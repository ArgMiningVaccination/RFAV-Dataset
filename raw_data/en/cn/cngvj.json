Policies and procedures document for healthcare personnel what they are supposed to do to prevent and control infections, and edu - cation and training are provided to show them how to do it. However, a core challenge for infection preventionists (IPs) is to inspire healthcare personnel to actually do what they know they should do. When we surmount this challenge, we are leaders who change the culture of the healthcare organization. Our need to lead seems like a no-brainer, but leading people is not at all simple. Before we can implement a change that significantly impacts culture, we must understand the nature of informal leadership, because most IPs are informal leaders in their facilities. Informal leaders in healthcare are most often experts with a high level of clinical competency who lack offi - cial \"carrots and sticks\" to incentivize implementation of best practices. Therefore, informal leaders must lead through other methods. IPs are uniquely positioned to advise healthcare personnel across the continuum of care about our shared vision and responsibility for patient safety. However, we lack formal authority to implement and ensure policy compliance. We certainly can't hire, fire, or determine compensation for everyone involved in infection prevention and control. Yet, as informal leaders, IPs are crucial to creating, prioritizing, and implementing patient safety goals. As we know from numerous studies, consistent compliance with infec - tion prevention and control policy promotes the safest environment for patients and personnel. Ensuring ongoing compliance is a daily battle\u2014and finding the best methods for buy-in can feel like aiming at a moving target. Fortunately, IPs are rising to the challenge to lead change by understanding different perspectives within the healthcare community and finding innovative solutions that work in real-world settings. This issue of the Prevention Strategist explores how IPs can use informal leadership pathways to effect change. A noted consultant helps us navigate conflict in organizations, and several IP leaders reflect on their own career develop - ment and advancement. We also learn how to respond to outbreaks, steps to set up a consultancy, and about the IP's role both in using antibiograms and in construction projects. Finally, this issue features inspiring profiles of the 2019 Heroes of Infection Prevention. These stories demonstrate that IPs have earned a seat at the leadership table. It has been an enormous honor to be your 2019 APIC president, rep - resenting this amazing organization. I continue to be inspired by you, the members, and am grateful for your dedication, your loyalty, and your support. I want to say thank you for the strong leadership and committed staff at APIC headquarters. I feel fortunate to have benefited from having an engaged, energetic board of directors to bring forward a new strategic plan and selection of a new AJIC editor. I also want to acknowledge my predecessors with whom I have served, Mary Lou Manning, Susan Dolan, Linda Greene, and Janet Haas, who have led the way for APIC's success. Finally, I want to offer my best wishes to my colleague and friend, the esteemed Connie Steed, your 2020 APIC president.

PUBLISHED DECEMBER 2019 API-Q0419 6776 COVER IMAGE: ISTOCK.COM/AAGGRAPHICSCEO'S MESSAGE BY KATRINA CRIST, MBA, CAE WINTER 2019 VOLUME 12, ISSUE 4Prevention 2019 was quite a year!I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT some of the newsworthy events that have taken place this year. We are delighted to welcome Dr. Patricia Stone, Centennial Professor of Health Policy and director of the Center for Health Policy, Columbia University, School of Nursing, as the next editor-in-chief of APIC's peer- reviewed scientific journal, the American Journal of Infection Control (AJIC). Dr. Stone's appointment begins in January following Dr. Elaine Larson's retirement at the end this year. In October, we were thrilled to welcome MedStar Georgetown University Hospital as the second recipient of APIC's Program of Distinction. Congratulations to this special team of infection preventionists (IPs) and their fearless leader, Mary McFadden, who led the way prior to her recent retirement. Also, in October, APIC held its inaugural Applied Learning Conference (https://apic.org/education-and-events/applied-learning-conference ) in St. Louis, Missouri. This new, highly interactive conference was host to 300 attendees interested in taking a deep dive into cleaning, disinfection, and sterilization; and microbiology and antibiotics for the IP. Preconference courses included a certification prep course and a workshop on hand hygiene, where even those who thought they couldn't possibly learn anything more about hand hygiene were pleasantly surprised, thanks to our excellent faculty. In November and December, APIC held its first truly virtual events, with a certification prep course and a conference ( https://virtual.apic.org/ apic/live/9/page/9 ) featuring some of the top 2019 annual conference ses - sions, respectively. We are pleased to be able to offer this new format that includes live presentations with interactive Q&A delivered directly to you via your computer. APIC is also pleased to bring you the new \"5 Second Rule\" podcast series that launched this year. The \"5 Second Rule\" podcast covers a range of infec - tion prevention and control topics that are relatable to the general public and healthcare community. You can find us at https://5secondruleshow.org or listen on Apple Podcasts, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you get podcasts. Early in the year, AJIC published two important APIC papers critical to you as a professional and to the profession. The first, published in April (vol. 47, issue 4), offers 28 future-oriented recommendations from the consensus conference held in the fall of 2018 to guide our future strategy. The sec - ond, published in June (vol. 47, issue 6), presents the revised Competency Model for the Infection Preventionist; it is complemented by an interactive model on the APIC website ( https://apic.org/professional-practice/infection- preventionist-ip-competency-model ). In January 2020, be on the lookout for news announcing the three strategic outcomes APIC will strive to achieve as part of a new strategic framework and the launch of MegaSurvey 2020. Your participation is highly encouraged. The value of collecting informa - tion on the IP workforce increases with the comparative data we will have as part this second fielding of the MegaSurvey. Thank you for another productive and successful year. Your commit - ment and dedication to protecting the patients you serve and to APIC, your professional association, continues to inspire me.

Many OR nurses agree that the current cleanup practice of using adhesive tape is time consuming, 3 and the reuse of tape rolls represents a cross-contamination risk.4-6 Recently published data demonstrated that BD surgical clippers fitted with the exclusive ClipVac vacuum-assisted hair-collection device eliminates these issues.3 In this study, the ClipVac device was compared with standard surgical clippers (SSC) and adhesive tape clean up.3 985169_BD.indd 1 11/4/19 9:31 AM12 | WINTER 2019 | Prevention Dear Colleagues, It has been a transformative year for the Certification Board of Infection Control and Epidemiology (CBIC). In 2019, we announced two new pathways\u2014 the CIC \u00ae recertification alternate pathway and an entry-level pathway\u2014and approved a study to help us better understand the correlation between the CIC \u00ae credential and patient indicators (e.g., healthcare-associated infection outcome data). With these new initiatives and others to look forward to, 2020 promises to be an exciting new chapter for CBIC. I am pleased to announce that our timeline for launching both pathways in early 2020 is on target, and that the aforementioned study will be conducted by Johns Hopkins University over the course of 2019 and into 2020. On behalf of the entire CBIC Board of Directors, I want to thank each and every one of you for your encouragement and support throughout CBIC's growth process. We have been working hard to ensure that CBIC continues to be future-oriented and meets the demands of the profession, all with the support of CBIC's partner organizations, the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC) and Infection Prevention and Control Canada (IPAC). I would also like to take a moment to discuss what's in store for the 2020 CBIC Board of Directors. With the 2019-2022 Strategic Plan and the future of these new initiatives in mind, we can look forward to the leadership of our incoming 2020 CBIC president, Linda Goss. I want to thank Joann Andrews, CBIC Board member and past president, as well as Vincent Hsu, CBIC Board member, as they will be rotating off the Board of Directors in 2020. They have been instrumental throughout the years in supporting CBIC's mission and vision. I am honored to have served with such fine individuals and will continue to cherish the relationship we've built. Thank you as well to the entire CBIC Board of Directors and all infection prevention and control professionals for supporting my tenure as CBIC president. Taking on this role has been a complete honor and pleasure. As a reminder to those CICs whose certification expires at the end of 2019, you have until 11:59 p.m. Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on December 31, 2019, to complete your internet- based recertification examination. Best of luck to all of you! I would like to conclude by sharing a quote by James Allen, which I hope will inspire all of you as you move through your careers: \"Think strongly, attempt fearlessly, and MSN, PHN, CIC, CBIC BY ROY BOUKIDJIAN, MSN, PHN, CIC, NE-BC \"On behalf of the entire CBIC Board of Directors, I want to thank each and every one of you for your encouragement and support throughout CBIC's growth process.\"W hat's in store for CBIC in 2020www.apic.org | 13 BRIEFS TO KEEP YOU IN-THE-KNOW BRIEFS TO KEEP YOU IN-THE-KNOW APIC recognizes MedStar Georgetown University Hospital as a new Program of Distinction designee MedStar Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, D.C., has earned the APIC Program of Distinction designation for excel - lence in infection prevention and control (IPC). MedStar Georgetown University Hospital is a not-for-profit, acute care teaching and research hospi - tal with 609 licensed beds, located in northwest Washington, D.C. Facilities awarded the APIC Program of Distinction designation are selected based on a rigorous evaluation process, including a comprehensive document review and onsite assessment by an APIC assessment team consisting of board-certified experts with at least 20 years of experience in IPC. The assessment team found MedStar Georgetown University Hospital to demonstrate a culture of open communication and interdepartmental collaboration that fosters patient safety. They noted the engagement and support found at all levels of the organization for their IPC program. \"Patient safety is our first priority,\" said Dr. Lisa Boyle, vice president of Medical Affairs at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, in a press release issued about the announcement. \"Receiving the APIC Program of Distinction designation truly validates our unwavering commitment to providing the highest quality, safe patient care. This designation also validates our work as a high-reliability organization in which every member of the patient care team is empowered to speak up for safety as we collaborate to provide care. Our culture of high reliability sets the stage for our staff to provide safe, evidence-based care\u2014all for the benefit of our patients.\" Founded by APIC, the Program of Distinction confers a des - ignation of excellence to acute care facilities for IPC programs that meet a set of high-level standards. The program aims to identify excellence in IPC and provides a new set of standards for the field. The APIC Program of Distinction Standards of Excellence in Infection Prevention and Control represent the highest standards for IPC programs, developed by a team of experts and APIC leaders. The Program of Distinction is a three-year designation. In addition to recognizing excellence, the APIC Program of Distinction recognizes the importance of quality improve - ment in infection prevention programs. As such, the assess - ment team identifies opportunities for improving policies and practices as they relate to the standards to help facilities maintain an increased level of patient safety readiness.

The MegaSurvey is the most complete workforce survey for everyone working in infection prevention and control (IPC) and helps APIC provide its members with the best data about compensa - tion, organizational structure, practice, and competency. APIC will use these data to create reports on the state and trends of the field and to conduct deep analyses to understand the implications of the data.The MedStar Georgetown University Hospital IPC team receives the Program of Distinction designation from APIC. Heads up: MegaSurvey launches in January 2020 The first APIC MegaSurvey was administered in 2015 and completed by more than 4,000 APIC members. The second MegaSurvey will help us understand the current state of the IPC field and provide longitudinal data to illuminate the trends that will shape its future. Please keep an eye out for the survey in the beginning of 2020. To show our appreciation, each respondent who completes a survey will receive a complimentary compensation report! COURTESY OF APIC. COURTESY OF LATOYA FORRESTER.14 | WINTER 2019 | Prevention BRIEFS TO KEEP YOU IN-THE-KNOW BRIEFS TO KEEP YOU IN-THE-KNOW Meet the 2019 Heroes of Infection Prevention APIC established the Heroes of Infection Prevention Award in 2006 to recognize infection preventionists who have developed and implemented innovative infection prevention programs. More than 100 individuals and groups have been recognized to date for their exceptional work in reducing healthcare-associated infections. The Heroes pro - gram is supported by a grant from BD, an APIC Strategic Partner. Visit the Heroes of Infection Prevention web page (www.apic.org/About-APIC/Awards/Heroes ) to read full profiles and inspirational stories from the heroes. Relationship building improves infection prevention statewide JoAnn Adkins, BSN, RN, CIC, FAPIC Terri Lee Roberts, BSN, RN, CIC, FAPIC Pennsylvania Patient Safety Authority Harrisburg, Pennsylvania JoAnn Adkins and Terri Lee Roberts are professional partners who serve as expert consultants and skilled educa - tors to more than 1,200 healthcare facilities in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The first infection preventionists (IPs) hired by Pennsylvania's Patient Safety Authority, Adkins and Roberts were charged with a monumental task: improve patient safety in Pennsylvania by initiating, developing, implement - ing, and monitoring new and existing infection prevention initiatives. The pair serve as expert resources to health - care facilities, conduct on-site visits to identify improvement opportunities, assist in the development of action plans, and provide education at the facility and statewide levels. To determine their priorities, Adkins and Roberts rely on data from statewide reporting, as well as Pennsylvania's Healthcare-Associated Infection Advisory Panel. \"The panel helps us understand issues from the field and identify educational needs,\" said Roberts. In 2015, Adkins and Roberts began hosting Long-Term Care Infection Prevention Symposia. \"Long-term care doesn't have the same resources as acute care hospitals,\" said Roberts. \"They leave the symposia with more confidence and with support from their peers.\" Along with providing education, the symposia encourage long-term care facilities to develop relationships with their local hospitals. \"We emphasize that they need to work together for the betterment of the community,\" said Adkins.The Patient Safety Authority's IPs also developed and led a long-term care antibiotic stewardship collab - orative, inviting facilities with high rates of urinary tract infections (UTIs). The 25 facilities that com - pleted the collaborative reduced new antibiotic ordering for UTIs by nearly 31 percent from base - line, vastly exceeding their goal of 10 percent. Adkins and Roberts say relation - ship building has been pivotal to their programs and success. \"We've worked hard to build our relationships with facilities and their relationships with each other,\" said Roberts.JoAnn Adkins Terri Lee Robertswww.apic.org | Middlebrooks, MSN, RN, CCRN, CIC Chad Neilsen, MPH, CIC Melissa Nelson, BSN, RN Marko Predic, MS, CIC University of Florida Health Jacksonville Jacksonville, Florida The infection prevention team at the University of Florida Health Jacksonville (UFHJ) spearheaded multiple orga - nizational improvements to change culture and enhance patient safety at their facility. As the only level 1, academic safety- net hospital in the region, UFHJ sees many of the most complex patients. \"There was a mindset that we couldn't do much about infections because our patients are so sick,\" said Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) Director Chad Neilsen.Organizational improvements change mindset to enhance patient safety In 2014, the facility's leadership included central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) and catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) reductions in the organization's strategic goals, signal - ing an increased emphasis on patient safety. An external consultant identified several key IPC challenges, including manual, retrospective infection-data reporting and placement of the IPC department under nursing. Shortly after, the facility shifted the depart - ment under the hospital's quality divi - sion and created a new IPC director position. \"Our new director provided perspective that enabled us to make key changes,\" said IPC team member Stefanie Buchanan. These changes included real-time electronic surveillance and leveraging other technologies\u2014such as a root cause analysis tool and an app-based program for hand hygiene surveys\u2014that improved feedback and helped drive timely interventions. The IPC team used data from these systems to determine infection priorities and create multidisciplinary commit - tees focused on individual healthcare- associated infections. Bedside rounding on all floors helped identify gaps, which staff shared with the committees. \"Information filters to the committees in a very fluid way, and they develop plans,\" said Buchanan. Finally, UFHJ instituted systems to increase shared accountability. \"We needed the units to understand that any single infection can signal opportunities for hospital-wide process improvement,\" said Buchanan. Between 2015 and 2018, UFHJ recorded a 74 percent reduction in CLABSI and an 86 percent reduction in CAUTI. \"Celebrate your wins along the way, and it will help maintain the motivation to change,\" said Buchanan.16 | WINTER 2019 | Prevention BRIEFS TO KEEP YOU IN-THE-KNOW BRIEFS TO KEEP YOU IN-THE-KNOW Teresa Daniels, MSN, RN, CIC, CPPS, T-CHEST Clark Regional Medical Center and Bourbon Community Hospital Winchester, Kentucky Teresa Daniels dramatically improved patient safety at her facility by creating a novel program that educates and engages environmental services (EVS) staff. When Daniels joined Clark Regional Medical Center as an infection preven - tionist in 2010, the facility was strug - gling to contain healthcare-associated Clostridioides difficile infection (HA-CDI) rates. Isolation and hand hygiene interventions had little impact. \"It dawned on me, 'What about EVS?,\" said Daniels. \"When I asked EVS staff about infection prevention practices, I often heard, 'I don't know, I'm just a housekeeper.' I had to make them part of the healthcare team. Without a clean Empowering EVS to eliminate HA-CDI Nkwan Jacob Gobte, BSN, MPH Hospital Cameroon Baptist Convention Health Services Kumbo Bui, Cameroon Working within the confines of extremely limited resources and technol - ogy, Nkwan Jacob Gobte created a pro - gram that dramatically reduced neonatal sepsis at his medical facility and now benefits hospitals in multiple, neighbor - ing countries. Prior to Gobte's 2002 appointment to the infection preventionist role at Banso Baptist Hospital (BBH) in Cameroon, the hospital experienced multiple, annual outbreaks of neonatal sepsis, an infec - tion closely associated with poor hand hygiene. Gobte had to start from scratch to tackle the problem. \"No one knew about infection prevention except me, and there were no data, so I started by conducting an assessment,\" he said. Resourcefulness and commitment defeat neonatal sepsisenvironment, infection prevention is not going to succeed.\" Daniels started by hosting a lunch- and-learn for EVS staff. \"I thought if I empowered them through education, they would understand their impact on patient safety so things could change,\" she said. Convinced she was on the right track, Daniels developed an educational pro - gram focusing on environmental surfaces contamination, multidrug-resistant organ - isms, high-touch cleaning, and terminal cleaning. \"We used CDC environmental surfaces cleaning guidelines and APIC guidelines,\" said Daniels. HA-CDI rates fell dramatically the following year. When Daniels initiated the program at a second hospital, their HA-CDI rate fell to zero. Based on these successes, Daniels col - laborated with her EVS team to create a three-level ladder program focused on continuing education, certification, and performance improvement. To expand awareness about the importance of EVS in patient safety, Daniels recommended statewide \"train-the-trainer\" training for EVS staff to the Kentucky Hospital Association and the Association for the Healthcare Environment. In 2018 Daniels hosted the first statewide train - ing in the U.S. for Certified Healthcare Environmental Services Technicians (T-CHEST). \"It has been so fulfilling to watch EVS staff embrace their patient safety role, and to see hospital leadership embrace their role as well,\" said Daniels. Gobte identified multiple causes for BBH's neonatal sepsis rates. Handwashing facilities were unavailable or inaccessible for non-physician staff. Infants shared supplies, including Vaseline, soap, and bath basins. Staff were using improperly diluted chlorine to disinfect surfaces and tubs. The resulting prevalence of neonatal sepsis at BBH was 86 percent. Gobte launched a multimodal inter - vention program that included removing shared bathing items and adding multiple handwashing stations for all staff. When handwashing levels were still insufficient, Gobte found a way to make alcohol-based hand rub available throughout BBH. \"Initially we relied on hand rub from U.S. doctors,\" he said. \"Then we figured out how to make it internally. Now we've scaled up and centralized hand rub manufacturing for multiple centers.\" Finally, Gobte conducted exten - sive training and education to create consistent behavioral change. By 2006, the neonatal sepsis rate at BBH had declined dramatically. In 2017, Gobte implemented the Global Handwashing framework, an interna - tional strategy to promote handwashing as key to health and development. His hand rub program has now been adopted in multiple countries. Despite the scale and impact of his work, Gobte sums up his success very simply: \"If you quit, you can't win,\" he said. \"If you have to win, you must be consistent and persistent.\"www.apic.org | 17 Kelly Romano, MPH, CIC Einstein Medical Center Montgomery East Norriton, Pennsylvania Kelly Romano created a culture of empowerment to lead sustained reductions in multiple healthcare-associated infec - tions (HAIs) at her Pennsylvania hospital. Romano joined Einstein Medical Center Montgomery (EMCM) as direc - tor of infection control and patient safety in 2007. \"Coming from a public health background, it took me a while to get oriented,\" she said. By drawing on her public health experience and actively seeking out resources, Romano was able to quickly begin tackling a daunting chal - lenge: simultaneously reducing multiple HAIs at her facility. \"Hospital leadership really wanted to see reductions across the board,\" said Romano. She created a team of five and Empowering and engaging employees to reduce multiple HAIs Jayme Townson, RN University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center Cleveland, Jayme Townson leveraged best prac - tices and back-to-basics education to cre - ate a culture shift that reduced central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) among particularly vulnerable patients. In 2017, Townson became the infection preventionist for the University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center's (UHCMC) Seidman Cancer Center, which includes an adult hematologic stem-cell transplant (HSCT) unit. While new to infection prevention and control, Townson had heightened urgency around patient safety because of her background as a pediatric hematology oncology nurse. \"My kids were always so vulnerable,\" she said. When Townson joined UHCMC, the HSCT unit was struggling to manage Tackling CLABSI by changing culture appointed individual members to tar - get specific HAIs, starting with central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI), catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI), surgical-site infections (SSI) and pressure injuries. The teams focused on bedside educa - tion, evidence-based practices, and direct observation, and met regularly to share observations. \"My job was to help these teams develop champions and get the resources they needed,\" said Romano. The team eventually grew to 40 cham - pions, who are essentially deputized IPs across the hospital. While Romano's teams were having a real impact, some staff remained reluctant to speak up about patient safety issues. \"We needed a push for everyone to feel comfortable,\" she said. The team began using Just Culture, a program designed to enhance staff confidence in reporting patient safety events. \"We've seen a real increase in patient safety and a decrease in harm,\" said Romano. CLABSI, SSI, and multidrug-resistant organism rates at EMCM have decreased significantly. The hospital's CAUTI rate is zero. Romano's management credits her diligent, passionate leadership for these reductions. Romano, for her part, points to comprehensive engagement. \"The change really comes when you have sup - port from the C-suite and staff at the bedside,\" she said. CLABSI rates. \"CLABSI is particularly challenging in transplant patients, and there was a mindset that 'our patients are so sick, we can't change this,'\" said Townson. \"We needed to shift the culture.\" Townson and colleagues started by spending a day at Johns Hopkins Medical Center, exploring best practices for central line care and CLABSI preven - tion. \"The Johns Hopkins team proved we could reduce infections in HSCT patients, and this helped us convince those who were skeptical,\" said Townson. Based on a literature review follow - ing the visit, the UHCMC team transi - tioned to using antimicrobial catheters. Next, they focused on central line care and maintenance. \"The Johns Hopkins team stressed that all the bells and whistles\u2014including the antimicrobial catheters\u2014aren't going to reduce infec - tions if the basics aren't getting done,\" said Townson.Townson and her colleague began weekly rounding on every patient with a central line to assess for bundle compli - ance and provide feedback and real-time education. This interaction helped estab - lish important relationships. \"Now the nurses see us coming and say, 'Can you help me?' or 'Tell me what you think,'\" said Townson. In one year, Townson and her team generated a 76 percent CLABSI reduc - tion. \"It's proof that persistence and edu - cation can create change that protects our patients,\" said Townson. 18 | WINTER 2019 | Prevention CONSULTANT CORNER What are the most important aspects of the Mega Rule that every infection preventionist (IP) should know? There are a couple of important things that every IP should know about the Reform of Requirements for Long-Term Care Facilities within the Conditions of Participation in the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)\u2014also known as the Mega Rule for skilled nursing facilities. First, the role of long-term care (LTC) in the healthcare con - tinuum has evolved as the resident population has changed, and CMS and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) priorities for infection prevention and control in the LTC set - ting have shifted as well. Now, there is much more focus on providing support for people recovering from surgery or who have significant medical needs, such as with ventilators and dialysis. This was unheard of 20 or 30 years ago. Second, many nursing homes aren't equipped to handle these changes. To help with this challenge, CMS has created the Facility Assessment Tool ( https://qioprogram.org/facility- assessment -tool). The tool guides skilled nursing facilities through a comprehensive interdisciplinary assessment of build - ings, equipment, staff, and their ability to support their resident populations. The resulting facility assessment is a critical docu - ment that forms the foundation of care, and it includes guidance for IPs about how the infection prevention and control program should operate to meet the needs of residents. What should be the top three priorities for IPs if they're worried about meeting Mega Rule requirements? The top three priorities should be: 1. Use information from the facility assessment and the infection prevention risk assessment to determine how much support is needed at the facility. A 100-resident nursing home in a Advice about the Mega Rule A CONVERSATION WITH DEB BURDSALL rural area will have very different needs than a 250-bed urban facility with patients who require ventilator support and onsite dialysis. 2. Ensure that the persons assigned to infection prevention have the appropriate time and resources to do the job they need to do. 3. Receive training from a credible source (e.g., APIC, CDC) and maintain a connection to the larger infection prevention community. What are the key elements for building a successful antibiotic stewardship program in LTC? The CDC has excellent resources for building an antibiotic stewardship program ( www.cdc.gov/longtermcare/prevention/ antibiotic-stewardship.html ). Also, Robin Jump, MD, PhD, and the Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine (AMDA) team developed a template that gives clear direction on antibiotic use proto - cols\u2014how to measure and monitor antibiotic use\u2014and how to implement an antibiotic stewardship program, including the key aspect of educating staff and residents. While teaching LTC training\u2014which is mandatory under the Mega Rule\u2014have you found any trends among the attendees? I have found that, at all levels, people don't understand the importance of the CMS facility assessment. They think that the infection prevention risk assessment is same as the facility assessment. It is not. The problem here is that the appropriate emphasis has not been placed on the facility assessment. It has been treated like a simple document to complete, and so many people don't realize what's riding on it. Facilities must first do the facility Deb Burdsall, PhD, RN-BC, CIC, FAPIC, has worked in long-term care since 1974, in roles including infection preventionist, quality assurance coordinator, and director of healthcare services. Deb is board-certified in infection prevention and control and certified in gerontological nursing by the American Nurses Credentialing Center. She earned her PhD in nursing from the University of Iowa College of Nursing with a cognate in public health. Her doctoral dissertation examined how healthcare personnel use gloves when caring for patients and tested the reliability of a new glove-use surveillance tool. She is currently an adjunct assistant professor at the University of Iowa and works with the Illinois Department of Public Health. www.apic.org | 19 assessment, and then the infection prevention risk assessment. Only at that point can they build the infection prevention and control program. It's not enough to have a plan. Facilities need to move away from the goal of having a plan in a notebook and instead work to establish a fully operational program. I have asked time and again how many IPs had input into their employer's facility assessment. Very few did. What are the most common questions you received from IPs or facilities about the Mega Rule? The following are things I have had to clarify for facilities regarding the Mega Rule: Infection prevention certificates are not board certifications. A certificate program typically provides training and education. Achieving board certification demonstrates competency. New LTC certifications are on the horizon and should be strongly recommended for IPs practicing in LTC settings. Practice- specific certifications may also serve as a steppingstone to eventually obtaining the CIC\u00ae credential. Infection prevention requires lifelong learning. Classes such as those offered by APIC or CDC are just the start. You need to continue to learn and maintain a knowledge base because everything is constantly evolving. Infection prevention is a specialty. Would you hire a brand-new graduate to be in charge of Minimum Data Set coor - dinating? No, because the facility would likely default. The same goes for infection prevention and control. You need to be educated and experienced in the specialty to do the job. If you are an IP in LTC, you are responsible for infection prevention in every facility program, including environmental services, food and nutrition, activities, social services, volun - teer programs, visiting groups, and more. But you don't have authority over all these programs. Sometimes, it might seem like you are stepping on people's toes, but that is the job. You have responsibility where you don't have authority. Infection prevention can't be an isolated silo. It needs to be part of an interdisciplinary process within the facility and an interfacility process within the healthcare system, collaborat - ing with hospice, emergency preparedness, medics, and so on. Infection prevention touches all of these areas. When an LTC facility is cited by regulatory or accreditation bodies, a common mistake is to quickly write a plan of cor - rection and immediately implement policies and procedures without going through the quality assurance and improvement (QAPI) process. This mistake sets facilities up for failure. Facilities and corporations have been given a gift of a QAPI requirement. Therefore, they must go through the right steps for improvement and do so with the appropriate resources and experts. This takes time and an interdisciplinary approach.What should LTC facilities keep in mind when developing policies and procedures related to influenza and pneumococcal vaccination of residents? A lot of the requirements for influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations are well established. Refer to the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for recommenda - tions for vaccination schedules ( www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/ recommendations .html). The Immunization Action Coalition has an excellent website ( immunize.org ) with excellent resources for LTCs. Facilities need to focus on staff as well as residents, making sure that there is an effective vaccination program that promotes all recommended vaccines, especially the influenza vaccination, for staff and volunteers. When we looked at gaps identified via the LTC-focused Infection Control Assessment and Response tool ( www.cdc.gov/ infectioncontrol/pdf/icar/ltcf.pdf ), proper vaccination storage and handling were common issues across the country. The biggest problem is that facilities are using dorm refrigerators to store drugs instead of using appropriate medication refrigerators with requisite temperature monitoring and control. Environmental services is everybody's job, and it's a huge part of the infection prevention and control program. I've noted huge gaps in appropriate procedures, supplies, materials, equipment, and disinfection; some people tend to choose the lowest-priced disinfectant products, which aren't necessarily effective against the organisms that are making people sick. Facilities must use cleaners/disinfectants that kill what is making people sick. Since the November 28, 2019, Mega Rule deadline has passed, what immediate actions should facilities take if they are concerned or want to verify that they have met all requirements? Or if they get cited on a CMS or state survey? There are lots of people and resources ready to help you. I've done this type of consulting and mentoring support via APIC Consulting Services for a long time. APIC consultants can assist. Local health departments' communicable disease divisions are also able to assist. Seek out the various resources that APIC and CDC provide. The most important thing is that you start with the basics: hand hygiene, environmental services, and outbreak control, which requires surveillance. There are many fancy things that can be done at an LTC facility, but without the basics, every - thing will fall apart. APIC Consulting Services is a full-service consulting firm offering expertise in infection prevention and control via board-certified consultants.

The Medicare Infection Control requirements for hospitals had not been substantively revised since they were elevated to a CoP a generation ago, in 1986. The proposal included the basic step of changing the name of the Infection Control Condition to \" Infection Prevention and Control and Antibiotic Stewardship Programs ,\" recognizing the importance of prevention and, for the first time, the role of antibiotic stewardship in infection prevention. The condition would require hospitals to have active, hospital-wide programs for the surveillance, preven - tion, and control of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) and other infectious diseases, and for the stewardship of anti - biotic use in adherence to nationally rec - ognized guidelines and in collaboration with the facility-wide quality assessment and performance improvement (QAPI) program. The requirements of the new condition included: Establishment in each facility of an Infection Prevention and Control Program (IPCP) under the direction of an infection preventionist (IP) who is qualified through education, training, experience, or certification in infection In advocacy efforts, persistence pays off: Infection control and antibiotic stewardship finally elevated in Medicare regulation BY RICH CAPPARELL, ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR, LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS; NANCY HAILPERN, DIRECTOR, REGULATORY AFFAIRS; AND LISA TOMLINSON, VICE PRESIDENT, GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS AND PRACTICE GUIDANCE prevention and control. The focus of the IPCP is to prevent transmission of infections: - between individuals, including patients, personnel, and visitors, - throughout the hospital setting, and - between the hospital and other healthcare institutions during care transitions. Establishment of an antibiotic steward - ship program (ASP) under the direction of an individual with education, train - ing, or experience in infectious diseases and/or antibiotic stewardship. The IPCP and ASP work in collabo - ration with the QAPI program to ensure training and education of all hospital personnel in infection preven - tion and control guidelines, policies, and procedures. A new administration arrives After the release of the proposed rule, the 2016 national election brought in a new administration with a stated pri - ority to reduce the substantial regula - tory burden on healthcare facilities. So, even though Medicare requirements for enhanced IPCPs were already being implemented in long-term care (LTC) facilities and home health agencies, and implementation of antibiotic stewardship was in process in LTC facilities, similar requirements for acute care and critical access hospitals were now on hold at ORHAN CAM/SHUTTERSTOCK.COMwww.apic.org | 21 CMS. While the proposed rule lingered, the three-year deadline to finalize the rule drew closer. But APIC was not about to let this chance to require infection prevention improvements in hospitals die without a fight. The opportunity to act presented itself in late 2018 when the Presidential Advisory Council on Combating Antibiotic- Resistant Bacteria (PACCARB) issued a request for information on new strate - gies to fight antibiotic resistance, which PACCARB would use to inform its development of an update to the National Action Plan on Combating Antibiotic- Resistant Bacteria. The National Action Plan is a multi-agency effort against anti - biotic resistance through many govern - ment programs. The objective for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) was to issue regulations requiring healthcare facilities to implement robust ASPs that align with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Core Elements of Antibiotic Stewardship. CMS started on this objective by including ASPs in proposed revisions to hospital CoPs, but then the effort stalled. APIC takes action APIC unleashed an advocacy campaign to finalize the proposed Medicare Hospital and Critical Access Hospital CoPs, includ - ing requiring ASPs. The following were key events in this campaign: APIC sent a joint letter with the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) to CMS Administrator Seema Verma urging CMS to finalize the pro - posed rule before it expired. APIC responded to the PACCARB request for information by emphasiz - ing CMS's unfulfilled commitment to include ASPs in hospital and critical access hospital CoPs. APIC President Karen Hoffmann made a presentation at the PACCARB meet - ing urging the council to encourage HHS Secretary Alex Azar to call on CMS to finalize the proposed revisions to the CoPs, noting that implementing ASPs in hospitals is an essential step in combating antibiotic resistance. Following Karen's presentation, the PACCARB chairman requested that APIC send a formal letter to PACCARB reiterating the request Karen made in person. SHEA joined with APIC on that request. As a result of the APIC/SHEA request, PACCARB unanimously approved an immediate action request to urge Secretary Azar to finalize the proposed rule. Karen gave an interview to the Government Accountability Office about the role of the CoPs and infection prevention on federal efforts to combat antibiotic resistance. APIC and SHEA once again joined forces to send a letter to Secretary Azar request - ing finalization of the proposed CoPs. APIC posted alerts, reminders, and vid - eos on social media to support finalizing the CoPs, resulting in letters to federal legislators from IPs calling for action on the CoPs. The first indication that we were mak - ing progress came just before the pro - posed rule was scheduled to expire in June 2019, with a notice from CMS that it had granted itself a one-year extension on the deadline. Then, on September 30, 2019, CMS published the final rule updating the infection control CoP for hospitals and critical access hospitals. CMS's concession to its goal of reduc - ing regulatory burden included combin - ing the CoP rule with a 2018 proposed rule, Regulatory Provisions to Promote Program Efficiency, Transparency, and Burden Reduction. The latter proposed rule amended the proposed CoP provi - sions by allowing unified and integrated IPCP, ASP, and QAPI programs for multi-hospital systems. This change enables systems to develop system-wide programs. However, it also holds the sys - tems accountable for ensuring that each hospital within the system (1) meets all the requirements of the regulation (including having a qualified IP); (2) complies with all state and local laws and regulations; and (3) takes into account the unique circumstances and any significant differences in patient populations and services offered by the hospital. The only provision of the final rule that APIC did not support was a revision to the 2017 Emergency Preparedness (EP) rule. The EP final rule required annual training and testing of each hospital's emergency plan. The new revision allows the training/test - ing every other year instead of every year. Once again, the determination of APIC members to keep patients safe from infec - tion resulted in changing rules and poli - cies to ensure the most effective infection prevention and control and antibiotic stewardship programs across the health - care continuum.

She'd like an update on the past year's trends. You start by printing the latest report, which is in the form of a table. It has dozens of rows and columns and several explanatory footnotes. When you set the font at a legible size, the table is several pages long. You immediately realize that this document is not what you should bring to your meeting with the vice president.FROM DATA TO DECISIONS A table is great for finding specific values, but it's ineffective for telling a story because it overloads our working memory\u2014there is a limit to how many different pieces of information we can keep in mind at once. Our goal in presenting data shouldn't be to cram in as many pieces of information as our audience could process at their best. We have to assume many of them will be tired or distracted, and all of them will be less familiar with our data than we are. Instead, let's look at a few ways that data can be graphed to communicate an underly - ing idea simply, effectively, and intuitively. We'll also discuss how to detect and avoid misleading impressions. DESIGNING THE RIGHT GRAPH Remember our discussion of quantita - tive versus categorical (nominal or ordinal) data? That method of classifying data is the first step in choosing the appropriate graph. One axis, which is typically the vertical (y) axis, will be quantitative. The horizontal (x) axis can be nominal, ordinal, or quantitative. Time, however labeled, is conventionally put on the x axis. Individual data points can be repre - sented with bars or points, or multiple points can be joined with a line. Which type of graph should you choose? Bar graphs In a bar graph, bars connect category labels along the x axis with their asso - ciated quantitative value, represented by bar height. Bar graphs are ideal for comparisons when the relationship of the categories is more important than the exact values.Visual presentation of data BY CHRISTINA BRONSON-LOWE, PHD, CCC-SLP, CLD, AND DANIEL BRONSON-LOWE, PHD, CIC, FAPIC TIMASHOV SERGIY/SHUTTERSTOCK.COMWelcome to article 15 in a series examining data concepts relevant to infection prevention and control. Our previous articles have been about data and analy - ses, but you don't get from data to a decision just by analyzing the data. The effects of an analysis can be made or broken by how well it's communicated to decision-makers. This article focuses on effective visual presentation of data. We used Microsoft Excel to create all graphs, but the principles we discuss aren't specific to any program. This is the last article in the series. We thank the editorial and graphic design staff of Prevention Strategist for their contributions and hope you've found the series useful . Not all bar graphs are equally valuable. Take a look Figure 1, which compares hand hygiene compliance in different facility units in March. If your initial \"Our goal in presenting data shouldn't be to cram in as many pieces of information as our audience could process at their best. We have to assume many of them will be tired or distracted, and all of them will be less familiar with our data than we are.\"24 | WINTER 2019 | Prevention PREVENTION IN ACTIONimpression was something like \"all values are near the maximum,\" look again. Hand hygiene compliance has an assumed goal of 100 percent, but the y scale in this figure has a maximum value of 45 percent. That is, the reported units actually all did pretty badly, but the viewer has to actively work against the impression the graph creates to get the proper take-away message. Compare Figure 1 to Figure 2. In the latter graph, properly scaling of the y axis to 100 percent helps communicate an accurate impression more intuitively. Many graph - ing programs automatically set the y scale to max out slightly above the highest value graphed. This default may be appropriate in some contexts; however, if your data have an explicit or assumed standard, adjust the y scale as necessary. You might even add a line labeled \"goal\" or \"standard\" (for example) to aid in accurate interpretation. Next, look briefly at Figure 3, which plots unit-based hand hygiene compliance in August. Wow, the differences between the units seem big! Did you spot the trick? The y scale is odd again, but this time it's the minimum that defies expectation. We generally assume that a bar graph has zero as its minimum value, making the length of the bar proportional to its value. So, once again, you have to actively work against your first impression to get the right mes - sage: The inter-unit differences aren't that big after all. If your graphing program autoscales the y axis around the maximum and minimum in your data, be alert for this issue. This choice can be appropriate to magnify small differences. However, any time the scale violates the assumptions that a casual, dis - tracted reader would have, the distinctive nature of the scale needs to be labeled very clearly in the graph itself\u2014not buried in the text. Scatterplots and line graphs If your data don't have an assumed mini - mum of zero, consider using points instead of bars. Because points aren't using the length of an icon to encode quantitative value, the viewer is less likely to assume that the y scale starts at zero. Of course, you'll still clearly label your y scale markers and note any breaks in the scale.You can also use points if both your axes are quantitative and x-axis values can recur in the data\u2014for example, if you are graphing the number of infections acquired by length of stay. This type of graph (a scatterplot) is commonly used to show correlation or the lack thereof. What about lines? They're used to con - nect a series of quantitative values, turning many data points into a single visual element. Since the implication of continuity and order is so strong, they're excellent for depicting time series data but inappropriate for most other uses.Color, shapes, weights, and styles How else can we communicate infor - mation simply, effectively and intuitively? Graphing programs automatically assign colors to points and lines, size and shape to points, and weight and style (solid versus dash or dot pattern) to lines, but all default choices can be changed. Consider: How will the graph appear if printed in black and white? Are there so many data series that read - ers will have to continually consult the legend? If so, should you make multiple Figure 2. Bar graph example 2.Figure 1. Bar graph example 1.www.apic.org | 25 graphs instead, or can you assign meaning to color, shape, or line weight/style to reduce readers' cognitive burden and emphasize your message? Might colorblind readers have difficulty tell - ing the colors apart? Will the cultural meaning of the color support or contradict your intended message? (For example, do you want to use red to signify danger/bad/stop and green for safe/good/go?) Bar fill patterns and nonsolid line styles should be used sparingly to minimize visual clutter. Black, white, and distinct shades of gray, while not exciting, are effective. Say you're evaluating an intervention to reduce rates of Clostridioides difficile infection. You track infection rates on two similar units, introducing the intervention on Unit B. You also track influ - enza rates, in case an overall change in rates of healthcare-associated infections coincides with the intervention. Our graphing program auto - matically produced Figure 4. Figure 5 shows the same data, with line weight, solidity, and color used to convey meaning and emphasize the data of interest. Labels, titles, legends and notes Next, consider your data's context. Provide clearly labeled axes and a graph title or explana - tory label. Your audience should understand what you are graphing and the units of measurement by looking at the graph, with - out having to hunt through the text. If you present multiple graphs whose x or y axes depict the same quantities and expect your readers to compare the graphs, use the same Figure 3. Bar graph example 3. Figure 4. Graph of four time series generated using default settings. Figure 5. Same data as Figure 4, with line weight, style, and color adjusted to underscore meaning and emphasize most important data. \"Say you're evaluating an intervention to reduce rates of Clostridioides difficile infection.

What visual techniques does the graph use? Are you convinced?QUESTION 2: You need to decide how to allocate resources by unit for hand hygiene interventions. What graph can you design that will make it most apparent which units have the lowest compliance? ANSWERSQ1: The biggest problem is the lack of a y axis. You can't know what the scale or units are, or whether the scale starts at zero. This graph could mean anything from \"save $20,000 by using our system\" to \"save $0.20.\" It also uses three other techniques to accentuate dif - ferences while downplaying their meaninglessness: (a) the green and red color choices suggest \"our system\" is good and the \"competitor\" is bad; (b) the left-to-right order makes the last and most visually salient comparison the one between \"our system\" and the strawman \"competitor\"; and (c) the redundant line, bracket, and text emphasize the difference between current costs and \"our system.\" Q2: Make a bar graph of hand hygiene compliance (y axis) by unit (x axis); check that the y axis scale runs from 0 percent to 100 percent. If you're working in a language read left to right, order the units by increasing hand hygiene compliance so that the units most in need of attention have the left-most spots.Figure 6.

Depending on your graph's purpose and complexity, you may need a legend, a benchmark or goal line, and/or annota - tions (e.g., \"intervention initiated\"). Don't overload the graph; keep the focus on the data. Finally, don't use three-dimensional effects. They add no information but do make it more difficult\u2014or impossible\u2014 to determine values and relationships.

Overall, 75 cases were identified in this facility between October 9 through November 3. The pathogen was found to be multidrug resistant to antimicrobial therapy. Additionally, this outbreak was part of a multistate cluster.Identify the pathogen! BY STEVEN SCHWEON, RN, MPH, MSN, CIC, FSHEA, FAPICFocus on long-term care and behavioral health outbreaks Hospital outbreaks are reported more often in the medical literature than occurrences in the long-term care (LTC) or behavioral health setting. By studying and learning from outbreaks in the LTC/behavioral health setting, infection preventionists (IPs) can glean additional knowledge and apply this information to hopefully prevent future infections and infection clusters in their facilities. This quarterly column will assist the IP by heightening awareness of appropriate interventions for preventing an outbreak.

Acinetobacter baumannii d. sonnei The pathogen in this outbreak sonnei. confirmed a shigellosis diagnosis when Shigella sonnei was recov - ered from the stool of a facility resident, staff member, or visitor. A probable case was defined as an individual in this population who had a diarrheal illness without a posi - tive culture. The infection rate was 15% among residents and 11% among staff members. Overall, 46 residents, 23 staff members, and 6 visitors became ill. Six patients were hospitalized; two patients with additional serious comorbidities died. INFECTION OVERVIEW Shigellosis is the diarrheal disease ated with Shigella, the environment.2 Kiyoshi Shiga, a Japanese microbiologist, first identified the bacteria in 1898. The most common species is Shigella sonnei,3 which is named after the Danish bacteriologist Carl Olaf Sonne. The incubation period for shigellosis one to two days, with symptoms consisting of diarrhea, fever, abdominal pain, and an urge to defecate. 4 Symptoms average five to seven days, but can last up to four or more weeks. Diarrhea may contain mucus, pus, and blood. Shigella is transmitted by the fecal-oral route, with humans being the only natural reservoir.5 Indirect spread is through con - taminated food or fomites, with flies serving as vectors.5 Shigella is somewhat resistant to stomach acid; ingesting from 10 to 100 organisms causes disease.5 Stool cultures are diagnostic, and antimicrobial sensitivity testing should be performed for severely ill patients.5 Shigella sonnei commonly causes mild disease.6 TREATMENT, PREVENTION, AND PRECAUTIONS Shigellosis may resolve spontaneously in adults during several days or weeks. Treatment is supportive, including replac - ing fluid loss. Antibiotics are not indicated for healthy adults with mild illness; however, children, older adults, debilitated patients, and adults with moderate or severe disease should be treated. 5 Antibiotic treatment may include cipro - floxacin or azithromycin, although clinical treatment failure due to resistance has been reported.7 Ceftriaxone may also be used. No Food and Drug Administration-approved vaccine is available. Hands contaminated by stool can be a source of transmission. Therefore, a key to prevention is hand hygiene with soap and water before eating or preparing food. Standard precautions are used when car - ing for infected persons. Contact precautions are used for diapered or incontinent persons for the duration of illness or to control insti - tutional outbreaks.8 Shigellosis is a nationally notifiable disease that should be reported to the health department.9 CONCLUSION The investigators in the Wisconsin case reviewed facility records and conducted interviews with the early cases, which included a staff member who prepared food while ill for several days at the start of the outbreak.1 This early staff case as well as several subsequent cases among visitors who dined at the facility supported a foodborne pathogen transmission hypothesis. Notably, there was no epidemiological link between this case and the multistate cluster.

Policies that are punitive or restrictive may encourage presenteeism. Shigellosis may be transmitted in many settings. Cases have been recently reported at a wedding, potluck birthday party, restaurants, a public swimming area, and a daycare center.12 There are multiple interventions to be taken when trying to bring an outbreak under control. The Kansas Department of Health and Environment has specific shigellosis guidelines.1330 | WINTER 2019 | Prevention PREVENTION IN ACTION AUT OMA TED TEE PROBE CLEANER DISINFECTOR 978614_CS.indd 1-2 10/28/19 10/28/19 5:46 PM32 | WINTER 2019 | Prevention PREVENTION IN ACTIONFood safety and infection control BY KERRY FLINT, PHD, MSN, RN, CIC Welcome to the fourth installment of the Accreditation Focus series. Over the course of 2019, we are presenting columns discussing recurring infection prevention and control (IPC) challenges during accreditation surveys. Each installment provides ideas, tips, and guidance on common IPC challenges and how to address them. The delivery of food and nutrition is a necessary component of care in healthcare facilities; enforcing effective food safety policies is critical to providing safe care and preventing foodborne infections. Food service in healthcare settings is especially challenging because many population groups, such as the very old, the very young, and immunocompromised patients, are at increased risk for foodborne ill - nesses. This article reviews key top - ics regarding food safety, drawing on the FDA Food Code 1 to guide compliance and survey readiness in areas providing food and nutrition services.ACCREDITATION FOCUS ISTOCK.COM/SOLSTOCKwww.apic.org | 33 INSPECTION AND SURVEY AUTHORITIES Hospital kitchens, just like restaurants, are subject to inspection by local and state authorities to ensure safe food handling practices are followed. Furthermore, all accreditation agencies, such as Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the Joint Commission, and Det Norske Veritas- Germanischer Lloyd (DNV GL), include inspection of food service areas in their sur - vey processes. Breaches in safe food handling and sani - tation are cited under the CMS Infection Control Conditions of Participation as well as accreditation agency standards. CMS findings for food service areas, as reported on Hospital Compare,2 frequently cite insuf - ficient cleanliness of the environment and equipment as deficiencies. THE ROLE OF THE INFECTION PREVENTIONIST There are specific accreditation require - ments for dietary services regarding issues such as staffing; however, the IPC depart - ment is responsible for monitoring whether the environment for storage, preparation, and delivery of food is sanitary.3 Specifically, the IPC program has oversight for prevent - ing transmission of foodborne pathogens to patients and preventing cross contamination of patient items, such as soiled trays, in food and nutrition areas.4 As infection preventionists (IPs), we must be familiar with potential infection risks related to food handling and sanitation and identify opportunities for intervention. The IP's experience with risk assessment pro - cesses supports the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) approach to iden - tify, evaluate, and control potential hazards at all stages of food service operations. 5 UNDERSTANDING AND MANAGING THE RISKS Major risk factors contributing to food - borne illness (in any setting) include the following:1 Improper holding temperatures Inadequate cooking Contaminated equipment Food from unsafe sources Poor personal hygieneFigure 1: Selected food preparation issues. Yes No General Cleanliness Ceilings and walls are clean. Exhaust vents and hoods are clean. Floors are intact and clean. Staff are wearing clean, appropriate attire, with their hair covered. Sinks are free of built-up grime. Work Surfaces and EquipmentWork surfaces can be easily cleaned. Surfaces are cleaned between preparation of raw and ready-to-eat foods.* Equipment is clean and in good repair. Equipment is cleaned and sanitized before reuse. Cooking Temperatures Foods reach the following internal temperatures: Poultry and stuffed foods: 165\u00b0F Ground meat and eggs: at least 155\u00b0F Fish and pork: 145\u00b0F for 15 seconds Fruits and vegetables: 135\u00b0F Hand Hygiene and Glove Use Staff wash hands with soap and water: Before working with food Before cleaning equipment, surfaces, or utensils After handling soiled equipment and utensils Any time that hands may become contaminated during food handling activities Staff use and dispose of gloves appropriately. In the healthcare setting, food safety issues must be monitored everywhere that food is prepared, stored, or consumed, including kitchens; cafeterias and tor lounges; and offices and meeting spaces. Preparation and storage areas for nutritional formulas and human milk are also environ - ments where foodborne pathogens may be a risk. Given the numerous areas where food and nutrition activities occur, the IP's respon - sibilities related to food safety may seem overwhelming. Dividing food service activi - ties into smaller chunks or process groups can help the IP drill down and focus on specific high-risk elements and locations within a facility. For example, four areas of food service are typically assessed during the survey process by direct observation of the environment or tracer methodology: Food preparation Food delivery Sanitation Storage The following sections will highlight some key elements that IPs should look for dur - ing environmental rounds and presurvey activities. FOOD PREPARATION Food preparation and cooking typically take place in the main kitchen. However, IPs must also monitor all other areas where food or nutritional items are prepared. When rounding in the kitchen, first be sure to perform hand hygiene and cover your hair (hairnets should be available). Then, look up, down, and all around at the overall cleanliness of the environment (see Figure 1). Cutting boards, microwaves, toasters, mixers, and other items should be clean and in good repair. Cutting boards should be cleaned and sanitized between use. Utensils *Ready-to-eat foods as defined by the FDA Food Code 2017.134 | WINTER 2019 | Prevention PREVENTION IN ACTIONand baking pans should be clean and free of rust. Observe hand hygiene practices by staff. Hand-washing sinks should be separate from those used for food preparation. Also monitor whether staff use gloves appropriately to avoid cross contamination of food and work areas. Use of gloves is cov - ered in several sections of the FDA Food Code.1 As a general rule, gloves should be used whenever handling food to avoid bare hands coming in contact with food items. Observe whether staff verify internal cooking temperatures of food to ensure food is safe for consumption. Talk to staff, and ask what actions are taken when temperatures are out of compliance. Preparation of enteral nutrition, infant for - mula, and human milk can also pose a risk for foodborne illness, and areas where these activities occur should be included in IPC rounding. Specific guidelines for the prepa - ration and storage of formula and human milk fall outside the FDA Food Code; however, general principles regarding hand hygiene, clean work surfaces and equipment, and time and temperature considerations are applicable to prevent cross contamination Figure 2: Selected food sanitation issues. Yes No Clean and soiled work areas are delineated. Staff wear appropriate personal protective equipment in the dishwashing areas. Staff monitor and document appropriate dishwasher temperatures and manual dishwashing processes. Staff monitor and document chemical sanitation, including: Use of appropriate chemical test kits Use of sanitizer solutions for wiping cloths used on work surfaces and tables Changing of sanitizer solutions as needed to sustain appropriate concentrations Equipment* is cleaned, sanitized, completely dried, and reassembled after each use. Dishes, equipment, and utensils are air-dried to avoid cross contamination that might occur with towel use. Dishes and cooking equipment are stored covered or inverted in a clean, dry location, protected from dust and splash contamination. Processes are in place and followed to clean and sanitize carts used to deliver food and trans- port soiled dishes. and pathogen growth. Additional resources regarding the safe preparation, administra - tion, and storage of enteral nutrition, infant formula, and human milk are available.6,7 FOOD DELIVERY Food delivery assesses how food and nutri - tional items move from the kitchen or other preparation area to the consumer (patient). This can be a high-risk area. Inadequate time and temperature controls can encourage pathogen growth or toxin formation. In healthcare settings, food is typically plated in the kitchen area and trans - ported to patient care areas. During plating, foods must be maintained at appropriate temperatures on steam or cold tables: Hot foods held at 135\u00b0F or above Cold foods held at 41\u00b0F or less Food should be covered during transporta - tion and delivery to patients and should be at the appropriate temperature when it arrives/ is served. Staff delivering trays or serving food must wash their hands after contact with potentially contaminated surfaces. In cafeterias and dining rooms, as well as other areas where food is served to patients, visitors, or staff, the goal is to protect foods from contamination. Methods of protection can include packaging, service lines, and food guards at salad bars. Again, maintain - ing foods at appropriate temperatures and duration is important, as is the provision of suitable serving utensils to prevent cross- contamination of food. SANITATION Sanitation addresses the cleaning of soiled food preparation items (pots and pans), dishware, and carts used for trans - porting food trays. Figure 2 lists sanitation- related items to inspect/monitor. FOOD STORAGE As noted previously, food and nutritional items are typically stored in many areas of the healthcare facility, not just in the kitchen. Regardless of location, storeroom areas should be clean and free of dust, insects, and rodents. During rounds, look for items on unclean surfaces and signs of potential water dam - age in ceilings, floors, and walls. Shelved items should be stored at least 6 inches above the floor. Check for damaged cans or other pack - aging, and review expiration dates on food items. Additional labeling may necessary when expiration dates are not printed on individual servings of product, such broth or pudding. For frozen or refrigerated foods, for - mulas, and human milk, assess that tem - peratures are monitored and documented according to facility policy. Ask about the history of failures and what actions are taken when temperatures are outside of the acceptable range.*e.g., food grinders, choppers, and mixers. LENSMEN/SHUTTERSTOCK.COMwww.apic.org | 35 Refrigerated foods should be: Covered Labeled per policy, including the prep - aration and/or expiration date and the contents Maintained at or below 41\u00b0F Discarded within seven days or per facility policy Frozen items should also be wrapped, dated, and stored at temperatures that keep frozen food solid. When rounding, inspect freezers for any evidence of thaw and check unit nutrition refrigerators for appropriate use and tempera - ture control. Review policies around storing patient food, formulas, and human milk. Consider an all-hazard risk assessment approach to identify potential risks for food - borne illness. Potential sources of risk may include the type of food/formula; where and how the food/formula was prepared; time and temperature controls; and the time between preparation and delivery/ administration. STAFF EDUCATION Education regarding the importance of safe food handling practices applies to all staff involved in preparing food, formulas, or supplements for patients. 8 Knowledge of safe food practices must extend beyond the kitchen. Clinical staff also need to under - stand safe practices for handling, preparing, storing, and reheating foods, formulas, and nutritional additives. The IP must ensure that staff under - stand the potential risks associated with food handling and routinely undertake prevention measures such as appropriate hand hygiene, equipment cleaning, and storing of food items. Additionally, staff involved in food handling need to know the potential for transmission of foodborne pathogens when ill, including the impor - tance of reporting signs and symptoms of concern and following guidance for return - ing to work.1,5,8 INTERVENTIONS TO ADDRESS RISK When conducting rounds, it is likely that you will identify actions that pose a food safety risk. Appropriate responses depend on the degree of associated risk from the behavior or event. Observations regarding poor compliance with hand hygiene or food hygiene practices during food preparation require immediate correction and real-time coaching. If the issue seems widespread or knowledge gaps are identified, additional actions such as education and competency validation may be appropriate. In situations where time and temperature controls for prepared foods are outside of defined parameters, those foods may need to be cooked longer, reheated, or discarded, depending on the propensity for foodborne illness. The FDA Food Code1 provides addi - tional guidance. In certain events, emergent closure or stopping of food service activities may be necessary to protect patients, staff, and visi - tors. Such events may include: A confirmed or suspected outbreak of a foodborne illness An immediate high-risk food service- related situation, such as those related equipment failures Events involving high-risk water and waste-water issues Whenever IPC concerns are identified, especially those that are persistent or of a serious nature, a root cause analysis should be performed. Such activities should be collaborative and inclusive to drill down and develop sustainable solutions. CONCLUSION This article highlights just a few of the issues pertaining to infection control in food service areas. Preventing the risk of food - borne illness within the facility and protect - ing patients, staff and visitors is within the purview of the IPC program and requires collaboration with staff working in food ser - vice areas as well as clinical personnel. IPs have an important role in ensuring safe food service practices and regulatory compliance. Using rounding tools such as those provided by CMS9 can increase both the IP's and staff's knowledge and accreditation readiness.

Even though the project involved demolishing a structure, removing soil, bringing in new soil, and integrating the new construction into existing the HVAC and electrical sys - tems, it took a conversation with leadership for Ash to gain a seat at the table at the start of the project. \"The critical importance of IP involvement in all phases of construction\u2014 including the initial planning phase\u2014had not been generally recognized by everyone involved,\" he said. At the \"Opening a New Hospital\" session, Christy Wisdom, MSN, RN, CIC, FAPIC, LSSBB, an IP at Arkansas Children's Hospital in Little Rock, shared a similar experience. She had to assert herself to be included in predesign meet - ings for a new facility. \"Predesign is where you want to do your risk assessment. You want to build relationships with the design team. You want to get yourself invited to the meetings. Find out what everybody is Attendees at the APIC 2019 Annual Conference in Philadelphia visit the interactive APIC and United Brotherhood of Carpenters hospital exhibit, which simulated an ICRA event. This event will also be held at APIC 2020 in Phoenix.www.apic.org | 37 doing and convince them it's important you're there.\" Wisdom emphasized the importance of taking the right approach to help the con - struction team understand the important role that an IP can play. \"Being aggressive, just saying 'I need to be here' doesn't work,\" she said. \"It puts up walls. Saying 'This is why I need to be here and how I can help' will go a lot further.\" A NEW LOCATION Arkansas Children's decision to build a new facility in the northwest part of the state was based on a wealth of relevant data. \"We were extremely lucky in that we had an idea of our patient population because we were the only pediatric facility in the state,\" Wisdom said. \"We had a clinic in that area. So, we knew what the needs were.\" The new Arkansas Children's Northwest in Springdale, which was announced in August 2015 and took about two and one- half years to design and build, has taken over care for several special populations heavily concentrated in that region of the state, such as patients with tuberculosis, congenital cardiac conditions, and cystic fibrosis. In addition, the new facility pro - vides basic chemotherapy and hematology infusion services; previously, patients faced a six-hour round trip to Arkansas Children's Hospital in Little Rock for these therapies. The new facility is more than 233,000 square feet in area, with 24 inpatient beds, 30 exam rooms, and five operating rooms. It also offers imaging, diagnostics, and occupational and physical therapy. A helipad is be used to transport critically ill patients to Little Rock if needed. Wisdom and colleagues joined the con - struction project in the spring of 2017 and began working on the infection control risk assessment (ICRA) plan during the design phase. \"We had a great market research group who did a lot of this work for us, and we were able to pull that for our risk assessment. This is where col - laboration comes in. You may not know these people, but they're always willing and able to help you.\" Also during the design phase, Wisdom started the hiring process for an IP because Wisdom would remain in Little Rock. Lydia Sietsema, MHS, BSN, RN, CIC, was hired as the new hospital's IP in June 2017; the facility opened in February 2018. Initiating a conversation with hospital leaders about making an early hire was an important first step, Wisdom said. \"You don't know how long hiring is going to take, and we knew we'd need to train.\"Getting an early start allowed the IPs to weigh in on important decisions, avoiding the need for costly retrofits later. \"We were there earlier than we had been in the past,\" Wisdom said. \"It's essential to be invited before the sinks are too shallow and the build is done.\" Still, throughout construction, the IPs had to keep a close eye on changes made to the design, and sometimes they had to push back. \"Stakeholders are making changes,\" Wisdom said. \"They'll forget things that you said, so you have to constantly check those plans and design. There were a few arguments I had where the architects and I went in and laid our hands down like in a poker game to see who had the best hand and best plan.\" Wisdom had to be flexible regarding some issues, like installation of the MRI and CT machines. \"These things have to be brought in during the build, and you build around them. Do they stay in a crate? It's one of the few times I would allow something to remain crated.\" Despite the involvement of the IPs, there were times of \"controlled chaos,\" such as when the clinics opened on the third floor\u2014which APIC RESOURCES ON CONSTRUCTION BOOK The Infection Prevention Manual for Construction and Renovation provides critical resources for the IP who is devel - oping a comprehensive infection control program during construction, includ - ing policies and procedures, models, examples, and educational materials for all patient populations.

COPYRIGHT ARKANSAS CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL.38 | WINTER 2019 | Prevention PREVENTION IN ACTIONdid not have direct access to the outside\u2014well before the rest of the facility. Also, some projects required additional tweaks to meet infection prevention stan - dards, Wisdom said. For example, an air - borne infection isolation room had gaps beneath the door, and the outlet for an auto - matic sink was easily accessible, allowing \"parents to unhook it so they could plug in their smartphones.\" Another issue involved the cleaning of three-dimensional logos from prominent sponsors. REMODELING In his presentation, Ash listed many of the patient safety risks associated with construc - tion that the IP must monitor: aerosolized dust from sheetrock, wood, fiberglass, or con - crete; airborne metal particles; fumes from construction Aspergillus , Fusarium , and Rhizopus ; and potential harmful microbes in water systems. When he landed his job as a construction services IP, he had limited understanding of construction. \"Most of us have never dealt with an air handling unit, data cabling, or plumbing. It's a brand new thing,\" he said. To fill in the gaps in his knowledge, he asked a lot of questions of contractors, turned to several APIC tools, consulted guidelines from the Facilities Guidelines Institute (FGI) and Association of periOperative Registered Nurses (AORN), and even searched Google on occasion. Like Wisdom, Ash noted the importance of building partnerships with stakehold - ers of all ranks. For example, the IP has to rely on the unit managers. \"You can't be on every single jobsite every day all the time. Rounding is hugely important, but you need to get to know your unit managers. If you have five projects occurring simultaneously, you want your unit managers to know if they see something that isn't right, they should get in contact with you.\" Knowing the occupants of the C-suite and other financial decision makers is equally important. \"Everything we ask people to do will probably cost more money,\" Ash said. \"It's a good idea to build relationships with the people who sign the check before our requests start adding to the bill.\" Ash also pointed to the value of good relationships with building maintenance, engineering, and environmental services IPs have plenty of tools at their disposal to improve patient care. But they may not know about certain tools that are invaluable during a construction project, said Leon Young, BS, MT, ASCP, improvement specialist in infection prevention and construction for the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) Corporate Services in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He presented during the session \"Construction and Infection Prevention: Using the Tools to Your Advantage\" at APIC's 2019 Annual Conference. Tools to measure air quality and moisture can \"help in your rounding with confidence to really solve problems,\" Young said. \"What is infection prevention based on?\" he asked. \"Evidence- based practice and data. These tools can provide data. If a patient becomes infected later and you're asked if the construction project was the cause, you have the data.\" PARTICLE COUNTER Young explained that a particle counter can be used inside and directly outside construction sites \"to determine if dust is escaping, or to make sure your negative air is appropriate.\" If the particle count is much higher within the construction site than the particle count outside of the site, that indicates that negative air is adequate. Young takes particle counts with a door slightly ajar to evaluate whether dust particles or mold spores are escaping when contractors enter or exit the jobsite. \"I have done this before with the door ajar, and I've gotten the same particle count as inside the construction site,\" he said. The particle counter also can be used to verify that HEPA air machines are working properly. \"Contractors don't test HEPA machines,\" Young noted. \"So a lot of times when I'm doing project rounding, especially in sensitive patient care areas, I will use the particle counter to make sure that the HEPA system is working efficiently.\" The process is fairly simple. First, you measure the number of particles being drawn into the HEPA machine. Then, you measure the number coming out of the exhaust. Finally, you calculate the percent reduction as follows: (Particle Count at Intake - Particle Count at Exhaust ) \u00d7 100 Particle Count at Intake \"When I see an 80, 85, or 90 percent reduction, there's some sort of issue,\" Young said. Perhaps the HEPA filter is damaged, or a flex duct is pulling away from the HEPA machine. DIFFERENTIAL MANOMETER Differential manometers measure the difference in pressure between two areas. \"We use them for confirmation of negative air on a construction site,\" Young said. \"It's a little more scientific than using a tissue.\" A tissue test is a low-tech way of testing negative or positive air pressure, simply by seeing whether a tissue placed near the bottom of a door is drawn into or out of the room. In contrast, the differential manometer provides more information, measuring the differences in pressure between building entrances and the outside or between suites and construction projects. \"Sometimes I'll ask myself, 'Is air flowing from the area of construction containment toward a patient care area or the other way?'\" MOISTURE METER The moisture meter comes in handy during a water leak or plumbing issue. \"Water has to go somewhere. Where does it go? To your drywall. It gets out, flows under the cove base, and up the walls. You can assist your maintenance team by letting them know what walls are wet and need to be removed.\" If the flood was from potable water, Young recommends trying to dry the site and testing it again in 48 hours. \"If you can get it dry within 48 hours, the wallboards won't grow mold.\" On the other hand, with floods involving gray or black water, contaminated walls must always be removed.THREE ESSENTIAL TOOLS TO USE DURING CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS BY SANDY SMITHwww.apic.org | 39 Surveillanc e Requirements Most hospitals are required to report healthcare-associated infections (HAIs ) data to the National Healthcare Safety Network. However, the reporting process can dedu ct 3-5 hours from the infection preventionist's day and re duce time focused on implementing infection prevention and contro l strategies for your organization. Surveillanc e Solutions Our CIC\u00ae-certified infection preventionists provide reliable, timely surveillance support so that your infection preventionists can spend more time on the facility floor. 1400 Crystal Drive, Suite 900 Arlington VA frontline work - ers such as plumbers, carpenters, painters, and those who maintain the HVAC system. \"They're the ones fixing the leaks, unclogging the toilets, replacing the sinks, changing out the broken beds. They are your eyes and ears and perform the important day-to-day work.\" When outside contractors come in, it's important to know what they're doing. If they're working in the ceiling or doing \"hot work,\" they could start a fire. \"If they're creating hot work, they're likely creating dust,\" Ash said. He noted that IPs can communicate with contractors and help them understand the contents of the ICRA. \"Explain who is responsible for enforcing the ICRA. It's not you, it's them. It will be the site supervisors or the foremen. You're responsible for rounding and being a resource for them.\" In all relationships, the IP helps others understand the ultimate focus\u2014patient safety\u2014and that the IP wants to minimize risks. \"Even the little things we do can have impact on the patient. The important thing is to let everybody know that infection prevention is required, it's important, and it's done to keep our patients safe. We're here to work with you.\" TIPS FOR SUCCESS Both Wisdom and Ash offered advice to other IPs involved in new builds or reno - vation projects. Some of their tips are as follows. Communicate. \"I keep saying this over and over: Communicate. Be present. Be respectful. Be nosy. Be assertive, compe - tent, helpful, and consistent,\" Wisdom said. \"In other words, be ourselves.\" Ash noted that, to effectively communicate with contractors, it's up to the IP to speak the language of construction. \"You can't be part of these meetings, shooting from the hip and winging it,\" Ash said. \"They have initials after their names too, and are the experts in their field. Learn who the play - ers are and how to speak their language so you can work together to minimize risks.\" He recommended APIC's The Infection Prevention Manual for Construction and Renovation, the APIC implementation guide Infection Preventionist's Guide to the OR, and resources from FGI and AORN. Emphasize safety. Ash suggested making sure contractors understand why the IP is there. \"Tell them, 'Patient safety is the most important thing that we do.' It's something that's hard for anyone to argue with. No one wants to speak against patient safety.\" Start early and establish a project timeline. Ideally, Wisdom noted, the IP is involved in predesign, design, hiring, training, mentor - ing, policy making, rounding, interactions with regulatory bodies (health department, the Joint Commission, the pharmacy board, lab certification), and everything else. Don't be afraid to ask for help. \"As we prepared for move-in, there was a sense of urgency and panic,\" Wisdom said. Learn about competing priorities. Other stakeholders will be focused on construction codes, rules, and regulations; budgets; the desires of end-users; and the aesthetics of the new building. Sandy Smith is a medical writer for Prevention Strategist.40 | WINTER 2019 | Prevention PREVENTION IN ACTION Supplemental salary, the ability to give back to the field, a new platform to raise your profile as a subject matter expert\u2014the benefits of infection prevention and control consulting are numerous. Before saying \"yes\" to your first consulting agreement, here are five important items to note. Leslie Kretzu, MA, MIPP, has been the Executive Director of APIC Consulting Services since 2012. She copresented \"Consulting 101: How to Get Started Now\" at the APIC Annual Conference in June 2019. This preconference lecture will be offered again at the APIC 2020 Annual Conference in Phoenix, Arizona, in June 2020. If you are in need of consulting services, would like to become a consultant with APIC Consulting Services, or want more information on our upcoming preconference lecture, contact Nicole Nesbitt at nnesbitt@apic.org .YOU NEED LIABILITY INSURANCE. APIC Consulting Services requires consultants to have a $1 million professional liability insur - ance policy as minimum coverage. Many large facilities and systems will require consultants to have this type of coverage in addition to other insurance policies specific to the scope of work (e.g., cyber liability coverage for remote work involving review of patient medical records). A professional liability insurance policy should run a few hundred dollars each year for nurses, and slightly more for consultants with MPHs who do not have a nursing license. CONFIDENTIALITY IS REQUIRED. Clients expect full confidentiality, which means you must protect every detail\u2014from the type of work to the scope of services to the name of the facility\u2014with the utmost confidentiality. If patient information is shared with the consultant, the consultant needs a HIPAA-compliant site upon which the information can be stored. Consultants also should maintain a strong document retention policy whereby sensitive information is destroyed following the completion of a project. DON'T WORK WITHOUT A CONTRACT. A verbal agreement is insufficient when you are consulting for a healthcare facility on infection prevention and control. You must have a formal agreement in place prior to the initiation of consulting work. Be aware of \"scope creep\"\u2014the extension of the scope of work into new areas once the contract has been signed\u2014especially if the work is being conducted for a flat fee. If necessary, develop a contract addendum to adequately capture additional responsibilities and be sure to designate a fee for the additional work. THE QUALITY OF A WRITTEN REPORT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOU MIGHT THINK. The final written report following a consulting project should be well written and error free. Assume that the audience is wider than the infection prevention and control staff. Ensure that all acronyms are spelled out on first use and that the report is written in third person. After the report is written, walk away and come back at a later time to thoroughly review the document before sending it to the client. Always send a PDF document. DON'T MINCE WORDS. The best-written reports include detailed action plans that are clear and concise. If it's critical that the facility take certain steps, be clear that the recommendation needs to be followed. Avoid telling the facility that they should \"consider\" a recommendation when you really mean that they must take the action you are prescribing to be in alignment with best practices. Clients appreciate clear language. Time frames for action plans are important . things to know before starting your consulting side business BY LESLIE KRETZU, MA, MIPP5 MARKET VECTOR/SHUTTERSTOCK.COM1 2 3 4 547th ANNUAL CONFERENCE Join us for the largest gathering of IPC professionals in the world. Register early to save! Register today at apic.org/apic2020 4:44 PM things to know before starting your consulting side business BY LESLIE KRETZU, MA, MIPP42 | WINTER 2019 | Prevention Leading WHAT WAS YOUR FIRST JOB (OR ROLE) IN IPC? Chaz Rhone: My first role in infection prevention was as an infection control practitioner (as the position was then called) at a medium-sized (400-bed) rural hospital. I had just earned a master of public health in epidemiology degree. The job posting said that an RN was required, but I applied anyway. The preceptor for my graduate capstone project, who was also an infection control practitioner, knew the infec - tion control coordinator at the facility and forwarded my resume to her. The medical director at the facility was especially inter - ested in my epidemiology background and thought it would be an asset to the team, so they decided to interview me despite the RN requirement. Timothy Bowers: My career started in the clinical micro - biology laboratory at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, so you could say that I was part of infection control long before I was an IP. My first official job in infection prevention was an infection control coordinator (now called an IP) at Penn Presbyterian Medical Center. There were two other coordinators and a manager in our department as well as a director (an infectious disease physician). Then I moved into leadership as corporate director of infec - tion prevention at Inspira Health Network. After years of development and growth, I became vice president of process improvement for Richmond University Medical Center in Staten Island, New York, before moving into my current role, director of infection prevention, closer to home at Christiana Care in Delaware. Sarah Smathers: I began my career in IPC as a clinical research coordinator working for the medical direc - tor of IPC at the University of Michigan. Our trial was investigating the impact of active surveillance for multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO), uni - versal gloving, and personal protective equipment in intensive care unit patients. I collaborated with the IPC department to share the results of our research cultures, which otherwise would have been unavailable in the medical record, so they could place patients on precautions or clear them when appropriate. The IPC department was incredibly welcoming and willing to share knowledge and expertise, which sparked my interest in the field. Carol Vance: My first role in infection prevention was in southern California right before an H1N1 outbreak. During this time, I was able to see how infection prevention played an intricate role in situations like this. I knew right away this was going to be an incredibly challenging career\u2014and I was hooked!FEATURE AS INFECTION PREVENTIONISTS (IPs) lead the fight against healthcare-associated infections, they are being called upon to further demonstrate their value to a healthcare system undergoing momentous change. To effectively navigate the rapidly changing healthcare landscape, IPs need to be nimble leaders with critical thinking skills. APIC's updated Competency Model provides competency domains to guide IPs toward professional development and serves as a roadmap for self-evaluation and growth. Seeking real-world insight on leadership development, Prevention Strategist sat down with four infection prevention and control (IPC) leaders: Chaz Rhone , MPH, CIC, FAPIC, Division Manager, HCA Healthcare-North Florida Division, Tallahassee; Timothy Bowers , MT(ASCP), MS, CIC, FAPIC, CPHQ, Director, Infection Prevention, Christiana Care Health Network, Newark, Delaware; Sarah Smathers , MPH, CIC, FAPIC, Senior Manager, Infection Prevention and Control, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and Carol Vance , RN, MSN, PHN, CIC, Multi-site Director, Infection Prevention, Advocate Children's Hospital, Park Ridge, Illinois. Read on to learn how they entered the field, some of the challenges and opportunities they leveraged that helped advance their careers, and their advice on ways to acquire the skills of influence, strategy, and change management necessary for leadership growth. THE WAY A dialogue with IPs about career growth and changePASUWAN/SHUTTERSTOCK.COM COMPILED BY ELIZABETH GARMAN AND ELIZABETH NISHIURAwww.apic.org | 43 WHAT TYPES OF PROJECTS HELPED YOU ADVANCE YOUR CAREER? Carol: In the infancy of my career in infection prevention, I tried to do as many different projects as I could. I knew the more diverse I was with my projects, the stronger my founda - tion in infection prevention would be. A very important aspect to my leadership growth was having a mentor. I consider myself very lucky to have found amazing mentors whom I still talk to. Sarah: When I first started in the department of infection prevention and control at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), I was the only one in the department with a back - ground in epidemiology, data management, data analysis, and statistics. I was able to bring this expertise to an incredibly knowledgeable clinical team to create the first database of modifiable risk factors from apparent cause analysis of central line-associated bloodstream infections. This work allowed me to collaborate with the IPs at CHOP and showcase my talents as an epidemiologist to enhance our data-driven approach to infection prevention. Another project that allowed me to grow as a leader was the implementation of a new hand hygiene program. This multi - disciplinary and multifaceted project involved setting new expectations across the organization for hand hygiene (WHO 5 Moments), training and onboarding staff for a new program, and creating processes for providing performance data back to units and leaders. I was a fairly new IP, so this project was truly a \"stretch\" assignment, and I'm incredibly grateful to my manager at the time who saw leadership potential and allowed me to practice and grow skills of influence, strategy, and change management with such an important project. Tim: I've always had great mentors who gave or allowed for education and special projects outside of my normal day-to-day work. Early on, my manager had me attend rounds in one of our intensive care units (ICUs), which really gave me perspective about how staff went about fulfilling their roles while operationalizing our recommendations. We were also able to focus on one area of infection prevention to become content experts. Once I entered leadership, more emphasis was placed on guiding my team and removing barriers for them as neces - sary. Those are different skills than nursing, bench science, or day-to-day infection prevention work, and they are key to an impactful and resilient infection prevention program. Lastly, and this project brought everything together that I'd learned, was incorporating High Reliability into our work and teaching it to an entire organization. High Reliability allowed us to dig deeper into the human factors that cause infection and truly mitigate or eliminate, as much as possible, the issues plaguing staff in their everyday work. Chaz: Most of my career advancement is centered around the work I have done on catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) prevention. My second role as an IP was working with the Florida Department of Health Healthcare-Associated Infection Prevention Program. There, I led a CAUTI preven - tion collaborative composed of two cohorts and over 20 acute care facilities. The collaborative shared prevention guidelines and best practices, facilitated enrollment into the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) in preparation for man - datory Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services reporting, and offered education via webinars and site visits to engage IPs, senior leadership, and bedside staff. By the end of the first cohort, 85 percent of facilities imple - mented a procedure for daily assessment of catheters, committed to annual training of all staff inserting catheters, and provided alternatives to indwelling urinary catheters. There was also a col - lective 4 percent decrease in device utilization. The project was presented as a poster presentation at the APIC national conference. This was my first leadership role and provided invaluable networking opportunities with IPs all over the state of Florida. As a result, I was asked to speak at several conferences through - out the state, not just on CAUTI prevention but also NHSN surveillance definitions. Additionally, after moving back into a role as an acute care IP, I later participated in the Project Protect: Infection Prevention Fellowship, a partnership between APIC and the Health Research & Educational Trust (HRET). The year- long fellowship focused on leadership development and expert mentorship, and centered around improving safety and reduc - ing CAUTI. My mentor was Linda Greene, a past president of APIC. Linda coached me through developing and executing a CAUTI reduc - tion project within a large teaching hospital that involved lever - aging the electronic medical record to implement an electronic reminder for indwelling urinary catheters. The intervention led to a 26 percent reduction in ICU surgical patient infection rates within six months of implementation. Because of the achieve - ments of the project, I won the Mentor's Choice Award among my fellowship peers, was invited to speak at several HRET events about CAUTI prevention, was chosen to speak as a panelist at the APIC Annual Conference, and was ultimately recognized as an APIC Hero in 2016. WHAT EDUCATION, TRAINING AND/OR EXPERIENCES HAS MADE THE GREATEST IMPACT ON YOUR CAREER? Tim: For technical expertise, especially early in my career, the APIC Annual Conference was by far and away the big - gest improvement driver for me\u2014so much knowledge, so many experts, such an immersive atmosphere! There is nothing else like it. Additionally, APIC's EPI 101, local SNJ-APIC chapter meet - ings, the American Journal of Infection Control (AJIC) , and a ADVANCING WITHIN INFECTION PREVENTION REQUIRES A COMBINATION OF TECHNICAL EXPERTISE AND EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE SKILLS .\" - Sarah Smathers, MPH, CIC, FAPIC\" I CONSIDER MYSELF VERY LUCKY TO HAVE FOUND AMAZING MENTORS WHOM I STILL TALK TO.\" \u2014 Carol Vance, MSN, RN, PHN, CIC \" 44 | WINTER 2019 | Prevention course taught by Diet Norske Veritas (DNV) on managing infection risk were very impactful. For leadership/soft skills, the use of an external leadership development group to assess where I was in my journey was a major driver. (I used ManagerReady by DDI.) It can be easier for external assessors to see you objectively and help you round out your skills. None of the above is possible or helpful without a leader (or several) to support your growth. That point cannot be over - stated. I cannot thank the leaders who helped me enough and will try to repay them by being that leader for others. Carol: The greatest impact for my learning was to have a mixture of education classes that were backed up by experi - ences. Conferences, webinars, and in-person education gave me a solid background that allowed me to work side by side with professionals in the areas of focus. Sarah: Since my background is in hospital and molecular epidemiology, I had a strong understanding of data, surveillance, and microbiology, but I lacked extensive clinical experience. To broaden my knowledge, I rounded with bedside nursing, the vascular access team, nursing leaders, the infectious diseases consult team, respiratory therapy, and sterile processing. These experiences helped me gain a better understanding of the clinical care of the patient and also provided an opportunity to build relationships and provide infection prevention educa - tion in the moment. It was also extremely helpful to attend Infectious Diseases Case Conferences to better understand disease processes, especially in our very medically fragile, immu - nocompromised, and clinically complex patients. Chaz: To continue growing my leadership skills, I took advan - tage of courses offered by my place of employment, such as DISC and Emotional Intelligence. Additionally, I participated in the APIC/SHEA Joint Leadership Development course. These opportunities were great in that they truly allowed me to take stock of myself and learn my leadership style, strengths, and opportunities. The courses also have helped me mentor others better and provided tools that I use to lead and facilitate teams through engagement and influence. As outlined in the APIC Competency Model and discussed by Dr. Sanjay Saint and Sarah Krein in their book, Preventing Hospital Infections: Real-World Problems, Realistic Solutions, leadership skills are necessary and vital to infection prevention. WHAT STRATEGIES OR ADVICE ABOUT CAREER ADVANCEMENT DO YOU SHARE WITH THE PEOPLE YOU SUPERVISE? Sarah: It is important to take risks, stretch outside your comfort zone, and be comfortable with being uncomfortable. The thing I love most about IPC is that you will never know everything, so you need to be comfortable with continuing to challenge yourself. Volunteer for assignments and projects that require you to learn something new or work with different dis - ciplines, as these opportunities allow you to build relationships and grow your influence. Also, don't be afraid to ask for the training and resources you need to be successful, whether your objective is performance improvement, leadership, or learning how to negotiate crucial conversations. Advancing within infection prevention requires a combination of technical expertise and emotional intelligence skills. Having the willingness and self-reflection to continuously hone and improve these skills is the key to true success. Carol: The two pieces of advice are communication and patience. It is imperative for IPs to know how to communicate to their audiences. Clear and concise communication can make the difference in your ability to influence. The other important component is to have patience with yourself. I often have to remind myself of this. Growth does not happen overnight (trust me, I wish it did). I have learned to try not to react initially; instead, I stop to observe, listen, and analyze the situation at hand before I take action. The most important part is what you learn from the situa - tion. Don't give up! Chaz: I always encourage those I work with or men - tor to intentionally pursue leadership skills and continu - ally assess themselves using the APIC self-assessment tools such as the Novice Roadmap and Proficient Practitioner Bridge. Additionally, I believe that all IPs need to become certified when appropriate to demonstrate proficiency in the core competencies. I am elated that APIC developed the Fellow of APIC (FAPIC) designation so that more advanced and proficient IPs have a goal to strive for. Tim: Don't confuse e-mail with communication. The latter assumes the message was received; the former means a message was sent. Start by asking questions. Allow whoever is in front of you to show you they are doing things correctly (despite what you think you saw/know). Everyone wants to do the right thing. We (the organization) place staff in situations where they have to make choices: As a leader, do what you can to make it easy to do the right thing (or, conversely, make it hard to do the wrong thing). Leadership doesn't come from one lecture, one book, or one conversation. It is the ongoing, relentless pursuit of how to make everyone else around you better. Just like infection prevention, no one knows everything about leadership. Editor's note: Prevention Strategist welcomes your contributions on leadership growth!

We should expect to encoun - ter it in our workplaces and let go of the mistaken belief that we can make it disappear from organizational life. In any situation involving two or more individuals, the likelihood of conflict is real. The challenge is to learn how to navigate conflict, knowing when some types of conflicts can be prevented, min - imized, or addressed quickly without exacerbating the situation. The aim of this article is to simplify an emotionally complex and, at times, overwhelming From prevention to healing topic\u2014conflict in organizations and what to do about it. WHAT IS CONFLICT? Sometimes, a single person can have an internal conflict, feeling or thinking more than one way about an issue. However, conflict is typically a difference that man - ifests between two or more parties, such as multiple departments within an orga - nization, two coworkers, or a manager and a direct report. The difference could be about the why, the how, the when, the where, the what, or the who. For example, suppose your facility needs a policy to specify the length of healthcare workers' nails and the types of materials that can cover nails. The infection prevention department believes the issue should be covered in the Attire policy, but human resources believes it should be covered in the Hand Hygiene policy. Note that although this conflict needs to be resolved, it is not inherently adversarial or counterproductive. Not all conflict is bad. It is when the con - flict becomes a source of stress, strain, bickering, pushing, and pulling that it has the potential to harm, hurt, distract, and disrupt. WHAT'S THE BUSINESS AND CLINICAL CASE FOR NAVIGATING CONFLICT? Conflict at work is costly, in more ways than one. An unpublished Canadian study from 2010 estimated that lead - ers and managers spend three hours of work time per week addressing conflict. Navigating in organizationsANA DE SOUSA/SHUTTERSTOCK.COMwww.apic.org | 47 Extrapolating from that estimate and the median annual salary for IPs2 sug- gests that the cost of addressing conflict at work is more than $5,000 per year for each IP in the role of leader/man - ager. Furthermore, time spent manag - ing conflict is time taken away from other responsibilities, such as patient safety, and it is generally more difficult to retain or motivate employees in a con - flict-ridden organization. Finally, there can be emotional, psychological, or even physical costs for individuals caught up in conflicts that become contentious. WHAT TYPES OF CONFLICT OCCUR AT WORK? There are four types of conflict that typically pop up at work: Intrapersonal Interpersonal Job/functional Organizational When conflict arises, an important first step is to assess what type of con - flict is occurring. Equipped with this information, you stand a better chance of addressing the conflict with greater ease and precision. Intrapersonal Conflict Picture yourself deciding whether you should give feedback to a coworker who could possibly benefit from your experi - ence. One part of you approaches the prospect of giving feedback, but another part avoids it. This is the classic approach- avoidance type of conflict. It occurs within yourself, not with others. Interpersonal conflict Imagine that your hospital has decided to implement a comprehensive unit-based safety project to reduce central line-asso - ciated bloodstream infection. Speaking for the IPs, you suggest that a staff-level nurse should lead the team, whereas the chief medical officer would rather see the director of emergency medicine in the role. Both of you agree about the rel - evance, importance, and necessity of the project, but you disagree about how to carry it out. Interpersonal conflict is more readily resolved when you can identify the issue rather than focusing on personalities and relationships.Job/functional conflict Visualize that your role as an IP has been substantially changed with the intro - duction of a new technology, such as an automated hand hygiene monitoring ser - vice. You are now confronted with having to adjust and adapt to this change in your role. You continue to have a good relation - ship with your supervisor and coworkers, and you feel good about the organization's implementation of the technology\u2014but you dislike some of the ways that your role has changed. This type of conflict is often referred to as poor job/person fit. Organizational conflict Envision that your organization has merged with or been acquired by another organization. This new organization is much more focused on cost reduction than your previous organization was. As such, budgets are tightening and expenditures must be justified with a lengthy, time-consuming process. You find yourself questioning the balance between high-quality patient care and cost reduction in this new organization, and you long for the \"good old days\" with your former organization. This type of conflict is often referred to as poor per - son/organization fit. HOW DO YOU SUCCESSFULLY NAVIGATE CONFLICT? After identifying the type of conflict you are experiencing (e.g., interpersonal or job/functional), you need to narrow down the issue at hand. The issue is the goal, expectation, policy, procedure, time - table, or other identifiable factor about which you and the other party differ. Once the issue is clearly identified and communicated with the other party and that party agrees to your characterization of the issue, you can decide whether the effort of addressing the conflict is worth it or not. If you decide that the effort is worth - while, the next step is to set a reason - able expectation about what you intend to achieve by addressing the conflict. You may not get all that you want or expect. Why ? Because conflict resolution is at least a two-party solution, and that means that you are not always in the driver's seat.Try to understand the perspective of the other party by listening closely and trying to respond rather than react. To accomplish this is to embrace empathetic listening. In general, if the other party feels as if you heard them and under - stood them (even if you disagree), then, at a minimum, you have signaled that you care. After listening to the other party's perspective, ask this question: \"Would it be okay if I shared my point of view?\" Most people will say \"Yes.\" At that point, it's best to pinpoint the facts from your perspective, express your feelings without indicating that the other party \"made you feel\" a certain way, and offer your thoughts about how to move forward with the identified issue. If you value the rela - tionship, make that known. After all parties have expressed their viewpoints, look for common ground. Once you have identified it, articulate what you share in common and then work together to determine the next steps to move forward. When detailing the next steps, remember that actions can be unilateral (only one party agrees to do something) or multilateral (multiple parties agree to do something). Do not expect that the conflict will be resolved magically in a minute, an hour, a day, or even a week. Be sure to moni - tor progress over time, recognize what's working, and work to improve what's not. KEY TAKEAWAY LESSONS Identify the type of conflict. Decide whether you want to address the conflict. Set reasonable expectations. Embrace empathetic listen - ing, and focus on the issue (not the people or feelings involved). Be patient\u2014never act when you're emotionally hijacked. Be diplomatic, especially if the parties in conflict are unequal in power. Seek common ground. PIGGU/SHUTTERSTOCK.COM48 | WINTER 2019 | Prevention If the conflict is long-standing and com - plex, you may have to go through several rounds of this process. Recognize that there will be occasions where the conflict cannot be resolved by just you and the other party. In such cases, what do you do? Consider escalat - ing the matter to another party, such as your manager, or to a formal process, such as mediation. Sometimes, you can cope with the fact that the conflict will not be resolved and work on immunizing yourself against any psychological, physi - cal, familial, or career harm. WHAT SHOULD YOU DO WHEN YOU'RE \"EMOTIONALLY HIJACKED\"? A small part of the brain, the amygdala, is headquarters for the \"fight or flight\" reaction. When you perceive a real or imagined threat, the amygdala responds while executive functioning in the brain's prefrontal cortex turns off. Suddenly, you are \"emotionally hijacked.\" When you are in this heighted psycho - physiological state, it is best not to address the conflict because somebody is likely to get offended, humiliated, or hurt. If you move forward in addressing the con - flict when you're emotionally hijacked, you may not mean what you say or do in the moment and later experience regret and remorse. Step away from the person and/or situation until you feel centered and grounded. This may take some time\u2014as much as a couple of hours, or even days for some folks. HOW CAN YOU NAVIGATE CONFLICTS INVOLVING POWER DIFFERENCES? Be careful. Real power differences in organizations\u2014whether based upon title, hierarchy, status, or who is in the \"in group\" versus the \"out group\"\u2014are key factors to consider in conflict resolution. When parties in conflict have unequal degrees of power, you must be delicately diplomatic to make sure that you are respectful of title, formal authority, and hierarchy while at the same time not allowing an abuse of power or bullying. If you are the individual in a higher power position, use your power responsibly and ethically, recognizing that you are not absolutely immune from sanctions. In some instances, we may perceive that the other party has relatively more or less power due to their interpersonal communication skills, negotiation savvy, and network of support. If you feel that you are in the less-empowered position, take care to avoid a defeatist attitude as you navigate the conflict. If you feel that you have the \"upper hand,\" remember that your advantages shouldn't be used to steamroll the other party. Conflict resolu - tion is most successful when it addresses the facts, and both parties should always remain within the boundaries of law, policy, procedure, and relevant customs. WHAT ARE PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ORGANIZATIONS, LEADERS, AND EMPLOYEES? Table 1 presents 15 techniques to not only put the lid on unhealthy, corrosive conflict at work but also address some of the root causes of burnout.3 Note that you have greater control over individual tactics than group/team or organizational strategies. However, if you are a leader or manager, you are responsible for improve - ments at all three levels; regardless of your level of direct control, keep in mind that effective leaders and managers influence both with and without authority. CONCLUSION As an IP, you understand well that contagions need to be contained. Recognizing that workplace conflicts can be contagious, challenge yourself to not infect others with out-of-control disputes that could harm you, your col - leagues, your organization, or even your patients. As an IP, you also understand well that knowledge is only effective when it is shared and applied. Please consider shar - ing tips from this article with others in your circle; by doing so, you may possibly inoculate others and prevent an epidemic of destructive conflicts.

Just hearing this word may spark feelings of dread for even the most experienced infection preventionists (IPs). When one occurs, the IP must put other work aside and focus on stopping further transmission. Fortunately, there are steps you can take to manage an outbreak situ - ation successfully. Step 1: BE PREPARED Outbreaks \"should be suspected when healthcare-associated infections, recovery of specific pathogens, or other adverse events occur above the background rate or when an unusual microbe or adverse event is recognized.\"1 All IPs in any type of facility need to be on alert because an outbreak can occur in any setting: In a long-term care facility, an outbreak could be a greater-than-normal rate of patients experiencing increased respira - tory secretions accompanied by fever. At an ambulatory facility, a surgeon might report increased incidence of surgical site infections. In a neonatal intensive care unit that averages 1 positive methicillin- resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) tests per month, 5 positive MRSA results this month may be an outbreak. In an emergency department (ED), one patient arriving with a virulent communicable disease could trigger a hospital-wide outbreak if the case is not appropriately handled.IPs can best prepare for the possibility of an outbreak by having an operational policy and procedure in place to address all contingencies. This protocol is the first document you and others will refer to when an outbreak occurs. By outlining the plan of action, it will not only provide direction to all team players involved but also help reduce everyone's anxiety dur - ing the crisis. If your facility doesn't have an up-to- date operational protocol, you can and should develop one. This document out - lines how to effectively classify patients during an outbreak and may be useful in other types of outbreak situations as well. to manage communicable disease exposure and outbreaks10 Steps BY JESSICA HAYASHI, CIC, CPHQ, FACHE, AND CHRISTINE YOUNG-RUCKRIEGEL, MSN, MPA, CIC Christine Young-Ruckriegel (seated) and her IPC colleagues at Morristown Medical Center. COURTESY OF CHRISTINE YOUNG-RUCKRIEGELwww.apic.org | 51 To create or update a protocol, start by reviewing guidance from your state department of health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Typically, state health depart - ment guidelines provide focused resources for regional issues. For example, the New Jersey Department of Health has an excel - lent guideline for dealing with respiratory outbreaks in long-term care.2 CDC also has an online self-study course3 that includes outbreak investiga - tion guidance at a more global level. In addition, the World Health Organization4 has an investigation resource. These resources and others are very useful for preparation. Take time to tailor the protocol to your facility, its staff, and the patient popula - tion. For example, while there is never a good time for an outbreak, they can occur at the most inconvenient moments. Many IPs have stories of getting the call to investigate a suspected outbreak at the start of a holiday weekend or on a Friday afternoon, just after the management team exited the building. What is your plan for these situations? Even if you think your protocol is in good shape, review it periodically to make sure it's current. The recent emergence of measles cases nationwide is a potent reminder that infectious risks can change suddenly, and our protocols must keep up. Step 2: VERIFY THE SUSPECTED OUTBREAK When you are confronted with signs of a possible outbreak, your first step is to quickly determine whether the facility does indeed have a significant exposure. Don't rely on hearsay! Evaluate and con - firm the facts. For example, if someone reports that 10 nurses had nausea, vomiting, and diar - rhea, call staffing to confirm the report, or contact the nursing unit or occupa - tional medical services and obtain more details, such as the dates of the nurses' absences and the symptoms they expe - rienced. Then, look for historical data that can be compared to this supposed \"outbreak.\" Is the reported number of cases above the threshold you normally observe or expect? This simple verifica - tion process can save time\u2014and your reputation. Step 3: REACH OUT TO LEADERSHIP, KEY PARTNERS, AND STAFF Let's say that you have verified an out - break is real or probable. Take a deep breath\u2014you can do this! Stay calm and repeat to yourself, \"I have the knowledge and resources to handle this.\" Get help as soon as possible. Start by making phone calls to alert leadership and key partners. Leadership may implement the incident command center if the out - break involves a virulent communicable disease. Your key partners will vary based on the clinical situation and regulatory guide - lines. You may need to alert your line of command, emergency management, occupational health, the department of health, and other experts or frontline per - sonnel. For example, if you're dealing with a measles case in the ED, you'll want to speak with the department manager or charge person. They can point you to key team members who will be able to identify all patients in the ED within a given time. Be sure to comply with state mandates for reporting an outbreak. Even if there are no applicable requirements, public health officials may provide valuable guidance and resources. Organizations should not be reluctant to seek their help. Depending on the type of outbreak and your organization, the public relations (PR) department may be a key partner. PR professionals may assist with creating scripts for the organization to ensure that staff relay a consistent and accurate mes - sage to patients and visitors. Such scripts can relieve everyone's stress about com - munication in these difficult situations. While you are reaching out to lead - ership and key partners, staff will also be asking your team for instructions on the next steps they should take. Those instructions should reflect what has been done already to contain the expo - sure or potential exposure. Therefore, as you speak with staff, inquire about their actions to this point and assess how those actions will affect your guidance about moving forward. Have a plan in place to frame all out - break-related conversations so that you can exchange information quickly and accurately, and get the assistance you require. The Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendations (SBAR) method is one effective approach.5 Published evidence6 shows that the SBAR is a recognized effective healthcare com - munication tool that can facilitate factual information exchange. Step 4: FORM A WORKING HYPOTHESIS You will need to develop a working hypothesis about the outbreak as soon as possible, although the timeline for accom - plishing this will vary depending on the type of outbreak (an SSI outbreak may have a different sense of urgency than a cluster of measles cases). This hypothesis will help establish a case definition and case finding method for other patients until lab work or other information can confirm diagnoses. A literature review is crucial to form a credible hypothesis. Select the relevant search terms for your review based on the symptoms or suspected/confirmed pathogen(s) in your outbreak, and look for applicable information on signs and symptoms, incubation periods, and com - municability. You may need to modify your hypothesis as patient data are col - lected; update your literature review as needed to fit the evolving situation. Step 5: ESTABLISH A PRELIMINARY CASE DEFINITION AND DEVELOP A METHODOLOGY FOR CASE FINDING As you form your working hypothesis, use it to establish a preliminary case defi - nition. This is a list of criteria that need to be met for an individual to be con - sidered a \"case,\" such as laboratory and Even if you think your protocol is in good shape, review it periodically to make sure it's current. 52 | WINTER 2019 | Prevention clinical findings; relevant patient demo - graphics (such as age group); geographic boundaries; and date range for infection transmission. 7 Accomplishing this step brings order to your outbreak process because it allows you to develop a methodology for case finding whether patients are implicated in an outbreak. For instance, if you have a potential outbreak of a gastrointestinal (GI) infection, you want to find out if the symptomatic patient has been taking laxatives. This may seem obvious, but when you are rushed, this basic inquiry may get overlooked. The case definitions and the methodol - ogy for case finding assist in determining the extent of the outbreak. You now have a way to evaluate the patients involved in the outbreak, and potentially any new cases, in a timely manner. Step 6: PREPARE AN INITIAL LINE LIST, PATIENT TRACE, AND EPIDEMIC CURVE A line list is a fundamental tool for out - break management.3,8 It is best to create it as a spreadsheet so you can sort your findings to determine average times of incubation or communicability and track dates of events. Headings on your list should include the elements you hypoth - esized for your case definition. Resources include department of health websites, many of which have examples of line lists for common outbreak types, such as GI and respiratory infection outbreaks (Figure 1).8 To be efficient, look for online line lists specific to your situation. If the list is available in a spreadsheet format, download that version so that you can easily adapt it. Use the line list to evaluate when an issue may have started, and to help revise your case definition as time moves forward. Additionally, you should render a patient trace to identify potentially exposed patients. These patients are not included in the line list unless they go on to meet the case definition. These patients will need to be assessed for pro - phylactic treatment and risk to other uninfected patients. For instance, if you have a hospital-onset positive influenza case, you will need to investigate what other patients and staff have been exposed, looking at roommates, room movement, staffing, and immuniza - tion status. The line list also aids in the establish - ment of a histogram showing the epi - demic curve, which helps identify mode of transmission. You can use spreadsheet functions to generate a separate tab for the curve that will give you information on transmission and mitigation. Your local department of health should be able to provide guidance about this; however, it may be quicker and timely to generate your own.9St e p 7: OBSERVE AND EVALUATE POTENTIALLY IMPLICATED PATIENT CARE ACTIVITIES Observing patient care activities is cru - cial to ensure that staff behaviors are not worsening the outbreak. For example: How is the room cleaning being handled? How are staff exiting/entering rooms and units? Are staff washing their hands prior to glove use? Is your low-level disinfection appropri - ate for the organism you have identified in the outbreak?Figure 1. Example of a line list for a respiratory infection outbreak. Reprinted from reference 8. Figure 2. Example of an epidemic curve.www.apic.org | 53 Is the surgeon following evidence-based guidelines? Have any hand-washing deficiencies been identified in food services? Detailed observations of the clinical area(s) in question should be documented. Step 8: DETERMINE WHETHER ENVIRONMENTAL SAMPLING IS APPROPRIATE The value of environmental sampling varies depending on the context of the outbreak. Environmental samples may not be warranted if lapses in general infec - tion prevention practices are suspected to be the cause of infection transmission. This decision is best made in consultation with lab professionals, an epidemiologist, and your leadership. Step 9: IMPLEMENT CONTROL MEASURES Your working hypothesis about what is occurring will inform decisions about infection control measures. For example, if you work in a long-term care facility where patients are experiencing increased respira - tory symptoms, you might halt communal dining for symptomatic patients. Remember, your goal is to stop ongoing transmission. This is the key to control - ling an outbreak. If a nursing unit has a suspected norovirus outbreak, the facil - ity might stop admissions to the unit, perform bleach cleaning, and advise face shields for staff performing patient care. Your line list will guide you in determin - ing whether your control measures are working or something newly identified is occurring. Step 10: REGROUP WHEN THE OUTBREAK IS OVER Outbreaks consume a lot of investiga - tive time and resources. When an out - break ends, you'll need to resume other infection prevention activities that were placed on hold so you could focus on the crisis. This is also a time to reflect: Was your protocol effective? What could have been done better? What can you do to be bet - ter prepared for the next time? Make an action plan to implement improvements. CONCLUSION Prevention of outbreaks should begin when you don't have one! Be sure that frontline healthcare providers are well educated about how to identify and iso - late potentially infectious cases quickly to reduce exposure to staff and visitors. When staff consistently incorporate infec - tion prevention practices in patient care, this contains transmission. IPs will all agree: If the patient has a fever and a rash, put on a mask. This small but important intervention will go a long way toward limiting any potential infectious outbreak situation.

Am J Infect Control, Vol. 46, Issue 7, 850.54 | WINTER 2019 | Prevention At UofL Health-UofL Hospital, an interdisciplinary team uses antibiograms and other tools to combat antimicrobial resistance. ccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), antibiotic-resistant bac - teria and fungi cause more than 2.8 million infections and 35,000 deaths in the United States each year.1 Also, patients infected by resistant organisms typically have longer hospital stays and higher expenditures compared to indi - viduals with nonresistant organisms. In response to the problem of antimicrobial resistance, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA),2 CDC, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), and others are setting expectations for antimicrobial stewardship and requiring action from healthcare providers. The UofL Health-UofL Hospital antimicrobial stewardship program will celebrate its 30th anniversary in 2020. In advance of this occasion, Prevention Strategist asked members of UofL Hospital's Antimicrobial Council for Education & Stewardship (ACES) inter - disciplinary team to explain how the pro - gram operates, describe its antibiograms, and share other insights. TELL US ABOUT YOUR ORGANIZATION. UofL Hospital is a 404-bed academic and research center located in the heart of Louisville, Kentucky. The campus con - sists of UofL Hospital, the James Graham Brown Cancer Center, and Health Care Outpatient Center/Ambulatory Surgery Center. Home to a level 1 trauma and com - prehensive stroke center, the facility also cares for bone marrow transplant, burn, neonate, and general medicine and sur - gery patients. UofL Hospital is the pri - mary teaching facility for the University of Louisville Schools of Medicine and Nursing and supports multidisciplinary layered learning with the united goal of optimizing patient care. WHAT DOES ANTIMICROBIAL STEWARDSHIP MEAN TO YOU? Antimicrobial stewardship is a broad term that represents the activity of man - aging antimicrobial use and resistance through policies, collaboration, and coordinated interventions. The goal of antimicrobial stewardship is to optimize appropriate antimicrobial use, impede the rate of resistance, decrease associated costs, and reduce harm. WHAT IS YOUR PROGRAM'S HISTORY ? \"We've been very fortunate for a long time,\" said Joyce Garr, microbiology supervisor. \"Switch therapy was basi cally the beginning of antimicrobial stewardship. We'd administer empiric antibiotics for 72 hours, and then the antimicrobials would be switched to more targeted treatment.\" UofL Hospital has a rich history of support for antimicrobial stewardship. In 1990, Dr. Julio Ramirez, chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases at the University of Louisville, and his team implemented an antimicrobial steward - ship program following the 1988 recom - mendations from IDSA. UofL Hospital was one of the first four facilities in the nation to implement this type of program. Its framework was shared with attend - ees in the mid-1990s at the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy and subsequently taught to numerous healthcare providers. 3 As antimicrobial stewardship has evolved, so has our program. Today, UofL Hospital has an engaged healthcare team that assists with stewardship activities, including pharmacists and physicians trained in infectious diseases, experts in the field of infection prevention, and a microbiology team. The Subcommittee of Antimicrobial Stewardship (SAS) is chaired by hospi - tal epidemiologist, Forest Arnold , DO, MSc, and is composed of physicians, pharmacists, microbiologists, nurses, and infection preventionists (IPs). This group reviews and approves policies, pro - cedures, and other related content. SAS's FEATURE 30 BY CRYSTAL HEISHMAN, MBA, MSN, RN, ONC, CIC, FAPIC, GARR, ASHLEY of antimicrobial stewardship Awww.apic.org | 55 peer-reviewed newsletter, Bugs & Drugs, features a monthly topic and is sent to all UofL Hospital providers. The Diagnostic Stewardship Committee, which is chaired by the director of microbiology, James W. Snyder, PhD, looks at diagnostic labora - tory testing and its effect on appropriate therapeutic regimens. The microbiology team at UofL Health includes Snyder, Supervisor Joyce Garr, 19 medical tech - nologists, and two clinical lab assistants. Activities of this committee have included Clostridioides difficile testing algorithms and developing guidance for appropriate urine and blood culturing. The Diagnostic Stewardship Committee, along with the clinical micro - biology team, collaborates with other members of the Antimicrobial Stewardship Committee and has spearheaded several initiatives to improve rapid diagnostic test - ing and reporting. One example is blood culture polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. Using PCR, organism identifica - tion and resistance markers are reported within three to four hours of detection. In comparison, reports using conventional culture and identification/susceptibility testing typically take 28 to 48 hours. ACES is a multidisciplinary team that is trained in infectious diseases. The ACES team consists of the infectious diseases prescribers and pharmacists, IPs, and microbiology experts. This team regularly reviews patients for appropriate antimicro - bial usage and makes recommendations for optimization. Additionally, council members have access to shared patient rosters within the electronic medical record for easier identification, evaluation, and reporting.Stacy Heckman, a member of the UofL Health-UofL Hospital interdisciplinary antimicrobial stewardship team. ALL PHOTOS COURTESY OF U ofL HOSPITAL.56 | WINTER 2019 | Prevention Other hospital-based interventions include the use of antimicrobial criteria- based policies, susceptibility rules to guide clinician prescribing, the use of rapid diagnostics for optimization of antimicrobials, and education and sur - veillance of resistance patterns. One key tool is the antibiogram. WHAT IS AN ANTIBIOGRAM, AND HOW IS IT USED AT YOUR FACILITY? \"An antibiogram is a helpful document used to identify susceptibilities and trends in order to optimize empirical antimi - crobial selection, reduce resistance, and improve patient outcomes,\" said Ashley L. Ross, UofL Hospital's infectious dis - eases pharmacist. \"An antibiogram can affect not only individual patient care decisions but also hospital formularies and healthcare protocols and guidelines.\" The antimicrobial stewardship team is responsible for the creation, evaluation, and dissemination of antibiograms. The goal is to help prescribers select the opti - mal antimicrobial agent to cover the most likely organism affecting the patient. UofL Hospital uses a locations-based antibiogram, a newly updated antifun - gigram, and a combination antibiogram, which provides a percent change of cov - erage depending on how one adds two antibiotics together to treat the infection before the organism or susceptibilities are identified. For example, a single agent may be susceptible only 80% of the time, but susceptibility increases to 93% when a second agent is added. HOW DO YOU DECIDE WHAT TO INCLUDE IN THE ANTIBIOGRAM? The microbiology laboratory uses aggregate data and applies guidelines from the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute ( https://clsi.org ) and the Food and Drug Administration. Generally, the pathogens selected have at least 30 isolates. The hospital formulary is impacted by the antibiogram. Antimicrobials on formu - lary may change to nonformulary (or vice versa) based on the information gathered. Creating the antibiogram can be a tedious process that requires consider - able teamwork and patience, but it is very important because it affects every team and every patient. WHAT IS THE IP'S ROLE IN ANTIMICROBIAL STEWARDSHIP? \"Like other members of the antimicro - bial stewardship team, those in infection prevention bring a unique type of exper - tise to the collaboration,\" said Crystal Heishman, an IP at UofL Hospital. \"Because IPs perform frequent monitor - ing and identification of resistant organ - isms, they are often the first to recognize trends or changing susceptibilities. That means they can relay timely information to the team.\" For example, the infection prevention department investigated a change in susceptibilities in Group A Streptococcus found in blood specimens. Although the organism had previously been suscep - tible to clindamycin and erythromycin, it began consistently showing resistance in early 2019 (Figure 1). While neither drug would be a first-choice treatment, the investigation meant that the antimi - crobial stewardship team received timely notification to monitor their efficacy. In November 2019, CDC released its antimi - crobial resistance threat report, elevating this issue to a concerning threat. 1 Another way that IPs help track/trend data is through the National Healthcare Safety Network Antimicrobial Use and Resistance module. The Antibiotic Use option provides a method to report and analyze antimicrobial usage as part of the overall antibiotic stewardship program. IPs also assist with facilitating com - munication about antimicrobial use and resistance. This communication might be within the organization, externally to other healthcare facilities, or to the state or local health departments. As voting members of the UofL Hospital SAS, IPs contribute to policy and procedures related to antimicro - bial utilization or clinical guidance. Furthermore, IPs support and promote antibiogram usage and encourage accep - tance of pharmacy recommendations. It is important that IPs understand how the antibiogram is read to educate others. HOW DO YOU EDUCATE STAFF AND ENCOURAGE USE OF THE ANTIBIOGRAM? UofL Hospital places a colorful, lami - nated antibiogram at prescriber worksta - tions. Education is provided individually as needed and in many sessions of grand rounds or conferences. \"Providing the antibiogram in an easily accessible electronic format is an important strategy to ensure ease of access and routine utilization,\" said Sarah Bishop, director for the UofL Hospital infection preven - tion program. \"Adding a link to prescriber desktops or within the electronic medi - cal record system are two good options to consider.\" UofL Hospital also disseminates a monthly Bugs & Drugs newsletter to all medical practitioners. Each issue discusses the pathophysiology behind a transmis - sible condition and the evidence-based treatment guidelines. Members of UofL Hospital's antimicrobial stewardship team, from left to right: Sarah Ashley Ross, and Leah Oppy.From left to right: Oppy, Bishop, LaShawn Scott, and Crystal Heishman.www.apic.org | 57 HOW DO YOU MEASURE USE AND SUCCESS OF YOUR ANTIBIOGRAM? Metrics used to measure the use and success of the antibiogram include days of therapy, defined daily dose, changing susceptibility patterns, and intravenous to oral conversions. Another metric is recommendations for optimization made by the ACES team and whether those recommendations were accepted by the prescribing team. WHAT IS LEADERSHIP'S ROLE IN THIS INITIATIVE? \"Any stewardship team that is not backed by hospital administration is doomed for failure,\" said Arnold. Fortunately, the executive leadership at UofL Hospital demonstrated their sup - port of antimicrobial stewardship initia - tives by endorsing a letter of commitment. They have also provided support through capital approvals and allocation of resources toward stewardship.\"Ensuring leadership is aware of how stewardship efforts support organiza - tional goals is crucial,\" stressed Bishop. For example, development and utilization of the antibiogram is an important piece of the antibiotic stewardship program. \"These initiatives can typically be tied into both quality and financial goals,\" she said . HAVE YOU ENCOUNTERED ANY UNEXPECTED CHALLENGES? Previously, extraction of data used to monitor changing susceptibilities tended to be manual and very tedious. To overcome this challenge has required ongoing col - laboration with information technology (IT). Another challenge has been dissemina - tion of information to as many people as possible. The UofL Hospital program has been investigating application builds so that everyone on the healthcare team has access to real-time updates on anti - microbial stewardship information, best practices, and the ability to hold the keys to antimicrobial success. WHAT ADVICE/INSIGHTS CAN YOU SHARE WITH OTHER FACILITIES? Plan appropriately up front and know what background work will be required. Will there be additional data to validate? Does your surveillance system have susceptibilities masked? Are your data valid? Ensure that the IT support is available and leverage your systems to make the easy thing the right thing. Remember: By choosing to do one thing, you are also choosing to not do something else, so make sure what you are doing is impactful. Build a team of dedicated individuals. Too many hands tend to complicate the process and even contribute to miscommunication. Education and awareness are key to success.
