ATSDR further recognizes that Viequenses are concerned about whether past military exercises2 on Vieques might have contributed to health conditions some on the island have reported. ATSDR wants to be responsive to those concerns. We have worked to ensure that this analysis of Viequense environmental data is thorough; that it considers a ll readily available investigations and research, especially research completed since release of our 2001 2003 public health assessments (PHA).3 1 exposure and health information relevant to Viequense public health issues, 2) to draw conclusions albeit often with some degree of uncertainty and 3) to make recommendations for environmental and public health agencies as well as for scientific researchers that will assist in reducing that uncertainty. The circumstances on Vieques typify many of the difficulties faced by the public and by public health officials when responding to concerns about the effects of hazardous substances. Although numerous the means are limited to answer such questions definitively. When reaching conclusions about hazardous waste and public health, some degree of uncertainty will always remain. Thus in this evaluation, ATSDR identifies the available data as well as the data gaps. soil, seafood, and locally grown foods. In addition , this report adds human biomonitoring and health outcome data. It begins with a review and update of !D 2003 Fish PHA data on consumption of fish caught off the Vieques coast . Next are two chapters on human biomonitoring data and health outcome data. These are the chapters whose subject matter was not included in previous ATSDR reports on Vieques. At the end of each chapter, we provide conclusions, recommendations, and references specific to that chapter. Four chapters are dedicated to examination of exposure pathways from food, air, soil, and water. Chapter 9 summarizes all the conclusions and recommendations from each chapter. The public health question in the chapters on food, air, soil, and water is whether residents were or are exposed to bombing-related contaminants and whether there were or are any public health consequences . The chapter on seafood consumption focused on mercury in seafood because Puerto 1 Throughout this document, the Spanish noun , and the . 2 including aerial bomb and naval gunfire practice on and in the vicinity of Vieques. 3 A public health assessment (PHA) is an ATSDR document that examines hazardous substances, health outcomes, and community concerns at a hazardous waste site to determine whether people could be harmed from coming into contact with those substances. The PHA also lists actions that need to be taken to protect public health. Page ix An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 Rican scientists and Viequenses raised that as a concern . Mercury in seafood is not from bombing- related activities . The public health question addressed in the biomonitoring and health outcome chapters is different. We could not use these data to assess whether bombing-related contaminants are present in Viequenses or are causing morbidity or mortality . The purpose of the biomonitoring chapter is to identify whether excessive exposure to metals is occurring in Vieques residents and whether there is a risk of harmful effects from metal body burdens . The purpose of the health outcome chapter is to assess the overall health status of the Viequenses population. Finally, the report includes four appendices. Appendix A summarizes the studies reviewed previously by ATSDR for this report. Appendix B contains summaries of !D -related environmental data, as well as summaries of two ATSDR-funded panel reviews: heart echocardiograms and elemental hair analysis . Appendix C contains the peer review comments received and ATSDR responses to those comments. Appendix D !D Background Isla de Vieques, or Vieques Island, is a 55-square mile tract of land 7 miles off the Commonwealth of east coast. Approximately 10,000 persons live in the central 7,000 acres or about 20% of the island, mostly in the towns of Isabel Segunda and Esperanza. In 1941, as the United States entered World War II, the U.S. Navy began to acquire Vieques property b y condemnation of private lands \u0011 1950 portions. With its wide beaches, shallow approaches, and warm water temperatures, as well as its distance from commercial air and shipping lanes, the Navy believed that Vieques was not only ideal for naval and Marine warfare training, it was one of the few locations in the Western Hemisphere that met ! F F !FF -called Inner Range on Vieques, comprising the Eastern Maneuver Area (EMA), and the Live Impact Area (LIA) (see Figure 1 -2). Marines conducted live-fire exercises in the EMA. Aerial explosive-ordnance and naval gunfire practice were limited to the 900-acre LIA, \u0012 Garc\u00eda,4 the principal Marine \u0012 E! For decades particularly after the mid-1970s ships and aircraft fired, launched, and dropped live bullets, artillery rounds, rockets, missiles, and bombs into the LIA. In the years following World War II, Vieques, contending that those activities deprived many residents of their livelihood (primarily fishing), exposed them to injury and, because of chemicals in the explosives, to long-term illness. Opposition increased after April 1999, when an F-18 pilot mistook an observation tower outside the LIA for a target. The exploding bomb killed the civilian observer inside the tower and prompted protestors Named for Puerto Rican native and Marine PFC Fernando Garc\u00eda, a Korean War Medal of Honor recipient. Page x 4 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 to occupy the LIA. All live-fire exercises ceased. After protracted negotiations between the federal government and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, in early 2003 then-President George W. Bush ordered cessation of all military activities on Vieques. Former Navy properties on the eastern and western ends of the island, now mostly under U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) jurisdiction, are national wildlife refuges. In August 2005, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) added sites in the former AFWTF Inner Range to the National Priorities List, making the area subject to federally supervised remediation, which continues today. Site investigations and environmental assessments began while the Navy still operated on Vieques. After departure, a thorough, in-depth evaluation of the current and long-term human health risks posed by exploded and unexploded ordnance was initiated.5 The Navy also looked at the risks military exercises generally might pose in Viequense air, water, biota, and in Viequenses themselves. The latest of these evaluations is !D environmental data that began in 2009. This report describes and discusses the results of our review. In addition, ATSDR examines some biomonitoring studies and health outcome data not available in our previous investigations. Previous Site Investigations and Assessments From 2001 to 2003, ATSDR released four Vieques-related PHAs. To investigate possible exposure to chemicals emanating from exploded and unexploded ordnance, each PHA assessed a specific exposure pathway: seafood (e.g., fish, shellfish, and land crabs), drinking water, air, and soil. After analyzing data and after extensive modeling, each PHA concluded that with one specific exception involving a single local well, contaminants in the evaluated pathways were not at levels expected to cause health effects. But these PHAs did not evaluate the risk of physical injury from unexploded ordnance or consider cumulative effects of exposure to multiple contaminants through multiple pathways. Unfortunately, current science does not adequately support a robust analysis of multiple chemical exposures and their interactions. Debate continues in the scientific community about how best to evaluate exposure to a chemical mixture both from a single pathway and from multiple, combined pathways. In addition, estimating combined doses from multiple pathways on Vieques is hampered by a lack of knowledge of the levels of chemicals residents are exposed to through various pathways (e.g., eating seafood, ingesting soil, drinking water, and breathing air). Viequenses and other Puerto Ricans together with some scientists, elected officials, and citizen groups !D -long island presence left Scientists in Puerto Rico, for example, produced h !D (see Chapters 3 and 4) . For this current site review, ATSDR not only revisited available data used in the previous ATSDR reports and revisited Vieques itself but also identified new environmental, gunfire projectiles, aerial bombs, and projectiles from other weapons fired, launched, or dropped primarily into the Vieques Live Impact Area (LIA). Page xi 5 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 biomonitoring, and health outcome data.6 In November of 2009, ATSDR hosted a meeting in Atlanta in which interested scientists discussed available scientific data concerning Vieques. The scientists suggested how ATSDR could look at the data in additional ways. For example, the group suggested that ATSDR reconsider exposure scenarios for fish consumption. They also expressed concern about the lack of information about potential exposure to contaminants through consumption of locally grown produce. Discussions such as these resulted in some new analyses for this report. A summary of the November 2009 meeting is available at http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/sites/vieques/notes_vsc_toc.html . This Report's Conclusions and Recommendations As part of this evaluation, ATSDR reviewed many of its previous conclusions and recommendations and identified some new findings. Again, Chapter 9 contains all of recommendations according to the topics described in each chapter. Certain conclusions and recommendations are highlighted in this Executive Summary. Conclusions and Recommendations from Environmental Data Consumption of Fish from Reefs off the Vieques Coast ATSDR has identified mercury exposure from frequent consumption of marine seafood as a potential public health hazard. Mercury is present in most seafood; it is particularly high in some fish species and low in other species. Due to mercury, children born to women who eat fish daily from waters surrounding Vieques are at increased risk of language, attention, and memory deficits, and to a lesser extent visual/spatial and motor function deficits . Children who frequently eat fish from waters surrounding Vieques are also at risk of similar harmful effects. That said, we could find no relationship between mercury in fish and military operations on Vieques. A more plausible explanation for the mercury levels found in fish is that they resulted from the global reservoir of mercury circulating through the environment. Due to the many nutritional benefits, women and young children in particular should include in their diets fish or shellfish that are low in mercury. Fish and shellfish are a part of a healthy diet . They contain high-quality protein, omega-3 fatty acids, other essential nutrients, and are low in saturated fat. A well-balanced diet that includes a variety of fish and shellfish can contribute to heart health and children's proper growth and development. Statistical analysis showed that some fish and shellfish from certain reefs surrounding Vieques had higher levels of some metals and lower levels of other metals iron, aluminum, copper, zinc, arsenic, barium, potassium and selenium were all slightly higher compared with other reefs surrounding Vieques. These metals are materials found in bombs and in metal ships, suggesting possible localized contamination. But the levels were only slightly higher and the difference was statistically significant only for some reefs compared with other reefs In this regard, note that the Navy is still involved in remedial activities on Vieques and these activities should be conducted in a way that ensures public health is protected from contaminant exposure. Page xii 6 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 surrounding Vieques. ATSDR recommends the following for consideration by environmental and public health agencies and scientists: o People who frequently consume marine seafood should follow available fish advisories and fishing restrictions in Vieques. Maintain the fishing restrictions in the waters adjacent to the LIA. o Conduct a survey of Vieques residents to determine the types, frequency, and quantity of fish consumed. o Conduct additional risk assessments and statistical analyses using new information gathered from the previously recommended fish consumption survey. o Should the proposed survey and statistical analysis not provide sufficient public health information, collect and analyze additional fish samples from Vieques. o Collect sufficient fish samples to allow analysis by species and by location. Biomonitoring The data from biomonitoring studies in Vieques showed elevated levels of some metals in resident blood, urine, hair, or feces. While cigarette use, seafood consumption, or hair dyes might explain some elevated levels in the se studies , the Puerto Rico Department of Health (PRDOH) manuscript reported they do not explain all. Because the source of these metals could not be identified, the biomonitoring results do not permit any conclusions about whether these elevated levels resulted from exposure to military exercise-related contaminants. Viequenses may be exposed to mercury in fish and cadmium in pigeon peas . These exposures may warrant additional environmental investigations, such as sampling locally grown produce for cadmium and gathering more information about fish consumption and possibly mercury in fish. The information could be used to decide whether to undertake human testing for mercury and cadmium in blood or urine. If other environmental exposures are identified, additional human biomonitoring investigations may be considered. More detailed information about !D found in Chapter 2, Section 2.3.2 and Chapter 5, Section 5.3.2, respectively. ATSDR is not recommending a comprehensive, systematic biomonitoring effort at this time. W e found little evidence of current exposure to contaminants from past military activities. Many chemicals are short-lived in the human body and thus cannot be measured through a biomonitoring program if the exposure occurred some time ago. Public health officials could consider a targeted human biomonitoring investigation following the release of this report, for example, by testing for excessive mercury exposure from eating fish . If a biomonitoring investigation is conducted, it should include a comparison group from mainland Puerto Rico. If requested, CDC/ATSDR subject matter experts will provide technical assistance and support to public health officials or scientists in planning and conducting such an investigation. Page xiii An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 Viequenses who remain concerned about exposure to mercury , cadmium, other metals, or metalloids should consult their healthcare provider to discuss the need for and cost of testing. A qualified laboratory should do the testing and analysis. CDC/ATSDR can provide a list of qualified laboratories that can perform the tests . And if requested, CDC/ATSDR can provide information to healthcare providers about tests for metals in biologic samples. Health Outcome Data ATSDR Recommends Elevated morbidity and mortality in Vieques, coupled with problems Developing an educational program about mercury in fish accessing health care, paint a complex that incorporates local habits and health picture for Viequenses .

Limited sampling data suggest cadmium toxicity may be a concern for excessive consumption of pigeon peas, but not for typical consumption rates of pigeon peas . A preliminary data evaluation completed for this report has concluded that the level of cadmium reported in a few samples of locally grown pigeon peas would not contribute excess dietary cadmium to preschool children who eat less than five of the largest (6 ounces) servings per week of locally grown pigeon peas. Adults who eat the largest serving sizes (12 ounces) should limit intake to 11 servings per week. Typical serving sizes for preschool children (1.5 ounces) do not contribute excess cadmium below 20 meals per week and adults who eat a typical serving (3 Page xiv An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 ounces) may eat up to 44 meals per week without exceeding recommended cadmium intake levels. The significant uncertainty in the evaluation of cadmium in pigeon peas stresses the need for further sampling. Preliminary evaluation suggests a potential for uptake of metals from soil into food crops. The se results warrant further investigation. Air We reviewed the data on airborne contaminants from military exercises at the former Vieques Naval Training Facility . This review confirmed our previous findings and indicated that airborne contaminants from past military operations were very unlikely to have had health effects on Viequenses. Soil Sufficient data are available to conclude that people who lived on the LIA during the 1999 2000 protests were not exposed to soil contaminants at levels high enough to cause adverse health effects. Recent data, and the presence of unexploded ordnance at the LIA, support the need for continued, restrict ed access to the LIA and to other potentially contaminated former military exercise areas . Environmental assessment and remediation activities should continue. fully. To address remaining uncertainties about residential soil contamination issues, ATSDR recommends surface- . Drinking Water With the possible exception of one private well found to contain harmful nitrate-nitrite levels, all drinking water supplies in Vieques are acceptable for their current uses. ATSDR recommends no one drink from the one private well until further testing confirms its water is safe . Ongoing monitoring of the current pipeline-source water is required to ensure the supply meets drinking water standards. Repeating previous sampling of storage tanks, residential taps , and wells still in use would address any remaining uncertainty. Peer Review and Public Comment Scientists from the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and from the United States peer-reviewed the Vieques Summary Report before we releas ed a public comment draft. Appendix C of this report contains !D comment draft for a 90-day period between December 8, 2011 and March 11, 2012. ATSDR reviewed all public comments and has revised the text of this report as appropriate . We have prepared responses to each public comment received .

Puerto Rico and Vieques Island Former NASD Residential AreaAn Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 1.1 Island Overview \u0012 largest offshore island (see Figure 1-1). Twenty miles long and 4.5 miles wide at its widest point, Vieques comprises some 33,000 acres, or 51 square miles. Puerto Rico, the easternmost island in the Greater Antilles chain, is approximately 7 miles west of Vieques. The U.S. Virgin Islands, including St. Thomas, St. John, and St. Croix, are 20 miles or more northeast and southeast . Drinking water for the island is supplied by pipeline from the main island of Puerto Rico Vieques groundwater is not used for drinking purposes. Figure 1- 3 contains a topographic map showing groundwater flow on the island. 1.2 Vieques and the U.S. Navy From 1941 until 2003, the U.S. Navy owned much of Vieques; residents were largely confined to areas (see Figure 1- 2). On the is Atlantic Fleet Weapons Training Facility (AFWTF) administered the Eastern Maneuver Area (EMA) and, ! ! two 90-day periods each year. Operating from Camp Garc\u00eda E! rehearsed amphibious assaults on Vieques beaches, maneuvered inland with armored and other vehicles, and generally worked with naval task forces to ensure combat-readiness before embarking on major deployments.

Vieques land use areas Over and off the Vieques east coast, the Navy used the LIA for naval gunfire training . Arrows in Figure 1\u00ad 3 below show directions of surface water, stream, and shallow groundwater for air- to-ground, explosive-ordnance exercises (CH2MHILL and Baker 1999). After the Culebra Island range closed in the Page 3 mid-1970s (see Figure 1-1), air-to ground and ship- to-shore training activities increased in the LIA. Major exercises were usually in the spring and fall, but smaller exercises occurred throughout the year (IT 2000). Unexploded ordnance (UXO), that is, bombs or explosive ordnance and other waste military munitions, were treated and detonated in the LIA. Today, when UXO are identified, they are transported to an authorized area and detonated with a remote control charge. UXO that cannot be transported safely to the open burning/open detonation area are detonated onsite in accordance with prescribed procedures. Figure 1-3.

Waterborne contaminants cannot flow from LIA to residential area. An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 The Navy is still involved in remedial activities on Vieques. These activities should be conducted in a way tha t ensures public health is protected from exposure to contaminants. In 2001, the Navy transferred ownership of approximately 7,500 acres of land on the west end of the island to the municipality of Vieques, the Puerto Rico Conservation Trust, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) but retained about 100 acres of the former Naval Ammunition Support Detachment (NASD) lands for radar and communication facilities (US Navy 2001). Some NASD areas were leased to local farmers for cattle grazing and other agricultural purposes (USEPA 2004). On May 1, 2003, after civilian protests and negotiations between the federal and Puerto Rican governments, all military operations ceased on and around the island. The Navy transferred its remaining 14,500-acre property on the eastern end of the Page 4 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 island to the FWS (USEPA 2004). Lands on the eastern and western ends of the island are now a national wildlife refuge. The Navy has initiated site investigations and cleanup actions pursuant to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), sometimes referred to as the Superfund Act. 1.3 Chemicals in Munitions and Detonation Byproducts During the peer review process for this report, several peer reviewers pointed out that the report failed to discuss any link between historical, military activity-related contaminants that might have entered the Viequense environment and any resultant human exposure from those contaminants . Previous PHAs looked at this issue; their findings are summarized in the following statements. !D ! D nitrite might have been present in drinking water samples taken by the Navy in 1978, but also expressed doubts about the validity of these data. Additionally, water samples from the Esperanza aquifer contained metals, high levels of total dissolved solids (TDS), and high salt. Two of the metals found in the Sun Bay wells (iron and manganese) and the TDS in all wells were above their secondary maximum contaminant levels (SMCL) established by U.S.EPA as a national secondary drinking water regulation. SMCLs are established only as guidelines to assist public water systems in managing their drinking water for aesthetic considerations, such as taste, color, and odor. TDS including iron, manganese, and sodium are commonly found in groundwater. The presence of these metals was considered directly related to the high levels of TDS in the water and probably reflected the natural geology of the island, given that the igneous and volcanic rocks that make up Vieques bedrock are a common source of iron and manganese (ATSDR 2001). !D ! Navy activities appeared to influence LIA soils. The concentrations of heavy metals found at the LIA were 1.4 to 2.9 times higher than background concentrations collected from the west end of the island. Current soil data from the residential area of Vieques were not available. Therefore, ATSDR conducted a very conservative health evaluation that included concentrations of metals detected in areas where access was restricted (i.e., land previously owned by the Navy, including the LIA) (ATSDR 2003a). !D ! ! exercises at Vieques released contaminants to the air, including dusts, chemical byproducts of explosions, and metals . Using particulate ambient air monitoring data from the residential areas of the island, the PHA concluded that wind-blown dust from the LIA was not a health hazard on days without bombing exercises and that the Navy's past military training exercises with practice bombs did not pose a health hazard. The modeling analysis of the Air PHA predicted that chemicals emitted from live bombing exercises dispersed to extremely low levels over the 7.9 miles that separate the emissions source (the LIA) and the residential area of Vieques. For a majority of the contaminants released, the estimated concentrations in the residential areas are so low that even highly sensitive air sampling devices would likely not be able to measure them (ATSDR 2003b). Page 5 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 As a part of AT D F ! compounds and heavy metals. Some evidence showed that explosive compounds might have 7contaminated the marine environment. HMX and a chemical similar to RDX were detected in fiddler crabs collected on the LIA. Because the fiddler crabs had not been rinsed before sampling, whether the explosive residues were present in the fiddler crabs or were due to external sand and dirt contamination was unclear. One trunkfish from the fish market was found to contain trace amounts of a chemical similar to RDX.7 Explosive compounds were not detected in any of the other 142 edible fish or shellfish samples. Several heavy metals were detected in the fish and shellfish (ATSDR 2003c) . Statistical analysis showed that some fish and shellfish from certain reefs surrounding Vieques had higher levels of some metals and lower levels of other metals iron, aluminum, copper, zinc, arsenic, barium, potassium and selenium were all slightly higher compared with other reefs surrounding Vieques. These metals are materials found in bombs and in metal ships, suggesting possible localized contamination. But the levels were only slightly higher and the difference was statistically significant only for some reefs compared with other reefs surrounding Vieques. ATSDR evaluated the known environmental data associated with military activities. Our evaluation show ed that residents living in the central portion of the island did not have direct contact with LIA soils at levels that could harm their health. Nor were residents likely to be exposed to contaminants in air at levels that could harm their health. While explosive compounds were found in a few sampled marine animals, residents did not consume these animals. Therefore, the available data indicate that no exposure occurred at levels that would harm health. The subsections that follow briefly describe 1) the organic and inorganic compounds and elements present in munitions and detonations, 2) what is known about these constituents in the Vieques environment, and 3) whether these constituents can be linked to human exposure on the island. 1.3.1 Organic Compounds in Munitions and Detonation Byproducts , various branches of the U.S. military used many different ordnance types (e.g., firebombs, parachute flares, rockets, inert rockets, machine guns, practice bombs, and live explosives) (Young 1978). Organic compounds are typically found in the explosive charge of the military ordnance, and not in the casings. The explosive components of bombs varied over the years, but usually included some combination of The laboratory that conducted the analyses could not confirm a conclusive identification. Page 6 7 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 Ammonium picrate (explosive D). When ordnance detonates, the organic explosives are rapidly consumed and release large amounts of energy. In the process of detonation, the organic explosives are largely but not completely destroyed. Thus, they form other compounds. The scientific understanding of detonation byproducts of explosions has advanced over the years. For example, some early Navy publications (Young 1978) listed various detonation byproducts anticipated for the types of organic explosives us ed at Vieques. These estimates included the following compounds and compositions: carbon dioxide (35%), nitrogen (27%), carbon ethane (5%), carbon (6%), propane (2%), plus several minor by products (e.g., ammonia, hydrogen, hydrogen cyanide, methane, methanol, formaldehyde) formed in trace quantities (<1%). These estimates are based on theoretical calculations, not on field-testing of actual detonations. Scientists have since developed more sophisticated and rigorous testing procedures for identifying and \u0011\u0011 ! 1992 a, 1992b, 1992c) have been particularly useful for directly measuring organic chemicals released following detonations. The BangBox refers to a flexible structure in which ordnance is detonated. Because the BangBox is completely enclosed, byproducts formed during the detonation do not escape the structure. Air sampling equipment can measure them. Scientists have used the BangBox to estimate emission factors for various types of ordnance, many of which are similar or identical to those used at Vieques. The BangBox studies have identified more than 50 organic compounds expected to be emitted to the air in trace quantities as detonation byproducts. In addition to the byproducts listed in the previous paragraph, the BangBox studies found the following byproducts in greatest quantities (but all were less than 0.1% of the total emissions): sulfur dioxide, benzene, naphthalene, acetylene, di-butyl phthalate, and various aromatic compounds. The modeling analysis in the Air PHA considered emission rates for every organic byproduct identified in the BangBox studies for the types of ordnance most similar to those the Navy used at Vieques. 1.3.2 Inorganic Compounds in Munitions and Detonation Byproducts Inorganic compounds in munitions, including metals, are found in the metal bomb casings and sometimes in the explosive charge. Both sources of inorganic compounds (primarily metals) are reviewed here. !D ! ! ordnance dropped onto the LIA and emitted into the air because of the training exercises . The most abundant elements in bomb casings were iron (93%), aluminum (5%), copper (2%), manganese (2%), and zinc (0.5%). The percentages shown total more than 100%not uncommon when expressing metal content in alloy mixtures (i.e., an upper bound concentration is often used when characterizing the composition of individual constituents). Numerous other metals were present in bomb casings at concentrations less than 0.02%, including boron, chromium, molybdenum, nickel, and titanium (ATSDR 2003b). The predominant metal in explosive charges was aluminum, which accounted for as much as 21% of the explosive charge in some live bombs (ATSDR 2003b). Page 7 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 The emission factors for the BangBox studies identified the following five metals as having the highest emissions in decreasing order: copper, zinc, aluminum, calcium, and lead. Eleven other metals were detected in these studies, but at lower levels. It should be noted that these studies did not measure concentrations of certain metals (e.g., iron, manganese) found in highest concentrations in the bomb casings (ATSDR 2003b). Given the previous review, iron, aluminum, copper, manganese, zinc, and lead are the metals most likely to be elevated in LIA soils from military activity, though other metals were also found in bombs. It should be noted that all of these metals are also naturally present in the soils and rocks of Vieques (ATSDR 2003a, Learned 1973, USGS 1997 and 2001). Because mercury was historically used in certain detonators, mercury has been mentioned as a contaminant of concern (Garc\u00eda et. al. 2000). Bomb casing composition data originally provided by the Navy indicated that casings did not contain mercury, which is consistent with information on Material Safety Data Sheets available for steel. The Air PHA indicated that the total annual estimated mercury emissions from high explosive ordnance used at the LIA were very low (i.e., less than 0.5 kg per year) . Following detonation, the mercury was presumably a trace constituent in the explosive charge and in the soil ejected into the air . This estimated mercury emission of less than 0.5 kg per year can be compared with the mercury National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) developed by the U.S. EPA . The mercury NESHAP air emission rate for a chlor-alkali plant is 844 kg per year. More information is available at: http:// www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR- 2011-title40-vol8/xml/CFR\u00ad 2011 -title40-vol8-part61.xml#seqnum61.52 . Therefore, the live ordnance dropped on the LIA does not appear to be a significant mercury source in the Vieques environment. 1.3.3 What Bomb-related Constituents Were Found in Vieques Vieques has seen numerous environmental sampling efforts over the past few decades. This section reviews the evidence for ordnance-related constituents in the local environment. Information is first presented for explosive compounds, then for metals. What follows is a summary of explosive compounds found in various media from Vieques. Because explosive compounds d o not occur naturally, the presence of these contaminants in environmental media point to the past military activities as the most likely source. In 2000, surface soil samples collected from the LIA showed rare detections of HMX, RDX, 2\u00adamino-DNT, and TNT (CH2MHIll 2000) . In 2003, seawater samples from inside and near a 2000-lb bomb in Bahia del Sur showed explosive compounds, but explosives were not detected in samples near the sunken target vessel, the former USS Killen (Barton and Porter 2004). In 2003, sediment samples collected from within 2 meters of a 2000-lb bomb in Bahia Salina del Sur showed TNT. Farther away, the concentration declined to nondetectable. Sediment samples collected from the vicinity of the former USS Killen contained no detectable explosive residues (Barton and Porter 2004). Page 8 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 In 2001, fish and shellfish were collected and their tissues analyzed for explosive compounds. No explosive residues were detected in fish tissues from any species or sample location, except for trunkfish. One trunkfish from the fish market was found to contain trace amounts of a chemical similar to RDX. Of the four shellfish species sampled, only fiddler crabs were shown to contain the explosive compound HMX. A chemical similar to RDX8 was also detected in fiddler crabs, but the level was so low that an accurate determination could not be made. Because the fiddler crabs had not been rinsed prior to sampling, it was unclear whether the explosive residues were present in the crabs or were due to external sand and dirt contamination (ATSDR 2003c). In 2003, other marine organisms (one damselfish, one feather duster worm, and one sea urchin) collected near a 2000-lb bomb in Bahia Salina del Sur showed explosive residues. 1,3,5\u00adtrinitrobenzene was detected in a damselfish sample; TNT was found in a feather duster worm and in a sea urchin. Explosive residues were not detected in fish and lobster samples collected near the former USS Killen. One coral sample from the USS Killen area contained detectable TNT residues (Barton and Porter 2004). The previous results show that small amounts of explosive compounds remain in the Vieques terrestrial and marine environments. While explosives have been detected in or on some organisms (e.g., feather duster worm, sea urchin, fiddler crabs), nearly every fish tissue sample to date has failed to contain detectable levels of explosives, with the only exception being a single damselfish tissue sample a species not typically consumed by people and possibly one trunkfish sample. The remainder of this section evaluates the presence of munitions-related metals in the Vieques environment. Metals were clearly present in the bombs the Navy dropped on the island and in to the nearby ocean. The metals that landed in the Vieques environment might change chemical form over time, but the metals themselves will not decay or decompose. Nevertheless, because many metals occur naturally in soil and sediment, distinguishing is often difficult between naturally occurring concentrations and concentrations that represent human-activity contamination. The text that follows considers whether metals in the LIA soils have been found at levels believed above background. 2006 \u00122 ed soil inorganics in east Vieques (CH2MHILL 2007) . The goal was to establish background levels within the naval training areas that could be used to determine whether other soil samples from suspected contaminated areas exceeded background levels. In cases where sampling results exceed background ranges, a logical inference is that the elevated measurements reflect contributions from past military activities or some other manufactured source. For each metal and element in the report, an upper tolerance limit (UTL) was developed for the various soil types in east Vieques. The UTL is a statistically derived value, with the exact derivation depending on the shape of the distribution of the sampling results (e.g., normal versus lognormal). The inference to be drawn from the UTLs is that measured soil concentrations below these values are indistinguishable from background concentrations. Not surprisingly, the UTLs were highest for the The laboratory that conducted the analyses could not confirm a conclusive identification. Page 9 8 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 predominant elements in soil, including aluminum (35,000 ppm for all soil types), iron (38,100 43,200 ppm, depending on soil type) and magnesium (3,710 22,200 ppm, depending on soil type). Other elements in soil had UTLs with the following ranges depending on soil type Arsenic 1.6 32 ppm for all soil types To identify metals possibly associated with military exercises, ATSDR compared soil samples collected in 2000 at the LIA (CH2MHILL 2000) with the above-listed UTLs. For the following metals, at least 30% of the measured concentrations exceeded background levels in LIA soils, as characterized by the UTLs. The maximum soil concentration for each metal follows: Arsenic 20 ppm Beryllium 33 ppm Vanadium 220 ppm Zinc 180 ppm Mercury was also considered in this data comparison. The average mercury levels in LIA soils from the 2000 dataset was 0.02 ppm, and the highest level was 0.086 ppm (CH2MHILL 2000). Only one of 29 soil samples had a mercury level that could be considered above naturally occurring levels when compared with the background UTLs (0.057 0.31 ppm; CH2MHILL 2007). In May and October 2007, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) randomly collected 78 sediment samples and 35 coral samples from near-shore waters and a number of inland lagoons (sediments only) on Vieques (Bauer and Kendall 2010). The samples were grouped according to Page 10 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 adjacent land use. A series of statistical tests were carried out to understand the distribution of the chemicals in the sediments. The concentrations of cadmium collected from sediments on and near the LIA were significantly higher than in sediments collected from the residential area of the island. The concentrations of cadmium were also found significantly higher in coral tissues than in sediments (Bauer and Kendall 2010). In addition, sediment concentrations of arsenic, copper, and chromium from the inland lagoons at the LIA were, on average, higher than sediment concentrations of these metals found in the other inland lagoons sampled elsewhere on Vieques. In conclusion, soil or sediment concentrations of arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, copper, iron, lead, vanadium, and zinc appear above naturally occurring levels in some areas in and around the LIA. The presence of these metals above background concentrations could reflect the influence of military activity, given the lack of other contamination sources at the LIA . 1.3.4 Linking Contaminants in Vieques with Human Exposure Pathways !D ! ! residential portion of the island do not have direct contact with LIA soils 7 to 8 miles away . Thus, exposures from any elevated metals in LIA soils cannot affect their health . Specific environmental sampling showed that Viequenses who camped on portions of the LIA in 20002001 were not exposed to metals (or other contaminants) in soil at levels that could harm their health . Similarly, the Air PHA concluded that metals in air from military activities could reach residential areas of the island, but not at levels that c Some migration of contaminants from the soils to the marine environment undoubtedly occurs at Vieques, just as weathering of soils naturally occurs in virtually any shoreline setting. Precipitation and wind can carry soils from the LIA and chemicals found in these soils either directly into marine waters or into inland lagoons. And those lagoons have the potential to overflow into the marine environment. Environmental decay processes can gradually transform explosives at the LIA into other substances over time and thus reduce the potential migration of these chemicals into marine waters . But these chemical decay processes do not decompose the metals at the LIA. From an environmental health perspective, although migration of contaminants clearly occurs, the rate and amount of chemical migration is more important. Military activities on Vieques have direct ly contaminat ed the marine environment with explosive compounds, such as HMX and RDX. Some of the ordnance previously fired at the LIA landed in the ocean rather than hitting onshore targets. Dr. James Porter provided direct evidence of this in photographs viewed during a meeting at ATSDR in November 2009. Some ordnance found in Vieques waters apparently included unexploded material. While explosive organic compounds were found in some marine species, these species are not consumed by humans; therefore, the available sampling data indicate that elevated human exposures are not occurring . Explosive compounds were not found in the 104 edible fish sampled in 2001 except for a chemical similar to RDX in one trunkfish collected from the fish market. Two observations suggest that the LIA is not currently the primary source of mercury in fish tissues. First, most mercury levels in LIA soils appear to be at naturally occurring levels, with no significant Page 11 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 spatial variation to suggest that mercury levels are higher at the LIA . !D study did not find unusually elevated tissue concentrations of mercury in Vieques reef fis h. A more plausible explanation for the mercury levels found in fish is that they resulted from the global reservoir of mercury circulating through the environment and not from mercury in some bombs and other ordnance. In conclusion, ATSDR evaluated the known environmental data associated with military activities . Our evaluation shows that residents living in the central portion of the island did not have direct contact with LIA soils at levels that could harm their health. Nor were residents likely to be exposed to contaminants in air at levels that could harm their health . While explosive compounds were found in a few sampled marine animals, residents did not consume these animals. Therefore, the available data indicate that no exposure occurred at levels that would harm health . ATSDR has concluded in this report that some residents who frequently ate reef fish were exposed to mercury at levels that could harm a developing fetus (see Chapter 2). But this mercury appears associated with global mercury circulating in the environment and not with the small amount of mercury in some military ordnance. 1.4 The Vieques Civilian Population The entire, approximately 10,000-member civilian population of the island referred to here as Viequenses entral 7,000 acres, mostly in the towns of Isabel Segunda and Esperanza. The residential areas are about 7 miles from the LIA . The civilian areas comprise residences and agricultural, commercial, and industrial activities. In the past, sugarcane was the principal crop; other crops have included coconuts, grains, sweet potatoes, avocados, bananas, and papayas. Construction of a General Electric plant in 1969 spurred manufacturing employment in the 1970s and released 1,1,1 trichloroethane and small amounts of copper to outdoor air (Bermudez 1998, ATSDR 2003b). Currently, however, the island is home to only minimal manufacturing activity. Commercial fishing fleets are home-ported at Isabel Segunda and Esperanza. Tourism has recently increased in economic importance . The 2000 Census indicates that 65% of residents of Vieques live in poverty compared with 48% for all of Puerto Rico 9. The 1990 Census results were similar, with 73% of the residents of Vieques living in poverty compared with 59% in all of Puerto Rico. According to the 2000 Census, about 19% of the population consists of women of childbearing age (15 to 44 years), and children 6 years and younger account for 11% of the population. 1.5 ATSDR's Evaluation of Vieques evaluation of public health concerns on Vieques is the latest in a series of Vieques investigations. In 1999 !D use of live and inert ordnance resulted in health risks. From 2001 to 2003, ATSDR released four public health assessments (PHAs). Each PHA assessed a specific pathway for possible exposure to chemicals: seafood (e.g., fish, shellfish, and land crabs), drinking water, air, and soil. Each of these evaluations is available at http:// www.atsdr.cdc.gov/sites/vieques/publications.html . ATSDR followed the public Using 2000 Census data, the poverty thresholds in 2000 were $17,603 for a family of four and $13,738 for a family of three ( http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/data/incpovhlth/2000/briefing.html ). Page 12 9 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 health assessment procedures described in its Public Health Assessment Guidance Manual.10 Scientific experts peer-reviewed each PHA before its final release. After analyzing data and modeling, each PHA concluded that with one specific exception, no health hazard was associated with any pathways evaluated. The exception: water from one local well was contaminated with nitrates and not fit to drink. But some scientists from the University of Puerto Rico, the University of Georgia, and Yale University, as !D . Most scientists and residents believed the -long island presence left residual environmental hazards that affected public health on Vieques. ATSDR has since 2009 gathered more than 75 documents relating to environmental sampling, health outcomes, and biomonitoring. Most of these documents were available when ATSDR released the 2001 2003 public health assessments, but some were completed later. In August 2009, ATSDR scientists and staff visited Vieques and met with community leaders, Puerto Rican scientists, and health officials. From those meetings emerged a commitment to involve local !D !D invited Puerto Rican scientists and others who had studied Vieques to meet in Atlanta, Georgia, on November 5 6, 2009. Participants engaged in a thorough review of multiple studies, identified the strengths and limitations of many of them, and made recommendations for further work. The group suggested that ATSDR reconsider its fish consumption exposure scenarios. The group also expressed its concern about potential exposure to contaminants through consumption of locally grown produce. Discussions such as these resulted in ATSDR performing new analyses for this report. A summary of that meeting is available at http:// www.atsdr.cdc.gov/sites/vieques/notes_vsc_toc.html . 1.6 The Report ATSDR prepared this report after review of all relevant, available data and related information and after the November meeting with invited scientists. We have divided the report into sections on environmental data (i.e., air, soil, drinking water, and food consumption), human biomonitoring data, and health outcome data . Conclusions and recommendations are made in each chapter and are summarized again in Chapter 9 . The circumstances on Vieques typify many of the difficulties faced by the public and by officials concern ed about the effects of hazardous substances. Numerous questions arise regarding exposures and at times, relatively few measurements are available to answer those questions directly . Environmental data are often limited in spatial coverage, number, or analytical quality control documentation . Consequently, some degree of uncertainty always remains . That means a key part of any review is to consider, before drawing public health conclusions, the adequacy of the available data. Note, however, that public health conclusions often can be drawn from limited data as long as uncertainties are recognized . !D conclusions can be reevaluated if new, improved information becomes available. Thus in this evaluation, ATSDR identifies the available data as well as the data gaps. Available at: http:// www.atsdr.cdc.gov/HAC/PHAManual/index.html . Page 13 10 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 In contrast to environmental data, human biomonitoring can demonstrate how much of a chemical has entered the human body. Blood and urine levels of metals and organic chemicals can be useful in the comparative sense, where potentially exposed groups can be compared with nonexposed or lesser- exposed groups. This comparison assess es whether the target group has unusual or higher than expected exposure . Limitations to biomonitoring include the appropriate timing and collection of samples that will affect data interpretation. Also, in most situations, biomonitoring provides information about current or recent exposures; only in certain situations where a chemical may persist in the body (e.g., lead in bone) does biomonitoring provide information about exposures long past. The November, 2009 Atlanta meeting resulted in ATSDR performing new analyses, as detailed in the chapters of this report. Appendix A includes short summaries of each report analyzed as a part of this evaluation. After careful examination of previously reported data, new data, and new science, ATSDR has arrived at the conclusions and recommendations contained at the end of each environmental data chapter, the health-outcome data chapter, the biomonitoring data chapters, and in Chapter 9. Because outside peer review and the public comment period are now complete and because the document is now final, ATSDR hopes the report will guide the future work of environmental and public health agencies and scientists on Vieques. 1.7 References [ATSDR] Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. 2003a.

Appendix 2A-3. The Joint U.S.EPA and FDA National Fish Advisory ............................................. 56 Chapter 2 Summary At the request of scientists who visited ATSDR in 2009 , ATSDR evaluated the risk from mercury in fish and shellfish by comparing the estimated mercury intakes with guidelines recommended by the National Academy of Sciences and by the U.S.EPA . Page 17 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 ATSDR has identified mercury exposure from frequent consumption of marine seafood as a potential public health hazard. After a review of estimated mercury intakes from seafood consumption, ATSDR concludes that children born to women who eat fish daily from waters surrounding Vieques are at increased risk of adverse health effects. Possible harmful effects identified from studies of non-Viequense children exposed in utero involve language, attention, and memory, and to a lesser extent visual/spatial and motor functions. In addition, even if children were not exposed in utero, some children who frequently eat fish from waters surrounding Vieques are also at risk of harmful effects. This conclusion about the risk of harmful effects to the fetus and to children is somewhat uncertain, primarily because a person's response to mercury is itself somewhat uncertain. Contributing to that uncertainty is how the body handles mercury, and the sex, genetics, health, and nutritional status of the person who eats the fish, or how mercury is handled in the body. Estimating mercury intake from eating reef fish is likewise uncertain. The intake could vary depending on the type, frequency, and quantity of fish eaten. Current information about Viequenses fish-eating habits and mercury levels in fish could reduce this uncertainty. Statistical analysis showed that some fish and shellfish from certain reefs surrounding Vieques had higher levels of some metals and lower levels of other metals \u2014iron, aluminum, copper, zinc, arsenic, barium, potassium and selenium were all slightly higher \u2014compared with other reefs surrounding Vieques . These metals are materials found in bombs and in metal ships, suggesting possible localized contamination. But the levels were only slightly higher and the difference was statistically significant only for some reefs compared with other reefs surrounding Vieques. ATSDR recommends the following for consideration by environmental and public health agencies and scientists: Following available fish advisories and maintaining fishing restrictions near the LIA; Conducting a survey to determine the type, frequency, and quantity of fish consumed; Conducting additional risk assessments and statistical analyses using information gather ed from the previously recommended fish consumption survey; Collecting and analyzing additional fish samples from Vieques should the proposed survey and statistical analysis not provide sufficient public health information. Collect sufficient fish samples to allow analysis by species and by location; and Developing an educational program about mercury in fish that incorporates local habits and information about Viequenses' seafood consumption . Page 18 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 2.1 Introduction to Viequense Fish Consumption Many Viequenses remain concerned that the U.S. contaminated fish and other marine life near the island. Locally harvested fish and other species are an important part of the Viequense diet . High contaminant levels in fish and other marine animals could affect the health of those who eat them. But heavy metals in fish and shellfish are not unusual. D iety of metals in varying concentrations. Thus in populations who eat substantial quantities of fish, evaluation of heavy metal exposure is quite reasonable . D !D , 2009 meeting in Atlanta, several scientists raised questions about mercury levels in fish. They reported finding residents with elevated mercury levels in hair . If these mercury levels are indicative of mercury body burdens generally, they might put a developing fetus at risk for neurological effects . The scientists were concerned that !D 2003 F ! were inconsistent with the 2004 U.S.EPA/FDA national fish advisory for mercury. They were also concerned that ATSDR did not use the National Academy of Science recommendations to U.S.EPA concerning mercury toxicity. ATSDR therefore is reevaluating its 2003 conclusions and recommendations about mercury in fish from reefs surrounding Vieques . !D coming from the global reservoir of mercury in the environment and not from past military exercises. A more thorough discussion of this topic occurs in Chapter 1, Section 1 .3. Nevertheless , because of continued public health concerns, ATSDR revisited its evaluation of mercury in fish. 2.1.1 A Brief Review of Mercury Mercury is found in several chemical forms : elemental mercury, inorganic mercury, and methylmercury. Elemental mercury is the familiar silver material found in some thermometers. Mercury in soil is o ften inorganic mercury, while mercury in fish and shellfish is predominantly methylmercury, with small amounts of inorganic mercury. When elemental or inorganic mercury enters freshwater and saltwater environments, some of it is transformed into methylmercury, which accumulates in fish and seafood. It is the methylmercury form in fish that is harmful to the developing fetus and to young children . Tests for mercury in fish, however, often measure all forms of mercury. We refer to these tests as total mercury concentration or just mercury concentration . Identification of just the methylmercury or inorganic mercury concentrations in fish requires specific tests. 2.1.2 Summary of !TSDR's 2003 Fish PH! In July 2001, ATSDR collected 104 fish and 42 shellfish samples. ATSDR analyzed the edible tissue for metals and explosive compounds . The 42 shellfish samples consisted of 20 conch, 7 lobster, 11 blue land crab, and 4 fiddler crab . Twenty-five blue land crabs comprised 11 composite samples, and 146 fiddler crab s comprised four composite samples. All samples were analyzed individually except the blue crab (combined into 11 composite samples) and the fiddler crabs (combined into four samples) . As expected, the results showed various metals in fish and shellfish tissue. Therefore, in its 2003 Fish PHA, ATSDR evaluated whether fish and shellfish muscle tissues contain ed levels of heavy metals that would pose a health risk. In its 2003 Fish PHA, ATSDR used fish intake rates that focused on people who ate large Page 19 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 amounts (i.e., 8 ounces for adults and 4 ounces for children) and who ate fish daily. The agency also used standard body weights of 70 kilograms (kg) (or 154 pounds) for adults and 16 kg (35 pounds) for children. ATSDR further assumed that all the mercury detected in fish and shellfish was methylmercury numerous fish studies support this (ATSDR 1999 ; Greib et al. 1990 ; Bloom 1992) . In the 2003 Fish PHA, t !D methylmercury. In June 2003, ATSDR released its evaluation of these data as a public health assessment with these conclusions: A variety of fish and shellfish were safe to eat every day; Fish and shellfish were safe to eat from any of the locations sampled, including from around the LIA and the sunken navy target vessel USS Killen; and Snapper, the most commonly consumed species, was safe to eat every day. These recommendations were based on the low level of mercury and other metals detected in fish collected from reefs, from the sunken target vessel, and from a commercial fish market on the island. Organic chemicals associated with past military activities were rarely detected in the seafood samples and then only at low levels. 2.1.3 U.S.EPA and FDA Jo int National Fish Advisory In March 2004, a year after the public health assessment, the U.S.EPA and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a joint national fish advisory. It emphasized that fish and shellfish were an important part of a healthy diet. The advisory pointed out that fish and shellfish contained high -quality protein and other essential nutrients, were low in saturated fat, and provided omega-3 fatty acids, a heart healthy chemical. A well-balanced diet that included a variety of fish and shellfish could contribute to heart health and to children's proper growth and development. The advisory concluded that in particular, women and young children should include fish or shellfish in their diets (USEPA 2004 ; FDA 2004). The joint FDA/ USEPA advisory acknowledged that nearly all fish and shellfish contained traces of mercury. For most people, the risk of mercury-related health effects from eating fish and shellfish was not a concern. Yet some fish and shellfish may contain levels of mercury considered unhealthy . Women and young children are advised not to eat some fish and shellfish , especially in large quantities. The risks from mercury in fish and shellfish depend on the mercury levels in, and the amount of fish and shellfish eaten. The FDA and the U.S.EPA have advised women who might become pregnant, women already pregnant, nursing mothers, and young children to avoid some types of fish and to eat only fish and shellfish known to have lower mercury levels (USEPA 2004 ; FDA 2004). The joint advisory said that by following these recommendations for selecting and eating fish or shellfish, women and young children would receive dietary benefits. At the same time, they would reduc e their exposure to harmful effects. U.S.EPA and FDA made the following recommendations and statements: Do not eat shark, swordfish, king mackerel, or tilefish they contain high levels of mercury. Eat up to 12 ounces (2 average meals) a week of a variety of fish and shellfish lower in mercury . Page 20 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 In the continental United States, five of the most commonly eaten fish low in mercury are shrimp (0.012 ppm),11 canned light tuna (0.12 ppm), salmon (0.01 ppm) , pollock (0.04 ppm), and catfish (0.05 ppm). Another commonly eaten fish in the continental United States, albacore (\"white\") tuna (0.36 ppm), has more mercury than does canned light tuna . U.S.EPA and FDA recommend limiting albacore tuna to only one 6 ounce-meal (one average meal) per week. U.S.EPA and FDA recommend checking local advisories about the safety of fish caught by family and friends in local lakes, rivers, and coastal areas. In the absence of a local adv isory, eat only up to 6 ounces (one average meal) per week of fish caught in local waters but do not consume any other fish during the week. U.S.EPA and FDA advise following these same recommendations when feeding fish and shellfish to young children, but serve smaller portions ( USEPA 2004; FDA 2004) . Note that the FDA currently compares the risk from mercury in fish with the benefits of eating fish (FDA 2009). According to its draft risk and benefit assessment, the FDA estimated the net effect of consumption of different amounts of fish. The results indicated that as measured by verbal development, consumption of fish species low in methylmercury was likely to result in a modest net benefit. When FDA modeled actual consumption for the range of methylmercury concentrations (low to high) in fish, the likelihood was small of an adverse effect in children. In addition, FDA concluded that fish consumption prevented a significant number of deaths from coronary heart disease and stroke each year in adults. FDA pointed out, however, that its risk and benefit assessment should not be construed - FD! 2009 FD! benefit assessment is available at http:// www.fda.gov/Food/FoodSafety/Product\u00ad S pecificInformation/Seafood/FoodbornePathogensContaminants/Methylmercury/ucm088794.htm . 2.1.4 The Vieques Marine Environment The following brief descriptions provide some insight into the ecological effects to the coral reefs around Vieques . In July 2001, the U.S.EPA Environmental Response Team ( USEPA/ERT) collected fish and shellfish from near-shore ree !D conducting the sampling reported that unexploded ordnance (UXO) was a common sight around the former USS Killen (a Navy target vessel intentionally sunk to the south of the LIA) and was occasionally seen in a seagrass bed to the north of the LIA. Despite the presence of UXO, the divers observed that all sample locations supported diverse, healthy populations of marine organisms and that the reefs visited were in good condition. The divers also noted that with very few exceptions, the fish and shellfish collected appeared healthy (USEPA 2001). In November 2001, a Navy contractor (Geo-Marine) characterized the biological organisms on and around the former USS Killen. The purpose was to assess the health of the marine species and to assess potential effects on the surrounding biota. The overall conclusion was that the Average mercury level as reported by FDA (FDA 2004). Page 21 11 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 sunken vessel and its contents had no negative effects on the coral reef ecosystem; rather, they acted as a productive artificial reef habitat (Geo-Marine 2002). In June 2003, researchers from the University of Georgia and Underwater Ordnance Recovery collected data on the environmental integrity and ecosystem health of Vieques coral reefs. They reported the presence of underwater UXO and numerous 55-gallon drums in Bahia Salina del Sur (the bay to the southwest of the former LIA) and documented damage to the coral reefs (Barton and Porter 2004). In May and October 2007, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) conducted an ecological characterization of the marine resources of Vieques. They found little evidence of any differences in marine resources, nutrients, or contaminants among the different former land-use zones. Biota, nutrients, and contaminant levels around Vieques generally match those of other coral reef ecosystems (Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands) and appear shaped by regional-scale processes rather than local factors. The results of their study did not support the hypothesis that military activities negatively affected the marine environment around Vieques. Nor did their study support the opposite hypothesis: that the lack of development on two-thirds of the island positive ly influenced the marine environment (Bauer and Kendall 2010). In July 2008, the National Coral Reef Institute published the results of a study that investigated whether the coral reefs around Vieques were in better or worse shape than the reefs around St. Croix. Even though the researchers observed evidence of past military activity at Vieques (e.g., unexploded bombs, casings, and ammunition shells to the north and south of the LIA), they found no differences in living benthic cover and coral assemblage structure between the two islands. They concluded that the effects of Caribbean-wide natural disturbances (disease and storms) had a greater impact on the coral reefs than did the former military activities on Vieques (Riegl et al. 2008). 2.2 Assessment of Available Fish Data Two sets of data are available on metal levels in fish. One is from the Metropolitan University in Puerto Rico, and the other is from ATSDR. Both sets of data originate from sampling events conducted from 1999 2000 or in 2001. 2.2.1 Fish Data from Metropolitan University From December 1999 to April 2000, Dr. Doris Caro with the Metropolitan University (i.e., Universidad Metropolitana), School of Environmental Matters, collected 52 fish from two markets in Vieques (northern Vieques and Esperanza) and compared the results with 26 fish collected from fish markets from the Parguera (Caro 2000). She also conducted a survey of 51 Vieques residents and fishers to determine the most frequently consumed fish. Among the 51 residents surveyed, Dr. Caro reported the following fish consumption frequencies: 20% never eat fish, 47% eat fish 1 2 times a week, 18% eat fish 3 4 times a week, and Page 22 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 1216% eat fish five or more times a week (Caro 2000). Dr. Caro thus reported that 34% of Viequenses ate fish 3 4 or more times a week. The more extensive, random PRDOH survey in 2004 supported her findings. The PRDOH manuscript reported that 38% of Viequenses ate fish three or more times a week. Both of these surveys show that a significant portion of Viequenses eat fish regularly. !D daily therefore seems reasonable, although the precise percentage is not known . Dr. Caro also provided information about the type of fish the 51 respondents ate. Table 2-1 shows these D \u0012 responders who ate certain fish (Caro 2000). Dr. Caro concluded that the detected metal concentrations in Vieques fish did not show that metals in fish bioaccumulate, pointing to the absence of any clear relationship between fish weight, size, and metal \u0012 2000 !D cies. Mercury concentrations in fish collected by Dr. Caro are shown in Table 2-2 as ppm, although whether the reported concentrations are dry weight or wet weight is uncertain. We have attempted to contact the laboratory to ascertain how the data were reported, but we have not received a response. The described method produces raw results in dry weight. The mercury concentrations were extremely low !D very low weights of the fish. Uncertainty thus remains about whether the results are wet weight or dry weight. Regardless, Dr. Caro concluded that the results show that mercury concentrations are higher in fish from markets in Vieques compared with the control population from Parguera (Caro 2000). These conclusions were reached using averages calculated in a manner inconsistent with U.S.EPA methods. Dr. Caro states that the results clearly justify a need for further sampling. We agree with this last statement. Dr. Caro further states that her report should be viewed as a starting point for a more comprehensive survey. She recommended the following: 1. Choose sentinel species, including some close to sediments. 2. Obtain fish samples in other areas of the island, mainly in ordnance-free areas. 3. Sample fish after the beginning of military exercises and analyze it accordingly. 13 4. Sample and analyze crustaceans (e.g., crabs, lobster) and other aquatic life, such as snails. 5. Assign additional funds for the enhancement of the proposed study. 6. Perform a risk-assessment study of the species analyzed and the results obtained. 12 Percentages are rounded to whole numbers. 13 Note that sampling fish after the beginning of military exercises is no longer possible all such exercises have ceased.

The table here uses the values calculated by Caro et al. 2000 from Appendix 10. Her averages include values below the detection level of the instrument. An apparent typographical error appears in the original table D \u0012 from Appendix 10 in the report shows that the average is 0.018 ppm , not 0.048 ppm. An apparent typographical error appears in the original table D \u0012 Using data from Appendix 10 in the report shows that the average is 0.024 ppm , not 0.029 ppm. The Metropolitan University data have several strengths, but some limitations as well. To ensure that metal concentrations in fish were in the fish that people were consuming, investigators collected their fish samples from two local markets. Investigators interviewed 51 residents and fishers about their fish \u00ad eating habits and where those fish were bought or caught. Investigators learned their Vieques fish market samples included fish from the reefs and the open ocean. Metal concentrations in Vieques market fish did not therefore necessarily represent metal concentrations in reef fish near Vieques . Also, the participants were not randomly selected, and only a limited number of surveys (i.e., 51) were conducted. All this adds some uncertainty to identifying all the fish species that Viequenses eat and to the frequency of Viequense fish consumption. And as stated, with regard to the fish sampling results, the authors did not specify whether their results were wet or dry weight. This prevents a reliable estimation of human doses from eating fish. Despite these limitations, however, one peer reviewer of this report \u0012 Therefore, with qualification, D \u0012 D \u0012 compared with !D Because Dr. Caro reported averages for fish according to species rather than fish family, some locations have just one or two fish to compare. Also, in calculating averages, Dr. Caro used values below the detection level . Page 25 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 ATSDR used the raw data reported in Appendix 10 of D \u0012 to group fish species into families from both Vieques markets. In this way, the results provide statistically significant numbers comparable !D : Arrayo w as combined with colirrubia to represent the snapper family at both Vieques markets, Cotorro rojo w as combined with cotorro azul and cotorro verde to represent the parrotfish family at both Vieques markets , Mero mantequilla were combined with mero cabrilla to represent the hind family at both Vieques markets , and Boquicolora were combined with pluma to represent the grunt family at both Vieques markets .

Average D \u0012 is unknown 2.2.2 Fish and Seafood Data from ATSDR !D 2001 sampling and analysis activities focused on whether muscle tissues from commonly consumed fish and shellfish contained levels of heavy metals and explosives compounds that would result in health effects. To assist in these activities, ATSDR sought advice and worked with the U.S.EPA Environmental Response Team (EPA/ERT) to collect and analyze fish and shellfish from the coastal waters around Vieques and from land and beaches near the shore. ATSDR collected fish and shellfish from five reefs surrounding Vieques and one local fish market. Two reefs were off the eastern portion of the island near the Live Impact Area, where military exercises formerly occurred and one of these locations included the area where the USS Killen is located. The three other reefs were off the central and western portions of the island. Land crabs were collected from two locations within the Live Impact Area and one location on the western portion of the island. Efforts were made to collect from each reef location and from the fish market five fish within a family (e.g., grunt and hind from the genus Epinephelus in the Serranidae family or snappers from the genera Lutjanus and Ocyurus within the family Lutjanidae ). At most locations, ATSDR was able to collect five fish from each family (e.g., Epinephelus, Sparisoma and Haemulon families) . But at several locations, five fish could not be collected for some families (see Table 2-4).

The meat from several land crabs was composited until a sufficient quantity of meat was obtained. To ensure a sufficient sample was collected for analysis, the whole fiddler crabs were composited and were analyzed. Fish and shellfish tissues were analyzed for explosives compounds. No explosive residues were detected in fish tissues from any sample location. Of the four shellfish species, only fiddler crabs were shown to contain the explosives compound HMX . RDX was detected in fiddler crabs, but the level was so low that an accurate concentration could not be measured. We should note that the laboratory analysis identified trace levels of a chemical with the same characteristics (i.e., retention time) of RDX (hexahydro-1,3,5,-triazine) in two samples : the fiddler crabs and the trunkfish. These trace levels were well below the RDX detection level and estimated doses were well below the RDX health guideline. Furthermore, the natural toxins within the trunkfish have the same retention time on the gas chromatogram as RDX. Therefore, we cannot conclusively determine whether RDX was present in the trunkfish tissues. The 2003 Fish PHA concluded that because residents did not eat fiddler crabs, the fiddler crab HMX would not cause harmful effects in people. No explosive compounds were detected in conch, lobster, or land crab samples from any location. Fiddler crabs and land crabs were collected from locations 1 and 2 on the eastern end of the island, and land crabs were collected from location 6 on the western end of the island (see Figure 2-1). Page 29 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 Figure 2-1. ATSDR fish and shellfish sample locations. In addition to explosive compounds, ATSDR analyzed the same fish and shellfish tissues for heavy metals. ATSDR collected 104 fish and 42 shellfish samples and analyzed the edible tissue for metals and explosive compounds. The fish samples represent 17 different species and can be grouped into these fish families: 30 hinds (or groupers), 19 snappers, 25 parrotfish, 24 grunts, 5 goatfish, and 1 cowfish . The 42 shellfish samples consisted of 20 conch, 7 lobster, 11 composite, blue land crab, and 4 composite fiddler crab samples . Twenty-five blue land crabs comprised 11 composite samples and 146 fiddler crabs comprised four composite samples. All samples were analyzed individually except the blue crab (combined into 11 composite samples) and the fiddler crabs (combined into four samples) . Here we refer to the individual and composite samples collectively as 42 shellfish samples . 2.2.3 Strength and Limitations of !TSDR's 2001 Fish and Seafood Data !D 2001 strengths: ATSDR used multiple information sources to identify the preferred types of fish and shellfish for collection. One important source was a Puerto Rican university report containing survey information about the frequency and types of fish eaten (Caro 2000). ATSDR substantiated the survey results with information from the petitioner and other residents, the Vieques Special Commission Report, and visits to the local fish markets on Vieques. ATSDR identified snapper ( Lutjanus and Ocyurus species) as the most frequently eaten fish followed by hind ( Epinephelus species) and grunt ( Haemulon species). Fish and shellfish were collected from five marine locations and from one commercial fish market on the island. Land crabs were collected from three surface locations (see Figure 2-1). In designing the sample plan and in collecting the samples, ATSDR partnered with the U.S.EPA Environmental Response Team, which has extensive experience in sampling and analyzing fish. The U.S.EPA recommended that ATSDR collect five fish per family group. Page 30 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 ATSDR collected 104 fish and 42 shellfish samples. Although most samples represented one organism, crab samples represented a composite of three or more organisms. ATSDR used standard-default fish consumption intakes. These included intake rates that focused on high-end fish consumers as well as standard body weights for adults and children. ATSDR also . This MRL underwent rigorous scientific and peer review when it was developed. ATSDR followed many of the criteria described in the U.S.EPA G ! \u0012 Contaminant Data for Use in Fish Advisories, Volume 1, Fish Sampling and Analysis, Third Edition (USEPA 2000). These guidelines describe among other techniques how to identify those fish that should be sampled, how to identify the fish tissue that should be analyzed, and how to composite fish tissue. In hindsight, !D 2001 sampling effort also had limitations. The U.S.EPA and the State of California recommend these newer criteria when developing fish consumption advisories. Regarding the appropriate number of fish to sample, the State of California believes the sample design should include either 1) a minimum of three composite samples with each composite consisting of three fish, or, preferably, 2) nine individual fish samples for each species of concern from each water body. When a species has a large size range, fish samples, when feasible, should be collected from multiple legal or edible sizes. Following this sampling protocol allows estimation of the range and variation of contaminant concentrations at a particular site and derivation of a representative mean concentration for use in developing fish consumption advisories (State of California 2009). The U.S.EPA currently recommends a statistical analysis to determine the most appropriate number of fish in a composite sample and the most appropriate number of composite samples. At a minimum, U.S.EPA says the sample design should consist of three composite samples, with three fish per composite. If the contaminant concentration in a fish species is highly variable, more composite samples and more fish in each composite are needed to estimate the average concentration of the contaminant in that species. These recommendations were developed to determine whether average mercury levels in a fish species would exceed U.S.EPA 0049 ppm (wet weight) screening level for mercury in fish. When estimating human exposure to mercury, other sample designs might also provide reliable data. 2.2.4 Mercury Levels in Reef Fish from Vieques Using !D 2001 chose to analyze contaminant levels in individual fishacceptable when a sufficient number of fish of each species or each family from each location are caught and analyzed. The maximum number of individual fish caught and analyzed for each species at each location was five. Table 2-4 summarizes the number of fish species and number of fish in each family analyzed at each location. Although the U.S.EPA recommends against combining species when determining contaminant levels, the State of California says similar species can be combined (e.g., bass) because species within a family group are likely to have similar lifestyles. And becaus e more than nine fish were collected within each family, sufficient samples were available to evaluate hind ( Epinephelus species), snapper ( ( Haemulon species)if the data from all Page 31 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 locations were combined. But grouping the data in this way introduced some uncertainty or bias. For example, certain species within a family had higher or lower contaminant levels than the average for that family. So having too many French grunt will create a high bias for all grunt . This was important for the fish ATSDR collected in Vieques the mercury concentrations were highly dependent on species (and family). Grouping the data also limit ed evaluation of fish data by location. Table 2-4, above, identifies those locations with more samples of one species or another. This table helps identify where comparisons can be made by species and where comparisons are only possible by combining species within a family. For example, in Table 2-4, five red hind (first line of data) were collected from locations 1, 4, and 5this suggests that red hind can be compared between locations 1, 4, and 5. Therefore, should we want to compare other locations, we would have to rely on other species of hind, which introduces added uncertainty due to the differences among the hind species . ATSDR compensated for this uncertainty in part by a statistical analysis of the 2001 fish data. Table 2-5 provides the average concentrations for each species and family collected at the six locations. Table 2-5 permits comparison of mercury levels in seafood by family, by location, and, in some cases, by individual species at a location . !D ! principal new conclusion was that the fish data represented enough fish to make numerous, statistically significant determinations . Statistical tests provided in Chapter 2, Section 2 .5, Appendix 2A-1 indicate that mercury concentrations were highly dependent on family, on species within some families, and by size of fish within some species. But the fish-mercury levels near the LIA were not statistically different than in the other locations. Other new conclusions in this report include Mercury was lower in shellfish and higher in finfish. Mercury in fish was highly dependent on the family and on fish species. Mercury was higher in two fish families (i.e., grunt and hind, 0.18 ppm and 0.12 ppm, respectively) compared with other families sampled (e.g., parrotfish and snapper, 0.01 ppm, and 0.05 ppm, respectively). Mercury in hind was associated with fish weight; larger hind typically had more mercury. The average mercury concentration in grunt and hind was higher than U.S.EPA 0049 -ppm screening level. Mercury levels in parrotfish were statistically lower than U.S.EPA level of 0.049 ppm and lower than the overall average of 0.1 ppm. Snapper averaged less than, but not statistically different from, the U.S.EPA 0.049 ppm screening level, and statistically less than 0.1 ppm. !D Reef fish, ocean-going fish, and canned fish by sex and by age group, Various fish species by sex and by age group, and Portion size by sex and by age group.

U.S.EPA identified that some fish and shellfish species had slightly higher levels of iron, aluminum, copper, zinc, arsenic, barium, selenium, potassium, and iron in the samples collected near the submerged bombs off the LIA coast . But the levels were only slightly higher and the difference was only statistically significant when compared with a few reef locations. U.S.EPA specific sources for these slight increases (USEPA 2001) . The U.S.EPA report did provide results for many common explosive organic chemicals, but explosive chemicals rapidly decay into other chemicals that may not be as easily detected. Nevertheless, the chemical results indicated the presence of HMX and the possible presence of RDX in fiddler crabs . Both of these chemicals are known to break down rapidly in the marine environment. For most fish, uptake of these chemicals is low; it is lowest in fish with higher oil content, and most species rapidly excrete the chemicals (Ownby et al. 2005 ; Yoo et al. 2002 ; Helene et al. 2003 ; Lotufo et al. 2005; Lotufo and Lydy 2005 ; Houston and Lutufo 2005 ; Blackburn et al. 2004) . When reviewing information for a chemical that had not been ruled out, we identified picric acid as a possible bomb component at some bombing ranges; but we could not verify it was used in Vieques . Some samples were collected from groundwater and soil, but picric acid was either not detected or the sample was rejected because of analytical problems. Picric acid is one explosive compound that does not decay rapidly in the marine environment. While picric acid is not typically used in bombs, it is an explosive compound used by the military. It does not quickly degrade in the sediment, but fish metabolize and excrete it rapidly (Yost et al. 2007 ; Nipper et al. 2001 ; Burton et al. 1983 and 1984 ; Cooper et al. 1984). Page 34 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 Slightly , but still statistically significant higher levels of military exercise-related chemicals were found in some seafood in the southern LIA area compared with other areas, such as, HMX and trace levels of RDX explosives compounds were found in the LIA fiddler crabs; Aluminum and potassium were slightly higher in some LIA fish (grunts, parrotfish) compared with other reef locations: o Aluminum in south LIA grunt compared with west end and market, o Aluminum in north LIA parrotfish compared with west end, o Aluminum in south LIA parrotfish compared with all locations except Esp eranza, o Potassium in south LIA gruntfish compared with west end, o Potassium in south LIA parrotfish compared with Isabel 2, Copper was slightly higher in some LIA species (grunts, conch) compared with other reef locations: o Copper in south LIA conch compared with No rth LIA, Esperanza, and west end, o Copper in north LIA conch compared with Esperanza and west end, o Copper in south LIA grunt compared with North LIA and Esperanza Iron was slightly higher in some LIA species (land crabs, snappers) compared with other reef locations: o Iron in snapper at south LIA compared with West End, o Iron in snapper at south LIA compared with North LIA, o Iron in crabs at south LIA compared with North LIA (USEPA 2001). Mercury levels in LIA fish were not significantly different from mercury levels in fish from other Vieques reefs . Mercury has been mentioned as a contaminant of concern because mercury was historically used in some detonators (Garc\u00eda et. al. 2000). The data originally provided by the Navy on the composition of the bomb casings indicated the casings did not contain mercury. This is consistent with information on the Material Safety Data Sheets available for steel . The Air PHA indicated that the estimated total annual emissions of mercury to the air were very low (i.e., 0.06 kg per year) . This estimated mercury emission of 0.06 kg per year can be compared with the mercury National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) developed by the U.S. EPA . The mercury NESHAP air emission rate for a chlor-alkali plant is 844 kg per year. More information is available at: http:// www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR- 2011\u00ad t itle40-vol8/xml/CFR- 2011-title40-vol8-part61.xml#seqnum61.52. The source of mercury air emissions was trace amounts in the explosive charge of some bombs and naturally occurring mercury in the soil ejected into the air following detonation. Therefore, past military exercises do not appear to be a significant source of mercury in the Vieques environment. Average mercury levels in LIA soils was 0.02 ppm, with the highest level detected at 0.086 ppm. NOAA determined that one of 29 soil samples had a mercury level that could be considered above naturally occurring levels (NOAA 2010). But two observations suggest that the LIA is not currently the primary Page 35 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 source of mercury in fish tissues. First, most mercury levels in LIA soils appear to be at naturally occurring levels with no significant spatial variation to suggest mercury levels are higher in the LIA . !D ntrations of mercury in Vieques reef fish. A more plausible explanation for the mercury levels found in fish is that they resulted from the global reservoir of mercury circulating through the environment. 2.2.5 Toxicological Evaluation of Mercury in Vieques Fish The wet-weight/dry-weight nature of the Metropolitan University fish data is unknown. Those data, then, provide only speculative insight into contaminant levels. That is, the data can be only compared with on. For quantitative dose estimates, the data are unusable; 15 doses calculated using these data would be unreliable. A toxicological evaluation will !D weight in ppm. Compared with D \u0012 2 -3), !D provide a higher mercury exposure estimate as the fish were larger and the mercury concentrations are higher . Also compared with D \u0012 !D possibly result from ATSDR having collected larger fish, which tend to accumulate higher mercury levels . !D November, 2009 meeting on Vieques raised concerns about ATSDR not using U.S.EPA D (RfD) for methylmercury and not considering the National Academy of Sciences ! The scientists noted that Puerto Ricans typically have lower body weights and that Viequenses have high fish consumption rates. T hey suggested, therefore, that ATSDR evaluate the risk for residents with lower body weights and with higher fish intake. ATSDR used the following parameters to recalculate the doses for women of childbearing age and for children: 1. A range of body weights from 4.5 to 100 kg (9.9 to 220 pounds): a. Children (1 2 years; 3 5 years; 6 8 years; 9 14 years; 15 18 years); and b. Adult women (18 54 years) (USEPA 1997). 2. A range of age-specific meal portion sizes, including the 50th, 95th, and 99th percentile. a. ! portion sizes were 3 oz, 8 oz, and 13.9 oz. b. \u0012 2 -6). For example, 3 5 year old girls have portion sizes of 2.5 oz, 6 oz, and 8.5 oz at the 50th, 95th, and 99th percentile, respectively (USEPA 1997). 3. Average mercury levels were recalculated using \u00bd the detection limit for the approximately 25% of fish that had nondetectable mercury levels (ATSDR 2005). Most of the nondetectable mercury Laboratory results for chemicals in fish are initially measured as dry weight because the moisture is removed from fish tissue before analyzing for the chemical. Once the moisture is removed, a fish sample might contain 1 ppm of a chemical as dry weight. To estimate exposure, the dry-weight concentration is usually converted to a wet-weight concentration; fish consumption is usually measured as ounces of fresh (wet) fish consumed. Thus to know whether the results are reported as wet weight or dry weight is important . Page 36 15 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 levels were found in parrotfish. Average mercury level for all fish was 0.1066 ppm using the 95th upper confidence limit (UCL) of the mean with a maximum mercury level in a bluestriped grunt of 0.33 ppm. 4. Some scientists were concerned that the 2003 Fish PHA used national average weights to represent exposure dose . This report provides exposure estimates using a wide range of weights for various ages . Estimated doses also were calculated on a continuous weight profile from 9.9 to 220 pounds and increasing meal size up to the 99th percentile (See Table 2A-1 in Chapter 2, Section 2 .6, Appendix 2A-2 .) 5. The estimated doses were compared with U.S.EPA D 01 \u00b5 Chapter 2, Section 2.2.5 provides more information about toxic effects. ATSDR also considered the National Academy of Sciences U.S.EPA . The NAS recommended that U.S.EPA use the Faroe Islands D also suggested the study and the effect levels that should be considered .

Approximate age groups are provided for various body weights ranging from 10 to 220 pounds (4.5 100 kg). For example, for women who weigh 143 pounds (65 kg) and who eat 4 ounces of reef fish daily, the estimated dose is 0.19 \u00b5g/kg/day. Similarly, for women who weigh 121 pounds (55 kg) and who eat 4 ounces of reef fish daily, the estimated mercury does is 0.22 \u00b5g/kg/day. These estimated doses exceed U.S.EPA D 01 \u00b5g/kg/day . The 99th percentile portion size is used to estimate the maximum dose for each age group. Doses are not calculated beyond this point and appear as black in Table 2A-1. Table 2-6 shows the 50th, 95th, and 99th percentile fish portion size for various age groups. Precision is difficult regarding what D \u0012 fish intake for an adult female might be three meals a week, with a portion size of 4 ounces and an average body weight of 55 kg (121 pounds). This person would have an estimated mercury dose of 0.094 \u00b5g/kg/day, which is below U.S.EPA D 01 \u00b5 Page 37 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 Estimated doses less than U.S.EPA D 01 \u00b5 are shown with a white background. Residents with these estimated doses are not at risk of harmful effects from mercury in fish. Estimated doses that exceed U.S.EPA D and dark). Women with estimated doses indicated as light blue (light gray in black and white) have a small increased risk of harming a developing fetus if they are pregnant. The risk is greater for those women with estimated doses indicated in medium blue. These estimated doses approach the dose of 1.1 \u00b5g/kg/day identified by the National Academy of Science as a dose that results in a 5% increase in the incidence of abnormal scores on the Boston Naming Test (a picture-naming, vocabulary test). The NAS effect level is consistent with the range of 0.85 to 1.5 \u00b5g/kg/day identified by the U.S.EPA as the benchmark dose lower limit (BMDL 05.) Similarly, most of the estimated doses in children exceed U.S.EPA D and dark blue in Table 2A-1 (Chapter 2, Section 2.6, Appendix 2A-2). Young children with higher daily fish intake have estimated doses that exceed the effect level of 1.1 \u00b5g/kg/day. These doses are in dark blue. Whether children are as sensitive to the neurotoxic effects of mercury as is the fetus is uncertain . To be protective, U.S.EPA FD! women who are pregnant, who plan to become pregnant, and nursing mothers. These conclusions about the risk of harmful effects are also somewhat uncertain; to know the exact dose that might cause harmful neurological effects in the fetus and in children is difficult. This uncertainty arises from limitations inherent in human studies and because a person ay vary. Finally, estimating the mercury dose that someone might receive is similarly uncertain. If residents eat more snapper and parrotfish, which are lower in mercury, their estimated dose of mercury will be lower; they are likely to be at lower risk of harmful effects or at no risk at all. If residents eat more grunt and hind, which are higher in mercury, their estimated dose of mercury will be higher and they could be at greater risk of harmful effects. The conclu !D end of this chapter (Section 2.3) and in Chapter 9 of this report. 2.2.6 Possible Mixtures Effects from Chemicals in Fish and Other Biota !D 2003 F ! centrations of individual metals in Vieques reef fish were not at levels of health concern. In its evaluation of these fish data for this report, ATSDR concluded that mercury in fish is a concern for children and for the developing fetus in women who frequently eat large amounts of fish. Unfortunately, current science does not adequately support a robust analysis of multiple chemical exposures and their interactions. Debate continues in the scientific community about the best methods by which to evaluate exposure to a chemical mixture both from a single pathway and from multiple, combined pathways. In addition, estimating combined doses from multiple pathways at Vieques is hampered by a lack of knowledge of the levels of chemicals residents are exposed to th rough various pathways (e.g., eating seafood, ingesting soil, drinking water, and breathing air). Because of this complexity and lack of knowledge, any additional risk from any possible, so-called mixtures effect assumed by residents eating seafood is likewise uncertain. Page 38 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 2.3 Conclusions and Recommendations 2.3.1 Conclusions D !D , 2009 meeting, several scientists raised concerns about mercury levels in fish. !D 2003 F ! the 2004 U.S.EPA/FDA national advisory concerning mercury. Therefore, ATSDR reviewed its 2003 conclusions and recommendations about mercury in fish from reefs surrounding Vieques. In its 2003 public health assessment regarding fish consumption, ATSDR used fish intake rates that focused on adults who ate 8 ounces of fish daily and who weighed 70 kg (or 154 pounds). Daily fish intakes rates for children were 4 ounces and children were assumed to weigh 16 kg (or 35 pounds). E !D 03 \u00b5 analysis of the Seychelles Island and Faroe Islands !D report, ATSDR used a broad range of daily fish intakes and body weights. Using information from U.S.EPA E F !D s for adult women were as high as 14 ounces the 99th percentile and that women weigh as little as 46 kg (or 100 pounds). For children, ATSDR assumed that daily fish intakes were as high as 6 ounces for 1- to 2-year old children, 8 ounces for 3- to 5-year old children, 10 ounces for 6- to 14-year old children, and 20 ounces for 15- to 18-year old children. The highest intakes for children represent the 99th percentile portion size for the !D ! U.S.EPA D D concerning mercury as well as human toxicity studies from the Faroe Islands. From its evaluation of mercury in Vieques fish, ATSDR reached these new conclusions: 1. ATSDR has identified mercury exposure from frequent consumption of marine seafood as a potential public health hazard . Women with a varied fish diet who typically eat more than 2 oz of fish every day have estimated mercury doses that exceed U.S.EPA D ! size increases, the estimated doses approach the lowest level known to cause harmful effects to the developing fetus . ATSDR concludes that if these women are pregnant, their developing baby has a small increased risk of neurological effects later in life. The risk of harmful effects increases as portion size increases. Possible harmful effects identified from studies of non-Viequense children exposed in utero involve language, attention, and memory, and to a lesser extent visual/spatial and motor functions. 2. Women who eat grunt or hind more frequently than other reef fish and who typically eat more than 2 oz of fish every day have estimated mercury doses two times higher than women who eat a varied fish diet. As portion size increases, the estimated doses approach or exceed the lowest level known to cause harmful effects in the developing fetus. ATSDR concludes that if these women are pregnant, their developing baby has a small increased risk of neurological effects later in life. The risk of harmful effects increases as portion size increases. Possible harmful effects identified from studies of non-Viequense children exposed in utero involve language, attention, and memory, and to a lesser extent visual/spatial and motor functions. 3. Children with a varied fish diet who typically eat more than 0.5 oz of fish every day have estimated mercury doses that exceed U.S.EPA D Page 39 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 neurological effects. But as portion size increases, the risk of harmful effects increases. Depending upon their age, children as young as 1 year who eat 3 to 4 ounces of fish every day have estimated doses that exceed doses known to cause neurological effects and have the greatest risk of harmful neurological effects. Possible harmful effects identified from studies of non-Viequense children exposed in utero involve language, attention, and memory, and to a lesser extent visual/spatial and motor functions. 4. Like women, children who eat grunt and hind more frequently than other reef fish have estimated doses two times higher than children who eat a varied fish diet. The estimated doses in these children exceed the doses associated with neurological effects. 5. tself somewhat uncertain. The uncertainty could be due to sex, genetics, health and nutritional status, or how mercury is handled in the body. In the three human studies that focused on mercury exposure from eating fish and seafood, the identification of the lowest-effect levels was uncertain. Estimating the mercury dose from eating reef fish was likewise uncertain, given that the dose could vary depending on the type, frequency, and quantity of fish eaten. 6. While ATSDR supports the U.S.EPA FD! s national fish advisory, portions of the advisory do not apply to the Viequenses who rely heavily on local seafood. For example, the advisory discusses fish that Viequenses do not eat, such as pollock, catfish, and tilefish. In addition, the advisory recommends that if a local advisory is not available, people should not eat more 6 ounces of local fish and should not consume any other fish during the week . We include links to the advisory for informational use and we recommend an educational program about mercury in locally consumed fish. 7. Residents need information so they can select local seafood lower in mercury over seafood higher in mercury. This will protect developing fetuses and young children from mercury in fish. For informational purposes only, the advisory and related information is available at: http:// www.epa.gov/waterscience/fish/advice ; http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodSafety/Product\u00ad S pecificInformation/Seafood/FoodbornePathogensContaminants/Methylmercury/ucm115662.h tm, and Chapter 2, Section 2 .7 of this report, Appendix 2A- 3. 8. For the 104 fish samples collected from the marine areas near Vieques and from the commercial fish market, the average mercury level was 0.1 ppm and the range was nondetectable to 0.33 ppm. The mercury levels detected in Vieques reef fish are similar to levels reported by the FDA (FDA 2010). The mercury levels are in the low (0.02 0.2 ppm) to mid (0.2 0.6 ppm) mercury range identified by FDA in its recent risk and benefit assessment (FDA 2009). 9. ATSDR also conducted a statistical analysis of the 2001 fish data and concluded the following: a. Mercury detected in the seafood is higher in two fish families (grunt and hind) compared with other families sampled (e.g., parrotfish and snapper). The average mercury concentration in grunt and hind was higher than U.S.EPA 0049 ppm screening level. In testing some of the hypotheses, ATSDR used the overall average of 0.1 ppm to determine which families of reef fish were likely to exceed the overall average. Page 40 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 b. Mercury levels in parrotfish were statistically lower than U.S.EPA 0049 -ppm screening level and lower than the 0.1-ppm overall average. c. All snapper were lower than U.S.EPA 0049 \u0011 number of snapper were collected to determine whether the average snapper-mercury level was statistically different from the U.S.EPA 0.049 ppm screening level. A sufficient number of snapper were collected to determine that the average mercury level is statistically lower than the 0.1-ppm overall average. 10. Mercury is present in most seafood and is particularly high in some fish species and low in other species. While mercury was a component of the detonators of some bombs, only small amounts of mercury were introduced to the Vieques environment from this source. This conclusion is supported by the low mercury levels in LIA soils, which appear to be at naturally occurring levels. Mercury levels in fish in and around the LIA are most likely the result of the global reservoir of mercury circulating in the environment. 11. Statistical analysis showed that some fish and shellfish from certain reefs surrounding Vieques had higher levels of some metals and lower levels of other metals iron, aluminum, copper, zinc, arsenic, barium, potassium and selenium were all slightly higher compared to other reefs surrounding Vieques. These metals are materials found in bombs and in metal ships, suggesting possible localized contamination. But the levels were only slightly higher and the difference was statistically significant only for some reefs compared with other reefs surrounding Vieques. 2.3.2 Recommendations ATSDR recommends environmental and public health agencies and scientists consider the following: 1. People who frequently consume marine seafood should follow available fish advisories and fishing restrictions in Vieques. Maintain the fishing restrictions in the waters adjacent to the LIA. 2. Conduct a survey of Vieques residents to determine the types, frequency, and quantity of fish consumed. 3. Conduct additional risk assessments and statistical analyses using new information gathered from the previously recommended fish consumption survey. 4. Collect and analyze additional fish samples from Vieques should the proposed survey and statistical analysis not provide sufficient public health information. Collect sufficient fish samples to allow analysis by species and by location. 5. Develop an educational program about mercury in fish that incorporates local habits and \u0011 with maternal intake of nutrients in seafood (FDA 2009) that can outweigh the concomitant intake of small amounts of mercury. The goal of this site-specific educational program should be to educate Viequenses about the benefits of eating seafood so they can choose fish lower in mercury and still maintain their healthy dietary customs of consuming local seafood.

The strengths of the 2001 sampling supported by ATSDR were It repeated the analysis of metals in market fish conducted by the Universidad Metropolitana, School of Environmental Matters (Caro et al. 2000). It provided previously unavailable, specific information about fish. Such information includ ed measurements of explosive compounds in fish, measurements of contaminants in fish captured on specific reefs around the island (including reefs with visible signs of military presence), and measurements of contaminants in shellfish captured on and around the island. The limitations were By collecting only larger specimens of the popular reef species, the average concentrations might have been biased high, which might have resulted in a mercury overestimate. Because larger fish were targeted and the reefs had only a few larger species, fish within the same family had to be combined to provide statistical significance. Consequently, these data could not establish differences in concentration between most species within a family. Fish within a family were grouped to provide sufficient number to represent each family at a sampling location. Although this was adequate to represent the concentrations of most metals in the families, more appropriate ways to address mercury were available. We determined that mercury concentrations were highly dependent on species within a family . For example, white grunt had lower mercury concentrations than the rest of the fish in the grunt family, and red hind had lower mercury concentrations than others in the hind family. 2.5.2 Sample D esign The original sample design did not focus only on mercury, but mercury was included. ATSDR and U.S.EPA proposed a sampling strategy to 1) evaluate many metals and explosive chemicals in fish , and 2) compare chemicals in fish caught in the various reefs with fish purchased at the market ( USEPA 2001). From each location, the specimens collected were approximately the same size. The School of Environmental Matters collected 52 fish of varying sizes, with little variation in results. Each of these datasets provided unique and meaningful information about mercury and other metals. Statistical tests confirmed sufficient fish for numerous evaluations. U.S.EPA provided statistical tests to compare fish by location and by family for all metals (USEPA 2001), and ATSDR provided statistics to compare fish family with health-related concentrations for mercury. A summary !D provided below. Page 47 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 2.5.3 Summary of Statistics for Health-Related Hypothesis Testing Hypothesis tests were designed to determine whether mean mercury concentrations were above or below 0.1 ppm and above or below 0.049 ppm. Figure 2A-1 of total mercury in fish by family illustrates many of the results of the statistical tests. Figure 2A-1. Total mercury in fish by family Blue squares represent concentrations for individual fillet s ample. The horizontal dotted line at 0.049 ppm (close to the 0.05 label) connotes the EPA screening value for subsistence populations and the horizontal dotted line at 0.1 ppm connotes the site-specific mean methylmercury level in Viequenses fish calculated !D 2001 data. Total Mercury Concentrations in Various Species 0.000.050.100.150.200.250.300.35 Fiddler LandCrabConchLobsterTrunkfishParrotSnapper GoatfishHindGruntConcentration (mg/kg-wet) A statistical analysis of the data supports the following conclusions: 1. Most of the goatfish, hind, and grunt had total mercury concentrations above the U.S. EPA screening level of 0.049 ppm ; a. The mean goatfish concentration of 0.0797 ppm was statistically higher than 0.049 ppm ; b. The mean hind concentration of 0.116 ppm was statistically higher than 0.049 ppm ; c. The mean grunt concentration of 0.185 ppm was statistically higher than 0.049 ppm ; 2. Many of the hind and grunt had total mercury concentrations above the average level of mercury measured in all Viequense fish analyzed for this report, 0.1 ppm . a. But the mean hind concentration of 0.116 ppm was not statistically different than 0.1 ppm ; b. Follow-up review of the species shows that red hind are lower (with a mean concentration of 0.091 ppmalso not statistically different from 0.1 ppm ) c. The mean grunt concentration of 0.185 ppm was statistically higher than 0.1 ppm ; d. Follow-up review of the species shows that Bluestriped grunt and French grunt were higher with mean concentrations of 0.22 ppm (each) and that white grunt averaged 0.098 ppm (therefore, white grunt were not statistically different from 0.1 ppm ) Page 48 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 3. Many of the snapper and goatfish had total mercury levels in the range between the two levels (i.e., 0.049 ppm and 0.1 ppm) : a. The snapper concentration of 0.0478 ppm was not statistically different from 0.049 ppm , but was statistically lower than 0.1 ppm ; b. The mean goatfish concentration of 0.0797 ppm was statistically higher than 0.049, but not statistically different from 0.1 ppm ; 4. The remaining fish families had total mercury levels below the 0.049 ppm level (many of those results were statistically significant): a. The mean lobster concentration of 0.0317 ppm was statistically lower than 0.049 ppm . b. The highest mercury concentration in 25 parrotfish was 0.0231 ppm , less than half of the 0.049 ppm screening level. Because mercury was not detected in most samples, the concentrations were not normally distributed; we therefore performed nonparametric tests using the median. The median of 0.00767 ppm has 95% confidence limits of 0.00747 and 0.00801 coverage of 95.7%, lower than 0.049 ppm . c. The highest mercury concentration in 11 composite land crab samples was 0.0287 ppm less than the 0.049- ppm screening level. The concentrations were not normally distributed; mercury was not detected in many samples. We therefore identified that the median 0.00823 ppm (with its 95% confidence limits of 0.00725 and 0.0216 ppm and 96.1% coverage) was lower than 0 .049 ppm. d. The highest mercury concentration in 20 conch was 0.0486 ppm , lower than 0.049 ppm . The conch concentrations were not normally distributed mercury was not detected in many samples. We therefore found that the median 0.008277 ppm (with its 95% confidence limits of 0.00803 and and 95.9% coverage) was well below 0.049 ppm . e. Four composite fiddler crab samples were normally distributed, with a mean concentration of 0.0077 ppm statistically lower than 0.049 ppm . We had only one trunkfish sample insufficient for statistical analysis. 2.5.4 Testing Limitations Testing of the thresholds had a high bias: larger fish were used, and total mercury was used to represent methylmercury. More samples in some locations would provide stronger results. But to collect enough samples for the test levels chosen (0.049 and 0.1 ppm ) could be cost prohibitive, as some families had averages very close to those levels . 2.5.4.1 Summary of Statistics for Location Testing Statistical analyses were conducted on the mercury (and other metals) levels in fish and invertebrate tissues to determine whether the locations were statistically different (USEPA 2001). Tissue from hind, Page 49 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 grunts, parrotfish, snappers, conch, and land crabs were included in the analyses. Because of the limi ted numbers collected at most sampling locations, fiddler crabs, goatfish, and lobster were not tested. The mercury statistical test found high influence of species and size . Even with these influences, the range of concentrations within families was relatively small . Thus any differences by location are hard to determine . Because the range of mercury concentrations was small and the influence of species and size was large, we cannot predict the number of samples needed to determine any differences between the levels found in the fish at each location. Further statistical tests are provided below. 2.5.5 Results of the Tests (Mercury focus) A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was computed for mercury (and other metals). Individual analysis of variance (ANOVA) results indicated a statistical significance between several metals at several locations . For mercury, U.S. EPA found statistically lower levels of mercury near the LIA compared with some other locations . We later found, however, that the significance was due to differences between species within the groups. Table C1 in Appendix C of U.S.EPA (2001) includes a complete summary of all comparisons between locations, parametric and nonparametric, for all families. The following is an abbreviated list of the summary of the mercury statistic tests provided by U.S.EPA in Appendix C of U.S.EPA (2001): Hind: A MANOVA was computed for mercury. Individual ANOVA results indicated a statistical significance between locations for other metals, but not for mercury. The statistical reports for U.S.EPA (2001) p C3.1. Grunt: A MANOVA was computed for mercury. Individual ANOVA results indicated a statistical significance between locations for some metals, but not for mercury. Snapper: A MANOVA was computed for mercury. Individual ANOVA results indicated a statistical significance between locations for some metals, but not for mercury. Parrotfish: Kruskal- difference (p<0.05) for mercury in comparisons between locations. Conch: Mercury at Esperan za was higher than the LIA North, LIA South, and the West End. Kruskal- <005 on the ranks resulted in two distinct patterns for mercury: LIA-North (1), LIA-South (2), and the West End (6) were grouped together; Esperanza (3) was grouped separately. Land Crabs: Because more than 50% of mercury results were below the detection level, the y were evaluated using nonparametric methods. Nonparametric testing indicated no significant difference between mercury levels at the locations. Page 50 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 Table C1 from U.S.EPA 's report ( USEPA 2001) for locations 1 through 6. 2.5.6 Testing Limitations Because of peer-review comments, we performed additional tests. Because the grunt family averaged higher than 0.1 ppm, we tested to determine whether all grunt species were higher. Four French grunt were caught near the west end and nowhere else; all were over 0.1, with the lowest sample having 0.14 ppm and the 95% confidence interval being 0.13 ppm. These French grunt were much smaller than the other species of grunts. French grunt, even at full size, are small and tend to forage more near sand than near grasses at night when they leave the reef, resulting in different exposures from other grunt. Because French grunt had relatively high mercury levels for their size, they introduce a bias into the grunt family. This reduced our ability to compare all grunt at all reefs . Bluestriped grunt were caught at three reefs, North LIA, South LIA, and Esperanza, with similar averages (between 0.21-0.24 ppm) . Furthermore, White grunt were statistically lower than Bluestriped grunt and French grunt. The market Page 51 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 only had white grunt for the investigation. We found no statistical difference between the Bluestriped grunt at the two LIA locations compared with those caught at Esperanza. In Chapter 2, Section 2.2.2 we discussed the hind family as one case where it appeared that a location (location 1) had different (in this case lower) concentrations than other locations. We also mentioned additional statistical tests to determine other reasons for location 1 having lower levels. Looking into this family, we want to compare other species factors and to determine whether weight could have influenced the results. We had sufficient samples within the hind family only to evaluate further the red hind and the rock hind. The red hind from the market, from Isabel Segunda, and from the North LIA averaged less than the rock hind from Esperanza and the South LIA (from Table 2-5). The three rock hind from the west end had the lowest average mercury levels for that species (0.057 ppm). Rock hind were found at two reefs, South LIA (averaging 0.13 ppm) and Esperanza (averaging 0.16 ppm). After accounting for species differences, we can determine whether weight influences the concentration by looking at concentrations within one species. Figure 2A-2 is a scatterplot of all the rock hind weights compared with their mercury concentrations. Figures 2A-2a and 2A-2b. Weight (in oz) vs. mercury concentration (ppm) 35 Rock Hind 35 Red Hind 30 30 25 25 20 20 15 15 10 10 5 5 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0 0.02 0.07 0.12 0.17 The graphs suggest a relationship between fish size and mercury concentration. This w as not evident in the fish Caro collected. Because ATSDR intentionally selected larger fish, the size variation is i nsufficient to make this c omparison for all fish. From the mercury tests, we concluded that only conch showed statistical differences by location. Those differences w ere that conch on the LIA-North, the LIA-South, and the West End had statistically less mercury than the conch collected in Esperanza. Even the Esperanza conch, however, were below screening levels.

A long-term human study of children from the Faroe Islands, a small group of islands in the North Atlantic Ocean affiliated with Denmark, began in 1986 and focused on children born to women who lived on the islands. This population relies heavily on seafood and whales as a protein source. The investigators used various tests that monitor child development. They concluded that at birth, cord blood mercury levels in the mother were associated with harmful effects in children at age 7 years involving language, attention , and memory, and to a lesser extent visual/spatial and motor functions (Grandjean et al. 1997). Follow-up studies at age 14 years showed similar findings (Debes et al. 2006). In 1978, New Zealand was the site of another human study. It focused on 61 children who were exposed in utero a week. If the authors omitted on 6 mercury levels at birth (Crump 1998). The third study came from the Republic of Seychelles, where 85% of the population relied on local seafood for protein. Average ocean fish consumption in this population was 12 meals a week (Davidson 1998). The Seychelles study initially did not find harmful effects in children as they grew older. In one recent publication, the investigators reported that two of 21 endpoints (one positive and one negative) were associated with prenatal methylmercury exposure. The authors stated that these outcomes were probably due to chance. They concluded that their data d id not support a neurodevelopment risk from prenatal methylmercury exposure from eating fish (Myers 2003). In another paper, the authors reported that they found several associations between postnatal ints. However, the investigators concluded that no consistent pattern of associations emerged to support a causal relationship (Myers 2009). In some cases in which several tests were used to evaluate a single domain, and only one of those tests was positive, the Seychelles investigators did not believe they could base a firm conclusion on only one of several tests for that domain. Rather, they believed that if a domain was adversely affected, more than one test should show it (Risher 2010). More informatio !D Profile for Mercury (ATSDR 1999). U.S.EPA developed a methylmercury Reference Dose using a mathematical model that estimated a 5% adverse response in children for neurological effects. 16 Using the Faroe Islands study, U.S.EPA concluded that the methylmercury concentration in maternal cord blood that caused a 5% adverse response in children ranged from 46 to 79 ppb. This methylmercury concentration in maternal blood equated to a range of 0.8 to 1.5 \u00b5g methylmercury per kilogram per day (\u00b5g /kg/day) as a dietary intake. The doses were divided by an uncertainty factor of 10 to arrive at the Reference Dose of 0.1 \u00b5g/kg/day. The U.S.EPA National Academy of Sciences . The NAS recommended that U.S.EPA use the Faroe Islands Study and 58 ppb methylmercury in cord blood for 16 thMore precisely, U.S.EPA estimated the lower 95 confidence limit of the concentration of methylmercury in maternal blood that gave a 5% response for neurological effects in offspring at 7 years of age.

U.S.EPA D in detail at http:// www.epa.gov/iris/subst/0073.htm ( USEPA 2012 ). The National Academy of Sciences concluded that some risk is possible regarding anticipated harmful effects in children exposed in utero to 58 ppb methylmercury in cord blood. The cord blood concentration of 58 ppb methylmercury equates to 12 ppm methylmercury in maternal hair (NRC 2000 ).

The Joint U.S.EPA and FDA National Fish Advisory What You Need to Know About Mercury in Fish and Shellfish , March 2004: 2004 EPA and FDA Advice for Women Who Might Become Pregnant, Women Who Are Pregnant, Nursing Mothers, and Young Children Fish and shellfish are an important part of a healthy diet. Fish and shellfish contain high -quality protein and other essential nutrients, are low in saturated fat, and contain omega-3 fatty acids. A well-balanced diet that includes a variety of fish and shellfish can contribute to heart health and children's proper growth and development. So, women and young children in particular should include fish or shellfish in their diets due to the many nutritional benefits. However, nearly all fish and shellfish contain traces of mercury. For most people, the risk from mercury by eating fish and shellfish is not a health concern. Yet, some fish and shellfish contain higher levels of mercury that may harm an unborn baby or young child's developing nervous system. The risks from mercury in fish and shellfish depend on the amount of fish and shellfish eaten and the levels of mercury in the fish and shellfish. Therefore, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are advising women who may become pregnant, pregnant women, nursing mothers, and young children to avoid some types of fish and eat fish and shellfish that are lower in mercury. By following these three recommendations for selecting and eating fish or shellfish, women and young children will receive the benefits of eating fish and shellfish and be confident that they have reduced their exposure to the harmful effects of mercury. 1. Do not eat shark, swordfish, king mackerel, or tilefish because they contain high levels of mercury. 2. Eat up to 12 ounces (2 average meals) a week of a variety of fish and shellfish that are lower in mercury. a. Five of the most commonly eaten fish that are low in mercury are shrimp, canned light tuna, salmon, pollock, and catfish. b. Another commonly eaten fish, albacore (\"white\") tuna has more mercury than canned light tuna. So, when choosing your two meals of fish and shellfish, you may eat up to 6 ounces (one average meal) of albacore tuna per week. 3. Check local advisories about the safety of fish caught by family and friends in your local lakes, rivers, and coastal areas. If no advice is available, eat up to 6 ounces (one average meal) per week of fish you catch from local waters, but do not consume any other fish during that week. Follow these same recommendations when feeding fish and shellfish to your young child, but serve smaller portions.

Biomonitoring ........................................................................................................................... 93 Chapter 3 Summary The following chapter describes and evaluates the available biomonitoring studies of Vieques residents. These studies were conducted since 1999 by Puerto Rican scientists and physicians or by the \u0006ommonwealth's \u0007epartment of ealth . They consist of measurement of various metals in residents' blood, urine, hair, or feces. Data from these studies reported elevated levels of some metals in residents' blood, urine, or hair. While some of these elevated levels might be explained by cigarette use, seafood consumption, or hair dyes, they did not account for all the elevated levels. These studies were unab le to investigate each person's environment to identify the metals' source for those residents who had excessive levels in hair, urine, or blood. The PRDOH study came closest to identifying possible sources but acknowledges an inability to identify the source or sources for all residents with excessive metals exposure . Page 57 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 Viequenses may be exposed to mercury in fish and cadmium in pigeon peas. These exposures may warrant additional environmental investigations, such as sampling locally grown produce for cadmium and gathering more information about fish consumption and possibly mercury in fish. The information could be used to decide whether to undertake human testing for mercury and cadmium in blood or urine. If other environmental exposures are identified, additional human biomonitoring investigations may be considered . More detailed information about !TSDR's recommendations concerning fish and locally grown produce can be found in Chapter 2, Section 2.3.2 and Chapter 5, Section 5.3.2, respectively. ATSDR is not recommending a comprehensive, systematic biomonitoring effort at this time because we found little evidence of current exposure to contaminants from past military activities. Many chemicals are short-lived in the human body and thus cannot be measured through a biomonitoring program if the exposure occurred some time ago. Public health officials could consider a targeted human biomonitoring investigation following the release of this report, for example, by testing for excessive mercury exposure from eating fish. If a biomonitoring investigation is conducted, it should include a comparison group from mainland Puer to Rico. If requested, CDC/ATSDR subject matter experts will provide technical assistance and support to public health officials or scientists in planning and conducting such an investigation. Viequenses who remain concerned about exposure to mercury, cadmium, other metals, or metalloids should consult their healthcare provider to discuss the need for and cost of testing . A qualified laboratory should do the testing and analysis . CDC/ATSDR can provide a list of qualified laboratories that can perform the tests. A nd if requested , CDC/ATSDR can provide information to healthcare providers about tests for metals in biologic samples. 3.1 Introduction to Biomonitoring Biomonitoring is the measurement of metals or chemicals in a biological matrix such as blood, urine, or hair. It can sometimes be a useful method of evaluating environmental chemical exposure in people. Biomonitoring examples include measuring lead in blood, cadmium in urine, and mercury in hair. The concentration of environmental chemicals in a biological matrix may allow assessment of excessive exposure. In some cases, the levels of environmental chemicals could be predictive of the risk of harmful effects occurring in the population . Depending on the chemical, biomonitoring studies can provide insight into a exposure over the previous days, weeks or months, or even years . Scientists usually use biomonitoring to assess populations at risk for exposure (e.g., average exposures or the prevalence of unusually high exposures). Less often, biomonitoring can be useful in assessing the exposure of a single person. But like all exposure assessments, biomonitoring has limitations and requirements. These fall into five categories: Many chemicals are not measureable with current technology . Measurements require defined precision and accuracy to be applicable . Proper timing and collection techniques are required. In fact, they are essential to interpretation , appropriate comparison, or identification of reference groups . Page 58 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 Although biomonitoring can assist in exposure assessment, the toxicological significance of biomonitoring results is sometimes not possible to ascertain. Biomonitoring results from Vieques can be compared with national data, such as the Fourth National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals (CDC 2009). But more appropriate comparisons should include comparison with biomonitoring data from residents of the main island of Puerto Rico. These limitations are described in more detail later in this chapter. 3.2 Assessment of Available Vieques Human Biomonitoring Studies Data Because !D sessments did not review biomonitoring data from Vieques, this chapter and its appendices describe the biomonitoring data in detail. Because of confidentiality issues, ATSDR does not have access to individual results. Thus our evaluation relies on information reported by the investigators. The important fact is, however, that biomonitoring data available for Viequenses cannot be used to determine whether residents of Vieques were exposed to past, military exercise-related constituents . Since 1999, either the Puerto Rico Department of Health or Puerto Rican scientists and doctors have conducted several human biomonitoring studies in Vieques. These studies have focused on measuring metals in hair, urine, blood, or stool samples . They are listed in Table 3-1 2006; Rodr\u00edguez Sierra 2009). Highlights are provided here. The studies are described in more detail in Appendix 3- A. Dr. Carmen Col\u00f3n de Jorge conducted one of the first studies. She analyzed hair samples from 30 residents with preexisting health conditions and analyzed seven stool samples for metals. At about the D \u0012 200 various metals. The doctors concluded their data showed Viequenses had heavy metal exposure and that the exposure had resulted in harmful health effects (Col\u00f3n de Jorge; Ortiz Roque 2002, 2004). Dr. Col\u00f3n de Jorge reported numerous metals in hair. That report stated that based on the ranges D D \u0012 30 D Data. Dr. Col\u00f3n de Jorge noted that in about 70% of the 30 tested residents, arsenic and antimony in D \u0012 stated that because antimony levels in bombs are high, the antimony exceedences proved residents were exposed to metals from munitions. The report, however, did not explain how residents could have been exposed to antimony or to other metals.

Unpublished manuscript, no date Dr. Carlos Rodr\u00edguez Sierra Webcast, October 30, 2009, New look at the opening of the case of Vieques, www. telecoqu i.net Most commercial laboratories that report results will develop their own reference range for what they consider normal or typical concentrations of a chemical in a biological matrix. But such ranges can vary with the populations tested. Inevitably, exposures will vary from population to population based on factors such as age, sex, race/ethnicity, and underlying health conditions. Laboratories will sometimes develop a concentration that they consider above the expected range or that they sometimes even consider toxic. Often for these ranges (and, if reported, for the toxic levels) the basis is the own cumulative experience from many years of laboratory testing. Such reference ranges or identified toxic levels are not regulated by the government nor are they approved by a medical or scientific organization. Dr. Ortiz Roque identified several residents with hair-mercury levels above 12 ppm the level the National Research Council identified as causing a 5% increase in abnormal results on a neurocognitive test (i.e., the Boston Naming test) for children who were exposed in utero (NRC 2000). D consumption (Ortiz Roque 2002, 2004); b ut, the patients in this investigation were not randomly selected. T hus, D mercury levels above 12 ppm is an important finding. A major limitation of hair analysis in a free-living population is the difficulty in discerning whether the metal was internally deposited from the blood stream or externally deposited from the air or the use of products on the hair. While hair measurements for mercury have been used in previous population studies, efforts to understand or control external deposition are usually investigated. From 2006 to 2008, Dr. Carlos Rodr\u00edguez Sierra collected hair, nail, and urine samples from 52 Viequense adults. He divided the study subjects into high and low fish-consumption groups . This division is necessary because persons who eat fish regularly will have high levels of urinary arsenic. This arsenic is predominantly arsenobetaine a nontoxic arsenic form. An October 30, 2009 Webcast sponsored by Page 60 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 Casa Pueblo de Adjuntas carried a report that high levels of arsenic in hair, nails, and urine were not detected at the time of sampling. Hair and nail sample levels were below 1-\u00b5g/g (microgram per gram) , which Dr. Rodr\u00edguez Sierra used as a reference value (Rodr\u00edguez Sierra C. 2009). The Webcast further reported that the sum of inorganic arsenic species and their metabolites in urine was less than 50 \u00b5g/g creatinine, which Dr. Rodr\u00edguez Sierra also used as a reference value. This value likely comes from occupational exposure studies; they might have used the value to assess excessive exposure to arsenic (ACGIH 2000; WHO 2001). The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygiene (ACGIH) currently recommends 35 \u00b5g/g creatinine as an action level of the sum of inorganic arsenic species and their metabolites for occupational testing (ATSDR 2007). Dr. Rodr\u00edguez Sierra reported that the median and 95 th percentile of total inorganic arsenic (As V, As III, DMA, MMA) respective levels reported in the 2003 2004 Fourth National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals.17 Dietary sources of inorganic arsenic include chicken as well as rice, particularly when rice is grown in arsenic-contaminated soils (Lasky et al . 2004; Potera 2007; Williams et al. 2007). Whether these slightly higher levels of inorganic arsenic in urine are associated with harmful effects, however, is impossible to determine . As a follow up to these studies, PRDOH conducted a comprehensive biomonitoring study in which it collected hair, urine, or blood samples from 500 randomly selected Viequenses. The results were shared with some of those who participated, but no public report was ever released (PRDOH 2006). In August 2009, ATSDR obtained a draft of the unpublished manuscript. ATSDR found that inappropriate units were used for some of the results, thus rendering some measurements uncertain. Nevertheless, the PRDOH manuscript report ed that in 20% of the participants, either aluminum, lead, or mercury in blood; uranium, cadmium, or nickel in urine; or nickel or arsenic in hair exceeded Quest Laborator reference range. 18 For some but not all of the elevated levels, the PRDOH manuscript identified as possible sources cigarettes, hair dyes, and seafood consumption. For other residents, the origin of high metal levels in urine, hair, and blood could not be identified. As mentioned previously, the elevated levels of metals (except mercury) in hair are difficult to interpret. Hair analysis leaves unanswered whether the metals were ingested and were bound to the hair from direct contact. Note also that the PRDOH manuscript stated that they did not test children 4 years and younger. All that said, however, Dr. Col\u00f3n D did support the conclusions in the PRDOH manuscript. 17 The ba \u0012D\u0012 F E E \u0012 an ongoing national survey that samples the U.S. population every 2 years.

Page 61 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 3.3 Strengths and Limitations of Human Biomonitoring for Vieques The use of biomonitoring results to assess public health issues requires consideration of biomonitoring previously enumerated strengths and limitations. Biomonitoring data will allow an investigator to look at markers of exposure and markers of effect. When toxicological information is available, markers of effect allow an investigator to determine whether harmful consequences might result from the measured level of a chemical or its metabolite. Extensive toxicologic data support current research on lead in blood, cadmium in urine, and mercury in hair. Once the concentration is known, health scientists can draw conclusions about the presence or absence of risk. For other metals in blood or urine, toxicological data and research are limited, thus reducing the ability to draw firm conclusions. For example, no human toxicity data are available for urine levels of antimony, beryllium, cesium, molybdenum, platinum, and tungsten. Thus while biomonitoring might identify populations with \u0012D\u0012 2009). But a particular biomonitoring strength is the availability of comparison data for a representative sample of the U.S. population. Those comparison data are in the National Reports on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals at http:// www.cdc.gov/exposurereport/ ( CDC 2009). National data are also available on mercury in hair (McDowell 2004). An important consideration when using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES) biomonitoring data is that differences in levels between populations (e.g., regional, cultural, and ethnic ) are likely due to differences in exposures, pharmacokinetics, and other factors . Thus U.S. population data can only be cautiously applied to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. If any future biomonitoring investigations are undertaken for the Vieques population, a comparison population from the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or another nearby island- based population may be more appropriate. To understand possible exposure sources, subjects with an elevated metal or chemical concentration should be subsequently investigated for attributable sources of exposure. 3.4 The Special Case of Hair Analysis for Metals and Other Elements 3.4.1 !TSDR's 2001 Hair Panel D !D , 2009 meeting with invited scientists, we were asked to reconsider the air. In 2001, ATSDR sponsored a workshop and invited researchers in the medical, environmental, and toxicological fields to advise the agency of the utility of measuring metals and organic chemicals in hair. The workshop panelists agreed on the following summary statement related to the overall usefulness of hair analysis in evaluating environmental exposures: For most substances, insufficient data currently exist that would allow the prediction of a health effect from the concentration of the substance in hair. The presence of a substance in hair may indicate exposure (both internal and external), but does not necessarily indicate the source of exposure (ATSDR 2001). Page 62 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 The panelists agreed that a relationship between contaminant concentrations in hair and any kind of measurable outcome provided external contamination could be ruled out have only been established for methylmercury and, to a limited extent, for arsenic (e.g., segmental analysis for forensic analysis). Unique forensic settings might be available for other substances (ATSDR 2001). The panelists identified several factors that limit interpretation of even the most accurate, reliable, and reproducible laboratory results. These include A lack of reference (or background) ranges in which to frame the interpretation of results. Difficulties in distinguishing endogenous (internal) from exogenous (external) contamination in hair. Some panelists thought the then-current literature suggested the absence of any reliable washing method capable of separating external contamination from internal element deposition. One potential remedy was that where possible, identifying metabolites or other unique markers of internal exposure for substances of interest would be most helpful in distinguishing internal and external contamination. A lack of understanding of how and to what extent environmental contaminants are incorporated into the hair. A lack of correlation between levels in hair and blood and other target tissues, as well as the lack of epidemiologic data linking substance-specific hair levels with adverse health effects. Little pertinent information is available for the study of environmentally relevant organic compounds in hair. The panel recommended taking advantage of what is known about hair analysis for testing for drugs of abuse (ATSDR 2001). 3.4.2 Current Status of Hair Analysis Validity ATSDR staff checked with several sources to determine the current validity of hair analysis. The American Medical Association (AMA) supports the conclusions of those panelists who participated in !D 2001 (AMA 2009). The German Federal Environment Agency (GFEA 2005) has a similar recommendation . One exception is carefully tested hair specimens for mercury. The NHANES survey includes mercury in hair from a national population for one 2-year period (1999 2000). Therefore, comparison of hair mercury levels with a national group is possible. This might help in identifying those with excessive mercury exposure. 3.5 Conclusions and Recommendations 3.5.1 Conclusions 1. Since 1999, Vieques has hosted at least five human biomonitoring investigations. Puerto Rican scientists, physicians, or the Puerto Rico Department of Health (PRDOH) conducted all of them. The PRDOH has conducted the most extensive sampling effort, collecting biological specimens from 500 randomly selected Viequenses. The PRDOH manuscript reported that in 20% of the participants, either Page 63 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 a. Aluminum, lead, or mercury in blood; b. Uranium, cadmium, or nickel in urine; or c. Nickel or arsenic in hair The PRDOH manuscript identified cigarette use and hair dyes, as well as the consumption of seafood, as possible sources for some but not all the elevated levels . The PRDOH manuscript acknowledged that for some residents, it could not identify the source of high metal levels in urine, hair, and blood. The PRDOH manuscript did not report mercury levels in hair. Results D residents had elevated levels of mercury in hair, and that the most likely source was fish consumption; other possible sources, however, were not completely ruled out. 2. Data from these studies showed that in blood, urine, hair, or feces, some residents of Vieques had elevated levels of various metals. While some of these elevated levels might be explained by cigarette use, seafood consumption, or hair dyes, they did not account for all the elevated levels. In particular, biomonitoring results from Dr. Ortiz Roque showed that some Viequenses had elevated mercury in hair above 12 ppm, the level identified by the NAS to cause harm in 5% of fetuses exposed in utero . Dr. Ortiz Roque also showed that mercury in hair was associated with fish consumption. In contrast, the PRDOH study did not find excessive mercury levels in blood, although the study either did not measure for or did not report mercury level in hair. Thus some uncertainty exists about the prevalence of high mercury levels in Viequenses. Except for mercury, metal content in hair is difficult to interpret. Metals can bind directly to hair from the use of commercial hair products, making difficult any distinction between internal metal exposure via ingestion and inhalation versus external exposure resulting from contact with the metal in the environment (e.g., shampoo, dyes, dirt). 3. These studies were unab le those who had excessive metals in hair, urine, or blood. The PRDOH study came closest to identifying possible sources (e.g., cigarette and hair dye use, seafood consumption) but acknowledged an inability to identify the source or sources for all residents with excessive metals exposure. Either through the survey instrument or through an in-home visit, it may be possible to identify other sources that increase metal exposure, such as cooking utensils, metal residues in foods (e.g., tea and vegetables), consumption of drinks with metallic packaging, religious rites using mercury-containing capsules, skin creams, antacid formulations and antiperspirant formulations. 4. ATSDR remains cautious in making decisions about using hair as an indicator of exposure to environmental contaminants and as an indicator of risk of harmful effects. A major problem in interpreting metal concentrations in hair is whether the metal content resulted from internal exposure (e.g., from ingestion or inhalation) or from external exposure (e.g., the hair coming in contact with a metal-containing product). Currently, no washing method is capable of removing exogenous metal contaminants while leaving endogenous metals undisturbed. Chemicals such as methylmercury, which originate generally from dietary sources, suffer less from this Page 64 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 drawback, provided unusual sources of inorganic mercury do not complicate the picture, (e.g., mercury vapor in occupational or home settings). 5. These biomonitoring results do not permit any conclusions about exposure to the bombing- related contaminants. 3.5.2 Recommendations 1. Viequenses may be exposed to mercury in fish and cadmium in pigeon peas . These exposures may warrant additional environmental investigations, such as sampling locally grown produce for cadmium and gathering more information about fish consumption and possibly mercury in fish. The information could be used to decide whether to undertake human testing for mercury and cadmium in blo od or urine . If other environmental exposures are identified, additional human biomonitoring investigations may be considered. More detailed information about !D \u0012 2, Section 2.3.2 and Chapter 5, Section 5.3.2, respectively. 2. ATSDR is not recommending a comprehensive, systematic biomonitoring effort at this time because we found little evidence of current exposure to contaminants from past military activities. Many chemicals are short-lived in the human body and thus cannot be measured through a biomonitoring program if the exposure occurred some time ago. Public health officials could consider a targeted human biomonitoring investigation following the release of this report, for example, by testing for excessive mercury exposure from eating fish. If a biomonitoring investigation is conducted, it should include a comparison group from mainland Puerto Rico. If requested, CDC/ATSDR subject matter experts will provide technical assistance and support to public health officials or scientists in planning and conducting such an investigation. 3. Viequenses who remain concerned about exposure to mercury, cadmium, other metals, or metalloids should consult their healthcare providers to discuss the need for and cost of testing. A qualified laboratory should do the testing and analysis. 4. CDC/ATSDR can provide a list of qualified laboratories that can perform the tests . If requested, CDC/ATSDR can provide information to healthcare providers about tests for metals in biologic samples. 3.6 References [ACGIH] 2000.

This study was !D consider. For this reason, the study is described in detail. In the first phase, the PRDOH manuscript reported interviewing 500 Vieques residents, collecting biological samples, and analyzing for the following: Arsenic, cadmium, and nickel in hair and urine, Aluminum, lead, and mercury in blood, and Uranium in urine. As stated in the PRDOH manuscript, the second phase involved collecting and analyzing blood samples from Phase 1 participants with metal concentrations deemed toxic according to the reference values provided by the analytical laboratory. Phase II was from December 2005 to March 2006. The PRDOH manuscript stated that the information obtained from the study would be used to determine the magnitude and scope of the problem, generate hypotheses and identify areas that warrant intervention from a public health perspective. The PRDOH report includes recommendations for follow-up activities. Page 69 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 3.7.2.1 PRDOH Study, Phase 1 Five hundred persons were randomly chosen from residents 5 years of age or older who lived in Vieques before 2000. The interview collected information about age, sex, residence history, smoking status, employment, water consumption and use, food preparation and consumption, medicines, hobbies, and chemicals/solvent use. In particular, information was collected about fish and shellfish consumption 3 days before the sample collection. To reduce external contamination from the environment, hair samples were collected from the pubic region or, if that was not possible, a 1-inch hair sample from the scalp was collected near the root. Table 3A-2 provides a summary of metal concentrations in blood, urine, and hair from Phase 1 . Note that comparing pubic hair results with scalp hair may not be appropriate. Page 70 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 Table 3A-2. PRDOH Phase 1 results of heavy metal a nalysis of Vieques residents. Note: The geometric means for some metals (e.g., uranium) in the study population appear to be the average of detectable concentrations . For other metals (e.g., mercury), nondetectable levels were replaced by zero while for other metals (e.g., aluminum), nondetectable levels were replaced by 1 \u00b5g/L . For cadmium, the report states that nondetect levels were replaced by a value but did not specify the value . The treatment of nondetects is very important when calculating means and comparing those means to either a reference or toxicity value or to a national average . Complicating the comparisons even further is that for some metals, the detection limit was high. When nondetectable levels are part of the database, the calculation of a geometric mean could be biased high or low depending upon what value was substituted for the nondetect . Therefore, caution is warranted when comparing these study population means to means from reference populations, who are likely to have handled nondetectable concentrations differently or had lower detection limits. For example, the NHANES means replace nondetectable concentrations with the detection limit divided by the square root of two. For some metals, the limitations of the detection limit are acknowledged in the PRDOH report.

For uranium, the average consists of just the six samples with detectable concentrations. A low percent detection indicates that many people had nondetectable levels, thus the mean of the detectable levels is uncertain 2 NHANES National Survey, 2003-2004. This 2-year period was chosen because Phase I of the PRDOH study was conducted in May 2004. 3 PRDOH 2006 report . Levels reported by Poison Line of Puerto Rico 4 PRDOH 2006 report, source not identified 5 Source = Quest Laboratories 6 Source = 1999-2002 NHANES 7 bmdl 05, Source = U.S.EPA (IRIS, Methylmercury) 8 The value 0.307 \u00b5g/L could not be confirmed from NHANES NA = not available Page | 73 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 Aluminum : The geometric mean blood aluminum was 17.6 \u00b5g/L (95% CI 17.02 18.34); Quest Laboratories reported, however, the detection limit for aluminum in blood was 10 \u00b5g/L . Because the PRDOH manuscript reported using 1 \u00b5g/L for 35 nondetectable levels, some uncertainty exists in the geometric mean of 17.6 \u00b5g/L . The PRDOH manuscript reported using a geometric mean for aluminum in blood in the United States of 1 to 4 \u00b5g/L, which was provided by the Poison Line of Puerto Rico. Twenty- two percent (109 persons) showed levels of 40 \u00b5g/L or greater of the reference range for a population. Two percent (10 persons) had levels greater than 60 \u00b5g/L, the 20 44 have aluminum levels above 40 \u00b5g/L than those 65 and older (PRR=4.99, p<0.05). Medicines and occupation were not identified as possible sources. Lead : The geometric mean blood lead level for all ages in the study population was 3.53 \u00b5g/dL compared with the geometric mean of 1.66 \u00b5g/dL from the 1999- 2000 NHANES survey (as reported in the PRDOH manuscript) and 1.42 \u00b5g/dL from the 2003-2004 NHANES survey. In addition, 16% (81/ 500) of participants (all ages) had blood lead levels greater than 5 \u00b5g/dL compared with 5% from NHANES. Older participants (46 64 years and 65+) were more likely to have levels greater than 5 \u00b5g/dL than were the youngest age group tested (5 to 19 years). Participants who worked with metals and with petroleum-derived products, and those lacking a water purification system were more likely to have elevated blood lead levels. For example, the following occupations or hobbies showed a high prevalence risk ratio for elevated blood lead levels: car/truck maintenance, electrical repair, metalwork, solvent use, petroleum product use, or metal use. Smokers and participants who consumed seafood within 3 days of the test showed a higher probability of elevated blood lead levels. The PRDOH manuscript stated, however, that smoking did not account for all participants with elevated blood lead levels. This conclusion is supported by the observation that the geometric mean of blood lead levels for nonsmokers was twice the national average . ATSDR agrees with this conclusion. Mercury : A comparison of average blood mercury levels in Vieques residents to other populations is not reliablethe detection limit for mercury in blood was too high (i.e., 5 \u00b5g/L). The NHANES survey finds the average blood mercury level for the U.S. population is 1 \u00b5g/L. But coastal populations have higher fish intake and a higher frequency of women with elevated blood mercury levels compared with the national average and inland areas. For example, 8% of women in coastal areas have blood mercury levels greater than 5.8 \u00b5g/L compared with 2% of women from inland areas (Mahaffey 2009). Interestingly, Mahaffey reported blood mercury levels by race/ethnicity as well: almost 16% of women whose ancestry is Asian, Native American, Pacific Islands, and the Caribbean Islands have blood mercury greater than 5.8 \u00b5g/L. The highest blood level detected in the PRDOH study was 13 \u00b5g/L. To provide perspective, U.S.EPA estimated a benchmark-dose, lower confidence limit of a 5% (BMDL 05) adverse response rate in fetal development. U.S.EPA identified the BMDL 05 cord blood mercury level in women to be between 46 79 \u00b5g/L (USEPA 20 12). U.S.EPA derived this range of blood mercury levels using human data from the Faroe Islands fish- methods (USEPA 20 12). U.S.EPA ! s ! Committee on the Toxicological Effects of Methymercury. Using a similar benchmark dose approach, the NAS identified the 5% adverse effect level (i.e., a benchmark dose, BMD) at 85 \u00b5g/L as a cord blood Page | 74 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 mercury level and estimated a 5% lower confidence limit of 58 \u00b5g/L (BMDL 05). NAS stated that corresponding values in hair result in a benchmark dose of 17 ppm and BMDL 05 of 12 ppm (NRC 2000). Arsenic : The PRDOH manuscript stated that the geometric mean for arsenic in urine was below what was expected (see Table 3A-2, 33.6 vs. 38.2 \u00b5g/L) . The report did not state the source of the reference levels . The geometric mean of the study population is higher than the geometric mean from the 2003\u00ad 2004 NHANES survey (33.6 vs. 8.3 \u00b5g/L . Total urine arsenic levels were above 50 \u00b5g/L in 25% of the participants (i.e., 117/473). The median age of participants with levels greater than 50 \u00b5g/L was 50 years (range = 5 to 90 years). The PRDOH manuscript stated that risk factors associated with elevated urine arsenic were the age groups 45 64 and over 65, smokers, seafood eaters, seafood consumption within 3 days of the test, regular contact with animals, and those who worked with metals. Still, the urine arsenic test did not distinguish between inorganic arsenic and organic arsenic. When people eat fish a few days before providing a urine sample, nonharmful organic arsenic arsenobetaine is often found in urine at high levels. Freshwater and saltwater fish contain the organic arsenicals, arsenobetaine, and to a much lesser extent , arsenocholine. Whenever total arsenic levels exceed 50 \u00b5g/L and people eat fish, the high levels of total arsenic are probably the result of measuring arsenobetaine and arsenocholine and thus do not indicate toxicity (Caldwell et al. 2009). Arsenobetaine and arsenocholine are excreted very quickly through the kidneys without being metabolized and are relatively nontoxic to humans. Some shellfish contain small amounts of inorganic arsenic in addition to organic arsenic; consequently, the arsenic levels reported in the PRDOH study are likely to be mostly organic arsenic with some inorganic arsenic The PRDOH report stated that 267 participants did not eat seafood and that 39 of these participants had urine total arsenic levels above 50 \u00b5g/L. This result points to another source of arsenic, or it points to dietary recall problems . Other dietary sources of arsenic in the human diet include chicken as well as rice, particularly when rice is grown in arsenic-contaminated soils (Lasky et al. 2004; Potera 2007; Williams et al. 2007). Uranium : Six of the 500 participants had detectable levels of uranium in urine. The geometric mean uranium level in urine in these six participants was 0.14 \u00b5g/L, which is greater than the 2003- 2004 NHANES geometric mean of 0.008 \u00b5g/L and the 95th percentile of 0.031 \u00b5g/L. All six participants are women, and five were not employed when interviewed. The median age was 57. No uranium levels exceeded Quest Laborator threshold level or toxic level . The source of uranium is unknown. Cadmium : The geometric-mean hair-cadmium level in the study population (n=429) was 0.14 ppm. The PRDOH report states that this value is similar to its reference value of less than 0.15 ppm. But the report does not identify the source of the reference value of less than 0.15 ppm. In any event, no participant exceeded Quest Laborator hair toxicity threshold of 3.4 ppm. The PRDOH report stated that the geometric mean cadmium level in urine in the study population was higher than the 1999-2000 NHANES geometric mean (0.43 vs. 0.31 \u00b5g/g) . Because of interference from molybdenum oxide, CDC has since corrected the 1999-2000 NHANES value . The corrected geometric mean from the 1999-2000 NHANES is 0.181 \u00b5g/g . 2003-2004 NHANES is 0.21 \u00b5g/g. Eleven participants had cadmium urine levels above 1.03 \u00b5g/g, the 95 th percentile from the Page | 75 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 1999-2000 NHANES (uncorrected for molybdenum oxide). Two participants showed urine cadmium 2 \u00b5 . ! 3 \u00b5 creatinine. The median age for participants with urine cadmium levels above 1.03 \u00b5g/g creatinine was 55. Smokers showed urine cadmium levels five times higher than did nonsmokers. Nickel 205 \u00b5 reference value (less than 2 \u00b5g/g creatinine) . The report does not identify the source of the reference value . Three participants (2 women and 1 man) had urine nickel levels that exceeded Quest threshold of 6.2 \u00b5g/g creatinine in women and 10.2 \u00b5g/g creatinine in men. No urine nickel levels exceeded the Quest Labor 100 \u00b5g/g- creatinine toxicity threshold. The geometric mean for hair-nickel levels in participants (0.64 ppm) was much greater than the reference level (0.39 ppm) reported in the PRDOH manuscript . The PRDOH manuscript did not identify the source of this reference level. Sixty-three participants had hair nickel levels exceeding the 2 -ppm threshold level. Of these, 80% were women. In addition, participants in age groups 519 and 20 44 showed higher levels than did persons over 65 years. Risk factors associated with higher nickel hair levels included dyed hair, colorants and pigments use, and solvent use. Most of the elevated nickel levels in hair were probably from external contact via hair treatment. 3.7.2.2 PRDOH Discussion of Phase 1 At the total population level, the average concentration of some metals was above expected norms as reference value) but the average concentrations for the population were not above toxic levels as also stated by Quest Laboratories. The PRDOH manuscript stated that this suggests the need for further investigation concerning the various risk factors, with particular emphasis on how smoking contributes to metal body burden. In addition, a better understanding is needed for how fish consumption affects metal body burdens, especially for arsenic and mercury. The PRDOH manuscript stated that eating fish within 3 days of a test or smoking could partly explain some but not all of the elevated metal body burdens in participants. The PRDOH manuscript stated that smoking was associated with lead in blood, and arsenic and cadmium in urine . In addition, seafood consumption was associated with mercury in blood, and arsenic in hair and urine. The PRDOH manuscript pointed out that the percentage of people with high metal levels who were neither exposed to tobacco smoke nor exposed from eating seafood was still greater than expected. For example, the PRDOH manuscript stated that 10% of nonsmokers had urine cadmium leve ls above 5 \u00b5g cadmium per gram creatinine where only 5% was expected . The PRDOH report did not clarify whether these nonsmokers lived with smokers. Using information from the survey, the PRDOH manuscript identified factors or sources that were associated with elevated metals . These factors or sources include age, sex, hair dyes , and years living on Vieques , and soil contact , as well as working with petroleum products, solvents, metals, or animals . Table 9 from the PRDOH manuscript provides information about the estimated number of residents with elevated levels of metals in blood, urine, or hair . The PRDOH manuscript stated the following: Being an adult between the ages of 20 to 65 was associated with higher aluminum levels in blood. Page | 76 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 Being an adult over age 61 and working with animals was associated with higher arsenic in urine. Working with petroleum products was associated with higher blood lead levels. \u0012 ted with higher cadmium in urine. Being a female; dying hair; using colorants, pigments, and solvents; and years living in Vieques was associated with higher nickel in hair. What follows is Table 9 from the PRDOH manuscript. Table 9 from Heavy Metal Prevalence Study, Vieques, 2004 The PRDOH manuscript stated that further research was needed to understand how metal body burden in Vieques residents compared with Puerto Rico. In addition, research was needed concerning the possible long-term effects of high body burdens of metals in some Viequens es. At the individual level, the PRDOH manuscript stated that according to Quest Laboratories, 15 persons showed toxic levels of metals: 10 had toxic levels of aluminum in the blood, Page | 77 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 Two had toxic levels of blood lead, Two had toxic levels of cadmium in the urine, and One had toxic levels of mercury in blood. Quest recommended follow-up tests and medical examinations for these persons and investigation of their environments for possible metals sources. It is not clear why the PRDOH manuscript did not include the 117 persons who had arsenic urine levels that exceeded 50 \u00b5g/L (see Table 3A-2). 3.7.3 PRDOH Study, Phase 2 In Phase 2, from December 2005 to March 2006, the PRDOH study undertook follow-up activities on 15 adults whose metal body burdens exceeded toxicity levels as identified by Quest Laboratories. Ten of 15 agreed to participate. Blood samples were collected and measured for aluminum (6 persons), arsenic (3 persons), lead (2 persons), and mercury (1 person) 19. Arsenic blood tests included inorganic arsenic. Why the PRDOH study did not test urinary cadmium in the two persons with elevated urinary cadmium in Phase 1 is not clear. W hy the PRDOH study did not measure speciated urinary arsenic in the 117 persons with elevated urinary arsenic in Phase 1 is similarly unclear. LabCorp conducted the tests and provided the reference levels. Of the six persons in Phase 1 with elevated aluminum in blood who agreed to retesting, none were elevated in Phase 2. Similarly, the one person with elevated blood mercury in Phase 1 was not elevated in Phase 2. Of the two participants from Phase 1 with elevated blood lead levels, one was elevated in Phase 2. The PRDOH manuscript stated that a follow-up investigation of the home environment for this person would take place. Table 3A-3 shows the results of Phase 2, although because of confidentiality issues, the PRDOH manuscript did not report the specific values. In addition to the 10 persons who participated in Phase 2 because they had high metal levels, the PRDOH manuscript included four additional residents who were not part of Phase I . These four residents volunteered for blood tests because they were interested in being tested . The PRDOH manuscript provides their results in the report but states that none showed levels considered potentially toxic. Note that the number of tests is 12 some persons were apparently tested for more than one metal.

The value of 50 \u00b5g/L appears to be a mistake as this level is often used for total urinary arsenic. 3.7.4 PRDOH Findings The PRDOH manuscript reported that the main findings of this study were In over 90% of the population, detectable levels were found of at least one heavy metal. In more than 20% of the study participants, the levels of aluminum in blood, arsenic in urine, or nickel in hair were over the laboratory reference threshold. Geometric means for uranium in urine, mercury in blood, lead in blood, aluminum in blood, nickel in hair, and cadmium in urine were significantly higher than the geometric means from the 1999 NHANES survey. But the geometric means for mercury and aluminum in blood reported in the PRDOH manuscript were unreliable because of the high detection limit reported by the laboratory. None of the identified geometric means were over the toxicity threshold identified by the reporting laboratory. Cigarette use, hair dye use, and seafood consumption were identified as risk factors for levels above the laboratory threshold for arsenic, cadmium, and nickel. Fifteen persons (3%) were identified with levels above the toxicity threshold for aluminum in blood (10 persons), lead in blood (2 persons), mercury in blood (1 person), and cadmium in urine (2 persons). In the follow-up study on 10 persons with metal body burdens that exceeded toxicity levels, only one person with levels above the toxicity threshold was identified. Fewer than 4% of the participants showed elevated metal levels associated with possible development of signs and symptoms related to acute exposure. Among the metals studied, levels of aluminum in blood, nickel in hair, and arsenic in urine were reported with the greatest frequency as over the laboratory detection reference threshold. But the test for ars enic Page | 79 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 measured total arsenic, which includes nontoxic forms of arsenic from eating seafood (i.e., arsenobetaine and arsenocholine). Multiple factors might account for these observations of elevated metals in blood, hair, and urine. For example, aluminum is abundant in soil worldwide. Average aluminum levels in LIA soils is 16,200 ppm compared with average aluminum in U.S. soils of 57,000 ppm. The absence of reference populations from Puerto Rico or information about aluminum levels in soils in Viequense residential areas limits interpretation of the aluminum results. The PRDOH manuscript also evaluated possible risk factors significant risk factors were in fact found. The PRDOH manuscript, however, points out that the study did not consider possible risk factors such as exposures from explosives, armaments, use of metal cooking utensils, metal residues that might be in foods such as tea and vegetables, consumption of drinks with metallic packaging, religious rites using mercury-containing capsules, skin creams, antacid formulations , and antiperspirants. In Phase 1, the PRDOH study measured total arsenic in urine, which consists of inorganic and organic arsenic. Because high levels of nontoxic organic arsenic are likely from seafood consumption, in Phase 2 the PRDOH study measured total and inorganic arsenic for the three persons who had elevated total arsenic in Phase 1. No evidence of inorganic arsenic was found. The PRDOH manuscript pointed out that hair arsenic levels in the study participants were similar to the national average. Nickel levels in urine in the study participants were similar to the national average. Sixty-three (63) persons had nickel levels in hair above the laboratory reference threshold. Hair dye, used by 27 of these 63 persons (43%), and the use of colorants and solvents were identified as risk factors and thus possible sources of the nickel in hair . The PRDOH manuscript information about internal (i.e., ingestion) exposure versus external contact with metals (except for mercury). In addition, nickel measurements in hair do not predict that exposure will produce adverse health effects. The PRDOH manuscript also said the geometric means for aluminum (blood), mercury (blood), lead (blood), uranium (urine), cadmium (urine), and nickel (hair) were higher than the national average (using NHANES and other reference sources); average levels, however, were not above toxicity levels cited by Quest Laboratories . The PRDOH manuscript identified three factors associated with increased arsenic, cadmium, and nickel in hair, urine, or blood: cigarettes , hair dye , and fish consumption. At the time of the study, seventy (15%) participants self-reported as smokers. Elevated lead levels were 4.75% more likely in smokers, who were also nearly two times as likely to have elevated levels of arsenic and nickel. The PRDOH manuscript added that the percentage of people with elevated levels of these metals who were not exposed to cigarette use or consumption of seafood was still higher than expected. The study design attempted to use a stratified random sample of Viequenses who would represent the \u0011 the PRDOH manuscript acknowledged the sample had a higher percentage of The PRDOH manuscript said this might have been due to interviews conducted during the day. Nevertheless, the PRDOH study may have underrepresented fishers and island residents who worked during the day. The PRDOH manuscript agreed that the difference between the study population characteristics and the island characteristics limited generalizations of the data to all island residents. Page | 80 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 The PRDOH manuscript also acknowledged that some of the tests failed to distinguish between the different forms of a metal. As mentioned previously, urine arsenic tests in Phase 1 failed to distinguish inorganic from organic arsenic. This also was the case for mercury. For uranium, laboratory tests failed to distinguish between natural uranium and depleted uranium. 3.7.5 PRDOH Actions Taken After Phase 1 and Phase 2 After completion of Phase 1, the following actions were taken: Dr. Luis Santiago gave a presentation of preliminary results to a group of about 15 Vieques community leaders. D clinic. Of the 500 participants, 182 collected their results. Dr. Braulio Jimenez, a toxicologist with the University of Puerto Rico, gave three talks in Vieques about the signs and symptoms associated with exposure to heavy metals. A Phase 2 sampling was conducted to follow up on residents with toxic levels of metals. A working group was formed to analyze the studies conducted by the health department. This group came up with the suggestions for continuity and follow-up activities listed here. 3.7.6 PRDOH's Suggested Follow-up Activities The PRDOH manuscript suggested follow up with People identified with toxic levels of heavy metals, People with possible acute exposure to heavy metals, People with possible chronic exposure to heavy metals, and High-risk groups. The PRDOH study used the CDC-provided recommendations to decide follow-up activities for the one remaining person with elevated blood lead levels after Phase 2 testing (CDC 1997; CDC 2002) . The PRDOH study offered additional urine arsenic tests for those people who had elevated total urine arsenic in Phase 1. The follow-up tests measured inorganic arsenic. Inorganic arsenic levels in urine were within the laboratory reference levels (PRDOH 2006). 3.7.6.1 Follow up for people with possible acute exposure to heavy metals The PRDOH manuscript stated that a protocol will be developed for the management of persons with suspected acute poisoning of heavy metals using CDC guidelines as a basis (CDC 1997; CDC 2002) . It should be noted that CDC guidelines apply only to lead. The protocol will contain 1) training of local health care providers, 2) ways to promote \u0012 3 use of the poison center to provide recommendations for managing acute exposure victims, and 4) referral of suspected cases to the Medical Center of Puerto Rico. Page | 81 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 3.7.6.2 Follow up for people with possible chronic exposure to heavy metals The PRDOH manuscript suggested establishing a voluntary health registry for Vieques residents. A health registry would 1) allow for systematic documentation of factors related to potential risks, 2) identify people with early signs and symptoms that may be associated with illness, and 3) facilitate early care and health service access needs. The registry would gather demographic information, risk history, family history, past illness history, present status, and history of signs and symptoms associated with the chronic heavy metal exposure. A health registry could also provide comprehensive medical evaluations that include physical examinations with, among other tests, neurological examination and laboratory tests, including tests for kidney function, liver function, and CBC. 3.7.6.3 Follow up with a monitoring program for children under 6 years of age Blood lead levels are unknown for the 1,000 Vieques children 6 years of age and younger a high-risk group more vulnerable to lead exposure than are adults. This initial evaluation proposed in the PRDOH manuscript will include all children 6 years of age and younger and will subsequently incorporate in future years an evaluation of children 1 and 2 years of age as part of their primary care. In 2006, when the report was written, the PRDOH manuscript stated that an epidemiologist would be appointed to work towards establishing this program, and this program will follow CDC guidelines for case management (PRDOH 2006). With funding from USEPA, PRDOH and CDC are currently conducting a prevalence study of blood lead levels in 1 to 5 year old children from mainland Puerto Rico . 3.7.7 Investigations by Dr. Carmen Ortiz Roque Dr. Carmen Ortiz Roque is a physician who has treated patients and conducted investigations on Vieques. In 2000, she began collecting hair samples from residents and had the samples analyzed for various metals. She has reported some of her results in unpublished manuscripts. In 2004 she published one peer-reviewed journal Ortiz Roque published the mercury data from her 2000/2001 hair study of Vieques residents (Ortiz Roque 2004). The study investigated hair mercury levels in women 16 to 49 years of age who lived on the island of Vieques and compared those levels with women from San Juan and Ceiba, Puerto Rico. Women with chemically treated hair within 3 months of the test were excluded. One of two licensed laboratories analyzed a 1.5-cm proximal hair sample. Dr. Ortiz Roque reported statistics on 41 Viequense women together with information about seafood consumption and compared these data with mainland Puerto Rico and with results from the 1999 NHANES survey in the United States. Table 3A-4 summarizes her data. Dr. Ortiz Roque used margin of exposure (MOE) to define unsafe exposure levels . The MOE approach used by Dr. Ortiz Roque came from a 2001 MMWR article and the National Research Council. The formula for MOE is 5% effect level for mercury in hair / 90th percentile value for mercury in hair in the study population.

The NRC recommended that the U.S.EPA derive their Reference Dose using a BMDL 05 of 58 ppb methylmercury in cord blood, which was identified as the 5% effect level using statistical models from the Faroe Islands study. The 58-ppb cord blood translates to 12 ppm in hair (NRC 2000). Therefore, the MOE = 12 ppm / 90th percentile mercury in hair. A MOE less than 1 means that for 10% of the study population the mercury level in hair is above the 5% effect level of 12 ppm, while an MOE greater than 1 means that for 90% of the study population the mercury level in hair is below the 5% effect level of 12 ppm (Ortiz Roque 2004; CDC 2001) . It is important to note that Dr. Ortiz Roque found three women with hair mercury levels greater than 12 ppm, the level identified by the NAS as an effect level for the developing fetus. Results showed that the 90 th percentile mercury hair concentration in Vieques women was 8.96 ppm compared with 1 ppm in women from Puerto Rico and 1.4 ppm in women from the United States. With a MOE of 1.3, Dr. Ortiz Roque concluded that because hair mercury levels were close to the 5% effect level of 12 ppm, some Viequense women of reproductive age were exposed to mercury concentrations unsafe to their developing fetus . While ATSDR agrees with this conclusion, it should be noted that the percentage of Viequenses women with hair mercury levels above 12 ppm is uncertain because of the small and bi D Dr. Ortiz Roque also has unpublished data showing other metal concentrations in hair of Vieques residents. These data are summarized in Chapter 2. 3.7.8 Summary of Dr. Ortiz Roque 2002 Unpublished Manuscript 3.7.8.1 Study Design Dr. Carmen Ortiz Roque collected hair samples from 203 Viequenses from January 2000 to July 2001 along with an extensive residential, occupational, nutritional, and health survey. Hair samples were analyzed for mercury, aluminum, cadmium, lead, and arsenic. The group consisted of 110 females and 93 males and ranged in age from 0.8 to 81 years. Participants were distributed among 18 neighborhoods on the island and were later informed of their individual hair results. Scalp hair samples were obt ained from most participants. However, when scalp hair was limited or not available or hair was treated chemically, pubic or chest hair was collected (Ortiz 2002). Note that comparing results from pubic hair or Page | 83 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 chest hair with scalp hair may not be appropriate . Hair analysis were conducted by either the Mayo Medical Laboratory (Rochester, MN) or the King James Medical Laboratory (Cleveland, OH) . 3.7.8.2 Hair Study Results Dr. Ortiz Roque reported the following results concerning metals in hair (Table 3A-5): Table 3A -5. Results of metal analysis of hair samples collected from Viequenses from January 2000 to July 2001. Metal (sample number) % elevated Average in ppm Overall (95% CI) Females Males Children <10 years old Mercury N= 205 33% > 1 ppm 2.07 (08.9) 8.07 (019.0) 4.28 (03.0) 0.141 0.233 Not available Dr. Ortiz Roque stated that elevated levels of mercury (33%), aluminum (56%), cadmium (26%), and lead (2.9%) were found in hair samples from residents in Vieques. Hair arsenic levels were not elevated (Ortiz 2002). Dr. Ortiz Roque provided additional information about hair mercury in women and children, shown in Table 3A-6. She stated that 22% of women and 60% of children sampled in Vieques had mercury levels above the 90th percentile in the United States as identified from the 1999 NHANES national survey (Ortiz 2002). Dr. Ortiz Roque further analyzed a subset of 22 Viequense matched pairs of mothers and their children 5 years of age or less. Dr. Ortiz Roque reported a significant correlation between mercury hair 093 = 00001 . Dr. Ortiz Roque published these matched pairs in 2003 (see Table 3A-4). Dr. Ortiz Roque stated that the average aluminum hair concentration for Viequenses was 25.74 ppm. She reported that this concentration exceeded the upper limit of a standard human population, although the manuscript does not report the source of the upper limit. Dr. Ortiz Roque pointed out that (Ortiz 2002). As stated previously, it is not possible to determine whether elevated levels of aluminum, cadmium, and lead in hair are from internal Page | 84 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 exposure via ingestion or inhalation or external exposure from direct contact of the hair with a metal \u00ad con D Viequenses at the 75th and 90th percentile, her population was not chosen randomly from the Vieques population. This nonrandom participant selection might account for some confounding factor elevating the rates. And for other metals, the nonrandom sample might account for the lower than expected metal concentrations. Table 3A-6.

While none of the women in the 1999 NHANES survey had mercury hair levels above 12 ppm, 3 of 45 Viequense women had hair levels above 12 ppm in D (i.e., 15.41, 25.26, and 101.3 ppm) (Ortiz 2002). In her 2002 draft manuscript, Dr. Ortiz Roque stated further that the positive correlation between mother and offspring hair showed that mercury exposure was occurring in utero; to mercury was too high to be considered safe; and mercury was used in explosive ordnance detonators (Ortiz 2002) . The correlation between mother and offspring hair with seafood consumption is expected, has been shown in numerous human studies, and points to seafood as a major source of mercury in humans . The correlation of hair mercury levels in mother and children is not conclusive proof that these children were exposed in utero . A study of mothers and newborns would be needed to make that statement conclusively. Assuming that mothers maintained similar fish-eating habits before and during their pregnancy, the positive hair mercury correlation between mother and offspring suggests that in utero exposure to mercury occurred and could occur in future pregnancies . D Page | 85 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 patients were not selected randomly, identifying several women with very high hair mercury levels is an important finding. 3.7.9 Investigations by Dr. Carmen Col\u00f3n de Jorge Dr. Carmen Col\u00f3n de Jorge also conducted human biomonitoring of metals in hair and in addition analyzed several stool samples for metals. Dr. Col\u00f3n de Jorge collected hair and stool samples from Vieques residents in 1999 and 2000 and wrote a manuscript describing her results and findings ( Col\u00f3n de Jorge, undated). Dr. Carmen Col\u00f3n de Jorge began her manuscript by describing the case history of one of her patients who lived on Vieques. According to the reporting laboratory, a 1991 hair analysis in a sick patient showed toxic levels 20 of lead and aluminum. The patient was treated using naturopathic remedies, and the patient improved. The patient was tested again in 1993 and again in 1996 because the patient was again sick. The hair tests showed high levels of lead, aluminum, and antimony. Arsenic and mercury were also present in hair. In 1999, toxic levels of aluminum, antimony, arsenic, and mercury were much higher as well, now showing toxic levels of cadmium and bismuth. The patient also had low levels of zinc and selenium and increased boron. Dr. Col\u00f3n de Jorge stated the low levels of zinc and selenium confirmed endogenous poisoning with heavy metals. Representing the Scientific Committee of the Association of Licensed Naturopaths of Puerto Rico, Dr. Col\u00f3n de Jorge collected hair and stool samples from Vieques residents in 1999 and 2000. She stated that the nutritional imbalance in residents as shown by hair analysis was evidenced by deficiencies in calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium and excessive boron in hair. She further stated that the decline in selenium, resulting from heavy metal contamination, was a contributor to cancer development. 3.7.9.1 Dr. Col\u00f3n \u00c1\u00c2 \u0091\u0094\u00c4\u00c2'\u0095 \u0006\u0091\u0090\u00c0\u008e\u0097\u0095\u00c6\u0091\u0090\u0095 Dr. Col\u00f3n de Jorge stated that 45 50% of the people tested in Vieques were poisoned with mercury. Using results from stool samples, she found that 3 out of 6 children tested in Vieques had metal 21concentrations in stools D Data) that conducted the tests. She also reported that 5 out of 6 children tested had antimony and . She pointed out that children could not be exposed to metals in paint, cigarette paper, tobacco, old pots, make-up, and hair dye as adults might be.22 established by the laboratory. 20 Dr. Col\u00f3n ript does not provide a definition for toxic level. Apparently Dr. Col\u00f3n de Jorge used the toxic level D D elements. Although D D s no toxic level definition, it appears to be any level above the 95th percentile and is based on the laborator observation of over 1 million hair samples. 21 Determination of metals in stools samples is not a standardized or recommended means of determining exposure. 22 Note, however, that children can be exposed to lead in paint when they contact painted surfaces such as walls, doors, windows, stairs, and fences. Page | 86 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 Dr. Col\u00f3n de Jorge reported that 30 hair samples were collected from Vieques residents with various health conditions: 50% of the people tested were contaminated with antimony compared with 29% from a control population, 50% of the people tested were contaminated with arsenic compared with 29% from a control population, 50% of the people tested had a selenium imbalance. Dr. Col\u00f3n de Jorge pointed out that antimony levels were high because antimony was used in explosive ordnance on Vieques, thus making the case that military exercises were the reason antimony levels were high . No supporting evidence, however, was provided to show how residents were exposed. Dr. Col\u00f3n de Jorge also summarized the results of seven control patients with the following statements: o None of the seven patients showed toxic levels. o Two cases had antimony above the reference range established by the laboratory compared with 29% of those investigated outside of Vieques. The selenium was normal for exogenous contamination. o Two cases had arsenic above the reference range compared with 29% of the cases outside Vieques. The selenium is normal for exogenous contamination. o The seven control patients exhibited no endogenous contamination with heavy metals the selenium was normal and within the reference range. According to Dr. Col\u00f3n de Jorge, heavy metal contamination in a patient will often result in lower levels of selenium. In summary, Dr. Col\u00f3n de Jorge collected hair samples from seven random persons in Rio Piedras, a community on the main island of Puerto Rico health status remains unknown. None of the results show toxic levels of heavy metals, while 21 of 30 persons (i.e., 63%) from Vieques with known health conditions and thus not randomly selected showed toxic levels of various metals. As stated previously, current science is simply incapable of determining whether elevated levels of these metals in hair is from internal exposure via ingestion or inhalation, from external exposure via direct contact of the hair with a metal-containing commercial product, or due to accumulation secondary to an underlying disease. The exception is that current science can determine whether mercury in hair is from internal or external exposure. Dr. Col\u00f3n de Jorge provided a report section that described the relationship between metal toxicities, which can cause mineral deficiencies and excesses, and the risk of various diseases and health conditions. This relationship, or risk pattern, is described for 1) cardiac conditions, 2) cardiovascular, 3) emotional disturbances, 4) violence 5) poor absorption, and 6) cancer.

Dr. Rodr\u00edguez Sierra discussed arsenic in fish and biomonitoring data concerning urine arsenic levels in Viequenses. Among the 162 fish from 8 species that he collected, he said only arsenic exceeded the international criterion of 2 \u00b5g arsenic per gram fish wet weight. Page | 91 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 In July 2006, he also collected biological samples from 52 adults, whom he divided into two groups: a high fish-consumption group (n=30) and a low fish-consumption group (n=22). He collected hair, nail, and urine samples. Urine samples were measured for total arsenic and for various arsenic species: Trivalent arsenic arsenic Dimethylarsenonic acid (DMA), Arsenobetaine. The inorganic arsenic species are AsIII and AsV and their organic metabolites (MMA and DMA). The following data were presented: 75th 23Minimum Median 95th max results of the U.S. population: N Median 95th 52 10.3 35.3 NHANES 2557 6.0 18.9 Dr. Rodr\u00edguez Sierra announced these conclusions from his analysis of arsenic in residents of Vieques: 1. High levels of arsenic in hair, nails, and urine were not detected at the time of sampling a. Hair and nail sample levels were below the reference values of 1 \u00b5g/ g, b. The sum of the inorganic arsenic species and its metabolites w as less than 50 \u00b5g/ g creatinine, which was used as a reference value. 2. Levels of inorganic arsenic in urine samples from Vieques are slightly above the median and 95th percentile levels reported in 2003 2004 NHANES. Dr. Rodr\u00edguez Sierra has informed ATSDR that he plans to publish these data; more complete information should then become available. ATSDR is unsure of the maximum level of total arsenic and arsenobetaine reported during Dr. Rodr\u00edguez presentation.

References ................................................................................................................................................................ 105 Chapter 4 Summary Assessing accurately the health status of Viequenses requires quantifying morbidity and mortality as well as identifying possible factors that may lead to adverse health outcomes. Quantifying morbidity and mortality and assessing possible contributing factors can help to identify specific opportunities for intervention in public health programs or delivery of health services. An understanding of public health data collection and reporting systems, public health programs, and the health care delivery system on the island of Vieques is required to determine future activities for improving the health status of Viequenses. In this chapter we review public health data collection and reporting systems used in quantifying morbidity and mortality, review several reports published in the last 10 years that assess morbidity and mortality in Vieques, and provide a brief review of available health services on Vieques. All of these studies are descriptive in nature and provide some insight into the Vieques health picture. The studies do not contain analyses that relate potential environmental or other factors to the identified health conditions. Because of the small population, all studies suffer to some degree from a lack of statistical power and methodological limitations that make interpretation difficult. Despite these limitations, the studies are valuable for describing the health status of Viequenses. The studies indicate elevations in the prevalence of chronic disease, cancer incidence, and cancer mortality in Vieques relative to the rest of Puerto Rico. Page | 97 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 4.1 Public Health Data Systems and Programs The primary data systems supporting the estimation of incidence and prevalence of health outcomes in Puerto Rico are the Central Cancer Registry (RCCPR), Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), Birth Defects Surveillance System (BDSS), and the Puerto Rico Vital Records Office. CDC helps to fund each of these data collection and reporting systems. Their strengths and weaknesses affect data quality and the resulting ability to develop appropriate public health actions based on this information. The data reported by the RCCPR have several strengths. Cancer registries typically represent the best population-based dataset when compared with data collection systems and associated datasets for other chronic diseases . Most cancer cases are captured by registries due to legal reporting requirements, redundancies in the reporting system (i.e., reporting by labs, clinics, hospitals, and specific oncologists), and the clinical course of cancer that usually requires substantial follow up and repeat visits. The analysis of cancer registry data should then represent the most accurate assessment of cancer incidence in Vieques. Through a cooperative agreement in place since 1998, CDC has continuously funded the cancer registry . And t data accuracy has steadily improved . That said, however, several weaknesses in the registry data should be noted. First, funding has been inconsistent throughout the life of the registry, but recently it has become more stable. The RCCPR was \u0012 E E EE Program from 1973 1989. The contract between the RCCPR and SEER was not renewed, and until 1997 RCCPR operated on local funding. In 1997, the RCCPR applied for and received funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) through a cooperative agreement via the National Program of Cancer Registries. The RCCPR provided data to the CDC beginning with cancer cases diagnosed in calendar year 1998. Completeness and timeliness have also been problematic due to a shortage of trained personnel to perform cancer abstracting and delays in reporting by facilities because of lack of funds and lack of reporting requirements by some facilities . The RCCPR has made significant progress toward improving completeness. In 2003, a CDC review concluded that 95.3% of all cancer cases diagnosed or treated in hospital facilities in Puerto Rico were appropriately reported to the RCCPR ; a result comparable to the US median (95 %) (ORC MacroSM 2000). BRFSS is the primary surveillance system for estimating the prevalence of chronic diseases and health behaviors in the United States and in Puerto Rico. BRFSS is the primary data source for prevalence estimates of asthma, diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease. One limitation of this system is the ability to provide accurate prevalence estimates in small populations. Vieques has a population of less than 10,000 residents. Providing accurate prevalence estimates is difficult in populations this small. This is particularly due to the complex survey design and the overarching goals of producing state and national prevalence estimates. The Selected Metropolitan/Micropolitan Area Risk Trends (SMART) project was initiated to develop prevalence estimates at the local level. The SMART project methods develop prevalence estimates using BRFSS data for areas with 500 or more respondents. These methods may represent a viable option for using BRFSS to develop prevalence estimates for Vieques. CDC funds the Puerto Rico BDSS, which tracks thirteen congenital conditions diagnosed at birth. Current program goals include expanding the capacity of the surveillance system to identify birth defects cases and developing legislation that mandates the reporting of birth defects in Puerto Rico to the BDSS. The Page | 98 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 BDSS is one of 14 CDC-funded birth defects surveillance systems. The population-based system uses active case ascertainment. Abstractors in each public health region visit hospitals and other facilities to review medical records to identify cases for each specific type of birth defect. Although this approach is considered the gold standard, it is resource-intensive. A limitation of birth defects surveillance in general is that some defects cannot be diagnosed at birth and thus go undetected. Another morbidity and mortality data source is the Puerto Rico Vital Records Office. The Vital Records office collects data on births and deaths for the entire population. Advantages of birth and death data include low cost, availability, and, because of the statutory reporting requirements, near-complete coverage. Mortality dat a limitations include multiple causes of death, completeness of records, and changes in diagnostic practices from improvements in medical technology (Rothman and Greenland 1998). Birth certificate data limitations include changes to birth certificates over time, incomplete birth certificates, and self-reported information. 4.2 Assessment of Available Public Health Data Several studies have evaluated morbidity and mortality in the Viequense population. All are descriptive in nature and provide some insight into the health of that population. But these studies do not contain analyses that relate potential environmental or other factors to the identified health condition. In addition, because of the small study population, all the studies suffer from a lack of statistical power. Despite their limitations, these studies are valuable for describing the health status of Viequen ses and providing insight that will inform next steps. An evaluation of studies published within the past decade are summarized and discussed in this chapter. Conclusions and recommendations for further action are outlined below and in Chapter 9. These recommendations are viewed as a starting point for dialogue with the scientific community and Viequenses to develop an action plan that will help improve health. 4.2.1 Cancer The RCCPR released reports in 2006 and 2009 detailing cancer incidence and mortality in Puerto Rico. The 2006 report evaluated cancer incidence and mortality from 1990 2001. In contrast, the 2009 report evaluated cancer incidence and mortality from 1990 2004. Both studies assessed whether, using similar methods, cancer incidence and mortality rates were higher in Vieques than in the main island of Puerto Rico. The standardized incidence and mortality ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated. The authors defined statistical significance as a 95% confidence interval that did not include 1. Similarly, the authors defined marginal statistical significance as a 90% confidence interval that did not include 1. The analyses have several strengths . Most cancer cases are captured by registries. This is because of legal reporting requirements, redundancies in the reporting system (i.e., reporting by labs, clinics, hospitals, and specific oncologists), and the clinical course of most cancers that requires su bstantial follow up and repeat visits. The analysis of cancer registry data should then represent the most accurate assessment of cancer incidence on Vieques. Although the analyses have several strengths, several limitations were also noted. As mentioned briefly in the PRDOH reports and confirmed by Dr. Figueroa (personal communication, July, 2009), some follow Page | 99 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 up to identify cases in Vieques occurred that was not uniformly applied across the rest of Puerto Rico. One example is related to the documentation of age for cases in the registry. For both assessments, all cases indicating residence on the Island of Vieques were age-confirmed. This practice was not mirrored on the main island of Puerto Rico. If a case did not have a known age, it was not included in any rate calculations . In addition, cases were actively sought in Vieques and not in the rest of Puerto Rico. This potentially introduces bias; it omits cases from the reference population (i.e., Puerto Rico) and increases the proportion of cases captured by the registry in Vieques relative to Puerto Rico, thus potentially, artificially inflating standardized incidence ratios. Other differential methods for seeking out and reviewing cases in Vieques not applied on the main island would similarly bias the results (RCCPR 2006, 2009). 4.2.2 Noncancer We reviewed two studies that evaluated noncancer data. The primary noncancer morbidity study was released in March 2000 by Yadiris Lopez and Crisarlin Carrosquillo (Lopez and Carrosquillo 2002). We also reviewed nonc Dr. Carmen Ortiz Roque (Ortiz Roque 2002). The Lopez and Carrosquillo survey was conducted because of growing concerns regarding environmental contamination from the past military activities and their potential adverse human health effects on Viequenses. The survey was a cross-sectional design with a sample size of 1,043. The field work for the study was conducted between April and November of 2000. Lopez and Carrosquillo attempted to include all residents in each neighborhood and allowed the head of a household, typically the matriarch, to provide proxy responses for all household members. The survey collected data on demographics, employment history, and dietary habits, along with self-reported disease prevalence. The overall age distribution of the sample selected, based on 1990 and 2000 U.S. census data, appears older than the Vieques population. Lopez and Carrosquillo reported that 36% of the sample was ages 60 and older. Data from the 1990 U.S. Census indicated that 16% of the Vieques population was 60 years and older . Similarly, the 2000 Census indicated that 19.5% of the Vieques population was 60 years and older. Participants were selected from Lujan, Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration, Santa Maria, and Esperanza . The 132 residents of Lujan reported an age range of 5 25, whereas the 306 residents of the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration (PRRA) reported an age range of 59 70. The age distributions of Santa Maria and Esperanza were not reported separately. These neighborhoods were The survey participants identified 28 medical conditions. These conditions are listed in Table 4-1. Of the 28 medical conditions identified by participants, the authors presented comparisons using risk ratios for six health conditions: cancer, heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, asthma, and arthritis. The prevalence of health conditions was compared with the expected number of cases, calculated by multiplying the population of Vieques by the percentage of cases that occurred in the 1994 Puerto Rico Chronic Morbidity Study (PRCMS). In addition to medical conditions, the authors described the frequency of cigarette use, alcohol consumption, eating habits, and abortions. The authors stated that cancer was not connected to cigarette smoking or alcohol consumption the frequency of each factor in Page | 100 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 the survey was similar to the totality of Puerto Rico. The frequency of cigarette use and alcohol consumption among participants with the most prevalent health conditions was not presented (Lopez and Carrosquillo 2002). Table 4-1.

In January 2002, Dr. Ortiz Roque, together with the College of Physicians and Surgeons in San Juan, PR, released a report because of community concern that past military activities on the island may have adversely affected health. Ortiz Roque reported mortality statistics from the Puerto Rico Department of Health for 19911998. Age standardized mortality data between Vieques and mainland Puerto Rico were compared with total deaths and cause-specific deaths. Additionally, infant mortality rates in Vieques were also compared with those of Puerto Rico for 1975 1995 (Ortiz Roque 2002). The mortality data presented did not enumerate all analyses performed only those that were elevated. Finally, infant mortality is only briefly mentioned, and to ascertain specific times is difficult, especially those for specific causes. Symptom-disease prevalence surveys of a population, such as the Lopez and Corrosquillo survey, are useful hypothesis-generating tools. This is especially true when little preexisting knowledge is available ! Lopez and Carrosquillo survey was its large sample size (n=1,043) relative to a population of approximately 10,000. Mortality data may also provide meaningful insight into the health status of Viequens es. Analyses of mortality patterns in a population can be useful for hypothesis generation; however, using these data to quantify potential relationships in exposure-disease relationships is difficult. Many potential confounding variables cannot be assessed (e.g., access to care, lifestyle factors, and dietary habits). Typically, mortality data are population-based, with near universal coverage, and are less prone to bias. Despite such strengths, however, symptom-disease prevalence surveys and the mortality data reviewed have several limitations. Their ability is restricted to test inferences regarding associations between exposure and health status. They assess exposure and disease simultaneously; thus to determine whether the exposure preceded the disease is not possible. Because these surveys rarely contain quantitative exposure data either through immediate environment or through biomonitoring using this approach to understand the relationship between exposure and health status is inherently difficult. The Lopez and Carrosquillo symptom prevalence survey, for example, did not include environmental exposure information. In addition, cross sectional surveys of symptom-disease prevalence are often severely compromised by reporting bias from participants real or perceived problems. For the Lopez and Corrosquillo survey, all data were self- reported or reported via proxy, with no attempt to validate the information using medical records. In such cases, the analysis would benefit from a medical records review to validate self-reported data. Page | 102 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 A third limitation of this survey was a lack of statistical power. The sample was large relative to the population, but still may have lacked the power necessary to identify differences in the observed frequencies and, for many health conditions, in the expected frequencies. Confidence intervals, with risk ratio estimates to identify differences, were not presented. 4.3 Findings Access to oncology and other specialty services (e.g., neurology, cardiology) requires travel to the main island of Puerto Rico. Analyses of data from the RCCPR (cancer incidence) and the Vital Statistics office (cancer mortality) identified some statistically significant elevations. Statistically significant results =005 Tables 4-2 and 4- 3. When compared with all of Puerto Rico, the Lopez and Carrosquillo survey indicated an increased occurrence in Vieques of hypertension, asthma, diabetes, heart disease, and some cancers. A key survey limitation is the lack of supporting medical record inspection to support self-reported claims and to reduce the possibility of information bias. An increase in infant mortality was also reported and increases in noncancer mortality for hypertension, cirrhosis, and diabetes. Table 4-2.

Typically, around 30 new incident cases and 15 deaths for all cancers combined occur annually. Therefore, statistical power to detect any meaningful differences in cancer incidence on the island is low when evaluating specific anatomical sites, short time frames, or both. Assessing rates over a longer time span would be useful rather than the traditional 5 years, as in standard cancer surveillance publications. As differential ascertainment for the Vieques residents probably biased the presented, standardized incidence ratios, uniform case identification methods should be applied across all study and referent populations. 4.4 Conclusions and Recommendations 4.4.1 Conclusions 1. The documents ATSDR reviewed paint a complex health picture for Viequenses. The findings of these reports indicate elevations in chronic disease prevalence, cancer incidence, and cancer mortality among the population between Vieques and the rest of Puerto Rico. In addition, increased mortality in Vieques particularly from cancer may indicate lack of access to appropriate medical care. The limitations associated with these analyses, particularly the methodological concerns discussed in this report, introduce considerable uncertainty and make interpretation difficult. Some of the methodological concerns previously noted include more exhaustive cancer case finding in Vieques than the rest of Puerto Rico, differential follow -up, chronic disease prevalence estimates based on a symptom disease prevalence survey without medical record confirmation of health outcomes, and limited noncancer mortality data. Differential follow up and exhaustive case finding may result in biased estimates of cancer incidence and mortality. Uncertainty is also evident in the wide confidence intervals reported indicating imprecise estimates of cancer incidence and mortality ratios in Vieques relative to the rest of Puerto Rico (RCCPR 2009). This is not unusual when calculating estimates for small populations.

References ................................................................................................................................................................ 117 Chapter 5 Summary This chapter evaluates available data and information on contaminants detected in local garden produce and livestock; Chapter 7 considers the effects of direct contact with soil contaminants. The overall data are insufficient to quantify adequately human exposures or draw any valid health conclusions about whether consuming locally grown produce and livestock would result in harmful health effects. Limited sampling data are available for pigeon peas, a staple food among Viequenses. A preliminary data evaluation completed for this report has concluded that the level of cadmium reported in samples of locally grown pigeon peas would not contribute excess dietary cadmium to preschool children who eat no more than 5 of the largest (6 ounces) servings per week of locally grown pigeon peas. Adults who eat the largest serving sizes (12 ounces) should limit intake to 11 servings per week . Typical serving sizes for preschool children (1.5 ounces) do not contribute excess cadmium below 20 meals per week and adults who eat a typical serving ( 3 ounces) may eat up to 44 meals per week without exceeding recommended cadmium intake levels. Exceeding recommended levels of cadmium in the diet would not typically result in immediate health consequences. Excessive cadmium intake over decades, however, could contribute to harmful levels of cadmium accumulation in the kidneys, possibly resulting in kidney disease. To be protective, these exposure estimates assumed that people consistently ate the largest portions typically consumed at a meal, and that the pigeon peas contained the highest level of cadmium measured. These assumptions, however, likely overestimate the extent of exposure for the majority of the population . Whether the limited sampling results are representative of cadmium concentrations in other locally grown pigeon peas is unclear; but the significant uncertainty in the evaluation stresses the need to conduct further sampling. Preliminary evaluation results and the totality of the available data suggest a potential for uptake of metals from soil into food crops \u2014thus further investigation is Page | 107 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 warranted. To evaluate better this exposure pathway, ATSDR has recommended a collaborative effort to conduct additional sampling of locally grown foods. 5.1 Introduction Many Viequenses remain concerned that past military training activities in the eastern portion of their island left elevated levels of heavy metals in the surface soil. Plants could take up these metals . And when people eat those plants, they could be exposed. Viequenses also question whether animals could accumulate heavy metals if they forage in areas where past military activities occurred, and whether this could result in exposure for people who consume meat and milk products from these animals. Viequenses depend on many local animal and vegetable products as food sources and for economic support. Thus, for Viequenses the safety of locally produced foods has both health and economic implications. 5.2 Assessment of Available Data Since 2000, a number of independent studies have explored levels of heavy metals in Vieques vegetation and livestock. This section provides a brief summary of the results and discusses their !D esponse to the findings. The studies discussed in this section were prepared by scientists associated with the University of Puerto Rico and Casa Pueblo, a local community advocacy organization. Several of these studies were presented and discussed by the authors during the November 2009 meeting in Atlanta, GA. 5.2.1 Studies from 2000 -2002 In 2000, researchers from Casa Pueblo and the University of Puerto Rico sampled the prevailing vegetation in the Live Impact Area (LIA) (specifically Carrucho Beach, Monte David, and Gato and Icacos Lagoons) for heavy metals (Massol Dey\u00e1 and D\u00edaz 2000). Reference populations of the same species were also collected in Bosque Seco de Gu\u00e1nica and RUM Alzamora Ranch. The plants collected included Urochloa maxima (root and (stem), Calotropis procera (leaves), among other species. The authors reported that the concentrations of heavy metals such as lead, cobalt, and manganese in Vieques vegetation were significantly higher than concentrations detected in the reference locations. In 2001, the same researchers randomly collected agricultural and common vegetation from three sites within the residential section of Vieques: an agricultural area in Monte Carmelo, another area of Monte Carmelo that bordered the former Camp Garc\u00eda, and an agricultural farm in Barrio Monte Santo, Gobeo sector (Massol Dey\u00e1 and D\u00edaz 2001). In this paper, discussion was limited to the two farms sampled in the civilian area of Vieques and focused on plants grown for an agricultural economy. Sampling included leaves and stems of pumpkin, pepper, pigeon peas, pineapple, and yucca. The study reported that the concentration of cadmium, cobalt, copper, lead, and manganese exceeded levels reported in typical vegetation in temperate zones (from Smith and Huyck 1999). The authors stated that roots, stems and leaf samples of pumpkin, pepper, pigeon pea, pineapple and yucca had elevated lead and cadmium concentrations while guam\u00e1 and mango trees did not show any elevated metals concentrations. On August 18, 2001, Page | 108 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 the researchers from Casa Pueblo collected hair samples from goats that grazed in Mount Santos and Santa Mar\u00eda on Vieques (Massol Dey\u00e1 2002). As a reference, samples were collected from goats that pastured in the main island of Puerto Rico. The publication reported that hair from goats grazing in Vieques contained higher levels of lead than did goats on the main island. No mercury was detected in the goat hair (detection limit was 0.03 \u00b5g/g). Because of these results and other studies by the same researchers reporting elevated levels of heavy metals in plants and livestock, on August 7, 2001, the Puerto Rico Department of Agriculture (PRDA) placed an embargo on Vieques produce and livestock. The Puerto Rico Department of Agriculture, in cooperation with the Farmers Association of Puerto Rico, sampled grass, fruit-bearing trees, and bovine livestock from Monte Carmelo, Martineau, Monte Santo, Esperanza, Lujan, Gubeo, and western Vieques for cadmium, cobalt, copper, lead, manganese, and nickel. The Department of Agriculture and the Farmer ! consumption and did not contain toxic levels of these metals (PRDA 2001). When the Department of ! F ! the Massol D D studies, the embargo was lifted (El Nuevo D\u00eda 2001). 5.2.1.1 ATSDR Evaluation During preparation of the public health assessment evaluating soil exposure (ATSDR 2003), ATSDR cited two of the studies (Massol Dey\u00e1 and D\u00edaz 2000, 2001). These studies reported elevated metals in local vegetation and agricultural areas. Th is issue was originally addressed as a community concern in the Soil Pathway Evaluation Public Health Assessment (ATSDR 2003). ATSDR requested that an agronomist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture independently review the 2000 and 2001 Massol Dey\u00e1 and D\u00edaz studies. The agronomist determined (USDA 2002) that although prevented estimation of a human exposure dose: 1. Humans do not eat many of the species sampled in this study. When edible species were sampled, the edible portions were not. Human exposures from locally grown foods are best estimated from the edible portions of the food source. In general, the edible portions of plants are less likely to accumulate metals from soil because of normal plant processes (e.g., physiological barriers that prevent contaminants from getting to the tops of plants) (ATSDR 2001). 2. The study lacked the use of standard reference materials to demonstrate that the results were accurate. It also lacked background corrections for lead, cobalt, nickel, and cadmium to eliminate the effect of light scattering by any nonelement materials in the samples, which can result in a concentration overestimate. 3. The metals analysis did not indicate whether the metals were in a bioavailable form (i.e. , in a chemical form readily absorbed into plant tissues from the surrounding environment). This is important because vegetation samples include both contaminants taken up by the plant and soil particles from the surrounding environment. Even with a thorough washing, small soil particles will adhere to the plant materials and can actually carry more contaminants than those taken up Page | 109 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 by the plant from the soil (ATSDR 2001). The researchers did not determine how much of the chemical was adhered externally as soil and how much was in the plant tissue. Because of these limiting factors, ATSDR could neither quantify human exposures appropriately nor draw any valid health conclusions about whether consuming Vieques plants would result in harmful health effects. ATSDR has recommended additional sampling of locally grown produce that would improve the evaluation of this exposure pathway. Deta !D at the end of this chapter and in Chapter 9 of this report. ATSDR was unable to evaluate human exposure to goat meat and milk products from the sampling data presented in Massol Dey\u00e1 (2002). Information was missing on similarities and differences between the goats in Vieques and the reference population (e.g., goat species, age, whether differences were statistically significant) and how they might affect interpretation of the hair sampling results . The report was unclear regarding how the hair samples were prepared for analysis. Inadequate processing of the hair for chemical analysis can lead to misleading results and to difficulty in interpreting whether the data represent contamination internal to the hair shaft or incomplete removal of any external contamination. Additionally, limitations in interpreting the health significance of hair sampling data precluded ATSDR from using the goat hair data reported in Massol Dey\u00e1 (2002). Three key limitations of hair analysis generally prevented further characterization of exposures: 1. Hair analysis results cannot pinpoint the sources of detected chemical contaminants. For instance, hair analysis results typically cannot distinguish substances deposited onto hair (e.g., dusts) from substances that might have distributed into hair following an environmental exposure, such as ingestion of contaminated drinking water or food. In other words, hair analysis generally cannot differentiate internal from external exposure. 2. Currently, the scientific community does not know the range of contamination levels typically found in hair. Without reliable data in the peer-reviewed literature on baseline or background hair contamination levels in the general population, and without hair samples collect ed from comparison populations, health agencies cannot determine whether hair analysis results from a given site are unusually high or low. In Massol Dey\u00e1 (2002) a comparison population of goats was sampled, and the results support ed n that the goats sampled on Vieques had higher concentrations of heavy metals in hair relative to the comparison population. 3. A critical input into public health assessments is an understanding of the dose whether measured or estimated. Because we currently know so little about rates at which substances in human and animal bodies distribute into hair, calculation was not possible of internal doses from hair sampling results. Hair analysis, then, would provide no added insight into estimating exposures to humans, but it does imply a need to sample directly meat and milk from these animals to determine whether the meat and milk are safe for consumption. For most substances, insufficient data are currently available to support any prediction of adverse health effects from concentrations in hair. Detection of a substance in a hair sample generally will not tell how, when, or where exposure to that substance occurred. Data from plant and animal foods that people Page | 110 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 actually consume are best suited for determinations about the possible health implications for people who eat those foods. Accordingly, as part of its evaluation, ATSDR recommends additional sampling of local produce and livestock. 5.2.2 Studies from 2003 In 2003, researchers from University of Puerto Rico published a study discussing the same data the authors published in April 10, 2000 plant samples collected in February and March 2000 and analyzed for heavy metals (D\u00edaz and Massol Dey\u00e1 2003). This paper compared concentrations found on Vieques with concentrations detected on the main island of Puerto Rico. The 2000 sampling included plant stems and leaves but did not include the edible portions of the plants sampled. This peer-reviewed publication provided more information on sampling, preparation, and analytical techniques than did the April 2000 report. In addition to the 2000 sampling data, this paper included new samples of C. cajan (pigeon peas) leaves and fruit taken August 18, 2001. It also discussed the ratio of contamination detected in the fruit to contamination in the leaves. The study compared concentrations detected in pigeon pea fruit and leaf samples collected August 18, 2001. For some metals, higher concentrations were found in the fruit (zinc, nickel, cadmium and cobalt). For other metals, higher concentrations were found in the leaves (copper and lead). 5.2.2.1 ATSDR Evaluation In May 2009 ATSDR obtained a copy of the 2003 D\u00edaz and Massol Dey\u00e1 study. As part of its evaluation of Vieques, ATSDR reviewed the pigeon pea data in this study . The data reported in D\u00edaz and Massol Dey\u00e1 have significant limitations that restrict !D to interpret the significance. These limitations include no mention of comparison samples and no indication of statistical significance in the data reportin g pigeon-pea metal concentrations. The sampling results from only one study are not representative of the extent of cadmium in local produce and do not represent the potential for cadmium exposure to the general population from consuming locally grown pigeon peas . A preliminary evaluation concluded that the level of cadmium reported in a few samples of locally grown pigeon peas would not contribute excess dietary cadmium to preschool children who eat no more than 5 of the largest (6 ounces) servings per week of locally grown pigeon peas. Adults who eat the largest serving sizes (12 ounces) should limit intake to 11 servings per week . To be protective, these exposure estimates assumed that people consistently ate the largest portions typically consumed at a meal, and that the pigeon peas contained the highest level of cadmium measured. These assumptions likely overestimate the extent of exposure for the majority of the population. Typical serving sizes for preschool children (1.5 ounces) do not contribute excess cadmium below 20 meals per week. Adults who eat a typical serving ( 3 ounces) may eat up to 44 meals per week without exceeding recommended cadmium intake levels . Still, excessive cadmium intake over decades could contribute to harmful levels of cadmium accumulation in the kidneys, possibly resulting in kidney disease . Table 5-1 provides details on the methodology used in this evaluation.

E Vieques and the Land Authority of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico collected a total of 72 samples of smooth cayenne pineapple fruit, leaf tissues, and soil. They collected these samples from two pineapple plantations (one located in Barrio Luj\u00e1n in the civilian zone in Vieques and a control located in Barceloneta on the mainland of Puerto Rico). The samples were to determine the total concentration of arsenic, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, and lead in the fruit. The author concluded that no contamination was found in the pineapple fruit or leaf samples from either plantation. In all fruit samples arsenic, cadmium, cobalt, and lead either were below levels of detection or were not detected. No contamination was observed in the pineapples from Vieques when compared with those from the Barceloneta plantation (Lopez Morales 2005). Higher levels of metals were, however, found in the soil at the Barceloneta plantation, which the author accepted regulatory levels. In 2005, Massol Dey\u00e1 et al. published a paper discussing the same data that the authors published in April 10, 2000, and again in 2003 plant samples collected in February and March 2000 and analyzed for heavy metals. The authors no addition to the 2000 sampling data, this paper included new samples of Syringodium filiforme (Manatee grass) taken from the Atlantic Fleet Weapons Training Facilities (AFWTF) in 2004 and from Gu\u00e1nica State Forest in 2003 and 2004. Concentrations of heavy metals were higher at AFWTF. The authors proposed the hypothesis of bioaccumulation through the food chain: manatee grass to crustaceans, fish eat the crustaceans and then are eaten by people. A similar food-chain scenario was hypothesized for migratory birds (Massol-Dey\u00e1 et al. 2005). 5.2.3.1 ATSDR Evaluation The data in Massol-Dey\u00e1 et al. ( 2005 ) might well provide ecologically important information, but they are not directly relevant to evaluating human health manatee grass is not typically a Viequense food source. ATSDR has recommended additional produce sampling. The L\u00f3pez Morales (2005) study was unique in that its purpose was specifically to sample the edible portion of a commonly consumed agricultural product grown in Vieques, smooth cayenne pineapples. As part of the evaluation of Vieques, ATSDR evaluated the level of chromium the only metal detected in the pineapple fruit samples. Using a standard intake rate for fruit consumption,24 ATDSR calculated the estimated exposure dose at below levels of concern for adverse health effects. L\u00f3pez Morales (2005) cited two additional studies that found 1 \u0012 ! E (September 6, 2001), and 2) A & L Southern Agricultural Laboratories, Inc. (August 31, 2001). Both About 7 ounces of fruit a day (mean total fruit intake; USEPA 1997) Page | 114 24 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 studies analyzed for heavy metals in guinea grass, sugar apple, wild tamarind, mango, green banana fruit, pigeon peas, genip fruit, grapefruit, and buffet grass. These studies sampled species Viequenses regularly eat. ATSDR is attempting to obtain copies of these studies, but to date has not been successful. 5.2.4 Studies from 2008 In January 2008, leaves from cilantro, spinach, beans, peppers, and papaya plants were collected from a Viequense organic farm and analyzed for cadmium, chromium, copper and lead. The researchers believed airborne contamination. The researchers found that concentrations of lead and cadmium in the Viequense vegetation were significantly higher than those detected in the reference plants (D\u00edaz de Osborne et al. 2008). 120 miles from Vieques 5.2.4.1 ATSDR Evaluation In reviewing the D\u00edaz de Osborn et al. (2008) report, ATSDR was initially concerned that the data D lack of any data quality assurance information, ATSDR questioned whether those data accurately represented typical heavy metal concentrations in locally grown produce. ATSDR consulted with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) about the study (R. Chaney, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Station, Beltsville, MD, personal communication, 2008 Oct 28 30). USDA noted that the reported levels of copper would be phytotoxic to the plants. USDA commented that the reported measurements were consistent with plants grown in soils that had been changed to increase metal uptake in the plants (Sterrett et al. 1996). As a result, how ATSDR should interpret these data is unclear. ATSDR has recommended additional sampling of locally grown produce to resolve uncertainties in the available data. Still, until additional data are available and this exposure pathway is more thoroughly evaluated, the USDA suggests following several simple methods for reducing metal uptake into garden produce from soil.

The overall data are insufficient to quantify adequately human exposures or draw any valid health conclusions about whether consuming locally grown produce and livestock would result in harmful health effects. Page | 115 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 2. Limited sampling data are available for pigeon peas, a staple food among Viequenses. Interpretation of these data is uncertain because of the lack of adequate QA/QC information for the analytical findings. a. A preliminary data evaluation completed for this report has concluded that the level of cadmium reported in a few samples of locally grown pigeon peas would not contribute excess dietary cadmium to preschool children who eat less than 5 of the largest (6 ounces) servings per week of locally grown pigeon peas. Adults who eat the largest serving sizes (12 ounces) should limit intake to 11 servings per week. b. Typical serving sizes for preschool children (1.5 ounces) do not contribute excess cadmium below 20 meals per week and adults who eat a typical serving ( 3 ounces) may eat up to 44 meals per week without exceeding recommended cadmium intake levels. c. Exceeding recommended levels of cadmium in the diet would not typically result in immediate health harm. Excessive intake of cadmium over decades could contribute to harmful levels of cadmium accumulation in the kidneys, possibly resulting in kidney disease . Typically, only a very small fraction (5%) of cadmium in food is absorbed in the body, especially in individuals with healthy diets containing adequate amounts of essential minerals such as zinc, iron and calcium (Reeves and Chaney 2008). 3. Whether the limited sampling results are representative of cadmium concentrations in other locally grown pigeon peas is unclear; but the significant uncertainty in the evaluation stresses the need to conduct further sampling. 4. Preliminary evaluation results and the totality of the available data suggest a potential for uptake of metals from soil into food crops thus further investigation is warranted. To evaluate better this exposure pathway, ATSDR has recommended a collaborative effort to conduct additional sampling of locally grown foods. 5.3.2 Recommendations ATSDR supports additional sampling and collaborative data collection to evaluate more thoroughly this human exposure pathway. The following recommendations are intended to promote collection of high quality data of maximum utility, and to minimize data uncertainties: 1. Sampling data should represent edible portions of a cross-section of local produce from local farms, home gardens, and local markets. Sample produce that tends to accumulate heavy metals more easily (e.g., leafy vegetables such as lettuce and spinach) rather than leaves of grain or fruit crops. 2. Survey residents to identify the prevalence and type of locally grown and commonly consumed garden produce. Sampling plan design should include produce types identified from this survey. 3. Collect representative surface soil samples at the same location and time that garden and farm produce samples are taken. Soil samples should be of appropriate depth to represent the root zone. Page | 116 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 4. Collect samples of meat and milk products from Vieques forage-consuming livestock. 5. To avoid false high or low values, sample collection and analysis should conform to high standards of data quality, including detailed quality assurance/quality control information, standard reference materials for analysis, and background correction. Design the sampling plan to collect a sufficient number of samples to ensure high statistical confidence. 6. Collect samples from an appropriate background or control location for comparison with food samples produced on Vieques. 7. To facilitate exposure assessment, report data as consumed (wet weight). 8. Plan and conduct sampling protocols in collaboration with local scientists. One way to avoid misunderstandings about the data is for local scientists and an independent expert jointly collect and split several samples and provide analytical reports with QA/QC supporting information. A QA/QC standard could be split at the time the samples are collected. 9. Request technical assistance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) in sample collection and analytical protocols. The USDA Agriculture Research Service has offered to provide, if requested, technical assistance in sampling plan design, collection, and analysis with proper QA/QC protocols. 5.4 References [ATSDR] Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. 2001.

References ................................................................................................................................................................ 130 Chapter 6 Summary This chapter reviews how potential airborne exposures to contaminants from military operations at the former Vieques Naval Training Facility might have affected Viequense residential areas. Although our review draws primarily from sources used in the 2003 ATSDR Air PHA, we also summarize air monitoring data and air dispersion studies developed or collected after publication of the 2003 Air PHA. These later data assessed effects of ongoing or proposed open detonation or open burning and included site-specific meteorological data collected after 2003. We further evaluate the modeling process used in the 2003 Air PHA, the assumptions and data used in that modeling process, and compare the results with monitored data collected during recent open burning events. While this review finds the Air PHA modeling process consistent with established practices, it does identify two minor errors in estimating detonation source concentrations. These errors, however, do not affect the results or conclusions of the Air PHA. Collectively, the available sampled and modeled data are adequate for the determination of any potential public health hazard arising from exposure to airborne contamination. By overestimating numerous aspects of the contaminant emissions and by assessing exposures for worst-case conditions, the 2003 ATSDR air dispersion model adequately addressed uncertainties inherent in the air dispersion modeling process. The model results indicate that in the residential areas of Vieques, airborne contaminants from historic military exercises on the Vieques Naval Training Range would have been essentially nondetectable and unlikely to have resulted in harmful effects. These results are supported by post 2003 air monitoring studies conducted in support of the ongoing site remediation. Page | 119 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 6.1 Introduction to Air Pathway 1980 !D was safe to breathe. The residents were and are concerned about contaminants released to the air during the d ordnance (early 1970s to April 1999), as well as exercises using inert ordnance (May 2000 to May 2003).25 Among other concerns, Viequenses questioned whether toxic dusts from the explosive- ordnance range could have blown into their neighborhoods. During the time the Navy still conducted explosive-ordnance exercises on Vieques, three air-sampling studies occurred (1972, 1978, and 1979). Direct references for these studies are not available, but other documents reported and summarized the results (TAMS 1979; Cruz P\u00e9rez 2000). Appendix C of the Air ! !D 2003 limitations. The Puerto Rico Environmental Quality Board conducted two of these studies, and the Navy concern. Those conclusions are limited by the small number of air sampling locations and the small number of measured analytes. And because those historic sampling studies did not employ data quality control procedures that are accepted today, the studies could not conclusively determine by current standards whether airborne contaminants were present in Viequense residential areas. Thus ATSDR could not base health conclusions on these studies alone. Modeling, however, could provide another dataset that might clarify earlier findings. When ATSDR first began evaluating the air pathway, two dispersion-modeling studies were available that produced distinctly different conclusions about potential exposures to particulate matter on Vieques. One was prepared by Navy contractors (IT 2000) and a second by Dr. Cruz-P\u00e9rez, a local professional engineer (Cruz P\u00e9rez 2000). As part of the 2003 PHA process, ATSDR hired three independent air modeling experts to review the studies. Appendix D of the Air PHA includes a summary and review of each of the modeling studies. After receiving feedback from the external reviewers, ATSDR decided to conduct an additional, independent modeling study using recommendations from the peer reviewers. Note that given the limited extent of air sampling that occurred at Vieques while the Navy used explosive ordnance, modeling was necessary. Appendix D in the Air PHA contains model documentation, including defining assumptions and results. 6.2 Assessment of Available Data 6.2.1 Assessment of Air Exposures in the Public Health Assessment To estimate effects of explosive ordnance on air quality, ATSDR used a modeling analysis that evaluated 86 different contaminants known to be released to the air when ordnance explodes (49 organic compounds, 29 metals, 5 explosive compounds, plus chaff, depleted uranium, and particulate matter such as PM10). The model results found that as dust and smoke traveled from the explosive-ordnance The Air Public Health Assessment includes a more complete summary of the Former Vieques Naval Training Facility operational history. Page | 120 25 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 range toward areas where people lived, chemicals released to the air by explosions dispersed to extremely low levels. For most contaminants, the predicted air quality effects at residential areas were so low that even if highly sensitive air sampling devices were in place they likely could not measure such low levels of the contaminants. For example, particulate-matter contaminants emitted during explosive ordnance exercises were predicted to account for less than 1 percent of the particulate-matter26 concentrations measured in Viequense residential areas. This comparison suggests that LIA emissions had a small effect on residential air quality. Using this modeling analysis and the previously referenced air sampling data, ATSDR concluded that of the 86 contaminants evaluated that might have been part of emissions from the former Vieques Naval Training Range, by the time they reached the residential areas of Vieques none exceeded any health comparison values. In other words, even the total effect of the chemicals combined did not result in residential air pollution. From May 2000 through May 2003, the Navy conducted military training exercises with inert (nonexplosive) ordnance. During 2000 2001, the Puerto Rico Environmental Quality Board conducted ambient air monitoring at two stations in Viequense residential areas. On days when such inert ordnance fell on the explosive-ordnance range, the Puerto Rico Environmental Quality Board collected more than 50 particulate-matter samples in the residential areas of Vieques. These data and supporting information are reported in the U.S.EPA Air Quality System (AQS) formerly the Aerometric Information Retrieval System (AIRS) and summarized in the Air PHA (Appendix C). In every sample, the levels of particulate matter were much lower than health-effects levels. In fact, no clear relationship was ever established between the quantity of inert ordnance dropped in the LIA and the levels of air pollution concentrations led ATSDR to conclude that on days when inert ordnance fell into the LIA, levels of air pollution did not pose a health hazard to t In addition to the modeling study and the analysis of historic air monitoring data, ATSDR conducted on \u00adsite air monitoring during the June 2001 Navy air- to-ground, inert ordnance exercises. The results of this sampling effort are documented (ERG 2001), and the Air PHA describes their limitations. Due to station location/siting problems (as discussed in the Air PHA), the sampling data do not meet applicable quality control standards. The measured contaminant concentrations are nonetheless consistent with the public health conclusions. ! ! !D monitoring stations at Isabel Segunda and Esperanza established and maintained by the Puerto Rico Environmental Quality Board: The ter PM10 and PM2.5 refer to particulate matter having aerodynamic diameters less than or equal to 10 and 2.5 microns, respectively. Also note that while current emphasis on the health effects of particulate matter focus on PM2.5, past health -based standards used PM10. The 2003 Air PHA used PM10 to make direct comparisons with earlier measurements and model results.

Wind-blown dust from the explosive-ordnance range did not and does not pose a health hazard to residents. The Air PHA also contains a thorough review of the then-available modeling studies, the ATSDR modeling study, and other reported air monitoring datasets. 6.2.2 Review of the Air Modeling Process Used in the Air PHA Eastern Research Group (ERG) and Trinity Consultants conducted the ATSDR air modeling study to evaluate potential air exposures from historic operations at the former Vieques Naval Training Range. The Air PHA and a follow-up report (Wilhemi et al. 2006) describe the specific procedures, assumptions, and results of the mod \u0012 \u0012 submitted the results to ERG (Trinity Consultants 2002). Direct measurement of airborne emissions produced by military ordnance explosions is not possible. 27 Quantitative modeling, however, is a useful approach for assessing potential emissions produced by explosive ordnance events. To evaluate potential exposures to airborne contamination, the Air PHA used the following modeling procedure: 1. Make health-protective estimates of airborne emission concentrations from individual ordnance items using the Combined Obscuration Model for Battlefield Induced Contaminants (Army Research Laboratory 2000); 2. Use a U.S.EPA-accepted air dispersion model (Calpuff) to estimate event-specific, health-protective, 24-hour annual contaminant concentrations at points of maximum off-site exposure; 3. Calculate maximum daily and annual contaminant concentrations at off-site exposure points using documented ordnance usage data to scale up the event-specific, dispersed-contaminant concentrations; and 4. Evaluate the potential public health effects of exposure to those contaminants by comparing the estimated maximum 24-hour and annual contaminant concentrations with appropriate health comparison values. This review finds that the overall rationale for that approach is sound, and each of the assumptions underlying the selection of model parameters is well documented in the Air PHA and in the literature (text and Appendix D; Wilhemi et al. 2006). The modeling procedure was developed from comments and recommendations by external, independent reviewers who assessed the existing studies. A number of factors or model assumptions within the 2003 study collectively led to an intentional overestimation of potential exposures, thus helping to ensure the conclusions are health-protective: The blasts would destroy the monitoring equipment; indirect downwind sampling is possible, however. Page | 122 27 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 Overestimate particulate emission rates from explosions by assuming all particulates are composed of the PM10 fraction (larger particles not susceptible to significant air dispersion are included as PM10). Overestimate emission rates of explosives (e.g., TNT, RDX, HMX, aluminum powder) by assuming 10% of explosives are not consumed in the explosion and are available for dispersion. By contrast, available data show that less than 1% of explosives remain after detonation. Because of variations in explosive composition of different ordnance types, maximum composition percentages of TNT, RDX, and aluminum powder were assumed to comprise collectively more than 125 percent of total explosive use. The emission estimates also assumed that all ordnance dropped, fired, or launched into the LIA exploded, and that all emissions emanated from a single-source location. Thus bombs exploding in multiple locations would spread the emissions over a relatively large area, leading to greater dispersion and lower concentration at any single downwind site. Potential exposure evaluations are all based on worst-case meteorological conditions for both 24-hour and annual exposures for a person living directly on the site boundary (i.e., the location of highest off-site concentration estimates). Residential areas are at least 3 miles farther west which, for off-site residents, would result in commensurately lower exposure doses. Three EXCEL spreadsheets developed by ERG (METALS.xls, ORGANICS.xls, and EXPLOSIVES.xls) contain !D -mail (John Wilhelmi, ERG, to Mark Evans, ATSDR, personal communication, 2009 Dec 3). A review of the spreadsheets has revealed two minor errors or discrepancies. First, metals concentrations within the particulate plume are calculated by adding metals in the explosive compounds, metals in the ordnance casing, and metals in the soil ejected into the ai r by the explosion. Concentrations of explosives (e.g., TNT, RDX, and HMX) present in Live Impact Area soils are not similarly accounted for in assessing plume concentrations of those materials. Still, because the concentrations of explosives compounds of LIA soils are so low, the relative contribution from soil ejecta is insignificant. As an example, the concentration of TNT in LIA soil averages 2.9 parts per million (ppm). Maximum annual emissions of TNT as soil ejecta (based on the TNT soil concentration of 2.9 ppm) would be approximately 1.6 pounds per year (or 0.00027 pounds per hour; based on 5,840 hours per year operations). In comparison, the ATSDR air dispersion model assumes that airborne emissions from undetonated TNT in bombs (assuming 10% of TNT does not ignite) is 10.76 pounds per hour . If only 5% of TNT remains after the explosion, this hourly TNT emission rate becomes 5.38 pounds per hour . Considering that available studies show less than 1% of TNT does not ignite, the amount of TNT in the ai r is overestimated and, relative to the overestimate from TNT ignition, the contribution from TNT in soil ejecta is very small. The second discrepancy detected in the ERG spreadsheets concerns calculation of maximum 24 -hour emission rates of metals in air particulates. This calculation neglected to include a conversion factor for Page | 123 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 adjusting emission rates in pounds per hour to emissions in grams per second. Considering that an emission rate of 1 pound per hour is about 8 times greater than an emission rate of 1 gram per second, the use of an input value 8 times too large results in an eightfold overestimate of the maximum 24 -hour emission rate. Collectively, however, the discrepancies in the air dispersion modeling process do not significantly affect the results or conclusions expressed in the 2003 Air PHA. ! ! ! E 39 ! !D each response adequately addressed each concern. This review finds that the responses were appropriate and provided adequate support for the Air PHA assessment procedure and the resultant public health conclusions. We note, however, one specific concern and the response thereto (Air PHA, comment/response #8, ! E 25 response indicates that in fact PM2.5 was not explicitly modeled. Bu t it is addressed by making the most health protective assumption possible (i.e., that the estimated PM10 concentrations consisted entirely of PM2.5 particulates). Thus the annual average and maximum 24-hour concentration increases caused by explosive ordnance events (0.04 \u00b5g/m 3 for annual average; 10.2 \u00b5g/m3 for 24 hour average) would still be (from the 2003 Air PHA): E! 25 -based standards (15 \u00b5g/m3 for annual average, and 65 \u00b5g/m3 for 24 hour average concentrations) .

The air monitoring data summaries describe real-time, on-site (downwind) sampling events conducted before, during, and after 51 in-place ordnance detonation events at the LIA. The information in these reports shows that the monitoring analyses were conducted using accepted methods, and that the results were within acceptable limits for sampling and analytical quality assurance. Analytes measured were PM10, metals, and explosives at hourly or 8-hour intervals. Measurements were summarized as 8-hour or 24-hour averages. No explosives or metals in any of the air samples have been reported in concentrations above regulatory or applicable health based standards. One detonation event might have ignited surrounding vegetation; it resulted in a 24-hour, PM 10 value of 153 \u00b5g/m3 just above the NAAQS standard of 150 \u00b5g/m3. This measurement, however, was taken at an on-site location immediately downwind of the detonation site. None of the 51 detonation events produced elevated PM 10 measurements at stations closer to areas of potential off-site exposure. The exposure levels for metals are more than 10 times below the health guideline. Thus interaction effects between chemicals are not likely, and additive or synergistic effects between chemicals are not likely to enhance !D 2004). An air dispersion model conducted in support of the BIP detonations (CH2MHill 2007a) supports the measured monitoring results. This modeling study used a different air dispersion model (Open Burn/Open Detonation Dispersion Model; Bjorkland et al. 1998) and si te-specific meteorological data unavailable when the Air PHA was conducted. The results of this air dispersion model also support the monitoring results and the conclusions of the ATSDR modeling study. Estimated airborne contaminant concentrations from BIP events at areas of potential off- standards and reasonable analytical detection limits for all compounds ( CH2MHill 2007a). The air dispersion modeling of the BIP detonations (CH2MHill 2007a) used meteorological data collected from the Camp Garc\u00eda airfield on Vieques. These site-specific windspeed and direction data for the year 2005 were not available when the ATSDR PHA was conducted. Instead, the ATSDR air dispersion model used then-available meteorological data from the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station and the San Juan Airport station. Figure 6-1 shows wind rose diagrams for Camp Garc\u00eda, the San Juan LM Airport, and the Roosevelt Roads stations (from CH2MHill 2007a). The Camp Garc\u00eda site is in a shallow topographic bowl on the south central portion of Vieques. The 2005 wind rose reflects this location with the predominant wind Page | 125 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 directions blowing from the northeast, while the San Juan LM Airport and Roosevelt Roads predominant wind directions are similar, but more southeasterly and easterly. Average annual wind speeds for the Roosevelt Roads and San Juan LM Airport stations are about two to four times greater than for the Camp Garc\u00eda station (2.88 and 4.10 vs. 1.46 m/sec, respectively). No long-term meteorological data are available for the LIA. The residential areas of Vieques are west of the LIA; the use of wind data that maximizes the easterly component of dispersion and uses a higher annual average wind speed provides a health-protective estimate of contaminant transport. That is, application of the Camp Garc\u00eda wind data would tend to disperse more contaminants a shorter distance and more toward the ocean (to the south), with lesser amounts to residential areas (to the east) . In addition to the recent evaluation of BIP detonations, the Navy has proposed prescribed burning of LIA vegetation to access safely and to remove remaining unexploded ordnance. In support of this proposal, the Navy has conducted additional air modeling to assess the potential effects of such prescribed burning (CH2MHill 2008a). Although the Air PHA did not address vegetation burning, it did address past operations of open burning/open detonation (OBOD) of excess or recovered ordnance. As the mass of ordnance involved in past OBOD events was small relative to the mass involved in then-ongoing Naval operations, the 2003 Air PHA found that air emissions from past OBOD events did not present a public health hazard to Viequens es. The 2003 Air PHA included an assessment of the public health significance of exposure to dust from African storms based on measured or estimated PM10 concentrations and found that PM10 exposures attributed to such dust storms were not a public health hazard . At the time of publication of the Air PHA, there were no data available on the chemical-specific makeup of dust from these storms . A recent study by Gioda et.al. (2007) presented PM10 and metals concentrations from air samples for sev eral Puerto Rican locations, including Vieques, which makes such chemical-specific data available . This study was able to correlate seasonal, measured air particulate concentrations at Vieques and other Puerto Rican locations with African dust storms . Most of the metals analyzed in these samples (cadmium, cobalt, copper, iron, nickel, lead, and vanadium) were well below their applicable health comparison values and do not represent a public health hazard . The annual average arsenic concentration of 0.0003 \u00b5g/m 3 is just above the comparison value of 0.0002 \u00b5g/m3, which is based on health protective exposure assumptions, a lifetime excess cancer risk of 0.000001, and the U.S.EPA unit inhalation cancer risk of \u00b5g/m3). Using the Gioda et.al. ( 2007 ) data, the estimated lifetime excess cancer risk for inhalation exposure to arsenic on Vieques is 0.0003 \u00b5g/m3 x per \u00b5g/m3 = 0.0000013 The measured annual average arsenic air particulate concentration and resulting estimated lifetime excess cancer risk at Vieques is midway between other Puerto Rican values and not significantly different from the Fajardo, PR background location identified by Gioda et.al. (2007) . Dust from African storms provides a measurable contribution to background particulate loadings at Vieques and other locations only during summer months and thus represents only a seasonal contribution to the predominantly local air particulate loads . Inhalation of specific metals from African dust storms, while contributing to seasonal particulate loads at Vieques and other Puerto Rican locations do not present an explicit public health hazard .

Analytically measured data assumes the sampling device adequately captures the target substance, that the sampler is at the correct time and place relative to contaminant releases and exposures, and that the chemical/substance analyses produce accurate concentration estimates. Quality control and assurance procedures ensure that field sampling and laboratory measurement processes produce reliable results. That said, however, field-sampling data remain only an estimate of real-world conditions. Quantitatively modeled datasets, such as the air dispersion model used in the Air PHA, resolve some direct sampling limitations the modeled datasets allow estimation of results for any time or location. But air dispersion models necessarily include other assumptions, such as relevant contaminant emission rates, appropriate meteorological data, and specific aspects of the site terrain (e.g., topography). All of these site-specific conditions or model parameters influence air movement patterns. As with field sampling methods, air dispersion models also include quality assurance procedures to improve result quality. The Calpuff model used in the ATSDR Air PHA has undergone appropriate regulatory review. The U.S.EPA Support Center for Regulatory Atmospheric Modeling has approved the model for such uses as those employed by ATSDR. See: http:// www.epa.gov/scram001 . Mode l assumptions and input parameters used in the ATSDR study are specifically documented in the 2003 Air PHA Appendix D and further described by Wilhelmi et al. (2006). By overestimating numerous aspects of the contaminant emissions and by assessing exposures for worst-case conditions, the uncertainties inherent in this air dispersion model have been adequately addressed. And despite the overestimation of potential exposures, the model results indicate that in Viequense residential areas, airborne contaminants from historic uses of the Vieques Naval Training Range would have been E\u0011 -PHA air sampling and air dispersion modeling support these predicted results. Collectively then, the available data are adequate for the conclusions in the Air PHA.

This review of potential airborne exposures within the residential areas of Vieques to contaminants from military operations at the former Vieques Naval Training Facility is based on the following sources of information that were used in the 2003 ATSDR PHA : a. U.S. Navy records of the types and amounts of ordnance used at the training range, b. A source term model used to estimate the amounts of material produced by ordnance detonations, c. An air dispersion model to estimate contaminant transport from the detonation area to the residential areas, d. Long term meteorological data from the San Juan PR airport and the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station, and e. Ambient air monitoring in the residential areas conducted by the PREQB for the 2001 - 2003 time period. 2. Also summarized are air monitoring data and air dispersion studies developed or collected after publication of the 2003 Air PHA for the purpose of evaluating ongoing or proposed open detonation or open burning. 3. This review of potential airborne exposures evaluates the modeling process used in the 2003 Air PHA, the assumptions and data used in the modeling process, and compares the results of that modeling process with monitored data collected during recent open burning events. 4. While this review finds the Air PHA modeling process consistent with established modeling practices, it does identify two minor errors in estimating detonation source concentrations. One results in an overestimate of metals concentrations. The other results in a minor underestimate of explosion byproducts in entrained soil that is overcompensated by the overall estimate of explosive compound concentrations. These errors do not affect the results or conclusions of the Air PHA. 5. Collectively, the available sampled and modeled data are adequate for the determination of the potential public health hazard from exposure to airborne contamination. The uncertainties inherent in the 2003 ATSDR air dispersion model have been adequately addressed by overestimating numerous aspects of the contaminant emissions and by assessing exposures for worst-case conditions. Despite the overestimation of potential exposures, the model results indicate that airborne contaminants from historic uses of the Vieques Naval Training Range would have been essentially nondetectable in the residential areas of Vieques and unlikely to E\u0011 -PHA air sampling and air dispersion modeling. Collectively, the available data provide an adequate basis for the public health conclusions in the Air PHA. Page | 129 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 6. To conduct its health protective evaluation of potential exposures to airborne contaminants from military exercises at the former Vieques Naval Training Facility, the ATSDR Public Health Assessment used appropriate modeling procedures and available monitoring data. The additional air dispersion modeling and monitoring data conducted after completion of the Air ! !D ons. Because past military exercises would not likely have produced measurable concentrations of airborne contaminants in the residential areas of Vieques, no public health basis supports additional air studies or ambient air monitoring efforts related to past military exercises on Vieques. 7. Although the residents of Vieques could hear and possibly feel the explosions from military exercises on the former Vieques Naval Training Range, 8 miles is still a considerable distance. The physics of sound and seismic wave migration are very different from the physics of atmospheric dispersion of airborne particulates and gases. 6.4.2 Recommendations No further recommendations at this time. 6.5 References Army Research Laboratory, 2000.

Indirect effects of soil contaminants through the terrestrial food chain are considered separately in \u0006hapter 5, \" Local Produce and Livestock Pathway;\" !TS\u0007R evaluated potential direct soil exposures in two situations: people who stayed on the LIA property during 1999 -2000 protests and people who live in the island's residential areas; Sufficient data are available to conclude that people who lived on the LIA during protests were not exposed to soil contaminants at levels high enough to cause adverse health effects; n the island' s residential areas, no soil data are adequate to characterize potential exposures fully. Nevertheless, consideration of soil data from other island locations and consideration of how contaminants might be transported through the air to residential areas s uggests that in the island's residential areas, exposure to military activity-related soil contaminants is not high enough to result in adverse health effects; Since !TS\u0007R's 2003 Soil P !, more soil data have become available through investigations of known, localized areas of contamination on military lands. These were not areas accessed or occupied by the protesters, so they do not affect the conclusions drawn for those exposures. They are also not from the residential portion of the island; therefore, they do not improve the residential evaluation. The recent data, along with the known presence of unexploded ordnance at the LIA, support the need for continuing to restrict access to the LIA and to other potentially contaminated military Page | 133 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 areas and the need to continue environmental assessment and remediation activities. To address remaining uncertainties about residential soil contamination issues, ATSDR recommends surface soil sampling in the island's residential areas. 7.1 Introduction to Soil Pathway Several studies have examined soil contaminant levels in the Live Impact Area and elsewhere on Vieques . ATSDR evaluated the available data to determine potential effects for two situations: people who lived in areas of the LIA during 1999 2000, and people who lived (in the past and currently) on residential portions of the island. The chapter includes the following subjects: !D direct exposures; Documentation of available soil data, including a discussion of the strengths and limitations of the data for assessing exposures in the LIA or the residential portion of the island and a fresh analysis of the exposures of interest focusing on uncertainties in the available data; and Discussion of how the above analysis might be affected by recently collected soil data in areas of concern or areas not affected by aerial bombing exercises, and a discussion of other considerations raised by interested parties related to soil exposures. 7.1.1 Soil Exposure Pathways Environmental contaminants directly and indirectly affect the health of the planet and the people on it. ATSDR focuses on identifying exposures that might directly affect human health. For soil, we look at whether the small amount people might accidentally swallow or touch could contain enough of a particular chemical to cause health effects. Contaminated soil might also affect plants growing in it, which people might eat. And people might eat the animals that eat the plants growing in that contaminated soil. ATSDR considers such exposure pathways by looking at contaminant levels in the plants or animals that people actually use or eat. Characteristics of the contaminants, the soil, and the plants all affect the potential for plant uptake of contamination and may be important for food, medicinal, or ceremonial use of the plants or the animals feeding on them. For further information on exposure from plants or animals possibly affected by soil contaminants, please see Chapter 5 of this report, Local Produce and Livestock Pathway. ATSDR identified several ways soil contaminants might directly affect Viequens es. We considered past (i.e., both during military exercises and after), present (i.e., the past few years, after cessation of military exercises), and future potential soil exposure pathways. Table 7.1 below lists the identified direct-soil exposure pathways. For evaluating soil exposures from accidentally swallowing or touching soil, surface soil data are preferred. Generally, in day- to-day activities people are assumed to contact only the top few inches of soil. Household dust is also considered a soil pathway constituent, given that soil may contribute contaminants to dust when it is brought indoors on shoes or hands. Windblown soil may contribute contaminants to surface soil, but its health effects are generally considered part of the air pathway.

This sampling was a reconnaissance geochemical survey for metals only and included 420 samples across the entire island. In a later report the data were re-reported (Marsh 1992). In 1978, soil samples collected from four locations within the Live Impact Area (LIA) and two locations in the Eastern Maneuver Area (EMA) were analyzed for explosives and explosion combustion products (Hoffsommer and Glover 1978; Lai 1978). The exact sampling locations and depths were not given in the reports describing this sampling. In 1998, to describe existing conditions before a proposed airport expansion project, five soil samples (4 -12 inches below ground surface) from an area of the Naval Ammunition Support Detachment (NASD) buffer zone were collected and analyzed for a range of potential contaminants (PMC 1998). In 1999, about 33 surface soil samples (06 inches below ground surface) were collected along the western border of the EMA and analyzed for explosive compounds (CH2MHill and Baker 1999). In 1999 and 2000, soil and sediment samples from 55 locations were collected from the LIA and other locations and analyzed for metals and other inorganic compounds (Garc\u00eda et al. 2000). The report describing this sampling event states that samples were collected from direct bomb \u00ad impact locations, stormwater runoff areas, adjoining conservation zones, and civil ian areas, but exact locations of sampling and exact sampling depth and procedures were not given. Only the highest and second highest contaminant concentrations detected for 25 sample locations within the LIA were reported. In 2000, 37 surface soil samples (0 6 inches below ground surface) were collected within the LIA and adjoining conservation zones, including specific areas in the LIA occupied by protesters in 1999 and 2000 (CH2MHill 2000). These samples were analyzed for metals and explosives. Samples from the LIA were targeted to bomb craters or collection areas for stormwater runoff deemed likely to contain the highest level of explosive contaminants. Samples from protester camps were collected from locations thought to be representative of the gener al area. In 2001, to describe background conditions at the NASD, 24 surface soil samples (0 6 inches below ground surface) were collected and analyzed for inorganic compounds (CH2MHill 2002). Since 2003, several investigations of sites in the EMA, the Surface Impact Area (SIA), and the NASD have included surface soil sampling of between 4 and 50 samples per site (CH2MHill 2007a -c; 2008a-e). These investigations focused on known, localized areas of concern affected by Navy activities other than aerial explosive-ordnance exercises. Page | 136 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 In 2007, 40 surface soil samples (0 6 inches below ground surface) were collected from areas of East Vieques not obviously affected by Navy activities. The samples were analyzed for inorganic compounds to describe background conditions on eastern Vieques (CH2MHill 2007d). 7.1.3 Strengths and Limitations of Available Data for Assessing Soil Pathway Some of the above- contaminants in Vieques soil. Thus to assess potential soil exposures, ATSDR focused on two pathways: exposures to protesters who occupied parts of the LIA in 1999 and 2000, and exposures to bomb-related gths and limitations of the se applicable, available data. 7.1.3.1 Protesters Living in the Live Impact Area during 1999-2000 Although limited in number, the CH2MHill 2000 data are otherwise ideal for assessing exposures to protesters during 1999 2000: they match the locations and time people may have been exposed. Less specific information is known about the locations, analysis, and results reported in Garc\u00eda et al. (2000), but the samples were taken at the same general area and at the appropriate time. In both sets of data, samples from the LIA were selected from areas thought to be the most contaminated (i.e., bomb craters and stormwater runoff collection areas). The samples then were intended to describe conservatively the contaminant levels within the LIA. But the small number of samples compared with the large land area ! This is a common limitation of environmental sampling. A further limitation of both datasets is that they only apply to periods near the protester occupation. Finally, evaluating these datasets for health hazards of chemical constituents gives little information about other serious hazards of LIA occupation, such as physical hazards posed by unexploded ordnance. 7.1.3.2 Exposures in the Residential Area of the Island Because of current Navy property access restrictions, most exposures today would occur only in the \u0011 1972 gical survey \u0012 28 and just analyze for metals content. These data were distributed across the residential and other areas of the island. They may not provide accurate or complete information about the surface soil people accidentally swallow or touch in their day- to-day activities. Although other data contain more complete contaminant information for soils at the surface, they were collected from uninhabited parts of the island. One limitation of these data in describing exposures is that they may not accurately represent residential exposures. Nevertheless, despite the limited nature of the available data on residential soil contaminant levels, ATSDR accessed a combination of information related to soil contaminant levels elsewhere on the island. ATSDR used this information 1) to model predictions of how contaminants could be transported through air to residential areas, and 2) to reach scientifically based conclusions about the likelihood of military exercises contaminating residential soil at levels that could cause health effects. More information on the In general, the parent rock beneath the surface soil and subsoil layers. Page | 137 28 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 uncertainties posed by using limited data to evaluate soil exposures is provided below in 7.2, the Analysis section. 7.2 Analysis Among other Vieques health concerns ATSDR received were those related to contaminant exposure from military exercises involving explosive-ordnance in the LIA. Because of current Navy property access D 1999 and 2000, however, some protesters did occupy areas of the LIA. The following sections discuss the data available for assessing direct soil exposures of protesters living in the LIA during that period, and of Viequenses generally at other times in the past or present. In addition, surface soil sampling d ata !D 2003 soil pathway exposures. 7.2.1 Exposures of Protesters in the Live Impact Area During 1999 -2000 In 2000, surface soil samples were collected from the specific LIA locations where protesters lived in 1999 and 2000, as well as other LIA locations (CH2MHill 2000). Samples included low-lying areas that stormwater runoff would likely affect. Around the same time, an independent organization also collected soil samples at the LIA and in areas where people lived during 1999 2000 (Garc\u00eda et al. 2000). For this sampling, the exact location, depth of sampling, and full results were not reported. Because the Garc\u00eda et al. report stated that the intent of the study was to characterize exposure, in its previous evaluation ATSDR considered the results as surface soil samples. This resulted in conservative exposure estimates because Garc\u00eda et al. only reported the highest and next- to-highest values detected !D inclusion of these reported values in estimating average exposures biased the estimate to the high side. Although limited in number, the surface soil samples collected during 2000 were nearly ideal for assessing exposures to people occupying the LIA. Both in space and time the samples were representative of the soil people may have contacted while they were there. The CH2MHill 2000 data report included documentation of high standards of data quality such as quality assurance/quality control and chain of custody forms. In its previous assessment, ATSDR estimated doses using the highest concentration measured in the locations where protesters lived; the doses were all below then-current health effects levels (ATSDR 2003). Some critics of this analysis suggested that people in the camps might have been exposed to contaminants in other parts of the LIA. In respon se we examined whether our conclusion would change if we used the average inorganic contaminant concentrations measured throughout the LIA as an exposure concentration (a person spending time in both the camp and in other parts of the LIA would have an average exposure over all the surface soils encountered). Although the average exposure concentrations were biased high because the averages included only the maximum and second highest soil measurement detected from the Garc\u00eda et al. study (2000), the concentrations were only slightly !D F the previous public health assessment, exposure to these concentrations in surface soil would not be expected to result in adverse health effects (ATSDR 2003). ATSDR also looked at surface soil explosives data from other locations of the LIA collected in 2000 (CH2MHill 2000). Although those samples showed Page | 138 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 rare detections of HMX, RDX, 2-amino-DNT, and TNT, even the highest detected values were lower than screening values.29 The average soil concentration for every chemical measured is below the respective screening value, indicating that potential mixture effects are unlikely. Using the available data, we found no indication that protesters living on the LIA in 1999 2000 were exposed to harmful levels of surface soil contaminants. A strength of this conclusion is that the camp data were collected specifically to assess this exposure and were collected to represent the camps where protesters lived. In addition, the LIA samples were collected to assess the most contaminated areas on the LIA, so the conclusions would be based on contaminant levels that were biased high and would be more protective. A limitation is that, as with any evaluation of this type, conclusions must be based on a small number of samples. If further sampling were to show the earlier sampling did not result in a conservative or representative description of the area of exposure, the previous conclusions might not be valid. Another limitation of using these data to assess exposure is that they apply only to the specific scenario described. That is, is the data a re restricted to protesters living in camps on the LIA in 1999 2000. In the years long before 1999-2000, contaminant levels (especially explosives) could have been much higher and could have had the potential for short- or long-term health effects (we have no way of obtaining these data today). Also, despite the fact that around the year 2000 the surface soil contaminant levels in the LIA were not high enough to expect adverse health effects, that finding alone does not mean people could safely occupy the LIA. Physical hazards remained, such as unexploded ordnance that could cause immediate injury or death to those who inadvertently disturbed it. Because these hazards remain , limiting access to the LIA and to other contaminated military areas is essential for protecting public healthat least until those areas undergo a complete environmental assessment and cleanup. 7.2.2 Exposures in the Island's Residential Areas ial areas. The only soil data available from this section of the island were the 1972 U.S. Geological Survey data (Learned et al. 1973). Although the sample points were well distributed across residential and other areas of the island, the data described o \u0012 (in general, the parent rock beneath the surface soil and subsoil layers). The report did state that at many points the surface soil and subsoil layers were absent (i.e., the parent rock was exposed at the surface). But the specific samples to which this applied were not stated, and the sampling depth and conditions were not available on a sample- by- \u0012 accidentally swallow or touch in their day- to-day activities is unknown. Moreover, whether the parent \u0012 deposition of airborne contaminants (i.e., the mechanism by which contaminants from explosive-ordnance exercises are believed to reach soil). Although the residential soil data were limited, ATSDR could use the limited data and other information to reach scientifically based conclusions about the potential for exposures to bombing -related Levels at which no adverse health effects would be expected from even continual exposure. Page | 139 29 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 contaminants in residential soil to result in adverse health effects. In its previous health assessment, because the residential data were limited, ATSDR used the USGS data and several other data sources from different areas of the island to evaluate the potential for residential exposure to soil to harm health (CH2MHill and Baker 1999; Marsh 1992; PMC 1998). The evaluation included data from The LIA, The Eastern Maneuver Area (EMA), The EMA border, The residential area, and The Naval Ammunition Support Detachment (NASD). !D below which no health effects would be expected. Contaminants above the screening level were evaluated further by estimating exposure doses based on an average soil concentration. None of the contaminants in soil were at levels expected to result in harmful effects (ATSDR 2003). The soil pathway public health evaluation conforms to ATSDR procedures for reaching public health decisions when only limited environmental data are available. In addition, the air modeling results, discussed in the previous chapter, support the hypothesis that exploded or unexploded ordnance did not contaminate residential soils to harmful levels. Models indicated that airborne contaminants would disperse to undetectable levels away from the Live Impact Area. Although the analysis of all the information indicated that health effects from exposure to contaminants assumptions contain uncertainty. When using discrete environmental samples to describe a large area, uncertainty is always present. This is particularly true when data collected at one location form the basis for conclusions about another, unsampled location. Additional data uncertainties include Averaging soil results that might include subsurface samples is not necessarily representative of the concentrations present in the surface soil that people in their normal activities accidentally swallow or touch. Each investigation might have a different focus and might analyze for different sets of contaminants. Also, while inorganic contaminant levels are expected to remain relatively stable over time, other contaminant levels (e.g., those of volatile compounds, certain explosives) in surface soil might, through volatilization or chemical or biological degradation, be significantly reduced over time. Therefore, even if surface soil sampling were available, the results might not represent completely all potential past exposures. The majority of the more recent surface soil data were collected in the LIA. Because the LIA was !D concentrated on describing potential residential soil effects using LIA data. Because contaminants from the LIA would be dispersed by the time they reached the residential area, Page | 140 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 ! ! But Vieques was the site of past military activities other than those involving explosive ordnance (e.g., transportation, storage, general training). Conceivably these activities or even nonmilitary activities could result in different contaminant profiles in the residential portion of the island compared with the LIA. Such data limitations aside, ATSDR still maintains that any low-level, current residential area soil exposures to explosive ordnance-related contaminants in the LIA are unlikely to cause health effects. First, recent surface soil sampling in the LIA did not show contaminant levels of health concern. Second, air modeling indicates that any windborne contaminants from the LIA would be dispersed to undetectable levels away from the LIA. Nevertheless, given the uncertainties described above, ATSDR has updated its previous conclusion (ATSDR 2003) to acknowledge these limitations and indicate that the historical data are insufficient for us to determine whether past exposures to explosives or other compounds in surface soil could have been high enough for an elevated past risk of adverse health effects. 7.2.3 Recent Surface Soil Sampling Data on Areas of Concern !D E! ! ! the NASD have included surface soil sampling (CH2MHill 2007a-c; 2008a -e). The investigations focused on known, localized areas of concern affected by Navy activities other than explosive ordnance. This means the surface soil samples were probably not representative of residential area surface soils. ATSDR performed a preliminary evaluation of the surface soil results from these investigations, focusing on maximum detections of inorganic compounds above background and detections of organic compounds. Although several sites had contaminants higher than screening values, 30 current access restrictions due to ongoing remedial activity mean exposures to the public are unlikely. In any event, we saw no evidence that contamination associated with areas of concern was present outside the localized area. Examining the contaminants present may nonetheless provide clues to contaminants previously unrecognized but of possible concern in the residential area. For example, certain recent investigations have shown isolated detections of pesticides, semivolatile compounds, explosives, and dioxin compounds. We repeat that we have found no evidence these areas of contamination have spread beyond their isolated, local areas. Agencies responsible for characterizing the nature and extent of contamination in the future should ensure that all potential sources and contaminants are considered. 7.2.4 Recent Background Study Data Recent soil background studies at the NASD and on East Vieques (the EMA) characterized the soils in areas unaffected by Navy operations that is, not close to known, localized areas of concern and not in the runoff path from known military operations areas (CH2MHill 2001; CH2MHill 2007d). As described in the previous chapter, evaluation of the air pathway indicates that airborne contaminants would hardly be detectable after dispersing away from the bomb impact area. Examining results from background locations (not directly affected by military exercises) could be a way to confirm that soils are not Levels at which no adverse health effects would be expected from even continual exposure. Page | 141 30 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 currently affected by past airborne fallout of contaminants from military operations. The NASD background study, however, only included inorganics, and the East Vieques background study only included inorganics and explosives. While inorganic contaminant levels are usually relatively stable over time, levels of other contaminants (e.g., volatile compounds, certain explosives) in surface soil might, through volatilization or chemical or biological degradation, substantially reduce over time. For this reason, the background soil data were not useful for conclusions about past exposures to explosives or present and past exposures for nonanalyzed potential contaminants. In background samples, very few contaminants were present above screening values.31 Only total chromium slightly exceeded a screening value for hexavalent chromium. Chromium is a naturally occurring element as well as a potential contaminant. In soils it is found in several forms, including the most toxic hexavalent form (ATSDR 2000). Although the relative proportions of all the different forms of chromium were not analyzed, much of the total chromium measured probably consisted of less toxic chromium forms. In the EMA, the explosive 2-amino-DNT was detected in one sample, but it was well below the applicable screening value. The residential area of the island was much farther from the past military activities than were the background samples collected in these investigations. Dispersal would result in contaminant concentrations even lower in the residential areas than in the background sampling areas. These background data, then, further support the hypothesis that contaminants in surface soil in Vieques residential areas are not at levels known to cause health effects today. Yet detection of explosive residues in the background samples also suggested that all areas of the island, including the residential area, might have been affected by explosive compounds from past bombing activities. Although residual levels are low today, it is impossible to say what past levels were. 7.2.5 Additional Considerations Some Puerto Rican scientists suggested to ATSDR that evaluating surface soil samples collected from 0 6 inches below land surface would underestimate potential exposure to contaminants present at high concentration assumptions, such as assuming the contaminant was present only in the top inch rather than the entire 6 inches. For the available data, however, we determined this was an unrealistic assumption. Most surface soil data came from the LIA, where years of widespread bomb and projectile impacts and explosions would have stirred up huge amounts of soil; any resulting contaminants were likely distributed throughout more than just the top 6 inches. Likewise, many inorganic compounds are n aturally present throughout soil and would never be completely absent, regardless of depth. Given these considerations, we decided an analysis of the available data assuming that all contaminants were present in the top inch of soil would be misleading. In future surface soil sampling events, ATSDR recommends that agencies or researchers explore this issue further by analyzing the top inch of soil separately from the typical 0 6 inches or 0 3 inches collected. Levels at which no adverse health effects would be expected from even continual exposure. Page | 142 31 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 The conclusions and recommendations from ATSD below and in Chapter 9 of this report. 7.3 Conclusions and Recommendations 7.3.1 Conclusions 1. Those who occupied the LIA from 1999 2000 were not at increased risk of adverse health effects from exposure to surface soil contaminants. Supporting data are limited, but they are of good quality and represent the location and the period of interest. In the years before the late 1990s tests, contaminant levels in the LIA (especially explosives) might have been higher, but we have no historical data with which to evaluate this assumption. 2. This does not mean anyone can now safely visit the LIA. Remaining unexploded ordnance could cause immediate injury or death to anyone who might inadvertently disturb it. Recently collected data on specific areas of concern within military lands not the same areas accessed and occupied by protesters demonstrate the remaining potential for localized contamination, which, if people frequented those areas, could be of health concern. 3. Limited available data from other locations and air pathway considerations suggest that the military exercises in the LIA did not result in current contamination of residential soils with inorganic or explosive compounds at levels considered harmful. ATSDR arrives at this concl usion using a scientific evaluation of the available data. But again, data from other areas are limited in number, data for all potential contaminants of concern are not available, and no adequate surface soil data are available from the residential area itself. ATSDR nonetheless understands that community members remain concerned about residential soil exposures. 4. Modeling described in the air pathway discussion has suggested that airborne transport of contaminants during past military exercises would not have been substantial enough to have are not available to confirm this, nor will such data ever become available. Consequently, we cannot determine whether past exposures to explosives or other compounds in surface soil could have been heavy enough to increase a past risk of adverse health effects. 7.3.2 Recommendations 1. Continue to restrict access to the LIA and other potentially contaminated military areas and continue environmental assessment and remediation activities to clear the way for public access. 2. To help address community concerns regarding residential soil, work with local residents to design sampling to identify residential surface soil quality issues, whether or not those surface soil issues relate to past military activities: a. Focus initial sampling on areas identified as potential high-exposure areas, such as areas free of vegetation or child-use areas. Page | 143 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 b. To identify any possible differences in the top layer, initial sampling should analyze the top inch of soil separately from the rest of the 0 3 or 06 inch surface samples. c. Perform a full range of analyses to identify all possible contaminants. d. Plan and conduct sample collection and analysis to ensure the results meet high data quality standards. 3. Although this sampling might provide inferences about past exposures for compounds stable over time, such as metals or other inorganic compounds, it will provide no definitive information on past surface composition and no information on past levels of compounds that react or degrade over time. 4. ATSDR also recommends collection of representative soil samples as part of its evaluation of the terrestrial food chain pathway.

References ................................................................................................................................................................ 154 Chapter 8 Summary The following chapter evaluates the available data and information on contaminants in past and present drinking water sources on Vieques and whether consuming drinking water could make people sick. ATSDR considered three past or present drinking water sources: the current pipeline supply, public and private supply wells used in the past and still occasionally used when pipeline water is interrupted, and rainwater collection systems that may have been used in the past and may still be used. ATSDR determined that the limited available sampling data on the pipeline water supply system and the public and private wells indicate almost all these drinking water supplies are acceptable for their current uses. One private well was found to contain nitrate-nitrite levels that could be harmful; ATSDR recommended no one drink from this well. Ongoing monitoring of the current pipeline source water is required to ensure the supply meets drinking water standards, and repeating previous sampling of storage tanks, residential taps, and wells still in use would address remaining uncertainty associated with conclusions about the pipeline water and public and private wells. A lack of adequate historical data prevents ATSDR from making any conclusion about distant past (1970s and 1980s) public supply well exposures. Also, no data are available to evaluate past or present rainwater collection systems exposures; Since !TS\u0007R's 2001 drinking water public health assessment, more groundwater data have been collected. These data are not from current drinking water sources, so they do not provide additional exposure information. One study, however, provided results supporting !TS\u0007R's previous conclusion that contaminants in groundwater at the LIA could not reach the public water supply wells. The other studies focused on locally contaminated areas of concern not used for drinking water; they support the continuing need for characterization and eventual cleanup of source areas resulting from past military activities on Vieques. Page | 147 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 In addition to required testing of the pipeline source water, ATSDR recommends repeated sampling of the current public water supply (storage tanks and residential taps) and public and private wells still available for use to confirm the safety of the drinking water for consumption. Also, ATSDR recommends further evaluation of the use of rainwater collection systems and sampling if such systems are used for drinking water. 8.1 Introduction Many Viequenses remain concerned that military activities on and near the island might have contaminated Vieques drinking water, either currently or in the past. Vieques has or has had only three past or present drinking water sources: 1. Since 1978, the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority (PRASA) has provided drinking water through a pipeline from the main island. In some years, these operations were conducted by private companies contracted by PRASA. After transport from Puerto Rico, water is stored in tanks on Vieques. Most Viequens es use this water source. 2. Before 1978, public supply wells in the Esperanza well field (presumably operated by PRASA) and several private groundwater wells were sources of drinking water . Some of these wells are still used whenever water pipeline service is interrupted. 3. Reportedly, individual households use rainwater collection systems as sporadic, supplemental drinking water sources. How prevalent the systems are, or were in the past, is unclear. ATSDR evaluated available data to describe the safety of these potential drinking water sources on !D 8.2 Assessment of Available Dat a 8.2.1 Pipeline Water (Current Supply) In summer of 1999, the U.S.EPA and PRDOH collected and analyzed water samples from storage tanks for water piped from the main island and from residential water taps on Vieques (PRDOH 1999; USEPA 1999). To address quality control issues, in January 2000, U.S.EPA resampled some of the locations for explosives (USEPA 2000). In its previous assessment, ATSDR examined these data and found no contaminants above health or regulatory standards or obviously related to bombing activities, indicating that pipeline water was acceptable for consumption (ATSDR 2001). ATSDR recently obtained water quality reports of the source water dated from 2004 2009. These reports show that in 2004 2005, the action level for lead (15 g/L) was occasionally exceeded. This was attributed to corrosion in the piping system. In 2006 2007, the number of exceedances went up sharply, with 28 in 2007 alone. For that year, the 90th percentile of lead concentrations measured (the level below which 90% of the lead concentrations measured fall) was 144 g/L, greatly exceeding the action level. This level is a significant concern, especially to pregnant women and young children. The cause of the elevations in lead are unknown to ATSDR. But the water quality reports stated that immediate investigations were undertaken to identify the source of the lead and to address the problem. In 2008 and 2009, the number of Page | 148 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 exceedances was low (2 in 2008 and 4 in 2009); the 90th percentile of lead concentrations measured was well below the action level in both years. To summarize, testing of the supplied water did not indicate any contaminants were related to military exercises on Vieques . Still, continu ed safety of the pipeline water supply relies on continued monitoring of the water supply according to federal regulations and, if necessary, on prompt action to address violations. 8.2.2 Public and Private W ell Water A 1978 sampling event reported low levels of explosives or explosives byproducts in drinking water samples taken from two public supply wells in Esperanza and Isabel Segunda (Hoffsommer and Glover 1978; Lai 1978). In its previous assessment, ATSDR questioned these reported explosive detections because of the small number of samples collected and because the sample descriptions left uncertainty !D 2001 E that level in drinking water, the levels of explosives were too low to result in adverse health effects (ATSDR 2001). In 1995, PRDOH tested the public and private wells, as did U.S.EPA and Navy contractors in 1999 (PRDOH 1995a and 1995b; USEPA 1999; Baker 1999). ATSDR evaluated these results and found that most well water was safe to drink. One private well located on the residential portion of the island west of the EMA and LIA was found to contain high levels of nitrate-nitrite, which could pose a health hazard and were likely a result of agricultural activity or septic systems in the area. Residents were !D ! (LIA) were unlikely to affect groundwater in private and in former public supply wells groundwater did not move in the direction of the wells (ATSDR 2001). Although wells used previously as public water supplies would have been subject to drinking water regulations, ATSDR did not review historical reports on the water quality from the 1970s and 1980s or before. On the basis of our experience reviewing historical records, even if the records had been maintained and could be found, too many questions would arise as to quality control measures used, adequacy of the analytical methods used, and analytes measured to make the historical records useful for assessing past exposures. 8.2.3 Rainwater Collection Systems No information was available on rainwater collection systems. This included their prevalence, whether they had ever been used for drinking water, or whether they had ever been tested. In its previous Drinking Water PHA, ATSDR discussed but did not evaluate this potential exposure pathway. ATSDR had planned to lear contaminants to the residential portion of the island and potentially contaminate rainwater collection systems. As discussed in a previous chapter, this air analysis suggested the air pathway was unlikely to transport contaminants to the residential portion of the island at levels that might result in adverse health effects (ATSDR 2003). ATSDR did recommend that Puerto Rican authorities identify representative systems and test them to ensure those systems deliver safe water. To our knowledge, such sampling has not occurred (ATSDR 2001). ATSDR also recommended sampling sediment from rainwater collection systems as an indication of potential past water quality. Page | 149 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 8.2.4 Strengths and Limitations of Available Drinking Water Pathway Data 8.2.4.1 Pipeline Water The available data were collected and analyzed according to standard methods and procedures. But only one round of tank sampling occurred. Only one residential tap sample representative of the water supplied to residents was collected. It is possible that the available data may not fully represent the quality of this water source over time. In fact, recent water quality reports indicate that lead levels in the supplied water have exceeded drinking water standards, sometimes significantly, in some years. Although these elevated levels are not related to bombing activities, they highlight the need to monitor continually the public water supply to ensure its quality. According to the most recent water quality reports, lead levels in source water have only rarely exceeded standards since 2007. The levels of lead do not appear to be a current concern. 8.2.4.2 Public and Private Well Water The available, recent data were collected and analyzed according to standard methods and procedures. But, similar to the pipeline water, only one or two rounds of sampling occurred, limiting the confidence that the recent results will fully represent results from the 1970s, these data are insufficient for public health conclusions regarding past conditions. Only two samples were collected, and the sampling and the analysis lacked documented quality assurance. We assumed that any available water quality reports or testing from that period would be similar ly limit ed. 8.2.4.3 Rainwater Collection Systems No information was available on the prevalence of rainwater collection systems including whether they were ever used for drinking water or whether they were ever tested for contaminants. 8.3 Analysis safe. In response, ATSDR first evaluated the available data. The d evaluation conformed to ATSDR procedures for using limited available environmental data to reach public health conclusions. The focus was on exposures taking place at that time. Uncertainties did arise from the limited available data, which we discuss below. We also discuss new information that may add to the previous assessment of drinking water exposures in light of groundwater sampling data obtained !D 2001 8.3.1.1 Pipeline Water In 19992000, only one round of sampling appears to have been done for the tanks and for the residential tap water representative of the water supplied to residents. While conditions in the tanks and the tap water are not expected to change over time, greater confidence in the safety of the storage and distribution of the municipal supply could be gained by repeating the sampling and increasing the number of samples collected at the point of use. Although Puerto Rico water authorities regularly test Page | 150 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 the source water, recent (2004 2009) water quality reports have indicated intermittent problems with elevated levels of lead in the water. That water is from Puerto Rico and would not be affected by past military activities on Vieques. But regardless of the source, lead in drinking water is a concern, especially for pregnant women and growing children . Ongoing monitoring and prompt action to address drinking water violations are essential to ensure the continued safety. 8.3.1.2 Public and Private Well Water ATSDR identified two general uncertainties associated with the evaluation of the former public water supply wells and the private wells: Number of Data Points: The conclusions about the recent safety of the drinking water wells were based on one or two sampling events for each well (June August 1995 and September 1999). Because well conditions usually fluctuate over time , we would have greater confidence in the safety of water from these wells were multiple time points available, encompassing at least both the rainy and dry seasons. We recognize that due to shutdown, further sampling of some of the wells (e.g., Sun Bay) is impossible, and that if people are unable to drink the water, no exposure can occur. Also, that contaminants would fluctuate between extremely low levels an d levels of health concern is unlikely. Further testing would nonetheless engender greater confidence in the conclusion. Lack of Historical Data: The arguments given in the previous assessment support the conclusion that groundwater movement is impossible from the Live Impact Area to the aquifers used for !D Impact Area that was the focus of the petition then under consideration. But other military activities took place on Vieques, such as transportation, storage, and general training. These activities could have had spills or other releases that resulted in contaminants reaching the former public water supply. In addition, nonmilitary contaminant sources, such as spills, sanitary landfills, septic systems, or agricultural run-off, could also have affected the former public water supply . That explosives are or were recently present in the aquifer supplying the former municipal wells is unlikely, given that in the late 1990s nearby wells showed no detections. Yet explosives were possibly detected in the 1978 samples. But this detection was uncertain: only two samples were collected, and any mechanism by which the explosives could have entered the groundwater is unknown . Still, to be completely rigorous, we cannot dismiss entirely the possibility that explosive residues might have been present in the past in the drinking water supply. If such possible explosives detections were representative of the typical level in the public drinking water, that level was too low to result in health effects. But too few historical data points are available to confirm this conclusion. When the public supply wells were in operation, the owner would have been subject to drinking water regulations and should have collected and maintained water quality testing results. As described previously, however, ATSDR did not attempt to gather historical information on the water quality of these wells. Assuming data and testing reports were kept from the 1970s -1980s and could be located, numerous questions would remain, such as the accuracy and precision of the analytical methods used, the quality control Page | 151 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 measures employed, whether all contaminants of potential concern were analyzed, and whether the sampling in general was adequate to describe past water quality from the wells. Thus with regard to the past condition of any well-supplied public water, sufficient data will never become available to establish its safety fully . 8.3.1.3 Rainwater Collection Systems In its previous drinking water assessment, ATSDR did not evaluate this pathway it remains, however, a !D and currently, not likely a major contamination source for rainwater collection systems. Still, to confirm that the water is safe, sampling of representative systems would be necessary. In its previous assessment, ATSDR recommended that Puerto Rico authorities identify example systems and test them to ensure they delivered safe water. To our knowledge, this sampling has not yet occurred. If sampling were conducted today (i.e., years after active bombing ceased), it would not answer the question of whether contaminants might have entered such systems in the past. ATSDR also recommended sampling sediment from rainwater collection systems as an indication of potential past water quality. This sampling would be limited to insoluble contaminants or to contaminants that had precipitated out of solution, had settled out, and had remained unchanged over time. But as stated previously for well water systems, for rainwater collection systems complete information about every past potential contaminant and its past level will never become available. 8.3.1.4 Recent Data Since !D 2001 sampling. In 2004, additional sampling was conducted for the wells along the western border of the Eastern Maneuver Area (EMA) (CH2MHill 2005). Groundwater analysis detected no explosives, semi-volatile organic compounds, herbicides, pesticides, PCBs, or dioxins. One inorganic (barium) and two volatile organic compounds (bromodichloromethane and chloroform) were 32 detected above screening values. Because a groundwater flow s tudy done in conjunction with the investigation showed that groundwater did not flow from the EMA toward the western border, such exceedances w ere thought more likely to result from background or from recharge of municipally treated water than from past military activities. ATSDR determined that all the substances f ound in the investigation were at levels not expected to cause adverse health effects i f people drank the water. Although limited in scope, this s tudy provided additional evidence supporting th military operations, could not physically move westward toward the aquifers f ormerly used as a public water supply. The results of the study do not exclude the possibility for other groundwater contamination caused by military or nonmilitary activities hy drogeologically connected to the groundwater that supplies pu blic and private wells. Levels at which no adverse health effects would be expected from even continual exposure. Page | 152 32 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 !D the extent of contamination at localized groundwater areas of concern identified through the remedial process (CH2MHill 2007a c;2008a e). Several contaminants were found at levels that would make the associated groundwater unsuitable for consumption. These studies do not address potential drinking water sources. But they do support the need for characterization and eventual cleanup of source areas resulting from past military activities on Vieques. !D e drinking water pathway appear below and are in Chapter 9 of this report. 8.4 Conclusions and Recommendations 8.4.1 Conclusions 1. The available sampling data of Vieques storage tanks and representative drinking water taps indicate that at the time of sampling, the public drinking water supplied via pipeline from Puerto Rico was acceptable to drink. This conclusion, however, is uncertain due to the limited number of samples and lack of additional rounds of confirmatory sampling. Public water supplies are tested regularly and have to meet water quality criteria. We have reviewed recent water quality reports indicating that lead levels have been a problem in the drinking water supply, although those problems appear to have been addressed now . Ongoing monitoring of the current pipeline source water and prompt action to address problems is required to ensure the supply meets drinking water standards. 2. Limited, late 1990s sampling data from public and private wells indicated that most of the wells are acceptable for occasional consumption, such as when the pipeline source is interrupted.33 Flow patterns preclude groundwater from the east (where most military operations occurred) affecting the public aquifers. And with the exception of one well, all groundwater contaminants were below ATSDR health screening values. But again, confidence in the conclusions is tempered by the limited number of sampling rounds, which might not have captured seasonal fluctuations in contaminant levels. Also, a lack of adequate historical data prevents ATSDR from making any conclusion about past public supply well exposures (i.e., the 1970s and 1980s). 3. Although additional sampling might change the result, ATSDR confirms its previous conclusion that nitrate-nitrite levels in one private well would pose a health hazard, especially to children. Regardless of the source of this contamination, water from this well should not be consumed unless proven safe by further, comprehensive testin g. 4. No data are available to evaluate rainwater collection systems for past or present exposure potential to contaminants. Rainwater collection systems remain a potential exposure pathway. 5. Past military activities did affect groundwater, but the affected groundwater is not currently used for drinking water. 33 Although t \u0011 \u0011 ls and the private wells can still supply drinking water. Page | 153 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 8.4.2 Recommendations 1. Continue required monitoring of the public water supply source water and take prompt action to address any exceedances of drinking water standards. Repeat the 1999 2000 storage tank and residential tap sampling, including a wider selection of representative taps. This could confirm the conclusion that the present public water supply is acceptable to drink. 2. Conduct additional sampling of the wells still available for use during pipeline ser vice interruptions. This too could confirm the safety of drinking water from these wells. 3. Determine whether people drink water from rainwater collection systems, and if so, test the collected water to evaluate its safety. Additionally, sample the sediment from these systems; 4. Do not use groundwater beneath the LIA and other former military operations for drinking water; continue environmental assessment and remediation activities to identify and clean up impacted groundwater. 8.5 References [ATSDR] Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. 2001.

We visited Vieques, where we discussed public health concerns. We discussed those concerns with local officials, with scientists, and with the Viequenses themselves. We held a meeting with other scientists in which we discussed the most current Vieques research and studies. Our conclusions and recommendations for the Vieques site and community regarding the environmental media, biomonitoring, and health outcomes follow. Page | 157 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 9.2 Consumption of Fish from Reefs off the Vieques Coast 9.2.1 Conclusions D !D , 2009 meeting, several scientists raised concerns about mercury levels in fish. !D 2003 F ! the 2004 U.S.EPA/FDA national advisory concerning mercury. Therefore, ATSDR reviewed its 2 003 conclusions and recommendations about mercury in fish from reefs surrounding Vieques. In its 2003 public health assessment regarding fish consumption, ATSDR used fish intake rates that focused on adults who ate 8 ounces of fish daily and who weighed 70 kg (or 154 pounds). Daily fish intakes rates for children were 4 ounces and children were assumed to weigh 16 kg (or 35 pounds). E !D 03 \u00b5 an analysis of the Seychelles Island and Faroese !D as presented in this report, ATSDR used a broad range of daily fish intakes and body weights. Using information from U.S.EPA Exposure Factor Handbook, ATSDR assumed that daily fish intakes for adult women were a s high as 14 ouncesthe 99th percentile and that women weigh as little as 46 kg (or 100 pounds). For children, ATSDR assumed that daily fish intakes were as high as 6 ounces for 1- to 2-year old children, 8 ounces for 3- to 5-year old children, 10 ounces for 6- to 14-year old children, and 20 ounces for 15- to 18-year old children. The highest intakes for children represent the 99th percentile portion size for the stated !D ! U.S.EPA D fD) concerning mercury as well as human toxicity studies from the Faroe Islands. From its evaluation of mercury in Vieques fish, ATSDR reached these new conclusions: 1. ATSDR has identified mercury exposure from frequent consumption of marine seafood as a potential public health hazard. Women with a varied fish diet who typically eat more than 2 oz of fish every day have estimated mercury doses that exceed U.S.EPA D ! size increases, the estimated doses approach the lowest level known to cause harmful effects to the developing fetus . ATSDR concludes that if these women are pregnant, their developing baby has a small increased risk of neurological effects later in life. The risk of harmful effects increases as portion size increases. Possible harmful effects identified from studies of non-Viequense children exposed in utero involve language, attention, and memory, and to a lesser extent visual/spatial and motor functions. 2. Women who eat grunt or hind more frequently than other reef fish and who typically eat more than 2 oz of fish every day have estimated mercury doses two times higher than women who eat a varied fish diet. As portion size increases, the estimated doses for women who eat larger portions daily (e.g., 10 to 14 oz) approaches or exceeds the lowest level known to cause harmful effects in the developing fetus. ATSDR concludes that if these women are pregnant, their developing baby has a small increased risk of neurological effects later in life. The risk of harmful effects increases as portion size increases. Possible harmful effects identified from studies of non-Viequense children exposed in utero involve language, attention, and memory, and to a lesser extent visual/spatial and motor functions. Page | 158 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 3. Children with a varied fish diet who typically eat more than 0.5 oz of fish every day have estimated mercury doses that exceed U.S.EPA D neurological effects. But as portion size increases, the risk of harmful effects increases. Depending upon their age, children as young as 1 year who eat 3 to 4 ounces of fish every day have estimated doses that exceed doses known to cause neurological effects and have the greatest risk of harmful neurological effects. Possible harmful effects identified from studies of non-Viequense children exposed in utero involve language, attention, and memory, and to a lesser extent visual/spatial and motor functions. 4. Like women, children who eat grunt and hind more frequently than other reef fish have estimated doses two times higher than children who eat a varied fish diet. The estimated doses in these children exceed the doses associated with neurological effects. 5. Some uncertainty is associated with somewhat uncertain. The uncertainty could be due to sex, genetics, health and nutritional status, or how mercury is handled in the body. In the three human studies that focused on mercury exposure from eating fish and seafood, the identification of the lowest-effect levels was uncertain. Estimating the mercury dose from eating reef fish was likewise uncertain, given that the dose could vary depending on the type, frequency, and quantity of fish eaten. 6. While ATSDR supports the U.S.EPA FD! advisory do not apply to the Viequens es who rely heavily on local seafood. For example, the advisory discusses fish that Viequenses do not eat, such as pollock, catfish, and tilefish. In addition, the advisory recommends that if a local advisory is not available, people should not eat more 6 ounces of local fish and should not consume any other fish during the week . We include links to the advisory for informational use and have recommended an educational program about mercury in locally consumed fish. 7. Residents need information so they can select local seafood lower in mercury over seafood higher in mercury. This will protect developing fetuses and young children from mercury in fish. For informational purposes only, the advisory and related information is available at: http:// www.epa.gov/waterscience/fish/advice ; http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodSafety/Product\u00ad SpecificInformation/Seafood/FoodbornePathogensContaminants/Methylmercury/ucm115662.h tm, and Chapter 2, Section 2 .7 of this report, Appendix 2A- 3. 8. For the 104 fish samples collected from the marine areas near Vieques and from the commercial fish market, the average mercury level was 0.1 ppm and the range was nondetectable to 0.33 ppm. The mercury levels detected in Vieques reef fish are similar to levels reported by the FDA (FDA 2010). The mercury levels are in the low (0.02 0.2 ppm) to mid (0.2 0.6 ppm) mercury range identified by FDA in its recent risk and benefit assessment (FDA 2009). Page | 159 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 9. ATSDR also conducted a statistical analysis of the 2001 fish data and concluded the following : a. Mercury detected in the seafood is higher in two fish families (grunt and hind) compared with other families sampled (e.g., parrotfish and snapper). The average mercury concentration in grunt and hind was higher than U.S.EPA 0049 testing some of the hypotheses, ATSDR used the overall average of 0.1 ppm to determine which families of reef fish were likely to exceed the overall average. b. Mercury levels in parrotfish were statistically lower than U.S.EPA 0049 -ppm screening level and lower than the 0.1-ppm overall average. c. All snapper were lower than U.S.EPA 0049 \u0011 number of snapper were collected to determine whether the average snapper-mercury level was statistically different from the U.S.EPA 0.049 ppm screening level. A sufficient number of snapper were collected to determine that the average mercury level is statistically lower than the 0.1-ppm overall average. 10. Mercury is present in most seafood and is particularly high in some fish species and low in other species. While mercury was a component of the detonators of some bombs, only small amounts of mercury were introduced to the Vieques environment from this source. This conclusion is supported by the low mercury levels in LIA soils, which appear to be at naturally occurring levels. Mercury levels in fish in and around the LIA are most likely the result of the global reservoir of mercury circulating in the environment. 11. Statistical analysis showed that some fish and shellfish from certain reefs surrounding Vieques had higher levels of some metals and lower levels of other metals iron, aluminum, copper, zinc, arsenic, barium, potassium and selenium were all slightly higher compared to other reefs surrounding Vieques. These metals are materials found in bombs and in metal ships, suggesting possible localized contamination. But the levels were only slightly higher and the difference was statistically significant only for some reefs compared with other reefs surrounding Vieques. 9.2.2 Recommendations ATSDR recommends the following for consideration by environmental and public health agencies and scientists: 1. People who frequently consume marine seafood should follow available fish advisories and fishing restrictions in Vieques. Maintain the fishing restrictions in the waters adjacent to the LIA. 2. Conduct a survey of Vieques residents to determine the types, frequency, and quantity of fish consumed. 3. Conduct additional risk assessments and statistical analyses using new information gathered from the previously recommended fish consumption survey. 4. Collect and analyze additional fish samples from Vieques should the proposed survey and statistical analysis not provide sufficient public health information. Collect sufficient fish samples to allow analysis by species and by location. Page | 160 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 5. Develop an educational program about mercury in fish that incorporates local habits and Benefits accrue to the developing fetus with maternal intake of nutrients in seafood (FDA 2009) that can outweigh the concomitant intake of small amounts of mercury. The goal of this site-specific educational program should be to educate Viequenses about the benefits of eating seafood so they can choose fish lower in mercury and still maintain their healthy dietary customs of consuming local seafood. 9.3 Biomonitoring 9.3.1 Conclusions 1. Since 1999, Vieques has hosted at least five human biomonitoring investigations. Puerto Rican scientists, physicians, or the Puerto Rico Department of Health (PRDOH) conducted all of them. The PRDOH has conducted the most extensive sampling effort, collecting biological specimens from 500 randomly selected Viequenses. The PRDOH manuscript reported that in 20% of the participants, either a. Aluminum, lead, or mercury in blood; b. Uranium, cadmium, or nickel in urine; or c. Nickel or arsenic in hair exc D hair dyes, as well as the consumption of seafood, as possible sources for some but not all the elevated levels. The PRDOH manuscript acknowledged that for some residents, it could not identify the source of high metal levels in urine, hair, and blood. The PRDOH manuscript did not D residents had elevated levels of mercury in hair, and that the most likely source was fish consumption; other possible sources, however, were not completely ruled out. 2. Data from these studies showed that in blood, urine, hair, or feces, some residents of Vieques had elevated levels of various metals. While some of these elevated levels might be explained by cigarette use, seafood consumption, or hair dyes, they do not account for all the elevated levels. In particular, biomonitoring results from Dr. Ortiz Roque showed that some Viequenses had elevated mercury in hair above 12 ppm, the level identified by the NAS to cause harm in 5% of fetuses exposed in utero . Dr. Ortiz Roque also showed that mercury in hair was associated with fish consumption. In contrast, the PRDOH study did not find excessive mercury levels in blood, although the study either did not measure for or did not report mercury levels in hair. Thus the prevalence of high mercury levels in Viequenses remains somewhat uncertain. Except for mercury, metal content in hair is difficult to interpret. Metals can bind directly to hair from the use of commercial hair products, making difficult any distinction between internal metal exposure via ingestion and inhalation and external exposure resulting from contact with the metal in the environment (e.g., shampoo, dyes, dirt). 3. those who had excessive metals in hair, urine, or blood. The PRDOH study came closest to Page | 161 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 identifying possible sources (e.g., cigarette and hair dye use, seafood consumption) but acknowledged an inability to identify the source or sources for all residents with excessive metals exposure. Either through the survey instrument or through an in-home visit, it may be possible to identify other sources that increase metal exposure, such as cooking utensils, metal residues in foods (e.g., tea and vegetables), consumption of drinks with metallic packaging, religious rites using mercury-containing capsules, skin creams, antacid formulations an d antiperspirant formulations. 4. ATSDR remains cautious in making decisions about using hair as an indicator of exposure to environmental contaminants and as an indicator of risk of harmful effects. A major problem in interpreting metal concentrations in hair is whether the metal content resulted from internal exposure (e.g., from ingestion or inhalation) or from external exposure (e.g., the hair coming in contact with a metal-containing product). Currently, no washing method is capable of removing exogenous metal contaminants while leaving endogenous metals undisturbed. Chemicals such as methylmercury, which originate generally from dietary sources, suffer less from this drawback, provided unusual sources of inorganic mercury do not complicate the picture, (e.g., mercury vapor in occupational or home settings). 5. These biomonitoring results do not permit any conclusions about exposure to the bombing- related contaminants. 9.3.2 Recommendations 1. Viequenses may be exposed to mercury in fish and cadmium in pigeon pe as. These exposures may warrant additional environmental investigations, such as sampling locally grown produce for cadmium and gathering more information about fish consumption and possibly mercury in fish. The information could be used to decide whether to undertake human testing for mercury and cadmium in blood or urine. If other environmental exposures are identified, additional human biomonitoring investigations may be considered. More detailed information about !D and locally grown produce can be found in Chapter 2, Section 2.3.2 and Chapter 5, Section 5.3.2, respectively. 2. ATSDR is not recommending a comprehensive, systematic biomonitoring effort at this time because we found little evidence of current exposure to contaminants from past military activities. Many chemicals are short-lived in the human body and thus cannot be measured through a biomonitoring program if the exposure occurred some time ago. Public health officials could consider a targeted human biomonitoring investigation following the release of this report, for example, by testing for excessive mercury exposure from eating fish. If a biomonitoring investigation is conducted, it should include a comparison group from mainland Puerto Rico. If requested, CDC/ATSDR subject matter experts will provide technical assistance and support to public health officials or scientists in planning and conducting such an investigation. Page | 162 2 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 3. Viequenses who remain concerned about exposure to mercury, cadmium, other metals, or metalloids should consult their healthcare provider to discuss the need for and cost of testing. A qualified laboratory should do the testing and analysis. 4. CDC/ATSDR can provide a list of qualified laboratories that can perform the tests . A nd if requested, CDC/ATSDR can provide information to healthcare providers about tests for metals in biologic samples. 9.4 Health Outcome Data 9.4.1 Conclusions 1. The documents ATSDR reviewed paint a complex health picture for Viequenses. The findings of these studies indicate elevations in chronic disease prevalence, cancer incidence, and cancer mortality among the population between Vieques and the rest of Puerto Rico. In addition, increased mortality in Vieques particularly from cancer may indicate lack of access to appropriate medical care. The limitations associated with these analyses, particularly the methodological concerns discussed in this report, introduce considerable uncertainty and make interpretation difficult. Some of the methodological concerns previously noted include more exhaustive cancer case finding in Vieques than in the rest of Puerto Rico; differential follow-up, chronic disease prevalence estimates based on a symptom disease prevalence survey without medical record confirmation of health outcomes; and limited noncancer mortality data. Differential follow up and exhaustive case finding may result in biased estimates of cancer incidence and mortality. Uncertainty is also evident in the wide confidence intervals reported indicating imprecise estimates of cancer incidence and mortality ratios in Vieques relative to the rest of Puerto Rico (RCCPR 2009). This is not unusual when calculating estimates for small populations. status. 9.4.2 Recommendations Assess the feasibility of applying the SMART BRFSS methods for generating stable Vieques specific prevalence estimates on asthma, diabetes, hypertension, and other chronic diseases. 9.5 Local Produce and Livestock Pathway 9.5.1 Conclusions 1. The overall data are insufficient to quantify adequately human exposures or draw any valid health conclusions about whether consuming locally grown produce and livestock would result in harmful health effects. 2. Limited sampling data are available for pigeon peas, a staple food among Viequenses. Interpretation of these data is uncertain because of the lack of adequate QA/QC information for the analytical findings. Page | 163 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 a. A preliminary data evaluation completed for this report has concluded that the level of cadmium reported in a few samples of locally grown pigeon peas would not contribute excess dietary cadmium to preschool children who eat less than 5 of the largest (6 ounces) servings per week of locally grown pigeon peas. Adults who eat the largest serving sizes (12 ounces) should limit intake to 11 servings per week. b. Preschool children who eat a typical serving size (1.5 ounces) may eat up to 20 meals per week and adults who eat a typical serving (3 ounces) may eat up to 44 meals per week without exceeding recommended cadmium intake levels. c. Exceeding recommended levels of cadmium in the diet would not typically result in immediate health harm. Excessive intake of cadmium over decades could contribute to harmful levels of cadmium accumulation in the kidneys, possibly resulting in kidney disease. Typically, only a very small fraction (5%) of cadmium in food is absorbed in the body, especially in individuals with healthy diets containing adequate amounts of essential minerals such as zinc, iron and calcium (Reeves and Chaney, 2008). 3. Whether the limited sampling results are representative of cadmium concentrations in other locally grown pigeon peas is unclear; but the significant uncertainty in the evaluation stresses the need to conduct further sampling. 4. Preliminary evaluation results and the totality of the available data suggest a potential for uptake of metals from soil into food crops thus further investigation is warranted. To evaluate better this exposure pathway, ATSDR has recommended a collaborative effort to conduct additional sampling of locally grown foods. 9.5.2 Recommendations ATSDR supports additional sampling and collaborative data collection to evaluate more thoroughly this human exposure pathway. The following recommendations are intended to promote collection of high quality data of maximum utility, and to minimize data uncertainties: 1. Sampling data should represent edible portions of a cross-section of local produce from local farms, home gardens, and local markets. Sample produce that tends to accumulate heavy metals more easily (e.g., leafy vegetables such as lettuce and spinach) rather than leaves of grain or fruit crops. 2. Survey residents to identify the prevalence and type of locally grown and commonly consumed garden produce. Sampling plan design should include produce types identified from this survey. 3. Collect representative surface soil samples at the same location and time that garden and farm produce samples are taken. Soil samples should be of appropriate depth to represent the root zone. 4. Collect samples of meat and milk products from Vieques forage-consuming livestock. 5. To avoid false high or low values, sample collection and analysis should conform to high standards of data quality, including detailed quality assurance/quality control information, Page | 164 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 standard reference materials for analysis, and background correction. Design the sampling plan to collect a sufficient number of samples to ensure high statistical confidence. 6. Collect samples from an appropriate background or control location for comparison with food samples produced on Vieques. 7. To facilitate exposure assessment, report data as consumed (wet weight). 8. Plan and conduct sampling protocols in collaboration with local scientists. One way to avoid misunderstandings about the data is for local scientists and an independent expert jointly collect and split several samples and provide analytical reports with QA/QC supporting information. A QA/QC standard could be split at the time the samples are collected. 9. Request technical assistance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) in sample collection and analytical protocols. The USDA Agriculture Research Service has offered to provide, if requested, technical assistance in sampling plan design, collection, and analysis with proper QA/QC protocols. 9.6 Air Pathway 9.6.1 Conclusions 1. This review of potential airborne exposures within the residential areas of Vieques to contaminants from military operations at the former Vieques Naval Training Facility is based on the following sources of information that were used in the 2003 ATSDR PHA : a. U.S. Navy records of the types and amounts of ordnance used at the training range, b. A source term model used to estimate the amounts of material produced by ordnance detonations, c. An air dispersion model to estimate contaminant transport from the detonation area to the residential areas, d. Long term meteorological data from the San Juan PR airport and the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station, and e. Ambient air monitoring in the residential areas conducted by the PREQB for the 2001- 2003 time period. Also summarized are air monitoring data and air dispersion studies developed or collected after publication of the 2003 Air PHA for the purpose of evaluating ongoing or proposed open detonation or open burning. 2. This review of potential airborne exposures evaluates the modeling process used in the 2003 Air PHA, the assumptions and data used in the modeling process, and compares the results of that modeling process with monitored data collected during recent open burning events. 3. While this review finds the Air PHA modeling process consistent with established modeling practices, it does identify two minor errors in estimating detonation source concentrations. One Page | 165 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 results in an overestimate of metals concentrations. The other results in a minor underestimate of explosion byproducts in entrained soil that is overcompensated by the overall estimate of explosive compound concentrations. These errors do not affect the results or conclusions of the Air PHA. 4. Collectively, the available sampled and modeled data are adequate for the determination of the potential public health hazard from exposure to airborne contamination. The uncertainties inherent in the 2003 ATSDR air dispersion model have been adequately addressed by overestimating numerous aspects of the contaminant emissions and by assessing exposures for worst-case conditions. Despite the overestimation of potential exposures, the model results indicate that airborne contaminants from historic uses of the Vieques Naval Training Range would have been essentially nondetectable in the residential areas of Vieques and unlikely to E\u0011 and recent air sampling data and by -PHA air sampling and air dispersion modeling. Collectively, the available data provide an adequate basis for the public health conclusions in the Air PHA. 5. To conduct its health protective evaluation of potential exposures to airborne contaminants from military exercises at the former Vieques Naval Training Facility, the ATSDR Public Health Assessment used appropriate modeling procedures and available monitoring data. The additional air dispersion modeling and monitoring data conducted after completion of the Air ! !D \u0011 not likely have produced measurable concentrations of airborne contaminants in the residential areas of Vieques, no public health basis supports additional air studies or ambient air monitoring efforts related to past military exercises on Vieques. 6. Although the residents of Vieques could hear and possibly feel the explosions from military exercises on the former Vieques Naval Training Range, 8 miles is still a considerable distance. The physics of sound and seismic wave migration are very different from the physics of atmospheric dispersion of airborne particulates and gases. 9.6.2 Recommendations: No further recommendations at this time. 9.7 Soil Pathw ay 9.7.1 Conclusions 1. Those who occupied the LIA from 1999 2000 were not at increased risk of adverse health effects from exposure to surface soil contaminants. Supporting data are limited, but they are of good quality and represent the location and the period of interest. In the years before the late 1990s tests, contaminant levels in the LIA (especially explosives) might have been higher, but we have no historical data with which to evaluate this assumption. 2. This does not mean anyone can now safely visit the LIA. Remaining unexploded ordnance could cause immediate injury or death to anyone who might inadvertently disturb it. Recently Page | 166 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 collected data on specific areas of concern within military lands not the same areas accessed and occupied by protesters demonstrate the remaining potential for localized contamination, which, if people frequented those areas, could be of health concern. 3. Limited available data from other locations and air pathway considerations suggest that the military exercises in the LIA did not result in current contamination of residential soils with inorganic or explosive compounds at levels considered harmful. ATSDR arrives at this conclusion using a scientific evaluation of the available data. But again, data from other areas are limited in number, data for all potential contaminants of concern are not available, and no adequate surface soil data are available from the residential area itself. ATSDR nonetheless understands that community members remain concerned about residential soil exposures. 4. Modeling described in the air pathway discussion has suggested that airborne transport of contaminants during past military exercises would not have been substantial enough to have ilable to confirm this, nor will such data ever become available. Consequently, we cannot determine whether past exposures to explosives or other compounds in surface soil could have been heavy enough to increase a past risk of adverse health effects. 9.7.2 Recommendations 1. Continue to restrict the LIA and other potentially contaminated military areas and continue environmental assessment and remediation activities to clear the way for public access. 2. To help address community concerns regarding residential soil, work with local residents to design sampling to identify residential surface soil quality issues, whether or not those surface soil issues relate to past military activities: a. Focus initial sampling on areas identified as potential high-exposure areas, such as bare areas or child-use areas. b. To identify any possible differences in the top layer, initial sampling should analyze the top inch of soil separately from the rest of the 0 3 or 06 inch surface samples. c. Perform a full range of analyses to identify all possible contaminants. d. Plan and conduct sample collection and analysis to ensure the results meet high data quality standards. 3. Although this sampling might provide inferences about past exposures for compounds stable over time, such as metals or other inorganic compounds, it will provide no definitive information on past surface composition and no information on past levels of compounds that react or degrade over time. 4. ATSDR also recommends collection of representative soil samples as part of its evaluation of the terrestrial food chain pathway. See Chapter 5 of this report for details. Page | 167 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 9.8 Drinking Water Pathway 9.8.1 Conclusions 1. The available sampling data of Vieques storage tanks and representative drinking water taps indicate that at the time of sampling, the public drinking water supplied via pipeline from Puerto Rico was acceptable to drink. This conclusion, however, is uncertain due to the limited number of samples and lack of additional rounds of confirmatory sampling. Public water supplies are tested regularly and have to meet water quality criteria. We have reviewed recent water quality reports indicating that lead levels have been a problem in the drinking water supply, although those problems appear to have been addressed now. Ongoing monitoring of the current pipeline source water and prompt action to address problems is required to ensure the supply meets drinking water standards. 2. Limited, late 1990s sampling data from public and private wells indicated that most of the well s are acceptable for occasional consumption, such as when the pipeline source is interrupted. 34 Flow patterns preclude groundwater from the east (where most military operations occurred) affecting the public aquifer. And with the exception of one well, all groundwater contaminants were below ATSDR health screening values. But again, confidence in the conclusions is tempered by the limited number of sampling rounds, which might not have captured seasonal fluctuations in contaminant levels. Also, a lack of adequate historical data prevents ATSDR from making any conclusion about past public supply well exposures (i.e., the 1970s and 1980s). 3. Although additional sampling might change the result, ATSDR confirms its previous conclusion that nitrate-nitrite levels in one private well would pose a health hazard, especially to children. Regardless of the source of this contamination, water from this well should not be consumed unless proven safe by further, comprehensive testing. 4. No data are available to evaluate rainwater collection systems for past or present exposure potential to contaminants. Rainwater collection systems remain a potential exposure pathway. 5. Past military activities did affect groundwater under some specific military areas, but the affected groundwater is not currently used for drinking water. 9.8.2 Recommendations 1. Continue required monitoring of the public water supply source water and take prompt action to address any exceedances of drinking water standards. Repeat the 1999- 2000 storage tank and residential tap sampling, including a wider selection of representative taps. This could confirm the conclusion that the present public water supply is acceptable to drink. 2. Conduct additional sampling of the wells still available for use during pipeline service interruptions. This too could confirm the safety of drinking water from these wells. 34 Although t \u0011 \u0011 wells and the private wells can still supply drinking water. Page | 168 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 3. Determine whether people drink water from rainwater collection systems, and if so, test the collected water to evaluate its safety. Additionally, sample the sediment from these systems; 4. Do not use groundwater beneath the LIA and other former military operations for drinking water; continue environmental assessment and remediation activities to identify and clean up impacted groundwater. 9.9 Final Summary ATSDR conducted a thorough review of environmental, biological, and health outcome data from the Island of Vieques. We carefully considered the data and information from Puerto Rican and other scientists who spent considerable effort and time, sometimes at their own expense, to research environmental health issues in Vieques. We are grateful for their efforts. Nevertheless, as with any site that has had such a long history of environmental investigations, those data have strengths and weaknesses that become important in public health decision-making. At times, the data can raise as many questions as they can provide answers. One such situation is mixtures. ATSDR recognizes the possibility that this report cannot address accurately the effects of mixtures and cumulative exposures on the health of Viequenses. Sometimes this is the result of a lack of data; other times it is a limitation of the science. ATSDR has published !D 2004 among our staff. But we recognize the continuing debate among scientists on these subjects and that no these effects accurately. Further, we are aware of the literature that examines the physical and psychological health effects stress can have on a community such as Vieques, given its six decades of military activiti es and lingering stress is a risk factor in cardiac disease and contributes to the onset of autoimmune diseases. Chronic stress also is an important factor in premature aging. Finally, as we stated at the outset of this report, ATSDR recognizes that Viequenses are concerned about the health of everyone who lives on their island . We hope the conclusions and recommendations in this report will raise public -being, and protect the health of all Viequenses.

A-76 Page | A-2 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 Category: Environmental Data - Radiation Date of Publication: November 9, 2001 Title: Dramatic Increase in Radiation in Vieques Author(s): Frankie Jimenez Affiliation: Committee for the Rescue and Development of Vieques (CRDV) Publication Status: Press Release Peer Review Status: None Cited Previously by ATSDR: Yes (2003 Public Health Assessment: Air Pathway Evaluation) Study Findings In 2001, after two rounds of bombing in Vieques, radiation sampling resulted in these findings: Table A-1. Radiation sampling in Vieques, 2001 Date Sampling Location Radiation Level June 2001 Civilian areas Yayi Beach (near bombing range) No increase 60% increase September - October 2001 Esperanza Beach (civilian area, south coast) Main town (Isabel II, north coast) 248% increase 225% increase The authors attributed the radiation increase to soil dispersion contaminated by past use of depleted uranium (DU) penetrators at the Live Impact Area (LIA). The press release did not indicate how levels of radiation were measured, what types of radiation were measured, or the actual amounts of radiation detected. The press release did, however, condemn future bombing exercises planned for November December 2001. How ATSDR Addressed the Study Findings In 2002, ATSDR contacted the Committee for the Rescue and Development of Vieques (CRDV) to learn more about this sampling effort, but did not receive a response. The allegation that radiation levels increased on Vieques during military training exercises could not be confirmed. No public health Page | A-3 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 decisions could be made based on a reported 248% increase in radiation levels without data. The more important indicator of exposure is the actual level of radiation, not the relative increase. No confirmation of statements made in the press release could be obtained. Nonetheless, in Section V.D of ! ! way Evaluation, ATSDR used established background levels to investigate the public health implications of the reported radiation increase. To estimate the effect of a reported 248% dose increase, ATSDR used data collected by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to establish background radiation levels. In June 2000, the NRC recorded radiation dose rate measurements at 29 locations in Vieques residential areas using a Ludlum Model 19 microR meter. These observations were collected at a distance of 1 meter above ground surface. The 29-measurement average exposure rate was 4 microroentgens per hour (\u00b5R/hour) approximately equal to 4 microrem per hour (\u00b5rem/hour). ATSDR assumed this dose rate represented external radiation background levels in the Vieques residential areas. If the CRDV data were based on similar dose rate observations, a 248% increase in radiation would imply that radiation levels increased from 4 \u00b5rem/hour to 14 \u00b5rem/hour, or a net increase above background of 10 \u00b5rem/hour. Assuming this increase above background occurred 24 hours per day for 90 days per year (i.e., the maximum amount of time the Navy could conduct military training exercises on Vieques), the overall increase in radiation dose for the year would be 22 mrem a level well below !D ionizing radiation. The MRL is defined as an increase in ionizing radiation dose of 100 mrem above background per year. Thus given these parameters, ATSDR does not consider a 248% increase indicates radiation exposures at levels of concern presuming an exposure rate of 4 \u00b5rem/hour. In fact, ATSDR noted that the levels of radiation measured in the NRC study appear to be well within background levels observed throughout the United States. And a non-CRDV press release (Fellowship of Reconciliation 2001) announced that the highest level of radiation measured during the recent survey on Vieques was 18 \u00b5R/hour approximately equal to 18 \u00b5rem/hour. These levels are comparable to survey readings collected elsewhere in the United States; they are considerably lower than background measurements from many areas at elevations of several thousand feet such as Denver, Colorado. Due to its higher elevation, Denver would be expected to have higher-than-average radiation levels. As analysis of data, ATSDR again requested more information on the study.

The investigator took gamma radiation measurements from around the targets (e.g., tanks and aircraft), from the roads leading to the targets, and from areas where former targets were buried. Yay\u00ed Beach was measured as the background location. ! Nuclear Research Corp no further sampling device information nor did the report list actual amounts of radiation detected at other locations. It provided instead the percent increase above readings at Yay\u00ed Beach. Lastly, the report did not specify the averaging time for individual measurements. Thus whether the findings were based on instantaneous peak radiation levels or sustained averages is unclear.

After completing some sampling, on January 19, 2000, the investigator filed a complaint with the Nuclear Regulatory \u0012 \u0012 \u0012 ! ! Pathway Evaluation. How ATSDR Addressed the Study Findings ATSDR received this report on August 5, 2009. Because this report like a contemporary press release entitled Dramatic Increase in Radiation in Vieques lacked an actual radiation level reading, ATSDR investigated the public health implications of the reported increase in radiation using the same D ! ! E ! 220% would imply that radiation levels increased from the background of 7 \u00b5r/hour (approximately equal to 7 microrem per hour [\u00b5rem/hour]) to 22 \u00b5rem/hour, or a net increase above background of 15 \u00b5rem/hour. Assuming this increase above background occurred 24 hours per day, 365 days per year, 131 !D c minimal risk level (MRL) for ionizing radiation is defined as an increase in ionizing radiation dose of 100 mrem above E !D not take into account individual occupancy. That is, for the MRL to be exceeded, a person would have to find the elevated radiation-level location and remain there 24 hours per day for an entire year. A more realistic yet still unlikely scenario is for a person to remain at the location 4 hours per day over the course of a year. This would result in an increased radiological dose of 20 mrem for the year. Page | A-6 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 Thus with respect to the actual method used to detect the radiation, the information supplied is of limited use: the background range was not specified. Typically, gamma radiation measurements will vary by 3 to 5 \u00b5R/h. As the author stated, the measured background was 7 \u00b5R/h, which ATSDR believes could vary up to 11 or 12 \u00b5R/h. Such a meter variation could also account for the large percentag es observed. For example, if the average were 7 \u00b5R/h, an increase in 3 \u00b5R/h would represent a 50% increase. Further, although depleted uranium (DU) is radioactive, its gamma radiation emission is low. It would not add to the ambient background radiation detectable by the type of radiation meter used in this study. In fact, the United Nations estimated that DU radiation is so weak it would be shielded by the soil in which it was buried. 35 Thus ATSDR believes the reported DU radiation was in error.

Their purpose was to determine levels of metals and other inorganic compounds in the Vieques ecosystem. Forty -four samples were collected from the LIA: specifically, areas of direct impact, target areas, and nearby areas. Five were collected from the Punta Este Conservation Zone, and six were taken from the residential area. Eleven water samples were collected from lagoons in the LIA, from Carrucho Beach, and from the Punta Este Conservation Zone. The sample analysis included highest and second highest concentrations: Table A-3.

LIA zinc and copper concentrations were higher than those USGS reported in 1973. The authors recommended additional environmental sampling in the civilian area and western portion of Vieques, as well as biomonitoring samples from Vieques residents. How ATSDR Addressed the Study Findings In a statistical comparison with other LIA data, these data show nine of the 20 chemicals were significantly different (higher, p <0.05): ammonia, barium, cadmium, copper, lead, mercury, nickel, nitrate/nitrite, and zinc. This does not imply any data discrepancy; it simply means that using only the highest and second highest detections rather than the complete dataset would skew any results. Therefore, these data were not used in the statistical analyses to evaluate general soil characteristics. They were, however, used to form the following conclusions during the public health evaluations in the ! E E During the public health assessment process, all available soil sampling data were considered, including the data presented in the Servicios Cient\u00edficos y T\u00e9cnicos report. To evaluate human exposures, ATSDR compiled roughly 600 soil/sediment samples (for a soil sampling summary, see pages 13 15 of the PHA). Vieques residents are not currently exposed to harmful levels of chemicals in the soil. Page | A-9 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 Although in the past, Navy training activities elevated the levels of some metals in the soil on the former LIA, those levels remain too low to be of health concern. Protestors who lived on the LIA for a year (1999 2000) endured the longest exposure to LIA soil contaminants. ATSDR analyzed the soil data collected by Servicios Cient\u00edficos y T\u00e9cnicos together with Navy data from areas where the protestors lived. ATSDR determined that the protestors were not exposed to harmful levels of chemicals in the soil.

On February 12, 2000, to characterize heavy metal contamination, a sediment sample was collected from each lagoon. The samples were taken only from the lagoon dry areas. The samples were 50 and 30 centimeters deep and were analyzed in 10- and 5- centimeter intervals (Gato and Anones, respectively). The authors reported that with respect to depth, the metals were almost homogeneously distributed. No significant differences appeared in the concentrations of heavy degree of mixture in the sediments down to at least 50 cm (20 inches) caused primarily by the intensity of bomb impacts The authors reported sampling results in a bar chart. An approximate interpretation of their data is presented below. Table A-4. Sediment samples from Gato and Anones Lagoons mg/kg Copper guideline was cited. Page | A- 11 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 How ATSDR Addressed the Study Findings ATSDR obtained this study in July 2009, and reviewed the data as part of its evaluation of Vieques. These data were collected from the former LIA a restricted area. Thus no one is now continuously exposed to these chemicals. The longest potential exposure occurred from April 1999 to May 2000, when protestors occupied the LIA. As reported by Massol-Dey\u00e1 and D\u00edaz (2002), the maximum concentrations of cobalt, cadmium, lead, nickel, chromium, and manganese were higher than the concentrations evaluated in the 2003 Soil Pathway Evaluation. And when matched with health-based comparison values, the cadmium and chromium concentrations were higher as well. As noted, however, access remains restricted to the former LIA (including Gato and Anones lagoons).

The authors concluded that with the levels detected, if people were to eat these plants they would be exposed to critically hazardous doses. The authors recommended remediation to reduce the transport of chemicals from the LIA to the residential areas. How ATSDR and the Puerto Rico Department of Agriculture Addressed the Study Findings This and other studies by the same researchers reported metals in plants and livestock. Con sequently, on August 7, 2001, the Puerto Rico Department of Agriculture placed an embargo on Vieques produce and livestock. The Puerto Rico Department of Agriculture, in cooperation with the Farmers Association of Puerto Rico, then sampled grass, fruit-bearing trees, and bovine livestock for cadmium, cobalt, copper, lead, manganese, and nickel. Samples were taken from Monte Carmelo, Martineau, Monte Santo, Esperanza, Lujan, Gubeo, and western Vieques. Sample analysis resulted in the conclusion that Vieques agricultural products were in fact suitable for consumption and did not contain toxic levels of D ! 2001 \u0011 F ! D mbargo was lifted (El Nuevo D\u00eda 2001). As part of the previous public health assessment, ATSDR requested that an agronomist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) independently review the Casa Pueblo and RUM studies. The agronomist determined that although the studies provided evidence of heavy metals accumulation in further concluded that Many of the species sampled in this study were not eaten, and when edible species were sampled, the edible portions were not sampled. Human exposures from locally grown foods are best estimated from the edible portions of the food source. In general, the edible portions of plants are less likely to accumulate metals from soil because of normal plant processes (i. e., physiological barriers that prevent contaminants from reaching the tops of plants) (ATSDR 2001). Additionally, the studies lacked standard reference materials to demonstrate that the results were accurate and lacked background corrections for lead, cobalt, nickel, and cadmium to eliminate the effect of light scattering by non-element materials in the samples. The metals analysis also did not indicate whether the metals were bioavailable. This is important because vegetation samples include both contaminants taken up by the plant and soil particles from the Page | A- 15 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 growing media. Thus even with a thorough washing, small soil particles will adhere to the plant materials and can actually carry more contaminants than those taken up by the plant from the soil (ATSDR 2001). When the external soil contamination is ingested, the chemicals bound to soil are not usually in a form the body can absorb. While methods are available to determine how much of a chemical concentration is adhered as soil and how much is in the plant tissue, the researchers here did not use them. Thus ATSDR could neither quantify human exposures nor draw any health conclusions about whether consuming plants grown in Vieques would result in harmful health effects. As part of its evaluation, ATSDR recommended additional sampling of subsistence produce. References ATSDR. 2001.

Toxic Metals in the Vegetation of the Civilian Zone of Vieques, Rico, Mayag\u00fcez Publication Status: Self-published Peer Review Status: None Cited Previously by ATSDR: Yes (2003 Public Health Assessment: Soil Pathway Evaluation) Study Findings \u0012 randomly collected agricultural and common vegetation from three sites within 1) a Vieques residential section, 2) an agricultural area in Monte Carmelo as well as a section of Monte Carmelo that borders Camp Garc\u00eda, and 3) an agricultural farm in Barrio Monte Santo, Gobeo sector. The ensuing paper, however, limited its discussion to the two farms sampled in the civilian area of Vieques and focused its conclusions and recommendations on plants grown for an agricultural economy. The study reported that all metals (cadmium, cobalt, copper, lead, and manganese) were found at toxic levels. Lead and cadmium had the highest absorption rates. Sampling included leaves and stems of pumpkin, pepper, pigeon peas, pineapple, and yucca. Only guam\u00e1 and mangoes showed acceptable metals levels. The study reported the following average concentrations found in plant stems and leaves. It did not report concentrations in the edible portions of the plants sampled (See Table A-6). The authors concluded that the highest concentrations of metals were found in plants that had shallow rootswhere higher contamination levels would be expected to be found in the soil and plants requiring higher watering rates (more access to soil contamination).

As part of the 2001 public health assessment, ATSDR requested independent review of the study by an agronomist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). That agronomist determined that although the studies provided evidence that heavy metal accumulation in plants prevented estimation of a human exposure dose. The agronomist further concluded: Many of the species sampled in this study are not eaten, and when edible species were sampled, the edible portions were not.

The paper compares concentrations found on Vieques with concentrations detected on the main island of Puerto Rico. The 2000 sampling included plant stems and leaves, but it did not include the edible portions of the plants sampled. This peer-reviewed publication did, however, provide more information on sampling, preparation, and analytical techniques than did the April 2000 report. In addition to the 2000 sampling data, this paper included new samples of C. cajan (pigeon peas) leaves and fruit taken August 18, 2001 and discussed the ratio of contamination detected in the fruit to contamination detected in the leaves. In Table 1 of the study, leaves and stems of four plant species were compared. When these findings were compared with samples from mainland Puerto Rico, the Vieques plant samples contained more lead, cobalt, and manganese, but less chromium and copper. For nickel and cadmium, results were mixed. Page | A- 21 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 Table 2 of the study compared leaves and stems of two plant species (pigeon peas and squash). As in Table 1, the Vieques samples had more lead and cobalt, but these two samples contained more cadmium and copper and less nickel and manganese. Both sample sets showed that the Vieques plants contained more lead and cobalt. For the other metals, results were mixed depending on plant species. Table 3 of the study compares concentrations detected in pigeon pea fruit and leaf samples collected August 18, 2001. For some metals, higher concentrations were found in the fruit (zinc, nickel, cadmium and cobalt). For other metals (i.e., copper and lead), higher concentrations were found in the leaves.

Concentrations of heavy metals were higher at AFWTF. The authors advanced the hypothesis of bioaccumulation through the food chain: manatee grass to crustaceans and fish to humans. A similar food chain scenario was presented for migratory birds. The authors evaluated temporal variations of the S. filiforme samples. Table 2 of their study shows heavy metal concentrations in 2004 (after bombing activities stopped) were approximately \u00bd the concentration levels found in 2000 (when the bombing range was active).

The Navy compensate Vieques residents for the impact on agricultural activities: contaminated soil from Navy activities was windborne to the civilian areas of Vieques where it was taken up by agricultural plants. 2. Cleanup of the Live Impact Area (LIA) should include not only unexploded bombs, but contaminated soil as well: winds still blow contaminated soil toward the civilian area. 3. Cleanup of the Live Impact Area (LIA) should include removal of unexploded bombs in the sea adjacent to Vieques. 4. E \u0011 conduct open burning of vegetation: plants have taken up contamination in the soil, and burning plants would release that contamination to the air where it would ultimately reach Vieques residents. How ATSDR Addressed the Study Findings ATSDR requested and received this study from the author in October 2008. ATSDR found the concentrations, as reported, would be harmful to humans. Thus ATSDR consulted with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) about the study (Rufus Chaney, USDA, personal communication, October 28 30, 2008). USDA noted that The reported levels of copper would be phytotoxic to the plants. The soil might have been experimentally enhanced to increase metal uptake. The measurements reported were consistent with plants grown in soils artificially enhanced to increase metal uptake in plants. Because of the limitations of this study, ATSDR recommended additional sampling of subsistence produce (see Chapter 5, Section 5.3.2).

Because this and other studies by the same researchers reported elevated levels of metals in plants and livestock, on August 7, 2001, the Puerto Rico Department of Agriculture placed an embargo on Vieques produce and livestock.

The study reported on four objectives: 1. Collect samples of chemicals leaking from the bombs. The letter reported that analysis should have been available in late December, 1999. 2. Determine the origin of craters in the area. Magnetometer readings suggested that metal objects (i.e., bombs) were imbedded in the crater walls. The study concluded that detonations caused the craters. 3. Determine whether bombing occurred after 1993. Dr. Porter used draft cards data and serial numbers to identify dates. But no data or conclusions regarding when bombing occurred were presented in the letter. 4. Determine the extent of chemical contamination. Analyses were not available at the time of the letter, but visual observations were reported: a. Coral in contact with one of the leaking bombs was diseased and highly discolored. b. 100150 barrels and one compressed gas cylinder were located near a sunken barge. c. 9001000 barrels were located near a second barge that was broken in two.

In 2001, ATSDR and U.S.EPA collected 104 fish and 42 shellfish from six locations in and around Vieques, including the area that Dr. Porter sampled near the former USS Killen. To determine other sampling locations and species of fish to collect, ATSDR relied on research by Universidad Metropolitana, discussions with the person who had petitioned ATSDR for an assessment of public health conditions on Vieques, residents of Vieques, and information provided in the Vieques Special Commission Report. ATSDR collected grouper, snapper, parrotfish, grunt, goatfish, land crabs, queen conch, and spiny lobster. In addition, to address a specific community concern, ATSDR collected one honeycomb cowfish from a local fish market. In 2003, ATSDR concluded the following in its Fish and Shellfish Evaluation: Explosive compounds were not detected in any of the edible fish and shellfish sampled from Vieques. Metals were detected in the fish and shellfish. ATSDR evaluated several consumption scenarios, including eating fish every day. ATSDR found that it is safe to eat a variety of fish and shellfish from Vieques on a daily basis, including snapper (the most desirable and commonly consumed species). ATSDR concluded in 2003 that fish and shellfish caught at any of the locations are safe to eat, including fish and shellfish from areas in and around the former LIA and USS Killen.

The USFWS research established that fiddler crabs and land crabs contained some heavy metals and pesticides. Because the USFWS samples were analyzed as whole body, the data from the report were useful to evaluate ecological contamination, but could not be easily converted to evaluate human health. In 2006, an ATSDR health consultation assisted the USFWS to determine whether selected refuge areas could be opened to harvest land crab. In 2005, NOAA sampled 74 land crabs from 14 locations, analyzing them for explosive compounds, PCBs, organochlorine pesticides, and trace elements: The levels found in the land crabs were much lower than levels the scientific literature reported as causing harmful health effects.

The report provided the following findings and conclusions: Radiological Normal ambient radiological readings were found around the USS Killen and around the 55 gallon drums. The readings indicate no health threat. The wreck of the USS Killen and 55 gallon drums should be left undisturbed to provide marine habitat. Explosives Measurable readings of explosive residues were detected in some biota from the vicinity of the some bombs, with concentrations decreasing with increasing distance from the source. The readings from the decaying ordnance are localized, and pose a minimal toxicological threat to humans. The fish and lobster collected in the vicinity of the USS Killen are safe to eat. The concentrations of explosive chemicals are below the U.S.EPA -based concentrations for commercially edible seafood. Page | A- 42 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 As increased human access and environmental leaching patterns increase the risk of detonation, spread, and bioaccumulation in the immediate vicinity of UXO and related debris, all such items located from the high water mark on shore to the bottom of Bahia Salina del Sur should be removed. Metals Arsenic concentrations in fish (0.76 and 1.05 ppm ) are above the U.S.EPA Risk-Based Concentration Guide (0.26 ppm ). The authors noted that concentration of total arsenic in lobster collected from Site 1 (11.0 ppm ) is within the normal range for Atlantic spiny lobster (10 20 ppm ). The report text states that the arsenic levels are above the U.S.EPA Risk-Based Concentration Guideline (0.13 ppm ) and may warrant a limited consumption advisory. Concentrations of barium, cadmium, chromium, and selenium in fish and lobster were below the U.S.EPA Risk Based Concentration Guidelines and within the ranges reported in the 2001 ATSDR fish sampling event. Uranium and lead were not tested for fish collected from Sites 1 and 2.

Sampling results of marine coastal waters How ATSDR Addressed the Study Findings Although the data were not published until 2004, in 1999 the University of Georgia issued a press release reporting that Dr. Porter discovered leaking barrels off the LIA coast. This report prompted !D 2001 Vieques. In 2001, ATSDR and U.S.EPA collected 104 fish and 42 shellfish from six locations on Vieques, D 2003 !D F E 2001 Explosive compounds were not detected in any of the edible fish and shellfish sampled from Vieques. Metals were detected in the fish and shellfish. ATSDR evaluated several consumption scenarios, including eating fish every day. ATSDR found that it was safe to eat a variety of fish and shellfish from Vieques on a daily basis, including snapper (the most desirable and commonly consumed species). Fish and shellfish caught at any of the locations were safe to eat, including from areas around the former LIA and the USS Killen. As part of its analysis of Vieques data, ATSDR evaluated the level of mercury in fish collected from the reefs surrounding Vieques and from a fish market on the island. The results from our evaluation of Vieques can be found in Chapter 2 . Page | A- 44 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 Arsenic levels in fish and shellfish are often reported as total arsenic. It is important, though, to distinguish between inorganic arsenic, which is harmful to humans, and arsensobetaine, which is an arsenic-containing compound that is not harmful to humans. Arsenobetaine is not harmful because it is not metabolized by humans and is easily and quickly excreted within 2 to 3 days of ingestion. Most of the arsenic (usually less than 1%) in fish and shellfish, such as lobster, is the non-toxic arsensobetaine (Sloth 2005, Fabris 2006, Green 2006). One particular study reported the percent inorganic levels in the spiny lobster ( Panulirus species) was 0.01 to 0.2 percent (Peshut 2008). Panulirus is the genus of lobster found near Vieques and other parts of the Caribbean. References Sloth JJ, Larsen EH, Julshamn K. 2005.

Dr. Cruz-P\u00e9rez concluded that Detonation of a single artillery shell (i.e., a 105 mm mortar projectile) could emit 400 kilograms of soil and explosive residue into the air. Ambient air concentrations of pollutants from military training exercises are inversely proportional to the downwind distance raised to the 1.5 power.

In Appendix D of the PHA, to estimate emissions, ATSDR used a published model and documented all input parameters and assumptions. Dr. Cruz- P\u00e9rez based the estimated ambient air concentrations on an assumed decay rate with downwind distance. All three expert reviewers questioned Dr. Cruz- one expert reviewer citing peer-reviewed publications suggesting that pollutants from instantaneous plumeslike those associated with bombing activity would decay much more quickly than Dr. Cruz\u00ad E D \u0012 - calculations, and ATSDR noted that the approach did not take into account parameters known to affect atmospheric dispersion (e.g., initial cloud height, atmospheric stability, wind speed, wind direction, mixing height). To estimate ambient air concentrations at Vieques, ATSDR used a U.S.EPA-recommended \u0012!FF !D 75 not just a single pollutant. And in its PHA, ATSDR fully documented all model assumptions, input parameters, and run-time options. By contrast, Dr. Cruz-P\u00e9rez estimated particulate matter ambient air concentrations on days when military training exercises occurred. Expert reviewers noted, however, that these estimates do not document the averaging time for the concentrations (e.g., 24-hour, annual average) nor do they specify the particle size (e.g., PM10, PM2.5, TSP), both of which are important health evaluation considerations. !D unted for these shortcomings by specifying the particle sizes considered and by evaluating both acute and chronic exposure durations. The PHA documents all ambient air concentrations ATSDR estimated during the modeling effort.

The concentrations of explosive compounds reported in both drinking water and lagoon water were well below levels considered harmful to human health. Past exposure to these compounds did not pose a public health hazard. The drinking water samples (4) and the chemicals analyzed in this study were both limited. To arrive at its drinking water health call, ATSDR used additional data. In the drinking water PHA, Appendix B lists sampling events and Appendix C lists chemicals for which analyses were performed. Other sampling events detected no RDX or tetryl in the drinking water supplies. The study noted, further noted, h explosives in seawater and particularly to detect explosive compounds. These methods were more sensitive than the current U.S.EPA laboratory methods now considered the standard for environmental work. The reported soil levels were below comparison values and did not indicate a health hazard. The number of soil samples (6) was limited. Thus for its soil health call, ATSDR used additional data. For example, in 1999 2000 !D \u0012 soil samples from areas where the protestors lived. Protestors who lived on the LIA for a year (1999 2000) endured the longest exposure to contaminants in the LIA soil. ATSDR reviewed the data and determined that the protestors were not exposed to harmful levels of soil-embedded chemicals.

The possible abnormalities noted in the Vieques fishers were attributed to \"vibro-acoustic disease\" (VAD), which Portuguese investigators had described in the medical literature. VAD was said to occur as the result of noise and vibrations caused by naval exercises on Vieques Island. By Presidential directive, the Department of Health and Human Services undertook an investigation of the issues raised by the study. The Department, in turn, referred this request to ATSDR, then currently investigating environmental public health issues in Vieques. The Cardiovascular Diseases Branch of Centers for Disease Control (CDC) provided considerable assistance in this investigation. Concurrent with this request, the Ponce School of Medicine (PSM), led by President and Dean Dr. Manuel Mart\u00ednez Maldonado, began a more definitive study of possible cardiac abnormalities among Vieques residents. This study sought to overcome methodological problems in the earlier pilot study. On March 29 30, 2001, scientists from ATSDR and CDC met with the PSM investigators and agreed that their review and interpretation of the findings should include an independent opinion of recognized practitioners and scientists. Page | A- 52 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 How ATSDR Addressed the Study Findings In July 2001, ATSDR, PSM, and CDC co-sponsored an expert panel to review PSM's follow-up study. The cipal conclusion was that neither the PSM nor the Mayo Clinic readings contained information indicating a cardiac health problem in the commercial fishers from either location. The initial report of gross valvular pathology from the pilot study was not replicated. All reviewers agreed that contrary to pilot study reports, no clinically relevant difference in pericardial thickness surfaced between Vieques and Ponce Playa subjects. Moreover, neither the PSM nor the Mayo Clinic measurements showed any subject's pericardial thickness to be larger than 2 mm a metric the published literature considered the upper limit of normal. The PSM study does not support findings of cardiac pathology among Vieques fishers. Because of the inability of trans-thoracic echocardiography to measure reliably the small differences found, those reported are likely due to measurement error intrinsic to the technique, not to scientists who use it. This in all likelihood accounts for the different results obtained when Mayo Clinic reading s of pericardial thickness were used in place of PSM readings.

Dr. Col\u00f3n de Jorge reported that 30 hair samples were collected from Vieques residents with self- reported health conditions. The doctor also concluded that 1) 50% of the people tested were contaminated with antimony compared with 29% from a control population, 2) 50% of the people tested were contaminated with arsenic compared with 29% from a control population, and 3) 50% of Page | A- 54 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 the people tested had a selenium imbalance. Dr. Col\u00f3n de Jorge pointed out that antimony levels were high because it was used in ballistics on the island, thus making the case that naval bombardment activity was the reason antimony levels were high in children. Dr. Col\u00f3n de Jorge also used the following statements to summarize the results of seven control patients: None of the seven patients showed total toxic levels of metals. Two cases had antimony above the reference range established by the laboratory compared with 29% of those investigated outside Vieques. Selenium was normal for exogenous contamination. Two cases had arsenic above the reference range compared with 29% of the cases outside Vieques. Selenium was normal for exogenous contamination. Because their selenium levels were normal and within the reference range, the seven control patients did not have endogenous heavy metals contamination. Dr. Col\u00f3n de Jorge collected hair samples at random from seven persons in Rio Piedras, on the main island of Puerto Rico. None of the results showed toxic levels of heavy metals. By contrast, tests of 21 of 30 persons (i.e., 63%) from Vieques with known health conditions (and thus not randomly selected) detected various metals at toxic levels. Dr. Col\u00f3n focused on how to evaluate and interpret elemental results in hair. One of the appendices D D Comprehensive Interpretations for Hair Elements from Al to Zn (Quiq 1998). How ATSDR Addressed the Study Findings To determine the relationship between hair data and the potential for adverse health effects, ATSDR sought the assistance of external experts. In June 2001, ATSDR convened an expert panel to discuss the state of the science relating to analyzing hair for environmental exposure (ATSDR 2001). The panel comprised persons from state and federal government agencies, academia, and private practice whose expertise, interests, and experience covered a wide range of relevant technical disciplines. The panelists agreed that . . . for most substances, insufficient data currently exist that would allow the prediction of a health effect from the concentration of the substance in hair. The presence of a substance in hair may indicate exposure (both internal and external), but does not necessarily indicate the source of exposure. The panel noted that provided external contamination can be ruled out a relationship between contaminant concentrations in hair and any kind of measurable outcome have only been established for methylmercury and, to a limited extent, for arsenic. The panel recognized that laboratory methods are available to measure the levels of some environmental contaminants in hair, but commented that procedures needed to be standardized to help Page | A- 55 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 ensure more accurate and reliable results. They also identified several factors that limited the interpretation of even the most accurate, reliable, and reproducible laboratory results.

Dr. Ortiz Roque in adults. The doctor concluded that the data showed Viequenses had internal exposure to heavy metal, and that the data were supported by the high percentage of women and children with hair mercury levels above the 90th percentile compared with the continental United States. While none of the women in the NHANES 1999 survey had mercury hair levels above 12 ppm, 3 of 45 Viequenses women had hair levels above 12 ppm (i.e., 15.41, 25.26, and 101.3 ppm). Dr. Ortiz Roque concluded that the correlation between mother and offspring hair showed that mercury exposure occurred in utero, that Viequenses exposure to mercury was too high to be considered safe, and that mercury was used in the detonators. How ATSDR Addressed the Study Findings As mentioned previously, ATSDR convened a panel of experts who agreed that . . . for most substances, insufficient data currently exist that would allow the prediction of a health effect from the concentration of the substance in hair. The presence of a substance in hair may indicate exposure (both internal and external), but does not necessarily indicate the source of exposure. Nevertheless, Dr. Ortiz Roque documented several mothers with elevated mercury levels in hair and her findings are described in Chapter 3. Viequenses who remain concerned about exposure to mercury, cadmium other metals, or metalloids should consult their healthcare provider to discuss the need for and cost of testing.

That study investigated hair mercury levels in women 16 to 49 years old who lived on the island of Vieques. The doctor compared those levels with women from San Juan and Ceiba, Puerto Rico. Women were excluded whose hair had been chemically treated within 3 months of the test. A 1.5-cm proximal hair sample was collected and analyzed by one of two licensed laboratories. Dr. Ortiz Roque reported statistics on 41 Viequenses women together with information about seafood consumption, and compared these data with mainland Puerto Rico and the United States. Table A- 15 summarizes the data. Dr. Ortiz Roque used margin of exposure (MOE) to define unsafe exposure levels. Table A-16.

The NRC recommended a 5% effect level derived from the 95% lower confidence limit of a benchmark dose (BMDL). The basis for the 5% effect level is abnormal scores on cognitive function tests in children exposed in utero to methylmercury. The NRC recommended that the U.S.EPA derive their Reference Dose using a BMDL of 58 ppb methylmercury in cord blood, which was identified as the 5% Page | A- 59 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 effect level from a Faroe Islands study using statistical models. The 58-ppb cord blood translates to 12 ppm in hair (Ortiz Roque 2004; NRC 2000). Results showed that the 90th percentile mercury hair concentration in Vieques women was 8.96 ppm compared with 1 ppm in women from Puerto Rico and 1.4 ppm in women from the United States. Dr. Ortiz Roque concluded that Viequenses women of reproductive age were exposed to mercury concentrations unsafe to their developing fetuses. How ATSDR Addressed the Study Findings Dr. Ortiz Roque documented several mothers with elevated mercury levels in hair. Her findings are described in Chapter 3.

Dr. Rodriquez Sierra is with the Department of Environmental Health, Site Medical Sciences, University of Puerto Rico. The following information comes from a March 2009 newspaper article i n El Vocero describing arsenic exposure in Vieques residents from eating fish. The article stated that inorganic arsenic was found in a representative sample of Viequenses with high fish consumption. Dr. Rodr\u00edguez Sierra identified two groups in Vieques: one consisted of 30 persons who consumed substantial quantities of fish. Another consisted of 22 persons who consumed very little fish. As a biomarker of short-term exposure, the researchers measured the levels of inorganic arsenic in urine. As a biomarker of long-term exposure, they measured arsenic in nails and in hair. The article stated that the researchers measured arsenic in urine and found that, on average, levels in urine, hair and nails were generally low. Nevertheless, some people, and particularly some men, who ate fish frequently had higher concentrations of inorganic arsenic in their nails an indicator of long- term exposure.

The results were presented in a draft manuscript in 2006. In the first phase, the PRDOH study conducted interviews and laboratory analysis on 1) arsenic in hair and urine, 2) nickel in hair and urine, 3) cadmium in hair and urine, 4) mercury in blood, 5) lead in blood, 6) aluminum in blood, and 7) uranium in urine. The second phase of the investigation involved collecting and analyzing blood samples from Phase I participants whose tests showed metals at toxic levels. Phase II was carried out from December 2005 to March 2006 . The PRDOH manuscript reported the main findings of this study as Detectable levels of at least one heavy metal were found in over 90% of the population. The levels of aluminum in blood, arsenic in urine, and nickel in hair were over the laboratory threshold in more than 20% of the study participants. Arsenic results in urine were for total arsenic, not inorganic arsenic. Geometric means for uranium in urine, mercury in blood, lead in blood, aluminum in blood, nickel in hair, and cadmium in urine were significantly higher than geometric means from the 1999 NHANES survey. None of the geometric means identified by the laboratory was threshold. For arsenic, cadmium, and nickel, the use of cigarettes, consumption of seafood, and use of hair dye were identified as risk factors for levels above the laboratory threshold. Page | A- 63 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 Fifteen persons (3%) were identified with levels above the toxicity threshold for aluminum in blood (10), lead in blood (2), mercury in blood (1), and cadmium in urine (2). In the follow-up study on 10 of the 15 persons, only one person with levels above the toxicity threshold was identified. The PRDOH manuscript suggested establishment of a voluntary health registry of Vieques residents. A health registry would 1) allow for systematic documentation of factors related to potential risks, 2) identify people with early signs and symptoms that may be associated with illness, and 3) facilitate early care and health service access needs. The PRDOH manuscript pointed out that blood lead levels were unknown for the 1,000 Vieques children 6 years of age and younger. This high-risk group is more vulnerable to lead exposure than are adults. The PRDOH manuscript stated that an epidemiologist would be appointed to work towards establishing this program, which will follow CDC guidelines for case management. Whether at this time this program has been implemented is unknown. How ATSDR Addressed the Study Findings The PRDOH biomonitoring study provided much insight into metal exposure for Vieques residents. Some results from the PRDOH study suggested elevated levels of various metals, thus raising concerns about excessive exposure on the island . The PRDOH study is described in detail in Chapter 3 . Viequenses who remain concerned about exposure to mercury, cadmium, other metals, or metalloids should consult their healthcare provider to discuss the need for and cost of testing.

As mentioned briefly in the document and as confirmed by Dr. Figueroa (personal communication, July, 2009), some follow up was necessary to identify cases in Vieques that were not processed uniformly with the rest of PR. One example relates to documentation of age for cases in the registry. For this assessment, on the island of Vieques all cases indicating residence had their ages confirmed. But this practice was not followed on the PR main island. If a case did not have a known age, it was omitted from any rate calculations. Given the small number of Vieques cases, the age was confirmed to ensure that all potential cases could be included.

Reportedly, fieldwork for this study occurred between April and November 2000.37 The authors attempted to include all residents in each neighborhood and allowed the head of a household typically the matriarch to provide proxy responses for all household members. Beyond the demographic, employment, and dietary habit information collected, the survey also gathered self-reported disease prevalence data. Cancer, heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, and asthma were self-reported at a higher prevalence than referent data from the main island of Puerto Rico. Specifically, the reported case rates were 1.18 2.69 times the reported case rates from a 1994 Puerto Rico study. All data were self-reported or reported via proxy. No attempt was made to access medical records to validate the collected information. The four neighborhoods were collectively described as representative of the Vieques population. Lujan had 132 reported residents with a reported age range of 5 25 years, PRRA had 306 reported residents with a reported age range of 59 70 years, Esperanza had 388 reported residents, and Santa Maria had 217 reported residents. This time frame as reported appears inconsistent with the March 2000 publication date.

Given the amount of superstructure missing from the Killen, the hypothesis was that the drums were used as ballast to redistribute the weight of the target ship. They also found that several of the drums had been sealed empty to provide buoyancy to certain of the ship compartments. The submerged aquatic vegetation around the two areas was comparable to the control site and did not exhibit signs of environmental distress. The vessel supported fish and coral populations similar to the control site, and was not found to be negatively affecting the ecosystem. The study concluded that the sunken vessel was acting as a productive artificial reef habitat.

Dodge Affiliation: National Coral Reef Institute Publication Status: Journal of Coastal Research 24(4):1008 -1021 Peer Review Status: Yes Cited Previously by ATSDR: No Study Findings This study compared the variability of coral assemblages of reef zones between Vieques and St. Croix to evaluate the differences and the influence of natural and manufactured factors. The researchers established 18 sites at Vieques (12 inside the former LIA and 6 in the former EMA) and 6 at St. Croix for evaluation of coral assemblage structure. No differences in living benthic coral reef cover or composition of coral assemblages between inside and outside the LIA were found at Vieques. Also, coral assemblages at Vieques and St. Croix were similar in composition and biotic coverage. The researchers considered the lack of differentiation within the coral communities of Vieques and between Vieques and St. Croix the most pronounced outcome of the study. Because the reefs at St. Croix were not in better condition than reefs at Vieques, the authors suggest that natural disturbances (disease and storms) had a greater impact on coral communities than former military bombing activities.

E E!E analyzed 104 fish and 38 shellfish (representing 20 different edible species) from the coastal waters and near shore land on Vieques in July 2001. Fiddler crabs from the LIA were also collected. EPA/ERT caught fish and shellfish from five preferred fishing locations (north of the LIA, south of the LIA, south of Esperanza, north of Isabel Segunda, and west Vieques) as well as from a local fish market in Isabel Segunda. Several heavy metals were detected in the fish and shellfish. No explosive compounds were detected in the fish and shellfish, with the exception of low levels of cyclotetramethylene tetranitramine (HMX) and a chemical similar to cyclotrimethylene trinitramine (RDX) 38 in fiddler crabs and a chemical similar to RDX in one trunkfish from the fish market. Because the fiddler crabs had not been rinsed prior to analysis, the detection may have been the result of soil contamination. Explosive compounds were not detected in any of the other 142 edible fish or shellfish samples. EPA/ERT statistically determined that the chemical concentrations in fish and shellfish collected from south of the LIA were similar to those collected from west Vieques. The divers qualitatively noted that the reefs were in good condition and the fish appeared healthy. They documented the presence of unexploded ordnance to the north and south of the LIA. A conclusive identification could not be confirmed by the laboratory that conducted the analyses.

Kendal (eds.) Affiliation: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Publication Status: Government Publication, NOAA Peer Review Status: Yes Cited Previously by ATSDR: No Study Findings The purpose of this study was to provide a spatially comprehensive characterization of the marine !! communities, nutrient levels, and chemical contaminants in the marine environment around Vieques. The data were grouped and analyzed according to former land use. The key findings are summarized below: A stratified random design was used to select 75 sites for benthic and fish community surveys around Vieques. The researchers found that Vieques was similar in terms of benthic cover, total fish abundance, and biomass to other nearby locations (southwest Puerto Rico, St. Croix, and St. John). Differences in fish and benthic communities could not be conclusively linked to former land use patterns. A stratified random design was used to select 78 sites for sediment (lagoon and offshore) and 35 sites for coral tissue sampling. The sediment and coral tissue samples were analyzed for 150 chemical contaminants including metals, pesticides, and explosives. Overall, contaminant concentrations were below established sediment quality guidelines, sediments from lagoon s typically had higher concentrations than offshore sites, and sediments had higher concentrations of trace and major elements than corals. Sediment samples analyzed for 14 explosive compounds yielded no confirmed detections. DDT (at four sites) and chromi um (at one site) were detected in sediment samples above established sediment quality guidelines. Page | A- 76 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 However, no sites had contaminant concentrations that were likely to affect sediment-dwelling biota. Sediment concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were significantly higher in the land-use zone that included the former Naval Ammunition Support Detachment. The concentration of cadmium was significantly higher in the former LIA. Water samples from 40 stratified random designed sampling stations were analyzed for nitrate nitrite, silicate, orthophosphate, ammonium, urea, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus. No evidence of anthropogenic over-enrichment of nutrients was discovered. Nutrient concentrations were generally low and similar in magnitude to those measured elsewhere in Puerto Rico. Nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were below published threshold values considered threatening for macroalgal overgrowth on coral reef ecosystems. The authors concluded that there was little evidence of any difference in marine resources, nutrients, or contaminants around Vieques compared to other coral reef ecosystems in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The reef ecosystem appears to be shaped primarily by regional-scale processed rather than local factors. The results of the study supported neither of the following hypotheses: 1) naval activities negatively affected the marine environments around Vieques and 2) the lack of development on two-thirds of the island was a positive influence by preventing human activities documented elsewhere to be harmful to marine environments. How ATSDR Addressed the Study Findings Because Viequenses are concerned about the effects that bombing activities have had on the marine environment, ATSDR reviewed this new study evaluation of Vieques. The results of the heavy metal sampling in sediment and coral are discussed in Chapter 1, Section 1.3.3. A summary of the study was also added to the section discussing ecological impacts to the coral reefs aroun d Vieques (see Chapter 2, Section 2.1.4). ATSDR notes that the scope of the study was to characterize the entire marine ecosystem around Vieques; it was not intentionally directed toward characterizing the impact from bombing activities.

Faye, P.E., Robert E. Faye and Associates, Inc. Hernan Horta Cruz, MS, Puerto Rico Department of Health (PRDOH), Mike Glogower, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region II, Sigfredo Torres-Gonzales, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) A Vieques resident petitioned ATSDR to investigate whether contaminated groundwater might move from beneath the Live Impact Area (LIA) to the populated areas of Vieques. ATSDR studied the hydrogeology of the island and evaluated chemical levels in drinking water and in groundwater samples collected from Vieques wells and tanks. ATSDR thereafter concluded that the water from the current public water supply system is safe to drink. Most Vieques residents receive their drinking water through an underwater pipeline from the Puerto Rico mainland. In 1999 and 2000, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Puerto Rico Page | B-3 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 Department of Health, and the U.S. Navy tested the public water supply system drinking water for volatile organic compounds, inorganic compounds, and explosive compounds. After an evaluation of the test results, ATSDR concluded that Navy activities did not affect the public drinking water supply and that the water was safe to drink. The water from most groundwater wells on the island is safe to drink In the past, residents drew from groundwater wells in the Esperanza and Resolucion valleys. Smaller private wells in the residential areas also supplied drinking water. Many such wells currently provide supplementary drinking water whenever the mainland public water supply system is interrupted. From 1995 to 2000, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Puerto Rico Department of Health, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the U.S. Navy sampled groundwater wells on the island for volatile organic compounds, inorganic compounds, pesticides, herbicides, polychlorinated biphenyls, and explosive compounds. Explosive compounds and their residues were not found in any of the wells. ATSDR evaluation included whether, for people drinking water from the wells, detected chemicals were at harmful levels. ATSDR concluded that during public water supply interruptions, water from all but one of the wells was safe to drink. But ATSDR also found that the groundwater wells had naturally high sodium content thus residents on sodium-restricted diets were advised to consider limiting their intake of water from the ate well (Well 3-7) also showed high levels of nitrates/nitrites. Thus the water from Well 3-7 was not safe to drink, especially for children and pregnant women. The Puerto D f personally informed residents that water from Well 3-7 was not safe. Given Vieques hydrogeology, ATSDR did not believe that contamination was a consequence of bombing range activities; rather, it was in all likelihood the result of area agricultural activities or septic systems. Vieques Island's geology and topography prevent groundwater movement from the Live Impact Area into the area where groundwater wells are located ATSDR evaluated the hydrogeology of the island to determine whether hazardous substances from the Live Impact Area could groundwater-migrate to the drinking water wells area. ATSDR determined that the wells were within isolated aquifers and therefore not geologically connected to the groundwater on tween the Live Impact Area and the wells location bedrock and westward topography sloped upward. Thus rather than migrating toward the wells, groundwater at the Live Impact Area moved slowly downhill toward the lagoons and, eventually, towar d the ocean. Page | B-4 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 If good sanitation practices are followed, water from rainfall collection systems is safe to drink Because no sampling studies characterized the quality of water in rainfall collection systems on Vieques, no site-specific sampling data were available on which to base firm conclusions. Nevertheless, if accepted sanitation practices were followed, ATSDR expected rainfall collection systems on Vieques would provide clean water that posed no health hazards. In the past, Vieques water was safe to drink In 1978, the Navy reported very low levels of explosive compounds in drinking water samples from Vieques. The laboratory that analyzed the water samples stated some uncertainty in the results. ATSDR reviewed those data, as well as the sampling and analytical procedures, to evaluate whether those reported detections posed a potential health hazard. To be protective of public health, ATSDR analyzed the results assuming that the explosive compounds were present. ATSDR concluded that the concentrations reported were well below harmful levels. The water did not pose a health hazard to anyone drinking it in the past. And recent analyses of drinking water samples using updated sampling and analysis methodologies did not detect any explosive-related contamination.

To address this concern, ATSDR evaluated roughly 600 soil samples collected by the U.S. Geologic Survey, the Puerto Rico Department of Natural Resources, the U.S. Navy, and Servicios Cient\u00edficos y T\u00e9chnicos, Inc. ATSDR analyzed the samples for metals, other inorganic compounds, and explosive compounds, and concluded that Residents of Vieques are not exposed to harmful levels of chemicals in the soil. ATSDR compared the levels of chemicals found in Vieques soils to levels public health professionals consider safe. ATSDR also conducted detailed analyses to determine the amount of chemicals to which people were expected to be exposed over a lifetime. The analyses showed that for either adults or children living on Vieques, incidental ingestion of soil or contact with soil would not result in harmful health effects.

ATSDR analyzed the data and determined that for anyone incidentally ingesting or touching the soil, all of the chemicals were at levels below those that might cause harmful health effects. In comparison with soil elsewhere in the region, some of the metals detected in Vieques soil were moderately elevated. ATSDR compared Vieques soil quality with sediment on the Puerto Rico mainland and with soil in the United States. ATSDR found that the maximum level of some of the metals detected in Vieques soil was moderately elevated when compared with soil in Puerto Rico and in the United States. ATSDR also analyzed the chemical characteristics of soil on Vieques to determine whether metals were at unnaturally high levels. To do this, ATSDR grouped soil samples throughout the island according to their underlying rock (the geologic units), and compared the general chemical characteristics of those soils. ATSDR found that the Vieques soils were strongly influenced by the type of rock from which they were formedin other words, soils developed on different underlying rock had different levels of metals. The levels of metals detected on Vieques were consistent with those normally found in soils underlain by the type of rock found on Vieques (e.g., volcanic rocks) and were not at levels of health concern. The concentrations of metals in the soils of the Live Impact Area appeared moderately elevated but not at harmful levels. ! !D ! activities and contained elevated metals levels. ATSDR determined, however, that the metals concentrations in the soil were not at harmful levels. ATSDR's spatial analysis showed that metals were apparently not moving from the Live Impact Area into Vieques residential areas. ATSDR examined the soil data for spatial trends that might show movement of metals from the Live Impact Area to the residential areas of Vieques (i.e., a pattern of high to medium to low concentrations from east to west). To do this, ATSDR created spatial maps showing the locations of metal concentrations detected on Vieques. None of the spatial maps showed any patterns beginning with high concentrations in the Live Impact Area and decreasing concentrations tapering off to the western parts of the island. Thus the soil data collected from across the island indicated that contaminants from the Live Impact Area were not air- residential areas.

To addr !D E ! Environmental Response Team to collect and analyze fish and shellfish from the coastal waters and near-shore land on Vieques to determine whether fish and shellfish muscle tissues contain levels of metals and explosive compounds that would be harmful to human health. From July 16th to 20th, 2001, fish and shellfish were collected from six locations on Vieques. ATSDR decided to collect grouper, snapper, parrotfish, grunt, goatfish, blue land crab, spiny lobster, and queen conch because they were identified by several sources as types of seafood that are commonly caught and eaten. These fish and shellfish were collected from reefs and near shore areas at the following six locations: (1) north of the Live Impact Area, (2) south of the Live Impact Area, near a sunken Navy vessel, (3) south of Esperanza, (4) north of Isabel Segunda, (5) a fish market in Isabel Segunda, and (6) west of the Laguna Kiani Conservation Zone on the west end of Vieques. Fillet and muscle tissues were analyzed for metals and explosive compounds. All sampling and analysis procedures were conducted in accordance with established U.S. Environmental Protection Agency protocols. During the sampling event, the divers noted that all sample locations supported diverse, healthy populations of marine organisms and that all reefs were in good condition. They also noted that, with very few exceptions, the organisms collected appeared to be healthy. Page | B-8 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 ATSDR reached the following conclusions: Explosive compounds were not detected in any of the edible fish and shellfish from Vieques. Metals were detected in the fish and shellfish from Vieques; however, the levels were too low to cause harmful health effects for people eating the seafood. It is safe to eat fish and shellfish from Vieques every day. According to a local consumption study, almost half of the residents of Vieques eat seafood one or two times a week. However, some people responded that they eat seafood five or more times a week. To be protective of all residents, ATSDR estimated exposure by determining the amount of metals people would most likely be exposed to over their lifetime if they ate fish or shellfish every day for 70 years. ATSDR then compared the levels to those that are considered to be safe by public health professionals. ATSDR found that it is safe to eat a variety of fish and shellfish from Vieques on a daily basis. \u0011 !D current evaluation of Vieques, some of these conclusions have changed. Please see Chapter 9 for new conclusions and recommendations concerning fish and shellfish.

The residents were bombing exercises. The residents also had questions about whether contaminated dusts from the bombing range might blow into their neighborhoods. ATSDR concluded that Given the results of ATSDR's modeling analysis, the Navy's \"live bombing\" exercises did not pose a health hazard to residents. Three air-sampling studies were conducted during the time when the Navy used live bombs on Vieques. The Puerto Rico Environmental Quality Board conducted two of these studies, and the Navy conducted the other. None of the measurements in these studies found air pollution to be at levels of health concern. However, because original documentation of these studies has not been located, ATSDR could not rest its health conclusions on these studies alone. ATSDR estimated air quality impacts from live bombs using a modeling analysi s. This analysis considered nearly 100 different contaminants that are known to be released to the air when ordnance explodes. The modeling analysis found that chemicals released to the air in smoke by the bombs dispersed to extremely low levels as the smoke traveled from the bombing range toward where people live. For most contaminants, the predicted air quality impacts where residents live were so low that even highly sensitive air sampling devices would likely not be able to measure them. In the case of particulate matter, for example, emissions from live bombing exercises were predicted to account for less than 1 percent of the concentration of particulate matter currently measured in the residential areas of Page | B- 10 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 Vieques. This comparison suggests that emissions from the bombing range have extremely small impacts on the air quality in the residential areas of Vieques. Based on this modeling analysis, ATSDR concluded that emissions from live bombing exercises did not cause air pollution to reach levels known to be associated with health effects. The Navy's practice bombing exercises did not pose a health hazard to residents . F 2000 2003 -called practice bombs. On days when practice bombs fell on the bombing range, the Puerto Rico Environmental Quality Board collected more than 50 particulate matter samples. In every sample the particulate matter levels were lower than health concern levels. In fact, in the residential part of the island no clear relationship appeared between the number of practice bombs dropped and the levels of air pollution measured. Using these observations and estimating air concentrations of other contaminants, ATSDR found that on days when practice bombing occurred, levels of air pollution did not Wind-blown dust from the bombing range does not pose a health hazard to residents. The air quality effects of windborne dust are typically evaluated by measuring the l evels of particulate we breathe. For the last 3 years, the Puerto Rico Environmental Quality Board has measured levels of particulate matter at two locations in Vieques residential areas. By the time the ATSDR air evaluation was complete, nearly 450 air samples had been collected. In every measurement, the amounts of particulate matter were well below health concern levels. 39 The public health assessment in which this air sampling was discussed was presented at the Air and Waste Management Association's 96th Annual Conference and Exhibition in San Diego, June 22 26, 2003.

In June 2005, NOAA collected land crabs (Cardisoma guanhumi ) from 14 locations (13 on Vieques and one on the Puerto Rico mainland). The crabs were analyzed for explosive compounds, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides, and trace elements. After reviewing the analyses, ATSDR concluded that Land crabs are safe to eat The levels of PCBs, organochlorine pesticides, and trace elements found in land crabs were much lower than levels reported to cause harmful health effects. The levels were also below the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) regulatory limit for shellfish consumption. Only a few land crab samples contained PCBs and pesticides, indicating these chemicals were not widespread. ATSDR did not expect harmful health effects to occur in people who ate Vieques land crabs. Children should not eat the land crab's internal organs Because of the amount of copper in land crab internal organs, children who ate those internal organs ! day. Prudent public health practice would dictate, however, that children reduce their exposure to copper by not eating land crab internal organs. Explosive compounds were not detected in any crab sample, and no association was found between land crab sampling location and contaminant level s In some of the areas sampled, land crabs contained higher average concentrations for certain chemicals than did land crabs in other areas. As for other chemicals, no remarkable differences were found between the locations. ATSDR found that people could safely eat every day one meal of land crab from any of the sampled locations.

Document is a panel discussion summary. Executive Summary In Atlanta, Georgia, on June 12 and 13, 2001, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) convened a seven-member panel to review and discuss the then-state of the science related to hair analysis; specifically, its use in assessing environmental exposures. ATSDR invited a cross-section of scientific experts in the fields of hair analysis, toxicology, and medicine to participate in 1\u00bd days of Page | B- 13 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 discussion on a variety of topics, including analytical methods, factors affecting the interpretation of analytical results, toxicologic considerations, and data gaps/research needs. Background ATSDR convened this panel in response to 1) a then-growing number of inquiries from community members looking for assistance in interpreting hair analysis results, and 2) agency interest in learning more about the utility of hair analysis when evaluating exposures and health effects at hazardous waste sites. The agency anticipated using the input received from this effort to develop guidance for agency health assessors on the use and interpretation of hair analysis data. The general questions that ATSDR sought to answer included For what substances are reliable hair analysis methods available ? When is it appropriate/inappropriate to consider hair analysis in assessing human exposures to environmental contamination? What if any data gaps limit the interpretation and use of hair analysis in the assessment of environmental contaminants? This summary report presents the findings of the panel discussions. Principal discussion points are highlighted. Discussions Overview Panelists engaged in a series of discussions to address ATSDR's questions, pointing to several limitations with the then-state of knowledge on the usefulness of hair analysis in environmental exposure assessments. Discussions focused primarily on metals and trace elements in scalp hair. Panelists considered the distinct differences between using hair analysis to identify exposures (e.g., Is the substance reaching people? Does a competed pathway exist?) and using it to predict, diagnose, or treat disease (e.g., What do hair concentrations tell us about the likelihood of harmful health effects?). Panelists noted that the latter question pointed up the largest data gaps that then existed. Although not required to reach consensus, the panelists did agree on the following summary statement related to the overall usefulness of hair analysis in evaluating environmental exposures: For most substances, insufficient data were available that would allow the prediction of a health effect from the concentration of the substance in hair. The presence of a substance in hair may indicate exposure (both internal and external), but does not necessarily indicate the source of exposure. For what substances are reliable hair analysis methods available? The group agreed that then-available laboratory methods could measure the levels of some environmental contaminants in hair. But to help ensure more accurate and reliable results, procedures needed to be standardized. That would include ensuring samples were collected by a trained person and would include but not be limited to establishing consistent sampling protocols, washing protocols, and Page | B- 14 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 quality control/quality assurance procedures. The panel further agreed that testing should be targeted to the specific element of interest. When is it appropriate/inappropriate to consider hair analysis in assessing human exposures to environmental contamination? In general, panelists agreed that before determining whether hair analysis was an appropriate assessment tool, assessors should consider 1. The exposure type and period. To understand the likelihood that a particular substance will be in the hair at the time of testing and to identify other exposure sources (e.g., hair treatments), take exposure histories. 2. Because the growth rate of hair is on average 12 centimeters per year, the panel concluded that hair analysis is not generally useful for evaluating very recent exposures or those longer ago than 1 year. Segmental analysis of hair (i.e., looking at concentration trends along the length of the hair) may have a role in documenting exposures over time (e.g., identification of a high -dose acute exposure). But this would require consideration on a subject-, substance-, and situation-specific basis. 3. The type of substance and its behavior in the body. Determine the biological plausibility that a particular substance will be present in hair and whether it is a marker of external contamination. 4. The group agreed that little is known about the transfer kinetics of substances into hair. 5. The clinical relevance of a negative or positive finding. Determine the dose-response relationship, if any, between chemical concentrations in hair and target organ effects/illness. Without an understanding of a dose-response relationship, useful interpretations would not be possible. The panelists agreed that a relationship between contaminant concentrations in hair and any kind of measurable outcome has only been established for two substances: methyl mercury (e.g., the relation between maternal hair levels and observed developmental neurological abnormalities in offspring) and, to a limited extent, arsenic (e.g., segmental analysis for forensic analysis) provided external contamination can be ruled out. Unique forensic settings for other substances could, however, provide similar relationships. The group also indicated the need to evaluate, on a substance- and exposure-specific basis, the extent to which hair analysis might be more advantageous than other biological sampling, such as blood or urine analysis. What if any data gaps limit the interpretation and use of hair analysis in the assessment of environmental contaminants? The group identified several factors that limited the interpretation of even the most accurate, reliable, and reproducible laboratory results. These include The lack of reference (or background) ranges in which to frame the interpretation of results. In the absence of environmental exposures, assessors need a greater understanding of what is Page | B- 15 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 expected to be in hair to determine whether detected levels are elevated as a result of environmental releases, including possible geographical or regional differences in backgrou nd levels. Difficulties in distinguishing endogenous (internal) from exogenous (external) contamination in hair. Making this distinction is important in evaluating internal doses of the substance of interest. The group voiced different views on the effectiveness before analysis of washing hair to eliminate external contamination. Some felt that the then-current literature suggested no reliable washing method capable of separating external contamination from internal deposition of elements. One suggestion was that where possible, identifying metabolites (or other unique markers of internal exposure) for substances of interest was most helpful in distinguishing internal from external contamination. A lack of understanding of how and to what extent environmental contaminants are incorporated into the hair. At the time of the conference, little scientific information was available on the uptake or incorporation of environmental contaminants into hair. For metals or for environmentally relevant organic compounds, neither kinetic models nor metabolite data were known or fully understood. The lack of correlation between levels in hair and blood and other target tissues, as well as the lack of epidemiologic data linking substance-specific hair levels with adverse health effects. Before hair analysis results could be used as a diagnostic tool or to predict health endpoints, these correlations must be understood. The panel noted that hair analysis was not likely to play a role in evaluations of some of the more common health concerns associated with hazardous waste sites (e.g., cancer, birth defects). Little information was available that was pertinent to the study of environmentally relevant organic compounds in hair. The panel recommended taking advantage of what was known about hair analysis in testing for drugs of abuse. The panelists encouraged standardization of sampling protocols and identified possible research areas. Yet hair analysis could only become a valid tool for any particular substance if research Could establish better reference ranges, Gained a better understanding of hair biology and pharmacokinetics, Further explored possible dose-response relationships, Established whether and when hair might serve as a better measure or predictor of disease than other biological samples (e.g., blood or urine), and Learned more about organic compounds in hair.

Document is a record of peer review comments on the Ponce School of Medicine Heart Study In January 2001, a pilot study comparing the echocardiograms of residents in Vieques and in Ponce Playa, Puerto Rico reported substantial valvular abnormalities and pericardial thickening in a large proportion of the Vieques residents findings not seen among Ponce Playa residents. The possible abnormalities noted in the Vieques residents were attributed to \"vibro-acoustic disease\" (VAD), previously described in the medical literature by Portuguese investigators. VAD was said to occur as the Page | B- 17 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 result of noise and vibrations caused by naval exercises on the Island of Vieques. By Presidential directive, the Department of Health and Human Services investigated the issues raised by the study. The Department, in turn, referred this request to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), which was already investigating environmental public health issues in Vieques. Concurrent with this request, the Ponce School of Medicine (PSM) led by President and Dean Dr. Manuel Mart\u00ednez Maldonado had begun a more focused study of possible cardiac abnormalities among Vieques commercial fishers. This study sought to overcome methodological problems (e.g., sampling frame, lack of blinding) found in the earlier pilot study. On March 29 30, 2001, scientists from ATSDR and CDC met with the PSM investigators and agreed to invite the assistance of recognized practitioners and scientists in reviewing and interpreting the findings. The chosen reviewers were experts with international reputations in echocardiography and environmental or cardiovascular epidemiology. Because of its extensive experience, the echocardiography \"core\" laboratory at Mayo Clinic, directed by Dr. Jae K. Oh, was selected to review the echocardiograms. Eight accomplished physician-scientists accepted invitations to participate. They were principally from academic institutions: four panelists were from U.S. universities, two from Mexico, and two from Spain. Half of the panelists were specialists in cardiology and echocardiography; others were epidemiologists. Additional meeting participants included personnel or consultants of PSM and ATSDR, Dr. Jae Oh of Mayo Clinic, and Dr. John Rull\u00e1n, Secretary of Health of Puerto Rico. The meeting took place July 12 13, 2001, in the Condado Plaza Hotel in San Juan. Dr. Mart\u00ednez Maldonado and Dr. David Fleming, then Deputy Administrator of ATSDR, co-chaired. Participants reviewed the methods, results, and public health significance of the Vieques Heart Study, considering both PSM and Mayo Clinic data. Dr. Mart\u00ednez Maldonado and Dr. Carlos R\u00edos presented the Vieques Heart Study. The study objective was to determine any association between place of residence (Vieques or Ponce Playa) and morphological cardiovascular changes among commercial fishers. Investigators sampled randomly from the lists of licensed commercial fishers from Vieques and from Ponce Playa and obtained 53 and 42 subjects from the two areas, respectively. Investigators measured height, weight, blood pressure, and other physical parameters, collected questionnaire data on echocardiograms we subject) for pericardial thickness by a group of several experienced PSM cardiologists, with caliper placement done by consensus and by using magnified images. By PSM's measurements, the average pericardial thickness was slightly greater among Vieques fishers than among those from Ponce Playa (1.20 mm vs. 1.05 mm), and this difference was statistically significant (P = 0.03). The values for pericardial thickness measured by Mayo were within the same range as those measured by PSM, but did not achieve statistical significance when Vieques and Ponce fishers were compared (0.78 mm vs. 0.82 mm, respectively). Page | B- 18 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 Panel Conclusions the Ponce Playa nor the Mayo readings contained information indicating a cardiac health problem in the fishers. The initial report of gross valvular pathology from the pilot study was not replicated. All reviewers agreed that no clinically relevant difference between Vieques and Ponce Playa subjects in pericardial thickness appeared, contrary to that reported in the pilot study. Moreover, neither the PSM nor the Mayo measurements showed any subject's pericardial thickness to be larger than 2 mm a value the published literature considered in the upper limit of normal. The PSM study got generally high marks from the panelists regarding study design and statistical analysis. The sampling frame (lists of registered fishers) was regarded as appropriate, and revi ewers generally felt that the response rate was adequate. The fact that reasonably clear-cut hypotheses had been developed beforehand largely obviated concerns about the problem of multiple comparisons. In general, panelists felt that the statistical tests used were appropriately chosen and employed. Panelists noted that echocardiographic readings were performed with appropriate blinding including masking of datesat both PSM and Mayo. Summary Conclusion The PSM study did not support a finding of cardiac pathology among Vieques commercial fishers. Because of the inability of trans-thoracic echocardiography to measure reliably the small differences found, the differences reported were likely due to measurement error (intrinsic to the technique, not the scientists who used it). This fact almost certainly accounts for the different results obtained when Mayo readings of pericardial thickness replaced PSM readings. The Vieques Heart Study represented a valuable contribution to scientific knowledge regarding the use -reviewed scientific literature.

[Comment] The document as a whole is well written and relatively easy to follow. However, it suffers from a significant lack of consistent focus. While the ostensible question addressed by the document is whether the historical bombing exercises at Vieques have impacted public health, the document only sporadically focuses on those environmental health impacts that are specifically linked to the bombing and related military activities and often shifts focus to general environmental exposure and health considerations. Given the stated purpose of the review, one would expect that (at least for the environmental exposure/risk assessment portion of the review) there would be a logical structure that first defines the activities with a potential to impact public health, then identified the environmental contaminants that could be anticipated to result from those activities, then identified the environmental/biological media in which those contaminants are likely to be found, then presented the sampling results for those media and contaminants, and then compared those results to appropriate background data to make a determination of whether the exposures and potential exposures related to the sampling data were likely to be associated with the bombing and related activities. This logical progression should have been driven by one or two focused and explicit hypotheses to be tested. These resulted in exposures to specific environmental contaminants above non-bombing-related background E -related contaminants pose a significantly elevated proach is implied in the review, it is only intermittently followed. The review does refer to specific contaminants that were identified as resulting from the bombing activities - D 86 15 e identified in the BangBox test series. However, the relationship between the prevalence of these contaminants in the explosives and their likelihood of occurrence in environmental/biological media is not presented. This lack of prioritization not only makes hypothesis formulation and testing unclear, but also results in large uncertainty in distinguishing bombing-related contamination from background. In contrast, the review seems to present information about environmental contamination that often appears to have no clear potential relationship with the bombing-related activities either with respect to the contaminants discussed or the spatial relationship between the impacted areas and the location of the samples. While this disconnect is not always the case in the review, it is the case sufficiently often that the reader loses the sense of a clear focus and context for the information presented. This is most notably the case in the sections on the Fish Pathway and Biomonitoring, although similar considerations F \u0011 F sampling portions of the document, there is a large focus on mercury. Given the extent of that focus, one could conclude that mercury contamination in fish and seafood is highly anticipated to result from the bombing-related activities and is a major focus of the environmental health impact associated with Page | C-3 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 those activities. However, I have not found any place in the document where the relationship between those activities and mercury contamination in the environment in general, or in marine species in particular, is established. A more focused and useful formulation and discussion of the potential impact of the bombing-related activities on mercury/methylmercury impact on the Vieques population could proceed along the following lines: Is mercury/methylmercury contamination expected to be a major outcome of bombing- related activities? If so, where would the impact be expected? Are the fish that are likely to be affected by bombing-related mercury, the fish that are consumed by Vieques residents? What are the consumption patterns of Vieques residents relative to the likely impacted fish? What is the background dietary exposure to methylmercury in Vieques (i.e., from non- impacted fish) and how does it compare to the exposure from the likely impacted fish? Given the ubiquity of at least low-level methylmercury contamination of fish worldwide, it should be anticipated that mercury would be found to some extent in all fish caught and/or consumed in Vieques. Furthermore, without a clear understanding of the background methylmercury exposure and the Vieques-specific fish consumption patterns, there is no clear way to distinguish the potential impact of bombing-related mercury exposure from the background in Vieques. ATSDR generated few focused data specific to the assessment of bombing-related impacts in Vieques, but instead had to rely on existing data, much of which were not generated specifically for the purp ose of this assessment and/or were not collected or analyzed in a systematic fashion designed for the appropriate hypothesis testing. This results in the classic situation where ATSDR largely ends up looking the overall assessment needs to be viewed in light of these limitations. Nonetheless, the use of the existing data without a clearer focus on the goal of the assessment and without a clear discrim ination of the data relative to its quality and its relevance to the that goal has resulted in a document that is not clearly focused and often confusing in important parts. ATSDR Response: All reviewers commented on contaminants that could be linked to military exercises on Vieques. We therefore provided additional clarification within the summary report and provided references from one section to other sections. For example, when we discussed substances measured in fish, we included references to explosive ordnance constituents and soil measurements. We also provided some perspective about those media constituent levels we expected to be higher than others. The Report (Executive Summary and Chapters 1; 2; 3; 6; and 9) has been revised to reflect greater clarity between substances found in the Viequense environment and those associated with activities related to military exercises involving live ordnance. Page | C-4 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 ATSDR recognizes that the Report discusses both pathway-specific exposures to military exercise-related contaminants and to more general public health exposures. In that regard, !D general health. The above-referenced revisions do identify possible links found between substances in the environment and military exercises. While most of our data on contaminants in soil, water, air, and seafood are relatively recent, the releases that might or might not have contributed to them are historical. To establish conclusive links or specific pathways between the two is very challenging, except in the rare case where contaminants are uniquely associated with a site, such as RDX and TNT and bombing activities. This situation is not unique to Vieques it is an inherent problem at any site where environmental contaminants have many potential sources, including some associated with past activities at that site. Regarding mercury, scientists visited ATSDR in November 2009. They requested that ATSDR take another look at mercury levels in fish in ! \u0012 2 clearly. Finally, ATSDR does not typically collect environmental samples. We rely on available data from other sources. Has ATSDR adequately addressed the pathways of human exposure to bombing range-specific contaminants? [Comment] ATSDR has identified and addressed the appropriate pathways of exposure. However, as discussed above, with obvious exceptions (e.g., TNT, RDX) it has not clearly identified those environmental contaminants that are bombing range-specific, nor has it identified the extent of exposures to contaminants in the environment that are potentially associated with bombing range activities. The exceptions to this are the air and soil contact pathways where ATSDR has made a strong case that significant exposure to bombing-related contaminants is unlikely. ATSDR Response : We provided additional clarification within the Report and provided references from one section to other sections. We included references to explosive ordnance constituents when we discussed substances measured in fish. The Report (Executive Summary and Chapters 1; 2; 3; 6; and 9) has been revised to reflect greater clarity between substances found in the environment and those associated with military exercises involving live ordnance. Page | C-5 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 Please include specific comments on: Consumption of seafood from reefs near Vieques [Comment] While the very limited data on contaminants unequivocally associated with the bombing- related activities (e.g., TNT, RDX, Al) suggests that there is little or no significant accumulation of these chemicals in Vieques fish and little or no potential for accumulation, the great bulk of the assessment of consumption of bombing-related contaminants in fish is focused on mercury (Hg). As discussed above, there is no clear rationale provided for this focus. The nature and extent of the relationship between the bombing-related activities and mercury is not discussed and it is not even clear whether an accumulation of methylmercury (MeHg) in fish would be expected as a result of the bombing-related activities. I suspect that the focus on mercury in fish results more from the availability of data related to more general concerns about MeHg exposures than from a specific connection to the bombing-related activities. ATSDR Response : Because scientists who visited ATSDR in November 2009 raised mercury in fish as a health concern, ATSDR reviewed its findings for mercury in fish. The scientists were !D ! ! ! D U.S.EPA. Moreover, residents are still concerned that the fish they eat are contaminated with mercury. We have added information to Chapter 2 to make this point more clearly. Iron, aluminum, copper, manganese, zinc, and lead are the metals that are most likely to be elevated in LIA soils from bombing activity, though other metals were also found in the bombs. It should be noted that all of these metals are also naturally present in the soils and rocks of Vieques (ATSDR 2003a, Learned 1973, USGS 1997 and 2001). We also associated aluminum, iron, copper, and explosive compounds in some LIA-vicinity seafood with LIA-related military exercises. But these associations did not include mercury or other substances. Nonetheless the Report (Executive Summary and Chapters 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9 ) has been revised to clarify any relationship between substances found in the Viequense environment and those associated with military exercises involving live ordnance. [Comment continued] There were few data available on the fish actually consumed by Vieques residents. The primary source of species-specific consumption data appears to be the data collected by Dr. Caro in 2000. However, those data were based on a sample size of only 51 consumers. This sample size is unlikely to be representative of the population as a whole. No information is presented about the demographic representativeness of that sample, of the geographic location of the sample relative to the locations of concern, or of the fishing habits of the subjects relative to the population of Vieques in general. Furthermore, as presented, the data provide no information about the relative consumption frequency by species or of the variability in frequency among consumers. The document states that !D for D \u0012 in which the data in total were used is not specified. These data gaps make it very difficult to create a Page | C-6 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 reasonable model of fish consumption in Vieques and, in turn, to assess the exposure to contaminants in fish in general in Vieques, and especially in fish potentially impacted by bombing-related activities. ATSDR Response !D D \u0012 2000 we D \u0012 1 residents of Vieques, 2) information provided in the Vieques Special Commission Report, 3) 4 D 200 6 report.

Yet to refine our exposure estimates from eating reef fish, we do need additional information. We know that a significant proportion of Viequenses eat fish regularly. Still, more information about Viequense dietary habits would be useful, such as the frequency of consumption by sex and age for o Reef fish, ocean-going fish, and canned fish, o Various fish species, o Portion size, and o Reef location. This additional information would allow more refined dose estimates and subsequent risk evaluations. In any event, we have made changes in Chapter 2 to highlight the lack of information about frequency of fish consumption by species and that having this information would allow more refined estimates of dose and subsequent risk evaluations. Use of biomonitoring tools to assess exposure to metals and other hazardous chemicals in blood, urine, or hair that are related to historical bombing exercises [Comment] Biomonitoring of exposure is potentially a very powerful tool. However, the occurrence of contaminants in biological media integrates exposures from all sources. Thus, the interpretation of biomonitoring data relative to the exposure and public health implications for a specific population from a specific source is highly reliant on both the understanding of the sources of exposure and the background of the exposure from other sources in that population. The biomonitoring studies considered in the review have significant limitations for the assessment of the public health impact of the bombing-related activities. The sample sizes in the studies other than the PRDOH study were quite small (n = 30, 52), the relationship of the subjects to potential sources of the specific exposures in question were not presented, and there was no appropriate referent population from Vieques that could be used to distinguish background sources of exposure from bombing-related sources of exposure. Information about background levels of exposure were either from Puerto Rico, US-NHANES or from laboratory reference ranges. The relationship between the background exposures in the Puerto Rico and NHANEs data and those in Vieques were not discussed and the nature of the laboratory reference ranges was likewise not discussed. Furthermore, based on the ATSDR assessment of the PRDOH study, the data were not finalized and were of uncertain reliability. Elevations of biomonitoring levels relative to the mean or median levels in a dataset are to be expected due to normal statistical Page | C-7 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 variation. To interpret those elevations in an exposure context requires either a statistically valid reference population and/or a separate measure of exposure (e.g., air, soil, water, food) that is comparable in time and space to the biomonitoring data and that can be used to elucidate the exposure context of those elevated biomonitoring levels. Much of the biomonitoring data was for mercury relative to methylmercury exposure from fish consumption. However, I was unable to discern information from those data that allowed levels of mercury in those data to be related to potential bombing-related exposure (or lack of exposures). In any fish-consuming population, one would expect to find measurable concentrations of mercury in hair and blood and it would not be surprising to find a fraction of the population with levels that exceeded the levels corresponding to the USEPA RfD. This would be the case for populations consuming store-bought fish caught in remote locations and for populations consuming locally caught fish. Elevated levels of mercury in such datasets cannot be attributed to specific sources of contamination without additional data: mercury levels in a comparable population without exposure to locally impacted fish; the specific types of fish consumed; the locations those fish were caught; and the sources of contamination in those sources. ATSDR Response : We agree that the Vieques human biomonitoring studies are limited. We also agree that using biomonitoring data can be problematic, especially when attempting to determine whether residents have been exposed to contaminants in explosive ordnance. For clarification, we have made changes in Chapter 3. We dedicated a large portion of the Report to describing mercury exposures. Many of the Report details were absent from the original PHAs. We were concerned that such disproportionate discussion of mercury might lead reviewers to conclude that we found an association between mercury and military exercises on Vieques. On the contrary, our assessment focused only on that chemical exposure scenario posing the greatest human health risk. Chemical results for soil, air, water, and biota did not reveal extensive contamination. And biomonitoring studies are unlikely to reveal whether residents were or are exposed to contaminants from explosive ordnance. We clarified these conclusions by revising Chapters 1, 2, and 3. In summary, chemical results for soil, air, water, and biota did not reveal extensive site- related contamination . Soils from the LIA, however, were shown to contain metals above typically occurring background levels and some of these metals are associated with bombing activities (e.g., iron, copper zinc, and lead) . None of the levels detected in soil are harmful to humans . Although biomonitoring is unlikely to establish any link between human biomonitoring data and military contaminants on Vieques, some biomonitoring might identify unusual exposures . We agree that for some exposures, no reliable, accepted biomonitoring detection/measurement methods are available. We further agree that all biomonitoring has some limitations. Consumption of food (produce, meat, dairy, eggs) grown on the island [Comment] Because endogenous mercury in hair and blood almost exclusively reflects methylmercury exposure and because methylmercury exposure comes almost exclusively from fish/seafood consumption, mercury biomonitoring data (other than urine data) can be related to fish consumption Page | C-8 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 even if the additional data needed to relate that fish consumption to a specific source of mercury are not available. For other contaminants, where there is a unique or nearly unique source of exposure, positive biomonitoring results for those contaminants can provide clear evidence of exposure to those sources. However, for the biomonitoring of contaminants with multiple sources of exposure, including all of the metals reported for biomonitoring results from Vieques residents, biomonitoring data without additional exposure context provide little or no useful information about specific sources of exposure. Furthermore, to relate reliably biomonitoring levels to exposure from single source or from a combination of discrete sources, there has to be a known and established relationship between the concentration of the contaminant in the given biological medium (e.g., hair) and the exposure to that contaminant. Not all media have a valid concentration-exposure relationship for a given contaminant. Specifically, cadmium (Cd), arsenic (As), nickel (Ni), antimony (Sb) and lead (Pb) in hair are, to the best of my knowledge, not established or directly interpretable biomarkers of exposure. For these reasons I do not believe that the biomonitoring data presented by ATSDR can be interpreted relative to exposure to produce grown on the island, much less to exposure to contaminants from the bombing-related activities through consumption of food grown on the islan d. ATSDR Response !D mercury exposure source when evaluating the association between mercury and seafood consumption. In summary, chemical results for soil, air, water, and biota did not reveal extensive site-related contamination . Soils from the LIA, however, were shown to contain metals above typically occurring background levels and some of these metals are associated with bombing activities (e.g., iron, copper zinc, and lead). None of the levels detected in soil are harmful to humans. [Comment continued] With respect to the direct sampling of locally grown food, ATSDR correctly points out the limitations in much of the available data. These include sampling of inedible portions of food plants and sampling of non-food plants, lack of appropriate analytical standards, and lack of consideration of bioavailability. Considerable discussion is focused on the cadmium levels in pigeon !D alth impact of consumption of the sampled peas, that discussion is presented without a context for the results. It is unclear how, if at all, the sampled peas reflect exposure to pigeon peas island-wide, or the extent to which pigeon peas figure in the diet of the Vieques population in general. For the peas in particular and for the sampled produce in general, there is no basis for connecting data on contaminant levels in those samples to the bombing \u00ad related activity. ATSDR Response : Text in Chapter 5, Section 522 comments. At this time, no data (i.e., consumption survey or further info on intake of pigeon peas relative to total legumes) are available on consumption patterns. Thus for this preliminary analysis we used conservative assumptions that modeled high-end intake rates. Further refinement of these exposure estimates could make them more realistic and more representative of the Viequense population. ATSDR agrees with the lack of evidence to support any assertion of a viable transport pathway of metals contamination from the Live Impact Area to distant areas where food is grown. Any Page | C-9 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 detected metals are more likely to reflect other sources, such as soil background concentration or some other local source. This is an important distinction; yet the community did cite food intake as a health concern. Thus as a public health measure we used available data to conduct a conservative, preliminary evaluation of this pathway. Exposure to air, soil, and water on Vieques [Comment] My conclusions presented above for interpretation of biomonitoring data relative to locally grown food apply equally to exposures from air, soil, and water on Vieques. With respect to direct assessment of the air pathway, this is the strongest section and the one most clearly relevant to assessment of the potential impact of the bombing-related activities. In lieu of real time air monitoring data, the modeling approaches evaluated by ATSDR are the best approach to assessing this pathway. The conclusions from these analyses are robust and clearly support a conclusion that the bombing-related activities did not result in a significant exposure to residential areas. With respect to the assessment of bombing-related contaminants in soil, although the sampling of on- site soil was necessarily limited, the conclusions of little historical health risk to the on -site protestors appear reasonable. This conclusion is based on the observations that the samples were taken at relevant and representative areas, that the bombing-related activities appear to have been widespread in that part of the island, and that essentially none of the soil sampling results indicated significant risk with long or short-term exposure. With respect to the impact of the bombing-related activities on the more remote, residential areas, ATSDR is correct in pointing out that potential transport of contaminants from the bombing areas to the residential areas would only have occurred by the same pathways that would have resulted in residential inhalation exposure to those contaminants. Thus, the modeled lack of significant airborne contamination from the bombing sites at the residential areas likewise, indicates lack of deposition of those contaminants to residential soil. With respect to the assessment of drinking water, the provision of drinking water through the pipeline system remote from the bombing locations ensures that there is no exposure through drinking water for the great majority of the Vieques population. The lack of clear data on the extent of private well water and rain collection basin use and the associated lack of data for the quality of those sources creates some uncertainty about exposure from drinking water. Nonetheless, the hydrogeologic findings regarding the direction of groundwater flow appear to preclude contamination of the relevant aquifers. However, there are no data presented to substantiate that claim and these would be helpful (e.g., groundwater flow contours). ATSDR Response: Thank you for your comments. We have added a topographical map showing groundwater flow contours as Figure 1.3 in the Report. Page | C- 10 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 Does the Vieques summary report adequately present and describe the limitations and uncertainty of assessing human exposure to bombing range-specific contaminants? [Comment] For the most part, ATSDR appears to be aware of the limitations of the available data for assessing human exposure to the bombing-related contaminants. The consideration of the air exposure, although somewhat short on detail, appears to be both site-specific, and appropriate in scope. The drinking water data are largely straightforward and are presented with the appropriate limitations largely arising from uncertainties about the extent of private well use. For the other exposures, despite awareness of the limitations associated with those data, data of limited or doubtful relevance are presented and considered in the overall assessment. I believe that more stringent criteria for inclusion of data in the review would have been appropriate for those exposures. In addition, particularly, in the sections on fish consumption and biomonitoring, ATSDR seems to repeatedly lose sight of the distinction between exposure to contaminants in general and exposure to contaminants specifically arising from the bombing-related activities. Specific instances of these points are presented in my text-specific comments. ATSDR Response : As for the specific example of mercury, visiting scientists in November 2009 requested that ATSDR review again its findings on mercury levels in fish, especially in light of the ! ! disproportionate focus on mercury might mislead reviewers into concluding that we found an association between mercury and the military exercises on Vieques. We could not show an association. On the contrary, in our assessment we focused heavily on the chemical exposure scenario that posed the greatest risk. Chemical results for soil, air, water, and biota did not reveal any such extensive mercury contamination. Describing all the environmental and health data available for Vieques is important even when some of the data could not be verified or validated. The hair data results were presented for numerous metals. Some scientists believed the data were valid and drew conclusions from them. We described the limitations of these data in detail, pointing out the inability to distinguish between external contact and internal ingestion for most metals, except mercury. To this extent, ATSDR has attempted to report fairly the available data and to provide insight into their usability in making health decisions. In our conclusions and recommendations the data that could not be verified or validated were either not used (e.g., metals in hair, except mercury) or were used qualitatively (e.g., arsenic in urine reported in a Webinar). All reviewers commented on Report discussions about possible links between contamination and the military exercises on Vieques. We thus provided additional clarification within the Report and provided references from one section to other sections. For example, when we discussed substances measured in fish, we included references to the explosive ordnance constituents and soil measurements. We also provided some perspective about various media constituents we expected to be higher than others. The Report (Executive Summary and Page | C- 11 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 Chapters 1, 2, 3, 6 and 9) has been revised to clarify further those substances found in the environment and those associated with military exercises. In that regard, ATSDR recognizes the Report discusses both pathway-specific exposures to explosive-ordnance contaminants and more general public health exposures. This resulted from the request ATSDR received to review its previous work in light concerns. The revisions referenced above provide information on possible links between substances found in the environment and military exercises on Vieques. Yet to prove links or specific pathways between current detections and historical releases of contaminants from multiple potential sources is impossible. This is not a Vieques-specific problem it is inherent at many sites where historical activities possibly resulted in environmental contamination. Are independent studies utilized appropriately in the determination of potential health hazards? [Comment] As indicated above, many of the independent studies were not conducted specifically to address the issue of the impact of the bombing-related activities. Some of the other studies that attempted to focus more directly on those activities were poorly designed or too limited in scope to be useful. ATSDR did not set a particularly high standard for discriminating among those studies in terms of incorporating data into its overall assessment. To some extent this is understandable given the necessity of addressing the communities concern and the limited pool of data with which to work. However, the net effect is one of a very mixed and loosely woven patch quilt of data sources. I address more specific comments below. ATSDR response : We agree that the data are of varying quality, and we described their limitations. That said, only in very few instances did poor data underlie potential exposure assessments. Mercury in some fish the public exposure scenario that posed the greatest health riskwas based on very high quality data. But even those data were limited. In response to the concerns about independent studies, it is important to describe all the environmental and health data that are available for Vieques. And this is true even when some of the data might be questionable. For instance, hair data results were presented for numerous metals. Some scientists believed these data were valid and drew conclusions on them. But ATSDR described the limitations of these data in detail. We pointed out the inability to distinguish between external contact and internal ingestion for most metals, except mercury. To this extent, ATSDR has attempted to report fairly the available data and to provide insight into their usability in making health decisions. In our conclusions and recommendations, these questionable data were either not used (e.g., metals in hair, except mercury) or were used qualitatively (e.g., arsenic in urine reported in a Webinar). Page | C- 12 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 On the basis of ATSDR's re-evaluation of historical bombing activities in the Vieques summary report, has ATSDR reached the appropriate conclusions and recommendations? [Comment] Fish pathway. I believe that the conclusions about mercury (Hg) levels by species and the health risk (relative to the methylmercury RfD) of consuming those fish at given rates of consumption are appropriate. Nonetheless, the connection between those conclusions and the impact of the bombing \u00ad !D !D be certain of the extent that military activities did or did not contribute to the mercury levels found in consumption in Vieques is likely to be misleading as a connection to the bombing-related activities is implied by that discussion. ATSDR Response : We agree that the mercury discussions are extensive. We further agree that some readers might assume that mercury is related to explosive ordnance used during military exercises on Vieques. We clarified this possible misconception by revising Chapters 1, 2, and 3. [Comment continued] Biomonitoring. ATSDR did not actually reach conclusions regarding the biomonitoring or its relationship to the bombing-related activities. Other than to express caution about the use of biomonitoring using hair due to potential exogenous contamination (and not, however, because of the lack of a clear relationship between endogenous hair concentration and internal exposure as discussed above), ATSDR merely reiterated the conclusions of the individual investigators and did not attempt and overall synthesis. I believe that the appropriate conclusion is that the biomonitoring results do not permit any conclusions about exposure to the bombing-related contaminants. ATSDR Response : We agree. Biomonitoring studies do not reveal whether residents were or are exposed to contaminants from live ordnance used during military exercises. We clarified this point by revising Chapter 3. [Comment continued] Health Outcome Data . Here too, ATSDR did not state clear conclusions about the relationship between the health outcomes data and the bombing- !D conclusions about the methodological limitations of the Vieques disease incidence data. ATSDR Response : Thank you for your comment. ATSDR did not state clear conclusions about any potential relationship due to the various methodological limitations in the limited, historical work.

I !D one hand about the direction of groundwater flow precluding groundwater contamination westward of the bombing sites, and its conclusion on the other hand that an insufficient number of wells have been sampled to draw firm conclusions about the potential impact of bombing-related activities on drinking water wells. ATSDR Response: We added clarifying text to Chapter 8, Section 8.3.1.2. Our evaluation indicates that bombing activities on Vieques would not affect the former drinking wells. Still, limited sampling in the 1970s showed two detections of explosives; thus we could not exclude the possibility of an unknown, past mechanism. But even conceding that the contaminants might have been extant in the past, they have not been detected in recent years.

Furthermore, the comparison between Vieques and Esperanza does not indicate a likely significant difference. Without more information and contextual description, no conclusion can be drawn from these data.

D \u0012 conclusions were based on two samples, analyzed at separate times, and treating a nondetected value differently from that suggested by U.S.EPA. Of the few species that had sufficient samples for comparison (hind, parrot, and grunt), only grunt had statistically higher levels of mercury in Vieques. The highest mercury level found by Dr. Caro of 0.052 ppm was found in Parguerra and this was 37% higher than the highest level found in Vieques.

[Comment continued] Pg. 22, par. 1 - The goal here is to characterize consumption, not the species per se. Therefore, discussion about combining species should have been driven by consideration of which species were most commonly consumed. ATSDR Response : Insufficient data are available to evaluate contaminant levels by species; we had to combine fish by families. In most cases, this resulted in data by genus rather than by species. Grouping fish by families did allow an evaluation of mercury levels in grunt, hind, and snapper. [Comment continued] Last paragraph - /the data were not adequate for comparison by species, the preceding discussion compare grunt/hind with other fish.? ATSDR Response : We have analyzed the data further and found that some species could be compared. Previously we grouped species in each family (e.g., hind, grunt, snapper) together to compare concentrations at locations. We have since determined that some species (e.g., rock hind and red hind) can be individually compared. These comparisons are described in Chapter 2, Section2 .5. [Comment continued] Pg. 26, #5 - There is no basis for this assertion. There is no LOAEL or NOAEL for MeHg ATSDR Response : We have modified the sentence.

Rather, the issue is increased risk of an adverse effect. ATSDR Response : We have changed the wording in Chapter 2, Section 2 .3.1. [Comment continued] Pg. 34, limitations - It appears that the choice of fish samples was not based on any direct data about actual consumption by species. This should be added as a significant limitation of the sampling strategy. ATSDR Response: We used the direct data collected by Dr. Caro and supplemented these data with information gathered from discussions with the residents of Vieques, information provided in the Vieques Special Commission Report, and visits to local fish markets. ATSDR agrees that additional information is needed to refine exposure estimates from eating reef fish. We know that a significant proportion of Viequenses eat fish regularly. However, more information about Viequenses dietary habits would be very useful. It would be useful to know the frequency of consumption by gender and age for: Reef fish, ocean-going fish, and canned fish, Various fish species, Portion size, and Reef location. This additional information would allow a more refined risk estimate. In any event, we have made changes to Chapter 2. [Comment continued] Pg. 49, par. 2 - All biological media are not equally appropriate for all analytes because of a lack of a demonstrable exposure-concentration relationship. In general, hair is considered a standard biological medium for Hg only. I am not aware of any established method for biomonitoring of Sb in hair. In NHANES, CDC quantified Sb in urine. ATSDR Response : ATSDR agrees. While antimony levels in hair can be measured, interpreting the results is difficult. Distinctions are impossible between oral intake of antimony (internal exposure) and hair contact with antimony-containing products (external exposure). [Comment continued] Par. 2 -\"/ Dr. Ortiz Roque's identification of three residents with hair mercury levels above 12 ppm is an important finding.\" Other than possibly from a clinical standpoint, why is this an important finding? Without information on sources of exposure (e.g., canned tuna), no inference for environmental exposure can be drawn. ATSDR Response : We agree. The findings are important from a clinical perspective but do not indicate an association to military activities on Vieques. Regarding the finding that some women Page | C- 17 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 and children with mercury hair levels above a level that might cause harmful effects to a developing fetus or a young child indicates excessive mercury exposure for at least some residents. While the assumption is that this excessive exposure comes from eating fish, only follow up can confirm this. The mercury exposure might have resulted from a high frequency of eating a certain fish (e.g., canned tuna, certain reef fish, or certain ocean-going fish). The Chapter 2 dose estimates indicate that exposure to mercury can be excessive in some people who frequently eat fish that contain moderate to high levels of mercury. [Comment continued] Pg. 51, Table 3- 2 - The summary information on the studies of mercury in blood is 3-5 years out of date. ATSDR Response : The studies referred to in Table 3-2 for mercury are the Faroe Islands study, the Seychelles study, and the New Zealand study. These are the principal studies the National Academy of Sciences, the U.S.EPA, and ATSDR use to develop health guidelines. The studies have resulted in numerous peer-reviewed journal articles that we consulted when evaluating the toxicologic significance of the methylmercury exposure. ATSDR is not aware of more recent peer-reviewed studies. [Comment continued] Pg. 52, par. 5 and ff. - matrix a follow- Why? From an individual chemical standpoint, an elevated biomonitoring result warrants follow-up only if there is a potential for adverse effects. From a population-based standpoint, a single elevated level provides little or no useful inferential data. ATSDR Response : ATSDR agrees that a single elevated level in one person provides very limited information when it comes to making broad statements about inferring exposure to bomb- related chemicals and elements. We have changed the text accordingly. Prudent public health practice, however, requires follow-up investigations when persons have metals in biological matrices at levels of health concern. A prime example is elevated blood lead levels. [Comment continued] Pg. 57 - informative about health risk.

ATSDR Response : We have modified the text to indicate that the 52 subjects were Viequenses. Because this information came from a Webinar, we cannot currently answer the other questions. This information is likely to be available when Dr. Rodr\u00edguez Sierra publishes his data.

We have clarified the text. [Comment continued] Pg. 103, par. 1 - The sentence is not a complete sentence. ATSDR Response : We revised the sentence in the fourth paragraph of Chapter 4, Section 4.1 as listed below. The Selected Metropolitan/Micropolitan Area Risk Trends (SMART) project was initiated to develop prevalence estimates at the local level. [Comment continued] Pg. 108, #2 and ff. Given the latency for most cancers, how do temporal aspects of cancer incidence relate to military activities on Vieques? ATSDR Response The U.S. Navy has occupied some part of Vieques since 1941. Considering the latency of most cancers, evaluating cancer incidence and mortality from 1990 2004 is a reasonable timeframe. [Comment continued] Page | C- 20 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 Pg. 109, #4 - It is important to discuss the socio-economic status (SES) of Vieques relative to Puerto Rico. ATSDR Response : ATSDR added a discussion of SES in Chapter 1. [Comment continued] Pg. 115, first bullet - Where are the locations of the reference populations given here? It would be useful to have a map at this point. ATSDR Response : We agree a map would be helpful. Unfortunately, Figure 2 of Massol-Deya 2000 contains only the study areas.

Are the goats in Puerto Rico that are being compared to those in Vieques the same species of goat? Are they the same age? What were the levels in Vieques and Puerto Rico goats? Was the difference statistically significant? ATSDR Response : This information was not included in the publication (Massol-Deya 2002) that presented the hair sampling data. Among other things, the lack of this information precluded ATSDR from using these data to evaluate human exposure from consuming local-livestock meat and milk products. [Comment continued] Pg. 121, Table 5- 1 - If the childhood exposure duration (ED) is assumed to be 6 yr, the adult ED should be 70 - 6 = 64 yr rather than the 70 yr value used here for adults if a 70 yr lifetime is assumed. Also, why do the ingestion rate (IR) assumptions differ for the MRL calculation (0.10, 0.05 kg/day) versus the NOAEL/LOAEL calculations (0.05, 0.01 mg/kg/day)? ATSDR Response : Table 5-1 has been modified to show that exposure duration had no effect on the estimated daily dose. The ingestion rates used for comparison to the MRL of 0.10 and 0.05 kg/day reflect 95 th percentile intake rates for adults and children, respectively. The rates for the NOAEL and LOAEL comparisons reflect 95th and 50th percentile intakes for children only. [Comment continued] Pg. 124, par. 2 - How many pineapple samples were taken? Was it only 1? If so, how can this observation be used to support modeling? Page | C- 21 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 ATSDR Response : Lopez Morales (2005) does not overtly state the sample number, but apparently a total of 72 samples were taken: 36 from the study site and 36 from a reference plantation. [Comment continued] Pg. 126, par. 2. I do not see that these very limited data support any larger assessment of exposure or risk. ATSDR Response : Thank you for your comment. ATSDR agrees that limitations in the current sampling data make it difficult to evaluate the extent of public health impact from exposure to metals in locally grown produce. Given the uncertainties in the data, ATSDR believes prudent public health practice requires further investigation of this potential exposure pathway. To address this data deficiency, ATSDR has recommended further sampling . [Comment continued] Pg. 164 1 E samples, this implies that they are assumed not to be impacted by specific activities. ATSDR Response: In Chapter 7, Section 7.2.4, we inserted parentheses around the phrase to indicate that background locations are by definition not affected by military operations. [Comment continued] Pg. 165, par. 2 - This is a reasonable assumption for the sites of the actual explosions. However, when considering off-site transport, surficial material becomes more important. ATSDR Response : Most of the surface soil samples used in this evaluation were collected directly from the LIA. We recommend that any future sampling conducted outside the LIA consider surficial (top 3 inches) contamination. [Comment continued] Pg. 190, 1b - Hair is not an appropriate medium for biological monitoring for most contaminants. Blood is generally more appropriate. But for blood too, the determination of the applicability of its use for biological monitoring is contaminant-specific. ATSDR Response : We agree that with the exception of mercury, hair is of limited use for environmental exposure monitoring. Numerous statements in the Report convey this message. We also agree that if other metals are considered as part of a biomonitoring study, developing a scientifically rigorous and valid protocol is important. This includes determining whether the results will inform about health risk. [Comment continued] Pg. 192, #2 - The review has not provided any basis to conclude what this single observation of Cd levels in the pigeon peas implies for exposure.

Page | C- 23 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 Reviewer 2 Overall, has ATSDR's re-evaluation of public health issues associated with historical bombing exercises at Vieques been appropriate? [Comment] The ASTDR document: A Fresh Look at Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques, attempts to explain in readily accessible language, the potential for human health effects as a result of decades of use of portions of the island as a U.S. Navy training and testing area. The document has been developed using data collected by related agencies specifically for the purposes of this risk assessment as well as data collected by external sources. The risk assessment discussion has been organized based on individual pathways as a means to both structure the information and explain the potential risks in a systemized manner. contaminants in soil systems as well as someone familiar with Vieques. Before graduate school, I worked in Vieques for two winters during the mid-1980s. At this time the Navy still had an active presence on the island. I remember being able to both feel and hear some of the munitions testing during my time on the Island. I read about protests by Viequenses that were a factor in the decision to end the testing operations. I have also been back since the Navy ceased operations and the former Navy bases became wildlife areas managed by U.S. Fish and Wildlife. Understandably, the residents of Vieques are concerned about potential negative health effects as a result of the decades long use of the island as a training and testing area for the Navy. Certain factors, including high cancer rates and increased incidences of select medical conditions would suggest to concerned residents that there is likely a link between the testing operations and these observed health effects. The risk assessment document attempts to ascertain any potential relationship between the testing and these observed effects by going through each exposure pathway and discussing all available evidence linking any human health effects to the testing results for each pathway. This effort is handicapped by a number of factors. The testing began several decades before any research efforts to document health effects were started. It is likely that the records of testing re: chemical composition, quantity and final fate of the ordinance used, is not complete. Some of the data used for the current effort was compiled by external scientists, without the appropriate quality assurance, quality control, information on methods, and control populations that are general considered essential for the data to be considered appropriate for use. Finally, the necessary studies to provide quantitative guidance on contaminant concentrations in different human tissues, soils, fish that are likely associated with health effects are not available for all of the contaminants considered in this document. In general, this review is very sympathetic to the concerns of the residents of Vieques. Data is included in this analysis that is likely inappropriate for use in a more rigorous exercise. Examples of this include web casts and unpublished data on health of residents. The desire to address concerns of residents has also resulted in credence and attention being given to certain pathways that are not realistically supported by the data as being a significant threat. Page | C- 25 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 ATSDR Response : Thank you for your summary comments. Has ATSDR adequately addressed the pathways of human exposure to bombing range-specific contaminants? [Comment] The document divides the potential for harm to have resulted from Navy activities into the following categories: Consumption of fish Terrestrial food chain pathway Air pathway Soil pathway Drinking water pathway The pathway approach is appropriate. In addition, all relevant pathways have been considered. ATSDR Response : Thank you for your comments. Please include specific comments on: Consumption of seafood from reefs near Vieques Use of biomonitoring tools to assess exposure to metals and other hazardous chemicals in blood, urine, or hair that are related to historical bombing exercises [Comments combined by reviewer] The primary conclusions of the report are that the pathways that have the potential to be of concern are the consumption of fish and the terrestrial food chain pathway. Mercury is the primary contaminant of concern for the consumption of fish and Cd is the primary concern for the terrestrial food chain pathway. The authors cite data from a number of studies that show elevated Hg concentrations in certain fish species caught in the vicinity of testing impacted reefs in Vieques. They also cite less credible studies that indicate elevated Hg concentrations in hair for, depending on the study, a significant number of Viequenses in comparison to control populations (Dr. Col\u00f3n de Jorge and Dr. Rodr\u00edguez Sierra). The elevated Hg in humans is related to the observed high Hg content in fish. The authors of the current report conclude that reducing fish consumption and avoiding certain species of fish are sensible options to reduce any risk associated with elevated Hg in seafood. These conclusions are reasonable based on the Hg concentrations in certain of the fish species sampled as well as the availability of other fish species that have been shown to have low levels of Hg in edible tissue. The authors of this report present the findings of Dr. Col\u00f3n de Jorge and Dr. Rodr\u00edguez Sierra while also pointing out the flaws or unknowns for both studies. It does not make sense to spend additional resources to test human Hg body burdens when a clear option for reducing Hg in diets while maintaining fish as a staple source of pr otein has been described. The one factor that is not considered in this discussion is the potential for the Page | C- 26 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 observed excess Hg in fish to be related to Naval activities. There is no discussion in the document on the quantities of Hg that were likely used in Naval activities or whether elevated Hg concentrations have been detected in reefs impacted by Naval activities. So while the conclusions and recommendations of the ASTDR report re fish consumption are reasonable, a clear link has not been made between the observed elevated concentrations in certain fish species and Navy activities on the island. ATSDR Response: The Report focused heavily on mercury in fish because it poses the greatest risk of those scenarios assessed. Chemical results for soil, air, water, and biota do not reveal extensive contamination and do not identify an association between mercury and the bombing activities. We clarified this point by revising the Executive Summary and Chapters 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9. Consumption of food (produce, meat, dairy, eggs) grown on the island Exposure to air, soil, and water on Vieques [Comments combined by reviewer] The other main concern outlined in the report is the potential for high Cd consumption from eating pigeon peas. This recommendation is based on a single study that included samples of about 20 pigeon pea plants from a single area on the island. This recommendation is also based on the assumption that a high quantity of pigeon peas will be part of a daily diet and that these peas will be grown on the island. For this reviewer, this conclusion and recommendation is not supported by the available data. There are a number of reasons for this. The report concludes that there is no basis for concerns re direct ingestion of soils (the soil pathway) or from airborne contaminants. Both the available data and modeling efforts show no evidence of or potential for significant hazards associated with either the soil pathway or the air pathway for residents in the middle portion of the island. This is the inhabited portion and has always been exempt from military testing. For pigeon peas to have excess Cd as a result of the Naval testing, there would also need to be associated soil contamination. As modeling and data show no hazard from the soil pathway or the airborne pathway, it is also highly unlikely that soils would have become sufficiently contaminated with Cd as a result of the Naval activities to result in consistently elevated plant Cd concentrations in the edible portions of plant tissue. As was stated earlier with Hg, there is no evidence provided of high Cd use or Cd concentrations in any of the munitions used in the testing. Cadmium was historically used as a pigment. It is not clear that any more than trace amounts of this metal were involved in any of the Naval activities. Soils can be naturally elevated in Cd- for examples soils in Salinas, California, derived from Monterrey shale have Cd 40concentrations ranging from 0.05-10.1 mg kg-1 (Burau et al., 1973) . Sediment samples collected from the LIA show Cd concentrations ranging from 60-110 mg kg-1. This was in an area where metal concentrations were elevated through the sampling depth as a result of direct impact of explosives. While these sediment Cd concentrations are clearly very high, they are directly in the impacted area. It is highly unlikely that agricultural soils will show any detectible increase in soil Cd as a result of the Navy activities. The peer reviewer did not provide a full citation in the comments sent to ATSDR. Page | C- 27 40 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 There are other factors that make the high Cd concentrations in this single study an insufficient basis for concern. Plant uptake of Cd will likely vary based on specific soil and plant factors. The study used as a basis for concern was from a single site. It is highly likely that Cd concentrations for peas grown in different areas of the island would vary significantly. A mean value, from a range of sites, showing highly elevated Cd, would be much more significant. Bioavailability of Cd will also vary based on the nutritional status of the individuals. A study showed significantly higher adsorption of Cd in cases where Ca and Fe were below required levels (Reeves and Chaney, 2001). Sufficient Zn in diets was also observed to protect against excess Cd adsorption. The most studied cases of adverse health effects as a result of excess diet Cd were in Japan where milled rice was the staple grain. This occurred after WW II when diets were poor in Japan. Pigeon peas are likely a far superior source of essential elements than milled rice. In addition, diets in Vieques are likely superior to those where Cd in food resulted in adverse health effects. Finally, it is highly unlikely that enough pigeon peas are grown in Vieques to feed a significant portion of the population for any amount of time. Although historically sugar cane was an important crop economically, agriculture in Vieques is limited. Families will have a few citrus trees, some banana and other sundry plants, however, there are very few large- scale farms in Vieques. During my time there, there was one attempt to grow tomatoes for export that failed. consistently grow crops commercially without irrigation. The above comments can be applied to the entire food chain transfer model (excluding seafood). Looking at the soil pathway section, there is no data presented in this chapter. However, based on the airborne discussion and the conclusions in the soil chapter, it seems pertinent to revisit the conclusions reached on metal uptake from home grown vegetables. That chapter did not include data on metal concentrations in soils where plants were grown. The chapter on soil pathways suggest that the potential for elevated soil metals as a result of Navy activities in the populated portion of the island, the portion that might be used for agricultural activities, is minimal. Airborne spread of metals would be the primary pathway for metal contamination of these soils. Metals would persist in the soil over time, unlike the organic contaminants that were also measured. The absence of any increase in soil metals suggests that the elevated Cd content in the pigeon peas is not likely related to soil contamination as a result of previous Naval activities. There are many factors that can lead to elevated plant metal concentrations, including a high soil electrical conductivity level, low soil Zn concentrations, and there may be a relation with low soil phosphorus. Many of these soil factors can be controlled with proper management. Appropriate soil testing and agricultural practices are suggested as a means to address concerns. ATSDR Response: Thank you for your comments. Relevant text in Chapter 5, Section 5.2.2 has been modified. Page | C- 28 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 Does the Vieques summary report adequately present and describe the limitations and uncertainty of assessing human exposure to bombing range-specific contaminants? [Comment] Yes Are independent studies utilized appropriately in the determination of potential health hazards? [Comment] In the interest of including as much information as possible with a particular goal of including any information generated by researchers from Puerto Rico, information is included in this report that would not be considered of sufficient scientific integrity to be included in most studies. There are a range of reasons for doing this, and the inclusion of these studies has not resulted in unreasonable recommendations. The recommendations from the report are likely to be more broadly accepted because this data has been included. ATSDR Response: Thank you for your comment On the basis of ATSDR's re-evaluation of historical bombing activities in the Vieques summary report, has ATSDR reached the appropriate conclusions and recommendations? [Comment] See discussion on plant Cd concentrations above, however general response is yes. ATSDR Response: None required. Select the appropriate category below: List recommended changes or reasons for not recommending o Recommend (X) o Recommend with Required Changes ( ) o Not Recommended ( ) Additional Questions: Are there any comments on ATSDR's peer review process? [Comment] No Are there any other comments? [Comment] In general, the report is potentially too lenient in its use of any and all appropriate data. The report expresses concerns with minimal basis. The information presented suggests that the history of Page | C- 29 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 naval activities on Vieques has not resulted in any measurable human health impacts. With that said, it is likely that if full and unrestricted access was granted to the former naval areas including home construction, the conclusions of this risk assessment would need to be revisited. The are a is likely to require extensive remediation before unrestricted access can be permitted. In addition, the limited data presented in this report on contamination both in the waters around Vieques and for portions of the impacted areas suggest that a full ecosystem risk assessment would reach very different conclusions than this limited human health risk assessment. ATSDR Response: Thank you for your comment. We changed the text (in the Executive Summary, Chapters 1, 2, and 3 to improve the discussion of contaminants in bombs and their possible contribution to various pathways. Iron, aluminum, copper, manganese, zinc, and lead are the metals most likely to be elevated in LIA soils from bombing activity, though other metals were also found in the bombs. It should be noted that all of these metals are also naturally present in the soils and rocks of Vieques (ATSDR 2003a, Learned 1973, USGS 1997 and 2001). Although associations with these samples and military activities are not strong, the samples were not designed for a thorough ecological assessment. Thus they should only serve as indicators of further study. Also, in Chapters 7 and 9 we clarified that ATSDR recommends environmental assessment and remediation activities continue at the LIA and at other potentially contaminated sites on Vieques. Restricted access to those areas should continue until the areas are cleared for unrestricted access. Page | C- 30 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 Reviewer 3 Overall, has ATSDR's re-evaluation of public health issues associated with historical bombing exercises at Vieques been appropriate? [Comment] Yes, the re-evaluation has been appropriate. The exposure pathways have been adequately considered, local studies that were made available were included and analyzed and proposals have been made for further work. My answer is qualified by only two things. First, there seems to be a degree of ignorance on local conditions, which are reflected in the report: the recommendation for Viequenses to follow the U.S.EPA FD! recommendations for selecting and eating fish and shellfish, and the lack of knowledge concerning the public water supply of Vieques. My second qualification has to do with the multiplicity of samplings and data gathering activities that are recommended to fill current data gaps. Considered individually, I generally agree with them. However, taken as a whole, they constitute a huge and expensive undertaking likely to take many years. It is suggested that priorities be established and the most important gaps be filled first in order to establish within a reasonable period of time whether the health of Viequenses is at risk or not. Details of this are given below. ATSDR Response : Thank you for your comments. We have modified the text in Chapter 2 to better reflect local fish consumption habits. We also modified Chapter 8 to address concerns about the public water supply. ATSDR considers education about choosing fish with lower mercury levels to be the highest priority public health recommendation and plans to work with our partners and the community to prioritize other recommendations. Has ATSDR adequately addressed the pathways of human exposure to bombing range-specific contaminants? [No Comment] Please include specific comments on: Consumption of seafood from reefs near Vieques [Comment] 1. I agree with recommendations #1-3. However, ATSDR should reconsider recommendation #4 (Viequenses follow the U.S.EPA FD! selecting and eating fish and shellfish). These recommendations are hardly applicable at Vieques. Consider that Viequenses eat fish provided by local fishers, which consist mainly of those shown in Table 2-1 E!FD! (salmon, pollock and catfish) that are non-existent in the area. This is not going to happen, and instead Page | C- 31 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 the recommendation should be to eat local species that are low in mercury, and a table should be provided. Viequenses are asked to check local advisories about fish safety. To my knowledge no such advisories there are none in Vieques. Using these references gives the impression that ATSDR is not aware o f the local situation. Viequenses are told not to eat shark, swordfish, king mackerel, or tilefish, species that are not listed in Table 2- 1. ATSDR Response : We agree that portions of the EPA/FDA national fish advisory do not apply to Viequenses. We have modified this recommendation in Chapter 2,Section 2.3.2. D \u0012 Table 2-1 in Chapter 2, Section 2.2.1). Table 2-1 now shows the 22 fish species and two shellfish (i.e., conch and lobster) that the 51 respondents reported to Dr. Caro that they eat. Note that residents reported eating shark, tuna, and marlin species that can have very high mercury levels. In addition, residents reported eating salmon, a low-mercury containing species. That Viequenses eat canned tuna seems a reasonable assumption. Therefore, some portions of the EPA/FDA national advisory apply while other portions clearly do not. During the November 2009 scientific meetings, a scientist also criticized the agency for 1) not E!FD! 2 !D previous, 2003 Fish PHA findings. That Viequenses know which reef fish have higher mercury levels is important, as is knowing which reef fish have lower mercury levels. ATSDR now recommends that the agency develop a health education program specific to Vieques. This health education program should empower Vieques residents to choose to eat fish that are lower in mercury. [Comment] 2. D \u0012 study: Table 2-2 appears to be incomplete (it only shows three fish species). Caro characterizes this ! ! 10 this and many other annexes were not included in the copy of the Caro report that was sent by ATSDR. ATSDR Response : We added the additional information from Annex 10 to Table 2-2 in Chapter 2, Section 2.2.1. [Comment] I agree that not knowing whether the results are dry weight or wet weight prevents comparison with other datasets and estimation of human doses from eating fish, but assuming dry weight would provide Page | C- 32 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 a conservative estimate and allow for qualified comparisons and estimation of doses. If wet weight is used the actual tissue concentrations could be higher. ATSDR Response \u0012 \u0012 2, Section 2.2.1 [Comment] The correct spelling for Parquera is Parguera. The Caro report appears to make the same mistake. ATSDR Response : The spelling of this town is corrected. [Comment] It is said the ATSDR is currently renewing its efforts to determine whether the data was dry weight or wet weight. Please note that Dr. Caro passed away in 2002. ATSDR Response : We tried to contact the laboratory. We revised the sentences in the Chapter 2, Section 2.2.1 to reflect our efforts accurately. [Comment] 3. Fish and Seafood Data from ATSDR It is indicated that ATSDR used standard body weights for adults and children. If this refers to a mainland standard, it should be noted that generally Puertoricans are smaller in size and weight, which could under estimate calculations on tissue concentration. ATSDR Response !D 2003 F ! 70 and 16 kg children. The point that Puerto Ricans typically weigh less also was raised by scientists in our November 2009 discussions. Therefore, in the current Report, we used a range of body weight from 4.5 to 100 kg (9.9 to 220 pounds) to represent the body weight of various age groups (see Chapter 2, Section 2 .6, Table 2A-1 in Appendix 2A-2). We also included a range of daily fish ingestion rates to cover daily intakes up to the 99th percentile. Therefore, the estimated doses of mercury in this report include a much wider range of doses than the 2003 Fish PHA. [Comment] 4. ! ! F \u0012 Waters of Vieque ! fish in Vieques in 2001. Concentrations ranged from 0.3 to 3.53 mg/Kg wet. The study considered different exposure scenarios for inorganic As and found that concentrations excee E! 00003 effects in adults and children. The probability of excess lifetime cancer for exposure to As by adults was estimated to exceed the acceptable cancer risk of 10 -6. I do not believe that this study has been published but the poster may be obtained from Dr. Carlos Rodr\u00edguez Sierra at the School of Public Health of the Medical Sciences Campus of the University of Puerto Rico. ATSDR Response : ATSDR has attempted to locate this information but has not been successful. Average total arsenic in fish samples collected by ATSDR in 2001 ranged from 1.85 ppm (or Page | C- 33 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 mg/kg) to 2.84 ppm (wet weight), with one trunkfish sample showing 8.3 ppm total arsenic. The median total arsenic concentration in fish was 2.8 ppm. Conch and land crabs had similar levels (0.3 ppm and 3.9 ppm, respectively). These levels are typical for total arsenic concentrations in seafood, and in particular for fish (WHO 2001, Rodr\u00edguez Sierra 2002, ATSDR 2007) and are similar to the levels reported by the reviewer in the poster (0.3-3.53 ppm). Numerous studies have shown that the predominant form of arsenic in fish is arsenobetaine, an organic arsenic (ATSDR 2007). Arsenobetaine is not harmful to humans because humans rapidly excrete this chemical unchanged within 24 to 48 hours of ingestion. The remaining small amount of inorganic arsenic in fish is not harmful (WHO 2001). Spiny lobster from Vieques reef were shown to have total arsenic levels ranging from 27 ppm to 48 ppm with an average of 33 ppm. Like fish, most of the arsenic in spiny lobster (genus Panulirus ) about 0.05% is inorganic arsenic (Peshut et al. 2007). No changes were made in the report. Use of biomonitoring tools to assess exposure to metals and other hazardous chemicals in blood, urine, or hair that are related to historical bombing exercises [Comment] 1. The chapter provides a good review of six Vieques human biomonitoring studies. I was surprised !D c health assessments did not review biomonitoring data from Vieques. ATSDR Response : Thank you for your comment. The biomonitoring studies were not readily available when the public health assessments for Vieques were being written or, in the case of the PRDOH study, had not yet been conducted. When ATSDR began its evaluation of Vieques in 2009, we knew that PRDOH had conducted a study, but were not aware that a draft manuscript was available. ATSDR was provided a draft copy of the PRDOH study in late 2009 [Comment] 2. The Puerto Rico Department of Health (PRDOH) appears to have conducted the most comprehensive biomonitoring study, in which it collected hair, urine or blood samples from 500 randomly selected Viequenses. However, no public report was ever released and it was not until August 2009 that ATSDR obtained a draft, unpublished manuscript. Quite frankly, the way this is written makes one wonder why it took three years for ATSDR to obtain a copy, and how it was obtained. ATSDR Response : When ATSDR began its evaluation of Vieques in 2009, we learned that PRDOH had conducted a study, but were not aware that a draft report was available. Shortly before the November 2009 meeting with invited scientists, ATSDR received a draft copy of the PRDOH study. Page | C- 34 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 [Comment] 3. The discussion in Chapter 3.3 of the strengths and limitations of previous human biomonitoring studies for Vieques is comprehensive and balanced. It is recognized that NHANES biomonitoring data applies to the entire U.S. population and that due to regional, cultural, and ethnic differences they can only cautiously apply to Puerto Rico. I completely agree that when looking for a Vieques comparison group, a control population from another town in Puerto Rico should be more appropriate. ATSDR Response : Thank you for your comment. [Comment] 4. The conclusions from Dr. Col\u00f3n exposed to metals in paint as adults might be. As EPA states in http:// www.epa.gov/lead/pubs/leadpdfe.pdf ( accessed 25 February 2013: -based paint may also be a hazard when found on surfaces that children can chew or that get a lot of wear-and-tear. These areas include Windows and window sills. Doors and door frames. Stairs, railings, and banisters. My own experience with lead paint studies indicates that Puerto Ricans tend to paint their houses using layer upon layer of paint, and that the inner layers (which are the older) are the ones that have lead paint. Children will chew all the layers, thus exposing them to the lead paint. ATSDR Response : We agree that children can be exposed to lead from lead-based paint and have added a comment to Chapter 3, Section 3.7.9.1. [Comment] 5. Dr. Col\u00f3n de Jorge pointed out that antimony levels were high because antimony was used in explosive ordnance on Vieques, thus making the case that military exercises was the reason d the review by ATSDR of the report should so state. ATSDR Response : Dr. Col\u00f3n de Jorge states that antimony levels in bombs were high and this is the reason that some children have high antimony levels. We have modified the text in Chapter 3, Sections 3 .2 and 3.7 .9.1 to include Dr. Col\u00f3n de Jorge justification. We also have pointed out that Dr. Col\u00f3n de Jorge did not describe how residents might have been exposed to antimony. Page | C- 35 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 [Comment] 6. The discussion of the investigations by Dr. Carlos Rodr\u00edguez (this is the same person as the one referenced in comment 4 of the section on consumption of seafood from reefs near Vieques above) is based on a presentation made in a webinar. Although it is stated that Dr. Rodr\u00edguez intends at some point to publish his data, he has apparently not done so, which raises an overall concern that I have about the lack of peer review of many of the local studies that are presented in the ATSDR report. ATSDR Response : ATSDR agrees that using peer-reviewed data is preferable. But data collected and analyzed using valid quality assurance/quality control procedures is also acceptable. In an effort to consider all available Vieques data, ATSDR chose to include the non peer-reviewed data in the Report. In the Report appendix, ATSDR summarizes all the available data and designates whether the data are peer-reviewed. In e-mail conversations with Dr. Rodr\u00edguez Sierra, he stated that his biomonitoring data were submitted for publication and are currently in the -review process. Those data will be available to ATSDR after publication Consumption of food (produce, meat, dairy, eggs) grown on the island [Comment] 1. This chapter includes an analysis of several studies dealing with contaminants detected in locally raised garden produce and livestock. All the studies present serious limitations. For example, one included plant stems and leaves but did not include the edible portions of the plants sampled. It appears that the locally grown pigeon peas could have a high cadmium level, but, again, there are insufficient data. ATSDR Response : ATSDR concurs. Thank you for your comment. [Comment] 2. D! when soils are contaminated. It is stated that most home gardeners use many of the suggested practices. However, the referenced website goes to a very general page on plants and crops. A more specific reference should be provided, insuring that the suggested practices are applicable to Vieques. ATSDR Response : No specific reference was available. We defaulted to USDA recommendations, which are generally applicable and relevant to gardening and agriculture. Exposure to air, soil, and water on Vieques [Comment] 1. Air Pathway The chapter makes no mention of the possibility of Saharan dust contributing contaminants to the air or soil in Vieques. For example, see Garrison et al. (Rev. Biol. Trop. 54 (Suppl. 3): 9-21. Epub 2007 Jan. 15.) who sampled in the Virgin Islands where trace metal concentrations in the Saharan dust were found to be similar to crustal composition. Although I Page | C- 36 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 think that metals concentrations in Saharan dust are not going to be high enough to make a significant contribution to metals found in Vieques, the issue should be addressed. ATSDR Response : African Dust Storms: The 2003 Air PHA evaluated the public health implications of exposure to airborne particulates from African Dust Storms (pages 59 61) and found that PM10 (and PM2.5) from such storms on Vieques were not at levels of health concern. However, no contaminant specific data on dust from African Dust Storms were available at the time of the Air PHA (which recommended further evaluation if such contaminant specific data became available). Contaminant specific dust data are presented in a recent study by Gioda et.al. (2007) and a discussion of this information has been added to Chapter 6, Section 6.2.3. [Comment] 2. The discussion of post-Air PHA sampling results and modeling studies as well as recent BIP detonations is comprehensive and leads to the stated conclusion that in the residential areas of Vieques, airborne contaminants from past military operations at the Vieques Naval Training Range would have been essentially nondetectable and unlikely to have resulted in harmful effects. ATSDR Response : Thank you for your comment. [Comment] 1. Soil Pathway This chapter evaluated potential direct soil exposures in two situations: people who stayed on the LIA property during 1999- 2000 residential areas. It concluded that people who lived on the LIA during protests were not exposed to soil contaminants at levels high enough to cause adverse health effects. This conclusion is well supported by the available data as discussed in the report. Concerning the no soil data are deemed adequate to characterize potential exposures fully. Although current or reasonable recent data supports the conclusion that the existing contaminant levels at residential areas are not likely to cause adverse effects, there is a lac k of historical data that would support a wider conclusion to the effect that it never has. The report calls for additional sampling to resolve existing uncertainties, which would be appropriate, but the wider question is now impossible to resolve . ATSDR Response : Thank you for your comment. [Comment] Drinking Water Pathway 1. The Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewers Authority (PRASA), a public corporation in existence since 1945, is charged with providing drinking water and wastewater treatment for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. It is the only entity in the United States with a statewide mandate, and as such is one of the largest water and wastewater utilities in the United States. In 2005 PRASA ran 130 different water systems throughout Puerto Rico, which processed 500 million gallons of water a day. It also operated 29 sewage disposal plants and 1,600 pump Page | C- 37 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 stations. Vieques is part of its service area. While it is correct that in recent years (for about eight years until 2004) PRASA had part of its operations partially conducted by private corporations such as the mentioned Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas or at another time by ONDEO de PR, it has always been regulated by the Safe Drinking Water Act as a public water system. This regulatory function has been delegated by EPA to the Puerto Rico Department of Health (DOH). PRASA is required to annually produce and distribute to its users Consumer Confidence Reports where the quality of its water is reported and explained in non-technical language. Such reports for the years 2004-2009 can be obtained at http:// www.acueductospr.com/AMBIENTE/ccr_reports.htm ( the system that feeds the Vieques pipeline appears under 5386-Humacao Urbano and then as R\u00edo Blanco in the pdf file) and reports for earlier years should easily be available at PRASA or the DOH. This data should be enough to settle the question concerning the quality of the pipeline water. For example, the data for 2009 shows that the lead action level of 15 ppb was exceeded four times. ATSDR Response : We have modified text in Chapter 8, Section 8.1 to correct any inaccuracy regarding the current operators of the public water supply. We did not include detailed descriptions of the water supply system; it could detract from our evaluation of possible exposures from all water supplies, past and present. The water quality reports from 2004 2009 referenced in the comment indicate that the pipeline supply has occasionally exceeded drinking water standards for microbial contaminants, turbidity, and lead. Elevated lead levels, detected particularly in 2006 and 2007, were not related to military exercises on Vieques. But regardless of source, lead in drinking water is an important public health issue. ATSDR has reworded text and added discussion to address these points in Chapter 8 and Chapter 9, Sections 9.8.1, and 9.8.2 of the Report. [Comment] 2. The ATSDR report also addresses wells that had been and are now occasionally used for drinking water. These wells are very likely to belong to PRASA, who should have historical data on the quality of their water. Also concerning the wells, the presence or absence of a sanitary landfill in Vieques that might be impacting groundwater and the use of septic tanks for sewage disposal should be discussed. ATSDR Response : We added discussion about historical data to the Report in Chapter 8, Sections 8.2.2, 8.2.4.2, and 8.3.1.2. We did not attempt to gather additional historical information on the water quality of these wells. Even if available, questions about sampling, analytical, and quality control procedures from the 1970s and 1980s render unlikel y the possibility that such reports would give us sufficient information to alter our current conclusions. Similarly, a lack of adequate historical data precludes any conclusion about more remote (1970s and 1980s) public supply well exposures. Thus, in Chapter 8, Section 8.3.1.2 we reworded text and added a statement about possible nonmilitary sources of contaminants, including sanitary landfills and septic systems. While sanitary landfills and septic systems could affect groundwater resources, whether they have was Page | C- 38 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 not a focus of our evaluation. Instead, ATSDR based its conclusions on actual sampling of supply wells, private wells, and taps. [Comment] Although it would be good to have data on the rainwater systems, their overall use and effect is likely to be very small. ATSDR Response : Thank you for the comment. [Comment] ATSDR should consider rewriting this whole chapter to better reflect the role of PRASA in supplying the drinking water at Vieques. ATSDR Response : We have modified text in Chapter 8, Section 8.1 to correct any inaccuracy regarding the current operators of the public water supply. We did not include detailed descriptions of the water supply system. We were concerned that it might detract from our evaluation of possible exposures from all water supplies, past and present. Does the Vieques summary report adequately present and describe the limitations and uncertainty of assessing human exposure to bombing range-specific contaminants? [Comment] I believe that the report is not as clear as it should be, particularly from the point of view of a lay person. The limitations and uncertainty are adequately presented, for a person that carefully reads the report in its entirety. Just reading the summary report does not present the same picture. ATSDR Response : In the Report, we provided additional information regarding environmental data available for assessing any exposures associated with the military exercises on Vieques. We identified that those chemicals found in environmental samples were also found in explosive \u0012 E \u0012 1 , 2, 3, 6, and 9. Are independent studies utilized appropriately in the determination of potential health hazards? [Comment] Yes, but they are being given the same weight as other peer-reviewed studies. ATSDR Response : The principal consideration for independent studies is the importance of describing all the environmental and health data available for Vieques even when some of the data were not peer reviewed. We considered hair data results for numerous metals. Some scientists believed these data were valid and drew conclusions from them. ATSDR described the Page | C- 39 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 limitations of these data in detail, pointing out the inability to distinguish between external contact and internal ingestion for most metals, except mercury. To this extent, ATSDR attempted to report fairly the available data and to provide insight into their value for health decisions. In our conclusions and recommendations, these data of questionable quality either were not used (e.g., metals in hair, except mercury) or were used qualitatively (e.g., arsenic in urine reported in a Webinar). On the basis of ATSDR's re-evaluation of historical bombing activities in the Vieques summary report, has ATSDR reached the appropriate conclusions and recommendations? [Comments] Yes as to their quality, but I have the following comments regarding the presentation: 1. It is confusing that there are conclusions and recommendations at the end of each chapter and in Chapter 9, and they are different. For example, at the end of Chapter 5 there is a nine-row paragraph with recommendations, while in Chapter 9 these recommendations are expanded to ten items over one full page. Also, as another example of confusion, Chapter 5 is called Terrestrial Food-Chain Pathway in the text of the report while in Chapter 9 it is referred to as Local Produce and Livestock Pathway. A similar thing happens with Chapter 2. ATSDR Response F -Chain E \u0012 5 conclusions and recommendations in Chapter 2 are now consistent with Chapter 9. [Comment] 2. Consider the first recommendation in Chapter 9 about Chapter 4 Health Outcome Data: Assess the feasibility of applying the SMART BRFSS methods for generating stable Vieques specific prevalence estimates on asthma, diabetes, hypertension, and other chronic diseases. In Chapter 4 the complete Recommendations paragraph reads: At this time, ATSDR recommends performing additional analyses to quantify cancer and noncancer morbidity and mortality, assessment of primary and specialty health care needs, and alternative approaches for delivery of health services. So, in Chapter 9 specific methods come up without any explanation as to what they are, why they are better or even needed at all. ATSDR Response : Assessing the feasibility of SMART to overcome the limitations of developing prevalence estimates in a small population should be included as a recommendation or next steps in chapter 9. We have made the recommendations in Chapter 4 consistent with the Page | C- 40 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 recommendations listed in Chapter 9. The language local level versus small population is interchangeable. Comment] In Chapter 9 some of the previous chapters have Summary and Conclusions while others only have Conclusions. There should be consistency on this to avoid further confusion. ATSDR Response : Revisions have been made so that the heading reads conclusions. Select the appropriate category below: List recommended changes or reasons for not recommending) o Recommend ( ) o Recommend with Required Changes (X) o Not Recommended ( ) [Comment] Rewrite the Drinking Water Pathway chapter to better reflect the role of PRASA in supplying the drin king water at Vieques. ATSDR Response : We have modified text in Chapter 8, Section 8.1 to correct any inaccuracy regarding the current operators of the public water supply. We did not include detailed descriptions of the water supply system. We were concerned it would detract from our evaluation of possible exposures from all water supplies, past and present. Additional Questions: Are there any comments on ATSDR's peer review process? [Comment] None, except for Question 6 above. Are there any other comment s? [Comment] None. Page | C- 41 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 Reviewer 4 Overall, has ATSDR's re-evaluation of public health issues associated with historical bombing exercises at Vieques been appropriate? [Comment] This reviewer recognizes and applauds the strong efforts done by the people and community leaders of Vieques and of PR to access the health status of its community. In addition, congratulates all the researchers that have contributed to the generation of scientific knowledge in this area. Overall, the re-evaluation done by ATSDR seems appropriate. This report supports the need for additional studies and public health interventions in Vieques, PR, as although some results are still not conclusive, evidence supports potential environmental exposures in this population, as well as health disparities as compared to the mainland of PR and the United States. Most studies have been included in the discussion, although additional efforts should be made to contact researchers whose results have not been published. This reviewer has highlighted several issues that merit consideration before this manuscript is published (see below). ATSDR Response : We appreciate all the comments. Has ATSDR adequately addressed the pathways of human exposure to bombing range-specific contaminants? Please include specific comments on Consumption of seafood from reefs near Vieques [Comment] Chapter 2. The ATSDR concludes that children who consumed fish from the reefs near Vieques and those born to mothers who also had this consumption were at increased risk for several health conditions. Nonetheless, the report highlights that this conclusion about the risk of harmful effects to the fetus and to children vary by sex, genetics, health and nutritional status. It is the belief of this reviewer that, despite some limitations, the observed association between fish consumption in Vieques and health hazards in these population sub-groups is very relevant and should not be minimized. ATSDR should add to its recommendations in this area the need for an assessment of the health and nutritional status of children in Vieques and how these factors can influence the impact that fish consumption could have on the health of children in Vieques. Some information regarding nutritional status of adults and children in Vieques could be collected from the BRFSS and the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) of PR. ATSDR Response: Thank you for your comments. Children and pregnant women are advised by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to avoid eating those fish with the potential for the highest level of mercury contamination (e.g., shark, swordfish, king mackerel or tilefish); to eat up to 12 ounces (two average meals) per week of a variety of fish and shellfish that are lower in mercury (e.g., canned light tuna, salmon, pollock, catfish); and check Page | C- 43 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 local advisories about the safety of fish caught in local lakes, rivers and coastal areas. Since fish are highly consumed in Vieques, we believe that fish consumption among this population should be addressed. [Comment] Table 2-2 (page 17): Efforts should be made to contact Dr. Caro and determine if the data came from dry or wet weight fish. ATSDR Response: Dr. Caro is deceased. The laboratory that conducted the fish analysis for her report has not responded to phone calls or e-mails. We have provided additional analysis to Dr. \u0012 \u0012 2, Section 2.2.1. [Comment] Chapter 2. Given that the authors highlight lack of knowledge regarding the estimation of combined doses of exposure (from single and multiple pathways) regarding possible mixture effects for residents eating seafood, ATSDR should add to the recommendations of this chapter (and of the overall report) that risk from possible mixtures effects for residents eating seafood should be further studied. ATSDR Response: At this time, evaluation of possible mixtures effects from chemicals in fish is not possible because of limitations in the science. This topic is discussed in Chapter 2, Section 2.2.6. [Comment] Chapter 2.3.2. The list of recommendations on Chapter 2.3.2 could be more specific and describe in more detail some of the recommendations previously mentioned in chapter 2. In addition, the authors should add to the recommendations of this chapt \u0012 ATSDR Response: We provided additional information in Chapter 2 specifying the need to collect additional fish samples to allow analysis by species and location. Use of biomonitoring tools to assess exposure to metals and other hazardous chemicals in blood, urine, or hair that are related to historical bombing exercises [Comment] Chapter 3 (page 50). The authors highlight that the levels of inorganic arsenic in Viequenses urine were higher than those reported in the U.S. general population according to the NHANES survey. To facilitate the discussion in this section, I suggest adding a table with the values of metals observed in the general population of the US according to NHANES. ATSDR Response: In Tables 3A-3 and Table 3B-1, ATSDR has included data from NHANES showing the average concentration of metals in urine and blood. [Comment] Chapter 3.2 (page 50, fourth paragraph). To complement this first sentence, the authors should include a brief summary of the conclusions of the studies by Dr. Col\u00f3n de Jorge and Dr. Ortiz-Roque. Page | C- 44 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 ATSDR Response: The conclusions from Dr. Col\u00f3n D presented in the second, third, fifth, and sixth paragraphs in Chapter 3, Section. 3.2. No changes were made in the Report. [Comment] Chapter 3. Section 3.5.1 Conclusions: Section does not acknowledge that metals were also detected in feces. In addition, sentence 6 of this paragraph starts by saying \"!nother study weakness/\" G ! ATSDR Response: ATSDR has included feces in the list of biological matrices where metals were detected and rephrased the discussion about study weakness. [Comment] Section 3.5.2 (page 56). In the conclusions of this chapter, the authors recommend that additional biomonitoring studies should measure mercury levels in blood and hair of Viequenses; these studies should also consider other metals and substances in the assessment. The authors should stress in this paragraph why additional studies are needed, as presented evidence already suggests high mercury levels (and other metals) in hair and blood of Viequenses-suggesting a health hazard in this population. ATSDR Response: ATSDR has added additional information to the Report conclusions in Chapter 3. While Dr. Ortiz Roque found several women with elevated levels of mercury in hair, the PRDOH study did not show high mercury levels in the blood of 500 Viequenses. Some uncertainty therefore remains regarding whether high mercury exposure is prevalent on the island. \u0012 371 \u0011 61 are briefly mentioned in the main text (not only in this appendix) for Chapter 3 and are described in ATSDR Response: ATSDR has reworded this sentence. [Comment] Section 3.7.2.2. PRDOH Discussion Phase 1 (bottom of page 65-top of page 66)- Given that ! above expected norms as established by Quest Laboratories but not above toxic levels as also established by Quest Laboratories. The PRDOH manuscript stated that this suggests the need for further investigation concerning the various risk factors, with particular emphasis on how smoking contributes to metal bod complete assessment of tobacco consumption of persons in Vieques. Although data presented in some of the analyzed reports does not suggest a higher prevalence of smoking in Vieques than in the rest of PR, this data should be analyzed in depth and included in this report. Given that it is of great relevance for various topics within this assessment, it should be included or recommended for inclusion in future studies in this population? ATSDR Response: ATSDR agrees that future studies should include detailed information about D 2006 study is confidential, ATSDR is unable to Page | C- 45 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 obtain the raw data. We are consequently unable to provide more detailed information about tobacco use in Vieques. [Comment] Section 3.7.2.2 (page 66, line 5)- D eating fish within 3 days of a test or smoking could partly explain some but not all of the elevated metal explanations does the PRDOH provide for this result. ATSDR Response: ATSDR agrees and has added text to Chapter 3, Sections 3.7.2.2 and 3.7.4. \u0012 D 90% the population, detectable levels were found of at least one heavy metal. In more than 20% of the study participants, the levels of aluminum in blood, arsenic in urine, and nickel in hair were over the laboratory reference threshold. Geometric means for uranium in urine, mercury in blood, lead in blood, aluminum in blood, nickel in hair, and cadmium in urine were significantly higher than the geometric 1999 !E 3 additional research in this area. A statement highlighting the reasons for these additional studies is warranted in the main conclusions/recommendations of this chapter. ATSDR Response: ATSDR has added clarifying text in the Executive Summary for its recommendations about future biological sampling and in particular the need for an appropriate comparison group . [Comment] Section 3.7.5 (page 70). According to the referenced manuscript, the correct sample size of the study was 500 participants (not n=499). ATSDR Response: The draft PRDOH report uses both numbers as the sample size: 499 and 500. Which is the correct sample size is unclear. We will use 500. [Comment] Section 3.7.7.1 (page 76). Results of Dr. Roque regarding the high levels of mercury in the hair of Viequense women as compared to those of women in the mainland of PR and the US should be highlighted as evidence in the main text. Particularly, given that evidence exists that mercury in hair of pregnant mothers is an indicator of disease risk in the fetus. ATSDR Response: D \u0012 3 statements such as these: Chapter 3, Section 3.2. Dr. Ortiz Roque identified several residents with hair-mercury levels above 12 ppm the level the National Research Council identified as causing a 5% increase in neurological effects in children who were exposed in utero (NRC 2000). Chapter 3, Section 3.7.8.3. Dr. mercury levels above 12 ppm is an important finding. \u0012 3783 D above 12 ppm is an important finding. ATSDR Response: !D D made this point several times in Chapter 3. In particular, biomonitoring results from Dr. Ortiz Roque Page | C- 46 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 showed that some Viequenses had elevated mercury in hair above the level identified by the National Academy of Sciences to cause harm in 5% of fetuses exposed in utero . [Comment] Section 3.7.6.2. The manuscript mentions that the PRDOH will develop a protocol for the management of persons with suspected acute poisoning of heavy metals using CDC guidelines. What is the status of this protocol? Has it been already developed and implemented? The authors could contact the PRDOH and include this information as part of the manuscript. ATSDR Response: ATSDR has been unable to determine whether PRDOH has developed and implemented a blood lead survey of Viequense children. [Comment] Section 3.7.6.3 (page 73). Table 3A-3 would be enriched by the inclusion of levels of heavy metals found in the U.S. population according to NHANES. ATSDR Response: As suggested, ATSDR has included data in Tables 3A-3 and 3B-1. [Comment] Section 3.7.8.2 (page 78, line 8). When discussing Dr. Ortiz- that the non-random participant selection might account for some confounding factor elevating the rates. Nonetheless, it should be highlighted that this procedure could also have reduced them. ATSDR Response: ATSDR agrees that a nonrandom survey could be a confounding factor that increases or decrease rates. We have made the suggested change in the text. \u0012 383 94 ! studies of persons residing in areas with higher cadmium soil concentrations or with cadmium pollution have reported mean blood and urine cadmium levels as much as 10 times higher than control groups or ATSDR Response: The paragraph with this statement has been deleted from the report; and, the reader is referred to the 4 th Report, which contains toxicological information about metals. [Comment] Section 3.8.3 (page 95, first line)- Please include references regarding the impact that cadmium levels in blood or urine could have on human health. ATSDR Response: The paragraph with this statement has been deleted from the report; and, the reader is referred to the 4 th Report, which contains toxicological information about metals. \u0012 \u0012 4 101 ! population, all studies suffer to some degree from a lack of statistical power and methodological limitations that make interpretation difficult. Despite these limitations, the studies are valuable for describing the health status of Viequenses. And in Vieques relative to the rest of Puerto Rico, the studies indicate elevations in the prevalence of chronic disease, cancer incidence and mortality, and infant suggest rephrasing this statement. ATSDR Response: Quantifying differences in rates of morbidity and mortality is statistically challenging in small populations. The limitations previously described also introduce additional uncertainty. Despite these limitations, the studies are valuable for describing the health status of Viequenses. Relative to the rest of the population in Puerto Rico, these studies indicate Page | C- 47 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 elevations in the prevalence of chronic disease, cancer incidence and mortality, and infant mortality in Vieques. Consumption of food (produce, meat, dairy, eggs) grown on the island \u0012 \u0012 5 pigeon peas could be potentially harmful for preschool children who eat more than four 6-ounce portions ATSDR Response: Thank you for your comment. Relevant text in Section 5.2.2 has been revised based on comments received. Exposure to air, soil, and water on Vieques [Comment] Section 6.2.1 (page 133, third paragraph). Regarding the Air PHA conclusions, the authors mention that the \"The Navy's ordnance exercises at the LI! did not pose a health hazard in the residential areas of Vieques.\" This statement should be clarified and highlight that it is referring specifically to the hazard of residential areas specifically by air pollution (other hazards may still be possible through other pathways). ATSDR Response: The statement referenced summarizes the conclusions of our previous Air Public Health Assessment. The current report clarifies this issue (see Chapter 6) . [Comment] Section 6.2.1 (page 134, first bullet). The authors highlight that levels of contaminants in air were low, and not at levels that would be associated to disease risk. Regarding the Air PHA conclusions, the authors mention that the \"Wind-blown dust from the explosive-ordnance range did not and does not pose a health hazard to residents.\" Comment should be more specific, as contaminants were measured in the air, and air quality was not associated to disease risk. This is of particular relevance given that cumulative exposure has not been evaluated. ATSDR Response: As there was no significant transport of airborne contaminants from the LIA to the residential areas of Vieques, there was no significant deposition to soils or subsequent leaching of contaminants from soil to groundwater. Consequently, the exposure pathways for soil and groundwater contaminants (from military operations) are incomplete and there is no basis for assessing cumulative exposures for these pathways. The Report does discuss the issue of cumulative exposures (as chemical mixtures in fish consumption) in Chapter 2, Section 2.2.6 and in Chapter 9, Section 9.9. \u0012 623 140 recent evaluation of BIP detonations, the Navy has proposed prescribed burning of LIA vegetation to access safely and remove remaining unexploded ordnance. In support of this proposal, the Navy has conducted additional air modeling to assess the potential effects of such prescribed burning (CH2MHill 2008a). Although the Air PHA did not address vegetation burning, it did address past operations of open burning/open detonation (OBOD) of excess or recovered ordnance. As the mass of ordnance involved in past OBOD events was small relative to the mass involved in then-ongoing Naval operations, the 2003 Air PHA found that air emissions from past OBOD events did not present a public health hazard to the residents of Vieques. A permit to allow LIA vegetation burning is pending before the U.S.EPA and the Page | C- 48 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 Puerto Rico Environmental Quality Board. If so requested by these agencies or by any concerned citizen, !D D to do this or is ATSDR recommending that it should be done anyway? Besides the data presented on Chapter 8 (Drinking Water Pathway), have any effort be made to determine the effect of airborne contaminants to water sources? ATSDR Response: Although ATSDR has not received a specific request to evaluate the pending air quality permit, Chapter 6 does include a summary of the air modeling and monitoring studies that support the permit application. Those studies indicate that vegetation burning in the LIA will not result in harmful inhalation exposures in the residential areas of Vieques and are in agreement with the results of the Air PHA. There is no public health basis for further evaluation of this issue . We have revised the Report by deleting the sentence indicating that ATSDR will further review this issue if so requested. [Comment] Chapter 7 Summary (page 150). We agree with th restrict access to the LIA and to other potentially contaminated military areas until environmental assessment and remediation clear the way for unrestricted public access. To address remaining uncertainties about residential soil contamination issues, ATSDR recommends surface soil sampling in 1970 may not represent the reality of the soil today. Nonetheless, this summary paragraph of chapter 7 should include the recommendation of soil cleanup (as it does in the chapter-section 7.2.1). ATSDR Response: Thank you for this comment. We reworded the relevant section of the Report, Chapter 7 Summary and in Chapter 9, Section 9.7.2, to clarify that we do recommend continuation of environmental assessment and remediation activities. [Comment] Chapter 7 Section 7.2.1 (page 158). The authors mention that a limitation of the study by Garc\u00eda (2000) (study that collected soil samples at the LIA and in areas where people lived during 1999\u00ad 2000) was that it was missing information on 1) the exact location, depth of sampling, and a 2) complete presentation of study results. Did the authors do an effort to contact Garc\u00eda and colleagues to clarify this missing information? This information is important in this assessment, as the authors are suggesting that Garc\u00eda correct). ATSDR Response: ATSDR has attempted to contact Dr. Garc\u00eda on two different occasions by e- mail but has not yet received a response. The authors reported only the highest and next- to\u00ad highest detections, so that would by definition high-bias the concentrations. [Comment] Section 7.2.1 (page 159). Even though the authors conclude that there is no indication that protesters living in the LIA in 1999-2000 were exposed to harmful levels of surface soil contaminants, they mention that a limitation is that conclusions were based on a small number of samples (making the conclusion not valid if future/representative analyses showed something different). This is not consistent with their sentence in the Summary section of this chapter (page 149) that says that \"Sufficient data are available to conclude that people who lived on the LIA during the protests were not exposed to soil contaminants at levels high enough to cause adverse health effects.\" Although at this Page | C- 49 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 point evidence does not support risk for this group, the limitation of small sample size should be included in the summary statement. ATSDR Response : The limitation mentioned in Chapter 7, Section 7.2.1 is a common limitation for any environmental characterization. Despite this limitation, the soil data collected f or protesters living in the LIA were sufficient to characterize potential exposures during that time. Samples collected from the protester camp were designed to represent actual exposures to those living there. Samples collected from the LIA were collected from areas likely to have higher concentrations of contaminants. These samples, although limited in number, are reasonable to use as protective descriptors of exposures that might have occurred to protesters. [Comment] Section 7.2.4 (page 164, last 2 sentences). The authors mention that explosive residues in the background samples also suggested that all areas of the island, including the residential area, might have been affected by explosive compounds from past bombing activities. Altho highlight that although this cannot be corroborated at this point, these exposures may have had an impact in the past, this should be highlighted in the conclusions, as right now they are suggesting that residential exposure was likely minimal. ATSDR Response: No changes were made in the report. Although verification is impossible regarding past levels of explosives in residential areas, the modeling work described in Chapter 6 and the levels of residues in background areas on the land adjacent to the LIA do suggest that any past residential exposures were small. [Comment] Chapter 8. As recommended by ATSDR, it is the opinion of this reviewer that additiona l studies of the pipelines, wells and rainwater collection systems are needed to confirm the safety of the drinking water consumption of Vieques. For groundwater, we agree with the authors in that current results do not exclude the possibility for other groundwater contamination caused by military and nonmilitary activities hydrogeologically connected to the groundwater that supplies water wells. Thus, supporting the need for additional research in this area. ATSDR Response: Thank you for the comment. [Com 822 172 4 E were present at the level in drinking water, the levels of explosives were too low to result in adverse !D 2001 What about cumulative exposure? Its possibility and potential harm should be acknowledged in the text. ATSDR Response: No significant transport of airborne contaminants occurred from the LIA to the residential areas of Vieques. No significant deposition occurred in soils. Consequently, th e exposure pathways for air and soil were incomplete; thus assessment of cumulative exposures for these pathways was without basis. For drinking water, the health guideline values used to compare with the possibly detected levels of explosives in this section were chronic guidelines. They would have assumed regular exposure of more than 1 year. But the historical data were extremely limited. Using such data to draw definitive public health conclusions about past exposures, or about past cumulative exposures, is impossible. The Report does discuss the issue Page | C- 50 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 of cumulative exposures (as chemical mixtures in fish consumption) in Chapter 2, Section 2.2.6 and in Chapter 9, Section 9.9. [Comment] Section 8.4. Given that several contaminants were found at levels that would make groundwater unsuitable for consumption, the need for further studies and cleanup of this sources should be highlighted in the summary and recommendations sections of this chapter, as it has been done within the chapter. ATSDR Response: We added recommendations that environmental assessment and cleanup of groundwater affected by military operations continue to Chapter 8, Section 8.4.2 and Chapter 9, Section 9.8.2 of the Report. Does the Vieques summary report adequately present and describe the limitations and uncertainty of assessing human exposure to bombing range-specific contaminants? [Comment] Overall, strengths and limitations of studies seem appropriately discussed in the report. Besides the recommendations already provided in this regard, additional specific recommendations are provided below. Chapter 3 (page 81). Given the relationship between metal toxicities and various diseases and health conditions, the report should also include recommendations for additional studies of the effect of metal toxicities to: cardiac conditions, cardiovascular, emotional disturbances, violence, poor absorption and cancer. ATSDR Response: Until more information is available that shows contamination of the environment with specific metals or explosive compounds and exposure of Viequenses, additional recommendations are not warranted to study the effects of metals on various health conditions. \u0012 \u0012 4 ATSDR Response: We have corrected Chapter 4, Section 4.1 to reflect the Puerto Rico Central Cancer Registry. [Comment] Chapter 4. When describing the PR Cancer Registry, the following statement/reference should be added to the text: 2003 \u0012D\u0012 953% diagnosed or treated in hospital facilities in PR were appropriately reported to \u0012\u0012 95% REFERENCE: ORC MacroSM. National Program of Cancer Registries, Technical Assistance and Audit Puerto Rico Central Cancer Registry 2000, Case Completeness and Data Quality Audit. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Department of Health and Human Services; 2003. pp. 1 32. Page | C- 51 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 ATSDR Response : The statement was added to the Report text as the closing statement in the paragraph below: The data reported by the RCCPR have several strengths. Cancer registries typically represent the best population-based dataset for any chronic health condition. Most cancer cases are captured by registries due to legal reporting requirements, redundancies in the reporting system (i.e. reporting by labs, clinics, hospitals, and specific oncologists), and the clinical course of most cancers that requires substantial follow up and repeated visits. The analysis of cancer registry data should then represent the most accurate assessment of cancer incidence in Vieques. CDC has continuously funded the cancer registry through a cooperative agreement since 1998 and the cancer registry has steadily improved its data accuracy. Finally, 2003 \u0012D\u0012 review concluded that 95.3% of all cancer cases diagnosed or treated in hospital facilities in PR were appropriately reported to the PRCCR; a result comparable to 95% [Comment] Section 4.1 (page 103). Although not mentioned, another limitation of the BRFSS is that it is based on self-reported information. Nonetheless, given that the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) of the US does not collect data for PR, the BRFSS is the best available data of population-based morbidity and health behaviors in PR. In order to generate consistent population- based data of the health status of people living in PR, efforts should be made to include PR (and Vieques) in the US NHANES survey. ATSDR could help in these efforts. ATSDR Response: NHANES is not intended to provide national prevalence estimates. BRFSS would thus continue as a better population-based data option for the health status of P R residents. [Comment] Section 4.2.1 (page 105). The report highlights that all cancer cases in Vieques were age-confirmed, an activity that could not be done with all cancer cases in PR, where if a case did not have a known age, it was not included in any rate calculation. The authors suggest that this could have inflated standardized incidence ratios. Is there indication on the PRCCR reports of the percent of cases excluded from analyses from the PR mainland due to this reasons? This could give an idea if the potential for bias is small or high. If the reports do not specify, this information can be obtained by contacting the PRCCR and Dr. Nayda Figueroa. Despite this limitation, mortality rates would not be affected by this, and in fact they show higher mortality from certain cancer types in Vieques as compared to PR. This should be given higher relevance in the report. In addition, results from this analysis could be better described in tables/graphs in order to give the reader a sense of the excess risk observed in Vieques as compared to PR. ATSDR Response: We contacted Dr. Figueroa to obtain information on the percentage of cases in PR that were excluded from analyses because of the lack of age confirmatory data. We have not heard back from Dr. Figueroa, and therefore have nothing to add to this response at this time. We are continuing to follow up. Page | C- 52 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 The magnitude of the combined effect of excluding cases from Puerto Rico and actively seeking out cases in Vieques and not in Puerto Rico would make the SIR higher than if the limitations mentioned were not present. The magnitude of this bias is unclear it may or may not change the overall conclusions. We agree that mortality for certain cancer types is higher in Vieques than in Puerto Rico. Although mortality is an important measure of health status, we believe that disease incidence is a better measure than is mortality for assessing whether military [Comment] Section 4.2.2 (Page 105). The authors say that the demographics in 2 of the 4 communities studied by Lopez and Carrosquillo (2002) in the study appear unusual. On what basis the authors conclude this and why is this a limitation of the study? The demographics of Vieques are in fact different from those of PR, a reference from the Census that supports this statement should be included. ATSDR Response: A review of the 1990 and 2000 census data showed that the selected sample population was older than the population in Vieques. Also, only persons ages 5 25 were selected from Lujan, and only older persons ages 59 70 were selected from Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration PRRA. The percentage of people in the sample population who were 60 years of age or older appears to be higher than the percentage of people in that same age category based on data from the 1990 2000 census report. This is not a limitation, but an inconsistency that we observed. [Comment] Table 4.1 could be strengthened by including in the table the percent of persons that were affected with each of the health conditions (Lopez and Carrosquillo 2002). ATSDR Response: The percent of persons affected was added to Table 4.1 as suggested. [Comment] Section 4.2.4 (page 107). A better description of the results obtained in the study by Roque (2002) could be included in this section. On this page, the following statement should be highlighted as a strength: \"Typically, mortality data are population -based, with near universal coverage, and are less prone to bias.\" ATSDR Response: Our statements about the strengths of mortality data were intended to apply for both the cancer registry and for Dr. Ortiz Roque. We modified the paragraph to make this point clearer. Mortality data reported by RCCPR and Ortiz Roque may also provide meaningful insight into the health status of Viequenses and have several strengths. Typically, mortality data are population-based, with near universal coverage, and are less prone to bias. Analyses of mortality patterns in a population can be useful for hypothesis generation. But using these data to quantify potential relationships in exposure-disease relationships has limitations. Many potential confounding variables are not susceptible to assessment (e.g., access to care, lifestyle factors, and dietary habits). [Comment] Section 4.2.2 (page 108). Was an effort made to contact the study researchers of the Lopez Carosquillo study and get information of the confidence intervals for the risk ratio estimates to identify differences? Despite the lack of confidence intervals, the magnitude of the excess risk observed in this study should be considered a strength that supports the greater disease burden in Vieques as compared to PR. Page | C- 53 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 ATSDR Response: We did not attempt to contact researchers to obtain confidence intervals for this review. We relied on the reports as written and commented on strengths and weaknesses of the methods used to produce results. [Comment] Section 4.2.4 (page 108, line 15)- F disease prevalence data was used as a reference from the PRCMS or some other source is unclear the PRCMS was based on systematic self-reporting mechanisms (e.g. , the Behavioral Risk Factor This statement is not clear to this reviewer. The PRCMS data is based on the Continuous survey of PR (See page 15 of the Lopez and Carosqullo study, 2002). ATSDR Response: This statement was deleted. At the time of our initial draft of this report, we did not have a copy of the 1994 Annual Survey. [Comment] Section 4.3 Findings (page 108). Please add to this section information on the PRCCR report of 2009, as it does not seem to have been addressed. ATSDR Response: The findings reported in 5-year intervals (1990 -1994, 1995 1999, 2000 2004) are from the 2009 report. We added tables to make this more apparent. [Comment] Section 4.3 (page 109). Authors suggest that the fact that 36% of participants from the Lopez and Carrosquillo (2002) study were unemployed may have implications for lack of insurance coverage and access to appropriate medical care, thus affecting morbidity and mortality data. Even though this may be in part true, the authors should acknowledge that approximately 90% of the population of PR are insured, and close to 40% of the population of PR are covered by Reforma (the public, government funded health insurance program). Thus, most unemployed people will in fact have access to health care through Reforma . Nonetheless, physical barriers (such as lack of proximity to health care providers) does exist for residents of Vieques. ATSDR Response: Of the participants in the Lopez and Carrosquillo (2002) study, 36% were unemployed. Although these participants may have access to health care through the government funded health program, their implications may be due to the lack of access to specialty care, thus affecting morbidity and mortality data. \u0012 442 110 \u0012 associated with these analyses, particularly the methodological concerns discussed in this report, introduce considerable uncertainty and make interpretation difficult. These findings can nonetheless data provided suggests evidence of a higher burden of chronic disease in the population of Vieques as specific recommendations in this area? There is enough evidence to support higher cancer incidence and particularly mortality among people residing in Vieques as compared to PR. What are the specific recommendations regarding future studies in this area? Also, additional future studies of chronic disease prevalence in Vieques as compared to PR should be added to the list of recommendations in this section. Page | C- 54 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 ATSDR Response: We agree that the health outcome data suggest a higher burden of disease in the population of Vieques as compared with Puerto Rico. But we also believe that the limitations in the available data reduce the strength of these conclusions. The limitations include the completeness of the Registry for much of the period of analysis and the self-reported data from the symptom prevalence survey. We believe that the next steps should focus on studies that better define exposure and that better characterize the occurrence of cancer and noncancer morbidity and mortality. ATSDR plans to consult with the community in Vieques, scientists in Puerto Rico, public health officials, and other external stak eholders to determine recommended, specific studies. [Comment] Chapter 6. Page 131 (second paragraph). Could the air-sampling studies performed in the 1970 group? Is there any way to validate this data? ATSDR Response: The 2003 Air PHA included a comprehensive review of historic data, including a determination of their utility as a basis for public health determinations. The Air PHA determined an adequately post facto data quality assessment was impossible. We consequently developed an air modeling study to assess historic exposures. The results of the air modeling study are consistent with all of the air monitoring studies and collectively provide an adequate basis for the public health conclusions. Are independent studies utilized appropriately in the determination of potential health hazards? [Comment] Overall, independent studies have been used appropriately in the determination of health hazards. Most studies have been included in the discussion, although additional efforts should be made to contact researchers whose results have not been published. In addition, as it has been already mentioned in this evaluation, additional efforts should be made to get specific unavailable information from some of these studies, as it is very relevant for a complete assessment. Also, as previously stated, results from the section of Health Outcomes seem strong, and should be acknowledged as so in that Chapter. Additional recommendations are described below. E 251 34 \u0011 average concentrations might have been biased high, which might have resulted in a mercury 35 52 These statements seem inconsistent, please clarify. ATSDR Response: Chapter 2 discusses two fish sampling plans, one from ATSDR and the other from Dr. Caro. ATSDR attempted to capture larger fish because larger fish tend to have higher !D \u00ad biased mercury levels. We intended this bias so that ATSDR would be sure to sample fish with higher contaminant levels. Dr. Caro reported that she could not find an association between mercury content and fish size. She attributed this lack of association to the predominance of Page | C- 55 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 smaller fish in her study. We provided additional information about Dr. \u0012 !D data in Chapter 2, Sections 2.2.1 and 256 38 ! \u00121 ! \u0012 U.S.EPA (2001a) includes a complete summary of all comparisons between locations, parametric and nonparametric, for F this manuscript. ATSDR Response: As requested, Table C1 from U.S.EPA !D 2001 sample has been added to the Report, Chapter 2, Section 2 .5.6. [Comment] Chapter 4. PRCCR data and the Lopez Carrosquillo study could be further discussed in this chapter (see previous comments). In addition, other references cited in this paper by Lopez and Carrosquillo (2002) seem relevant to the assessment in discussion, and should be considered for inclusion in this report. ATSDR Response The references mentioned in the Lopez and Carrosquillo paper did not provide any additional information on morbidity and mortality other than what we obtained previously from other reports. Chapter 4. The 2009 report of the PRCCR, which evaluated cancer incidence and mortality from 1990 2004, is not summarized in the Appendix of this manuscript. Please include. ATSDR Response: We added a summary of the 2009 PRCCR report to Appendix A. [Comment] The study by Dr. Carlos Rodr\u00edguez Sierra regarding arsenic levels in people of Vieques (page 272) is very relevant for biomonitoring. Further efforts should be made by the authors to contact Dr. Rodr\u00edguez Sierra and get a copy of his results for further discussion in this report. ATSDR Response: On September 23, 2010, Dr. Rodr\u00edguez Sierra responded to our request for additional information about his arsenic studies with this statement: ults of arsenic in Vieques, we just submitted this work as a research manuscript to a journal to be evaluated for publication (waiting time is 6-10 If the study is accepted for publication, it should be available in 2011. Dr. Rodr\u00edguez Sierra has repeatedly declined to share his data with ATSDR that he wishes to publish the data first is understandable. Until his data are available, ATSDR will use the results he presented in his Webinar for qualitative purposes only. On the basis of ATSDR's -re-evaluation of historical bombing activities in the Vieques summary report, has ATSDR reached the appropriate conclusions and recommendations? [Comment] Despite some limitations characteristic of research studies, previous research suggests a high burden of environmental health risks and of chronic conditions in the Viequense population. This Page | C- 56 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 reviewer overall agrees with recommendations/conclusions made in Chapter 9 of this manuscript. Nonetheless, specific suggestions are described below. Fish pathway: Given that this manuscript shows potential health risks associated with the consumption of large amounts of fish in Vieques, this reviewer agrees with the proposed recommendations of additional conclusive studies in this area. These future studies should consider fishes of different sizes, different classes of fish within the same family species and from different reef locations. ATSDR Response: We added the concept of looking at fish species and locations to the recommendation for an additional fish study. See Chapters 2 and 9. [Comment] Biomonitoring: Increased blood levels of mercury in blood and hair of Viequenses has already been documented. Given that some limitations have been discussed in the text regarding this data, the authors should clarif y in the recommendations of this chapter (Chapter 9) why they are suggesting additional studies. ATSDR Response: We have recommended that a survey of Vieques residents be conducted to determine the types, frequency, and quantity of fish consumed . The results of this survey could be used to conduct additional risk assessments and statistical analyses to validate our concerns about mercury in Vieques reef fish. ATSDR is not recommending a comprehensive, systematic biomonitoring effort at this time because we found little evidence of current exposure to contaminants from past military activities. Many chemicals are short-lived in the human body and thus cannot be measured through a biomonitoring program if the exposure occurred some time ago. Public health officials could consider a targeted human biomonitoring investigation following the release of this report, for example, by testing for excessive mercury exposure from eating fish. If a biomonitoring investigation is conducted, it should include a comparison group from mainland Puerto Rico. If requested, CDC/ATSDR subject matter experts will provide technical assistance and support to public health officials or scientists in planning and conducting such an investigation. We have recommended that if individual Viequenses remain concerned about exposure to mercury, cadmium, other metals, or metalloids, they should consult their healthcare provider to discuss the need for and cost of testing. A qualified laboratory should do the testing and analysis. [Comment] Health Outcome Data Increased burden of chronic diseases, cancer incidence and cancer mortality are documented in Vieques as compared to PR. The authors suggest that the confidence intervals are too wide. To what study are they making reference when doing this comment? Page | C- 57 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 ATSDR Response : We are referring to the last line of paragraph 2 on page 56 of the 2009 Cancer Incidence and Mortality report, which refers to low precision in the confidence intervals. We added language to clarify our reference to cancer incidence and mortality in Chapter 9, Section 9.4.1. The revised response refers to cancer incidence and mortality . Uncertainty is also evident in the wide confidence intervals reported indicating imprecise estimates of cancer incidence and mortality ratios in Vieques relative to the rest of Puerto Rico (RCCPR 2009). [Comment] Section 9.4.2 (page 191, 4th recommendation). Why do they suggest point 4?? The data already provide evidence of increased disease risk in this population. Please provide more specific recommendations of the reasons for future studies in this area, and the suggested qualities/focus that these studies should have. ATSDR Response: Although the data suggest increased prevalence of chronic diseases, we believe the findings contain considerable uncertainty. The conclusions for the prevalence of noncancer chronic diseases are based solely on one report. We believe that the next steps should focus on studies that better define exposure and that better characterize the occurrence of cancer and noncancer morbidity and mortality. [Comment] Local Produce and local Livestock Pathway Given that evidence suggests potential contamination of foods (i.e. pigeon peas), potential for uptake of metals from soil into local food crops, and lack of definite data on contamination of edible portions of produce and livestock, this reviewer agrees with the recommendation of further sampling and research in this area. The splitting of samples between labs for further validation of results is an important suggestion. ATSDR Response: Thank you for your comment. [Comment] Air Pathway: Is there any way to confirm the U.S. Navy records of the types and amounts of ordnance used at the training range? Fluctuations in this records could impact the models developed to access population exposure ATSDR Response: 2003 ! ! usage data and metals and explosive by-products emissions estimates that ATSDR derived from them. While there is no way to provide an ordnance usage estimate independent of naval records it should be noted that the Navy does not keep such records for environmental assessment purposes. The Navy maintains ordnance usage data for the purpose of monitoring training activities and ultimately because they must replace expended ordnance. Consequently, there is little rationale for the Navy to underestimate ordnance usage. [Comment] Page | C- 58 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 The report concludes no potential exposure to residential areas and thus, no further research in this area. Given that this reviewer is not an expert in Air pathways, the feedback of another reviewer in this area is recommended. ATSDR Response : Comment noted. [Comment] Soil Pathway: The results presented in this chapter suggest that contaminant levels at the LIA may have in the past been high, and are potentially high in the present, and thus may represent a harm for human exposure. Thus, this reviewer agrees with the need of future studies in this area. Validation of samples between laboratories should be done during these efforts. ATSDR Response: Thank you for your comment. [Comment] Drinking Water Pathway: I agree with the recommendation of additional research to further sample drinking water in Vieques to determine the safety of its consumption. ATSDR Response: Thank you for your comment. [Comment] Section 9.9- Final Summary The authors suggest the need for a well-conceived and well-conducted biomonitoring study. They should further elaborate on the proposed characteristics for this study, including that it should have the capacity to study mixtures and cumulative exposures and their impact on human health in Vieques. ATSDR Response: In this type of document, elaboration is not appropriate regarding the study design of any future biomonitoring study in Vieques. A more appropriate approach is first to gather buy-in from scientists and health professionals who would be interested in such a study. After identifying such a group or groups, much discussion would be needed to determine the metals and other compounds that could be monitored and that could provide insight into whether residents are being exposed to contaminants from past military exercises. Adding mixtures to such a study would require a great deal more thought and insight. Many reviewers commented that one failing of the previous studies and work on Vieques was the inability to relate contaminants to bombs and munitions. Thus identifying which metals are military exercise- related is important, as is whether a pathway of exposure can be identified that warrants a biomonitoring study. ATSDR is not recommending a comprehensive, systematic biomonitoring effort at this time because we found little evidence of current exposure to contaminants from past military activities. Many chemicals are short-lived in the human body and thus cannot be measured through a biomonitoring program if the exposure occurred some time ago. Public health officials could consider a targeted human biomonitoring investigation following the release of this report, for example, by testing for excessive mercury exposure from Page | C- 59 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 eating fish. If a biomonitoring investigation is conducted, it should include a comparison group from mainland Puerto Rico. If requested, CDC/ATSDR subject matter experts will provide technical assistance and support to public health officials or scientists in planning and conducting such an investigation. The Report does discuss the issue of cumulative exposures (as chemical mixtures in fish consumption) in Chapter 2, Section 2.2.6 and in Chapter 9, Section 9.9. No change was made in the Report.

[Comment] This report acknowledges the commitment of ATSDR in its continuing involvement in Vieques and in continuing to work with local community and health and environmental officials to implement the recommendations of this report. This reviewer thinks that this commitment is essential, not only in expertise, but also in other recourses, such as financial matters (as a future, well -rounded study will be costly ). ATSDR Response: Thank you for your comment. Are there any other comments?

[Comment] The results of this manuscript should be discussed with researchers, community leaders, the Department of Health of Puerto Rico and other people interested in the health of Vieques for further evaluation and recommendations. Multidisciplinary and collaborative efforts should be developed to further study and improve the health of this community. ATSDR Response: Thank you for your comment. ATSDR plans to work with our partners to Page | C- 61 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 Reviewer 5 Overall, has ATSDR's re-evaluation of public health issues associated with historical bombing exercises at Vieques been appropriate? ATSDR Note : Peer Reviewer 5 did not answer the six questions that were sent, but rather provided comments in the format below. ATSDR has provided responses to the comments after each comment where appropriate. [Comment] Critique of Air Pathway Analysis: 1. Failure to Collect and Manage Air Pollution Data: ATSDR concluded that air pollution data was mismanaged and therefore provides unreliable information regarding the magnitude and distribution of air contaminants during high activity periods on the Live Impact Area. The Navy's 1979 Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for continued use of the bombing range documents results from a 2-month air sampling program (TAMS 1979 provided no information on the sampling methods used or on data quality. No documentation can be found describing the sampling methods used or the quality assurance measures taken. ATSDR Response : Quality of data used in the assessment: The Air PHA included a comprehensive review of all of the available air monitoring data, modeling studies, and meteorological data. While historic data and data reports do not include all of the data quality assessments that are required in current practice, this does not preclude the use of such historic data. Such data, however, should be interpreted with caution. The Air PHA used the historic data in conjunction with recent monitoring data and modeling studies. Although in isolation each of these information sources includes aspects of uncertainty, collectively they provide a comprehensive assessment of the potential airborne exposures in the residential areas of Vieques. [Comment] Exposures to Releases from Military Training Exercises Using \"Live\" Bombs Averaging Periods: A problem is identified with respect to air pollution modeling. Pollution levels were averaged over two periods, one year and 24 hours. This may be relevant for chronic respiratory disease prevalence, however it neglects the potential for short term bursts of pollution to exacerbate existing respiratory problems such as asthma, allergies and chronic bronchitis. Averaging pollution over 24 hours could make temporal bursts caused by periodic explosions disappear, while these episodes may be quite relevant to estimating respiratory distress among the sensitive. This is especially problematic for young children who have immature and narrower airways than adults. ATSDR Response : The reviewer is correct in noting that there was no assessment of PM10 concentrations for time periods fewer than 24 hours, and that military operations could have resulted in higher PM10 concentrations for time periods of fewer than 24 hours. The U.S.EPA Page | C- 63 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 and the California Air Review Board have established recommended procedures for conv erting between various air loading averaging periods (USEPA 1992; CA ARB 1994). The recommended conversion to estimate a 1-hour averaging period from a 24-hour period is to multiply the 24-hr value by 2.5 (Figure H.1/ Appendix H, CA ARB, 1994). Using the upper-bound assumptions for contaminant emissions, daily ordnance use, and !D ! ! 24-hour average PM10 concentrations in residential areas to increase by 10.2 \u00b5g/m3 ge 40, Air PHA). Using the above conversion procedure, the maximum 1-hour increase in PM10 would be 25.5 \u00b5g/m3 (10.2 \u00b5g/m3 x 2.5). Adding the calculated maximum 1-hour increase of 25.5 \u00b5g/m3 to the maximum 24 hour measured PM10 concentration (94 \u00b5g/m3; Isabel Segunda, page C-9, Air PHA) results in a maximum short-term air PM10 concentration of 119.5 \u00b5g/m3. This value is below the 24-hour PM10 standard of 150 \u00b5g/m3 and unlikely to result in respiratory distress or other adverse health effects. As shorter averaging periods do not change the health determination, no changes to document have been made as a result of this comment. [Comment] 2. Particle Size: Low diameter particles (less than 2.5 microns in size) were not measured. These fine and ultrafine particles may stay suspended for longer periods of time, move longer distances and may become more deeply embedded in the lungs. ATSDR Response : Chapter 6, Section 6.2.2 (of the summary document explicitly addressed the issue of PM2.5. No further revisions are necessary . 3. Wind Blown Dust: It was concluded that wind-blown dust from the LIA on days when bombing did not take place is not a health hazard. ATSDR Response: Thank you for your comment. 4. Total Suspended Particulates (TSP) are primarily a measure of larger diameter airborne particles that would likely settle out in close proximity to the location of their generation. Particles of smaller diameter PM 2.5 microns in diameter and smaller are far more likely to remain in the atmosphere for longer periods of time and travel longer distances before deposition. These finer particles were not measured by ATSDR, the Navy or EPA. These particles may also act as nuclei \u0012 ATSDR Response : Chapter 6, Section 6.2.2 of the summary document explicitly addressed the issue of PM2.5. No further revisions are necessary . Page | C- 64 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 [Comment] 5. Chaff: Chaff fibers typically are 25 microns (\u00b5m) thick and between 1 and 2 centimeters long. Chaff fibers are visible to the human eye and have the appearance of short, very fine, hair-like fibers. a. ATSDR estimates that 266,000 pounds/year of chaff may have been deliberately dropped over or near Vieques. b. Ground level concentrations were never monitored by the Navy or other government authorities. ATSDR Response Chaff: Regarding the issue of chaff emissions and exposures, the Air PHA explicitly addressed the issue of chaff emissions and potential exposures. Using health protective assumptions regarding emissions, exposure, and uptake, the Air PHA concluded that ge of chaff at Vieques does not pose a public health hazard, whether the chaff finding regarding chaff and other air contaminants in Chapter 6, Section 6.2.1. No further revisions or assessment are necessary. [Comment] Critique of Drinking Water Analysis [Comment] 1. Chemicals released to the environment of the island of Vieques by the U.S. Navy may have resulted in human exposure and associated health threats that may be dose dependent. A 35 1943 1978 exposed via drinking water to possible hazardous compounds released to the environment by the Navy. Yet this is also a period when government testing of environmental quality on the island was minimal. ATSDR Response : The current conclusion that a lack of historical data prevents a definitive conclusion about distant-past exposures to drinking water from wells is consistent with this comment; therefore, no changes have been made. We believe, however, it is important to indicate what limited past information and data do tell us about the relative likelihood of past exposures through the drinking water pathway. As discussed in Chapter 1, Section 1.2, ordnance training on Vieques was not scaled up until the 1970s, particularly after 1975, when training on the island of Culebra was discontinued. Therefore, it is not unreasonable to presume that contamination of public supply wells or cisterns was very unlikely before the mid- 1970s . 2. [Comment] The poor history and quality of water testing makes it difficult to precisely reconstruct a history of exposure. Water supplies were not routinely tested for chemicals that were released to the environment by the Navy. ATSDR Response : The problem of limited historical environmental monitoring data is not specific to Vieques. It is common at many sites that operated in the past. ATSDR evaluates public health effects from potential past exposures in such situations by reviewing available Page | C- 65 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 contaminant fate and transport data and, using professional judgment, making assumptions about past exposure and identifying areas of uncertainty. 3. [Comment] The most probable routes of exposure to chemicals released to the Vieques environment by the Navy include: 1) contamination of drinking water wells from airborne chemicals that drifted and settled in the watersheds surrounding municipal wells; 2) contamination of cisterns from airborne chemicals that drifted and settled into the tanks; 3) contamination from Naval use of pesticides and herbicides; 4) contamination from airborne and surface fuel releases; 5) waste disposal practices. ATSDR Response !D ! \u0012 8 this report discuss contamination of drinking water wells and cisterns (rainwater collection systems). Potential sources of contamination, including use of pesticides or herbicides, releases of fuels, and waste disposal practices, are evaluated by evaluating levels of associated contaminants in air, soil, or drinking water, as was done in past ATSDR PHAs and this report. 4. [Comment] Most reported studies are not peer reviewed, remain unpublished and are often based upon sampling designs and exceptionally small sample sizes (ranging between 1- 12 samples). Degradation products were not tested or reported. ATSDR Response : ATSDR summarized the findings, strengths, and limitations of the reviewed studies in Appendix A of the Report. ATSDR was requested to review all available studies and data related to potential exposures at Vieques. While many of the studies were limited, they added to the body of knowledge about Vieques environmental exposures. 5. [Comment] Since the ATSDR drinking water study was completed prior to the air study the conclusions of this report are not conclusive. The most plausible pathway for drinking water contamination resulting from Navy activity on the islands is from airborne chemicals having settled in drinking water systems. ATSDR Response : ! \u0012 6 !D ! Assessment (ATSDR 2003 b), evaluation of the air pathway suggested that no substantial levels of atmospheric contamination had reached the residential area of Vieques. ATSDR was un able to evaluate directly the potential for exposures from cistern water as no cistern water data are available. 6. [Comment] These studies do not provide a reasonable estimate of the drinking water contamination that may have occurred prior to the completion of the municipal water supply line from the main island of Puerto Rico in 1978. ATSDR Response : As concluded in Chapter 8, Section 8.4.1 and Chapter 9, Section 9.8.1, ATSDR recognizes that the 1978 data are insufficient to make public health conclusions about exposures long past. But as detailed in Chapters 6 and 8, consideration of groundwater flow patterns, air modeling studies, actual bombing patterns, and recent sampling results suggest that past exposures from drinking water were not high. Page | C- 66 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 7. [Comment] The EPA studies cited did not test for pesticides and herbicides. Also an analysis of military use of pesticides and herbicides not been conducted or presented. ATSDR Response : The Report does not consider pesticides and herbicides. As discussed in !D Drinking Water Pathway PHA (ATSDR 2001), 1995 sampling had shown no detections of a wide range of pesticides and herbicides, indicating that drinking water supplies had not been contaminated at any location by pesticides or herbicides. Pesticides and herbicides were not analyzed in many of the soil sampling events. Soil sampling at the NASD and recent EMA sampling related to remediation activities have found a few detections of DDT and its breakdown products. In all but one specific location, these detections were far below health\u00ad !D recommendation to restrict the LIA and other potentially contaminated military areas and continue environmental assessment and remediation activities will protect the public from any harmful exposures to pesticides and herbicides remaining from military activities. 8. [Comment] It was reported the presence of RDX (0.04 ppb) and Tetryl (0.05) in the drinking water supplies of Isabel Segunda (0.5 ppb) and RDX (0.04 ppb) in the drinking water of Esperanza in May of 1978, referencing a Naval Surface Weapons Center report (Hoffsommer and Glover 1978; Lai 1978). ATSDR Response : ATSDR discussed these findings in Chapter 8, Sections 8.2.2 and 8.3.1.2 of the Report. 9. [Comment] The studies interpreted by ATSDR do not demonstrate the absence of health threats associated with naval activities. Instead, they demonstrate the absence of proper testing of the history when it was most vulnerable. ATSDR Response : As concluded in Chapter 8, Section 8.4.1 and Chapter 9, Section 9.8.1, ATSDR recognizes that the 1978 data are insufficient to make public health conclusions about distant past exposures. Critique of Soil Analysis: 1. [Comment] Failure to Collect and Manage Soil Contamination Data: The Navy consistently failed to collect data on soil contamination associated with training and operations. The absence of these data prevented the understanding when and where possible soil contamination might have posed a public health threat. This could occur from particles exploding into the atmosphere, drifting along the island into the breathing zone of inhabitants, settling on soils, infiltrating water supplies, being absorbed by plants, some of which might have been consumed by animals, in turn consumed by humans. By failing to monitor pollution air pollution, patterns of deposition to soil and other sediments, this in turn prevented an understanding of possible food chain dynamics. ATSDR Response : We agree that the issue of food-chain dynamics has not been thoroughly investigated on Vieques. Long-range transport of certain contaminants (e.g., aerial deposition of mercury) has been observed elsewhere under the right conditions (i.e., continuous emissions of large quantities from a single large source or multiple smaller sources, combined with Page | C- 67 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 appropriate meteorological conditions). Nevertheless, actual sampling data and air dispersion modeling on Vieques do not indicate that environmental transport of contamination originating from the bombing areas would be expected to affect areas distant from the range. It appears that any environmental effect from past range use activities is localized. 2. [Comment] Grazing Animals and their Products: The Navy, EPA and ATSDR did not do research on grazing activities by cattle, goats, sheep, pigs and chickens. Their importance to the diet of Viequenses is also poorly understood, but could potentially be an important additional pathway of contaminant exposure. The community members expressed concern over the possibility that livestock are accumulating heavy metals by grazing on contaminated plants. ATSDR Response : Thank you for your comment. At the time of the original public health assessment discussing the soil evaluation pathway, little information or data were available pertaining to the potential for heavy metal accumulation in local livestock. The Puerto Rico Department of Agriculture, in cooperation with the Farmers Association of Puerto Rico, sampled grass, fruit-bearing trees, and bovine livestock from Monte Carmelo, Martineau, Monte Santo, Esperanza, Lujan, Gubeo, and western Vieques for cadmium, cobalt, copper, lead, manganese, and nickel. They concluded that the agricultural products from Vieques did not contain toxic levels of these contaminants and were suitable for consumption (El Nuevo D\u00eda 2001). Since that time, additional plant data have been collected. But due to data limitations, uncertainty remains regarding the degree of potential exposures from consuming local produce. The Report contains a thorough discussion of currently available sampling data from locally produce and livestock. Although the results of sampling by the Puerto Rico Department of Agriculture is reassuring, ATSDR recommends additional sampling of locally grown produce to allow a more complete evaluation of this exposure pathway . 3. [Comment] Air, Soil and Water: The most plausible hypothesis regarding transport and fate of chemicals is that chemicals released to the atmosphere were eventually deposited on soils and plants and then washed into underlying aquifers by rains. ATSDR Response : To assess whether the dust releases present public health hazards, ATSDR evaluated whether dusts blow into the residential areas in appreciable quantities. The findings of the Air Pathway Evaluation, described in Chapter 6, suggest that substantial levels of atmospheric contamination had not reached the residential area of Vieques. 4. [Comment] Plant Contamination: ATSDR could not quantify exposures to contaminants from these reports nor draw any health conclusions about whether consuming plants grown in Vieques would result in harmful health effects. ATSDR Response : Most of the relevant studies sampled plant species typically not eaten by humans or sampled the parts not eaten. As a result, the data were not useful for interpreting the degree of exposure or representative of locally grown produce on the island. To address this data gap, ATSDR recommends further sampling. Page | C- 68 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 Page | C- 69 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 Reviewer 6 Overall, has ATSDR's re-evaluation of public health issues associated with historical bombing exercises at Vieques been appropriate? [Comment] According to my best knowledge, the ATSDR re-evaluation of public health issues associated with historical bombing exercises at Vieques is appropriate. This opinion is based on the evidence presented, including ATSDR own data and the data generated by Puerto Rican scientists and researchers. As ATSDR recognizes, there is a huge degree of uncertainty in this type of analysis and the recommendations made are directed to reduce that uncertainty. Vieques was used as a military target and ammunition-explosive storage for more than 60 years and, as expected, these military activities are a major source of contamination, which constitutes a human health concern. Past and present conditions of Vieques reflect the difficulties of approaching this type of human health assessment based on environmental data that was not necessarily developed to answer the type of questions associated with public health issues. In addition, Vieques social and environmental conditions are very complex. Thus, some degree of uncertainty will always remain. Nevertheless, military activities were always considered the major envi between military activities and human health concerns in Vieques have been established by local scientists and researchers and this report very well examines the scientific strengths and weaknesses of those connections. This report also incorporates new environmental, biomonitoring and health outcome data and revisits the previous ATSDR reports. Therefore, new recommendations and findings are integrated into this report. ATSDR Response : Thank you for your comments. Has ATSDR adequately addressed the pathways of human exposure to bombing range-specific contaminants? Please include specific comments on: Consumption of seafood from reefs near Vieques [Comment] This subject was addressed adequately. ATSDR recognized the limitations of the data in measuring mercury levels in fish and shellfish. It also indicates that some children born to women who frequently ate fish from waters surrounding Vieques were at increased risk of adverse health effect and some children who frequently ate fish from waters surrounding Vieques the same fish were also at risk of harmful effects. Based on the information available, ATSDR could not make any connection with the military activities and the mercury level found in fish. Then, the best recommendation is to make a risk assessment around the LIA to determine the effect that military activities have had on the marine ecosystem . ATSDR Response: Thank you for your comments. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Admi !! \u0012 \u0012 \u0012\u0012 !! Page | C- 71 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 conducted a characterization of coral reef ecosystems, contaminants, and nutrient distribution patterns around Vieques (NOAA 2010). Use of biomonitoring tools to assess exposure to metals and other hazardous chemicals in blood, urine, or hair that are related to historical bombing exercises [Comment] This subject was addressed adequately in some extent. ATDSDR reviewed the PRDOH, and some local researcher studies, and found elevated levels of various metals in blood, urine and hair. ATSDR emphasized that the weakness of all these studies was the inability to investigate each The PRDOH identified cigarette use, hair dyes and seafood consumption as possible sources for high metal concentration. Dr. Ortiz Roque showed that some residents had elevated levels of mercury in hair and that the most likely source was fish consumption. The best recommendation to address this issue is to make a survey of Viequenses to determine the type and quantity of fish consumed as well as a biomonitoring study to measure mercury and other metals in blood and hair. ATSDR should use the preliminary data developed by PRDOH and Dr. Ortiz to enforce a more specific study, which include an tions and metal concentration in different parts of their body. ATSDR Response : Thank you for your comment. We have recommended that a survey of Vieques residents be conducted to determine the types, frequency, and quantity of fish consumed . The results of this survey could be used to conduct additional risk assessments and statistical analyses to validate our concerns about mercury in Vieques reef fish. ATSDR is not recommending a comprehensive, systematic biomonitoring effort at this time because we found little evidence of current exposure to contaminants from past military activities. Many chemicals are short-lived in the human body and thus cannot be measured through a biomonitoring program if the exposure occurred some time ago. Public health officials could consider a targeted human biomonitoring investigation following the release of this report, for example, by testing for excessive mercury exposure from eating fish. If a biomonitoring investigation is conducted, it should include a comparison group from mainland Puerto Rico. If requested, CDC/ATSDR subject matter experts will provide technical assistance and support to public health officials or scientists in planning and conducting such an investigation. Viequenses who remain concerned about exposure to mercury, cadmium, other metals, or metalloids should consult their healthcare provider to discuss the need for and cost of testing. A qualified laboratory should do the testing and analysis. Consumption of food (produce, meat, dairy, eggs) grown on the island [Comment] This subject was addressed adequately. The main ATSDR conclusion about this subject is that the overall data is insufficient to adequately determine human exposure or to draw any valid health conclusion. ATSDR evaluated Dr. D\u00edaz and Dr. Massols (2003) research, which found cadmium levels in pigeon peas potentially harmful for preschool children. ATSDR cannot be certain of the extent to which military activities contribute to the cadmium level found in pigeon peas. Recommendations suggested by ATSDR encouraged additional sampling and collaborative data collection for plants, livestock and soil. Based on the data collected by Dr. D\u00edaz and Dr. Massol, ATSDR should enforce more specific studies about this subject and its association with military activities . Page | C- 72 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 ATSDR Response : Thank you for your comment. In fulfilling its role as a nonregulatory science advisory agency, ATSDR cannot direct other entities to conduct further studies, nor collect samples of local produce. However, we hope that recommendations for a collaborative sampling effort will help resolve uncertainties and limitations in data on locally grown produce. Exposure to air, soil, and water on Vieques [Comment] This subject was addressed adequately to some extent. The main objective of this section was to determine whether airborne contaminant could potentially expose Viequenses in residential areas to harmful levels of metals and particulates that might result in adverse health effects. A TSDR used all the climate and meteorological information available as well as the ordinance detonation and the residential area air quality data. ATSDR reviewed and adapted a new version of a dispersion model and applied it to Vieques. Using this model ATSDR concluded that in residential areas of Vieques airborne from past military operations would have been essentially nondetectable and unlikely to have resulted in harmful effect. This conclusion is very critical in the sense that most of Vieques populatio n receive the winds coming from the east (where the LIA was located) and they were not located far away from this military activities. This model should incorporate measurement of 2.5pm that is proved to be harmful for humans. This model should also include measurement of particulate matter coming from the Sahara desert, which is very well documented that affects human health throughout the Caribbean region. A conclusion sustaining that there is no air pollution reaching soil or water is somewhat uncertain. The rest of the data, conclusion and recommendations are very well documented. ATSDR Response : Chapter 6, Section 6.2.2 of the summary document explicitly addressed the issue of PM2.5. No further revisions are necessary. The 2003 Air PHA evaluated the public health implications of exposure to airborne particulates from African Dust Storms (pages 59 61) and found that PM10 (and PM2.5) from such storms on Vieques were not at levels of health concern. But no contaminant-specific data on dust from African Dust Storms were available at the time of the Air PHA (which recommended further evaluation if such contaminant specific data became available). Contaminant-specific dust data are presented in a recent study by Gioda et.al. (2007) and a discussion of this information has been added to 6.2.3. Does the Vieques summary report adequately present and describe the limitations and uncertainty of assessing human exposure to bombing range-specific contaminants? [Comment] Yes, the summary report, in general, adequately describes the limitations and uncertainties of assessing human exposure to military activities. As the report recognized, the data used has strengths and weaknesses and cannot address the effect of mixture and cumulative exposure on the health of Viequense s. ATSDR Response : Thank you for your comment no revision required. Page | C- 73 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 Are independent studies utilized appropriately in the determination of potential health hazards? [Comment] Yes, independent studies contained in this report are properly used to determine the potential health hazard caused to the population of Vieques by past military activities. Most of these studies bring out new information and data to support new evidence and conclusions. ATSDR Response : Thank you for your comment. On the basis of ATSDR's reevaluation of historical bombing activities in the Vieques summary report, has ATSDR reached the appropriate conclusions and recommendations? [Comment] Based on the data and information available ATSDR, in general, reached appropriate conclusions and recommendations. As stated in the report, more studies could be done in order to complete the whole picture of a really complex environmental and human health problem. At this moment, the information collected represents a lot of fragmented pieces of an environmental health puzzle . Therefore, an integrated and holistic approach could be developed for future studies. ATSDR Response : ATSDR agrees and has made recommendations in the Report to 1) conduct a scientific survey of Viequenses to assess their seafood consumption and other food consumption, and 2) reanalyze the existing data using information obtained from the survey . ATSDR is not recommending a comprehensive, systematic biomonitoring effort at this time because we found little evidence of current exposure to contaminants from past military activities. Many chemicals are short-lived in the human body and thus cannot be measured through a biomonitoring program if the exposure occurred some time ago. Public health officials could consider a targeted human biomonitoring investigation following the release of this report, for example, by testing for excessive mercury exposure from eating fish. If a biomonitoring investigation is conducted, it should include a comparison group from mainland Puerto Rico. If requested, CDC/ATSDR subject matter experts will provide technical assistance and support to public health officials or scientists in planning and conducting such an investigation. ATSDR also recommends that Viequenses who remain concerned about exposure to mercury, cadmium, other metals, or metalloids should consult their healthcare provider to discuss the need for and cost of testing.

[Comment] The peer review process is very well documented and guided. ATSDR Response : Thank you for your comment. Are there any other comments? [Comment] Sometimes science is not sufficient to find answers to some environmental problems. Particularly, when dealing with the human health dimension of these problems. What is critical is to find the best possible response to the particular environmental health problem. In the case of Vieques, I think that a necessary approach is to develop a comprehensive epidemiological study of its population. This study should consider all human health conditions and diseases. It should also consider habits, cultural activities and personal and social environmental conditions. This study should be complemented with several studies recommended in the different sections of this report. But, instead of approaching the problem from an environmental perspective, it will be better to approach the analysis from a human health dimension. I completely agree that a future comprehensive study should investigate the combined and cumulative effects of exposure to military activities in Vieques. ATSDR Response : ATSDR is mandated to focus on the environmental associations with adverse ! ally to identify environmental exposures of concern and then evaluate biologically plausible health effects possibly associated with these exposures.

Their comments are shown below !D their comments. Also, throughout our responses we refer to An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques, Puerto Rico as Commenter 1 [Comment] A 90 day period had been given for comments to the aforementioned document which took more than two years to prepare. The following critique is done only for those priority areas in which the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Puerto Rico has been directly involved. During 2009, the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Puerto Rico expressed our opinion about the risk of exposure to military contaminants in Vieques and increased morbidity and mortality. As scientists, physicians, epidemiologists and as public health advocates, we identified the following priorities: 1. The need to obtain a full disclosure of ALL the contaminants (PHYSICAL, CHEMICAL, and/or \u0011G\u0012! ! ! ! 40 years. 2. Once the most potentially hazardous exposures are identified, the corresponding biological monitoring (in humans) has to be done in order to avert disease for this and the future generations of Viequenses. To date, a full disclosure has not been produced. Thus, any evaluation of the exposure to military agents in Vieques is seriously limited by the lack of the most critical information. With the aforementioned stated, we proceed to offer our professional opinion about some aspects of the ATSDR Evaluation. a. Identification of Exposures by ATSDR The ATSDR did not formally nor systematically identify hazardous agents (chemical, physical or biological) utilized by the military forces in Vieques. Available information was not utilized and is hereby presented for their benefit. i. Since 1994, there is USA government documentation (Environmental Protection ! E! D military contaminants (NAVY had 102 discharge violations) in the coastal waters of Vieques. Docket no. RCRA- 02-2000 -7301. In particular, MERCURY was among the hazardous violations found by EPA. Page 5: D009 a solid waste exhibiting the toxicity characteristics of mercury pursuant to CFR 261.24 Page | D-3 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 ATSDR Response : Docket no. RCRA- 02-2000-7301 is a Consent Order that outlined the responsibilities of both the U.S. EPA and the Navy with regard to the Atlantic Fleet Weapons Training Facility. The Navy conducted a RCRA Facility Investigation (RFI) to determine fully the nature and extent of any release of hazardous wastes, solid wastes, or hazardous constituents at or from the facility. The U.S. EPA reserved the right to perform any and all work the Order required, including but not limited to any additional site characterization, feasibility study, or response or corrective action deemed necessary to investigate the facility thoroughly, or to protect human health or the environment. ATSDR reviewed data on many contaminants at the Atlantic Fleet Weapons Training Facility. !D 2003 public health assessment (PHA) reviewed the sample results of explosive residues and over 40 other chemicals. Sample results for over 300 different chemicals were considered as a part of the 2001 Drinking Water PHA, while the 2003 Air PHA modeled the potential exposure to nearly 100 different contaminants. This information was reviewed again as a part of the Report, which also considered information from studies published since completion of the 2001 2003 PHAs. While the Consent Order does not contain the details of the 102 discharge violations, ATSDR was able to review correspondence between the EPA and the Navy that does discuss the D National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit. ATSDR reviewed a list of 126 effluent violations that occurred between February 1994 and April 1999. Only one of the violations involved mercury. The violation for mercury was a reported value of 0.0014 mg/L, which was above the permitted limit of 0.001 mg/L but below the maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 0.002 mg/L. The Consent Order does not add to the understanding of the levels of mercury or other contaminants present in the different environmental media on the island or the amount to which persons were or are exposed. [Comment] 3. F 11 2005 E! 2 of the many contaminants in Vieques originated by the Atlantic Fleet Training Area (Vieques). Threat of contaminants Extensive amounts of unexploded ordinance [sic] and remnants of exploded ordinance [sic] have been identified in the range areas of Vieques, and in the surrounding waters. Hazardous substances associated with ordinance [sic] may include mercury, lead, copper, magnesium, lithium, perchlorate, TNT, napalm and depleted uranium among others. At the Eastern Maneuver Area, and in the NASD, the hazardous substances present a range of chemicals such as PCB, solvents and pesticides. ATSDR Response: E!

Consequently, it does not add to the understanding of of mercury levels to which persons were or are exposed. Page | D-4 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 In the Report, ATSDR staff reevaluated the list of possible contaminants in unexploded ordnance, particularly mercury. The following sections in Chapter 1.3 (Chemicals in Munitions and Detonation Byproducts) provide detailed information about organic and inorganic components in various ordnance types in the Vieques environment and in human exposure pathways: 1.3.1. Organic Compounds in Munitions and Detonation Byproducts 1.3.2. Inorganic Compounds in Munitions and Detonation Byproducts 1.3.3. What Bomb-related Constituents Were Found in Vieques 1.3.4. Linking Contaminants in Vieques with Human Exposure Pathways With regard to mercury in military ordnance, the Report states: \u0011 contaminant of concern (Garc\u00eda et. al. 2000). Bomb casing composition data originally provided by the Navy indicated that casings did not contain mercury, which is consistent with information on Material Safety Data Sheets available for steel. The 2003 Air PHA indicated that the total annual estimated mercury emissions from high explosive ordnance used at the [Live Impact Area] (LIA) were very low (i.e., less than 0.5 kg per year). Following detonation, the mercury was presumably a trace constituent in the explosive charge and in the soil ejected into the air. Therefore, the live ordnance dropped on the LIA does not appear to be a significant mercury To provide perspective, ATSDR has added information from the mercury National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for allowable mercury air emissions from chlor-alkali plants . Developed in 1973 and last amended in 2000 by US EPA, this standard allows a chlor-alkali plant to release 2.3 kg of mercury daily into the atomosphere . Therefore, the annual estimated mercury emissions from high explosive ordnance in the LIA (less than 0.5 kg per year) can be compared with the NESHAP standard for chlor-alkali plants (844 kg per year). More information is available at: http:// www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR- 2011-title40-vol8/xml/CFR- 2011 -title40-vol8\u00ad pa rt61.xml#seqnum61.52 . In addition, if military ordnance were a significant source of mercury in the environment, soil in the LIA should have significantly higher mercury levels than surrounding soils. The Report states in Section 1.3.3, however, ! from the 2000 dataset was 0.02 ppm, and the highest level was 0.086 ppm (CH2MHILL 2000). Only one of 29 soil samples had a mercury level that could be considered above naturally occurring levels when compared with the background upper tolerance levels (UTLs) (0.057 0.31 \u00122 2007 [Comment] Page | D-5 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 1. To this date, no other local sources of mercury, uranium nor napalm contamination have been identified in Vieques other than military activities. ATSDR Response: While no civilian uses of napalm have been documented on Vieques, both the military and civilians used gasoline one of the main napalm ingredients (Reich and Sidel 1967; Department of the Army 1984). With regard to uranium, it is a naturally occurring radionuclide present in nearly all rocks. It is also present in soils, which are derived from rock erosion. Uranium is also a trace contaminant of !D 1999 !D 200 1 Drinking Water PHA addressed the incident involving the firing of 263 depleted uranium rounds onto the LIA. During June 6 15, 2000, the Nucle \u0012 \u0012 the depleted uranium rounds contaminated the environment. The NRC found that the only detections of uranium, at levels above the natural background level, were measured in five samples collected in the holes where DU rounds were found, and concluded that depleted uranium had not spread to areas outside the LIA. Thus the public had not been exposed to depleted uranium contamination or other radiation above normal background (i.e., naturally occurring) levels (NRC 2000). ATSDR reviewed the NRC report and concluded that the background levels of radiation detected on Vieques did not present a public health hazard. The Report also identifies other possible mercury sources. For example, case histories from the scientific literature show that broken mercury thermometers and reclaimed dental fillings can expose residents to mercury in the home. In addition, ATSDR has added religious rites using mercury-containing capsules as a possible source of mercury exposure from indoor air. [Comment] 2. Military activities in Vieques were and are not limited to the east end of the island. The Naval Ammunition Storage Detachment (NASD) is in the west end of Vieques. ATSDR Response : As this co !D fish samples from the west end of Vieques. The Report also references several studies that include data from environmental samples collected at the western end of the island.

Thus, in addition to mercury global contamination, for decades Vieques has been recipient of mercury contamination of military origin. ATSDR Response : Bomb casing composition data originally provided by the Navy indicated that casings did not contain mercury, which is consistent with information on Material Safety Data Sheets available for steel. However, the Bang Box studies showed that small amounts of mercury could be present in the explosive charge of some bombs . The 2003 ATSDR Air PHA indicated that the total, annual estimated mercury emissions from high-explosive ordnance used at the LIA were very low (i.e., less than 0.5 kg per year) . To provide perspective, ATSDR has added information from the mercury National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for allowable mercury air emissions from chlor-alkali plants . Developed in 1973 and last amended in 2000 by US EPA, this standard allows a chlor-alkali plant to release 2.3 kg of mercury daily into the atomosphere . Therefore, the annual estimated mercury emissions from high explosive ordnance in the LIA (less than 0.5 kg per year) can be compared with the NESHAP standard for chlor-alkali plants (844 kg per year). More information is available at: http:// www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR- 2011 -title40\u00ad vol 8/xml/CFR- 2011-title40-vol8-part61.xml#seqnum61.52. The estimate of less than a kg of mercury per year took into account the small amount of mercury present in some explosive charges and the amount from soil ejected into the air. But most mercury levels in LIA soils appear to be at naturally occurring levels, with no signifi cant spatial variation to suggest that mercury levels are higher at the LIA . Therefore, the small amount of mercury in some bombs was not sufficient to raise mercury soil levels in the LIA, the most heavily bombed area on Vieques . ! !D h sampling investigation did not find unusually elevated tissue concentrations of mercury in Vieques reef fish compared with levels reported by the FDA (FDA 2010) . Therefore, the live ordnance dropped on or fired into the LIA does not appear to be a significant mercury source in the Vieques environment. (See the Report, Chapter 1, Section 1.3.) [Comment] Page | D-7 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 4. After evaluating our 2004 publication, ATSDR concluded that women of reproductive age and children in Vieques are exposed to mercury levels that can be neurotoxic to their fetuses. We and the consensus of the ATSDR reviewers agree. a. Mercury contamination in women of reproductive age in Vieques is a fact. While only 6.6% of the similar women sampled in the larger island of Puerto Rico had mercury levels that could cause neurologic disease to the developing fetuses, in Vieques 26.8% had such levels. Samples were done on or before 2003, before bombing ceased. As a reference, in the continental USA only 7% of the sampled women exceed the [reference dose] (RfD). Margin of exposure analysis also revealed an unsafe mercury exposure for Viequenses. (Ortiz Roque and Rivera L\u00f3pez 2004). This study has been published and internationally peer reviewed. b. The only variable that correlated with mercury hair levels in women was LOCAL FISH CONSUMPTION. c. Unpublished data from the same researchers revealed that children 5 years of age or younger in Vieques were also dangerously exposed to mercury. While the margin of exposure was 30 in USA children, the margin of exposure in Vieques children was 4.4. A margin of exposure of less than 10 is considered dangerous for a population (Ortiz Roque and L\u00f3pez Rivera 2004). d. Thus, direct bio monitoring humans in Vieques-using internationally validated methodology-demonstrated significant mercury internal exposure and potential neurologic human disease. Mercury findings exemplify the importance of identifying exposures and the proper human bio monitoring. An indirect approach, pathway analysis and use of sentinel species, requires extensive ecological knowledge and investigation which is not always available, as was demonstrated by the fish sampling studies done by ATSDR. ATSDR Response: ATSDR agrees that if some pregnant Viequense women are high fish consumers, their fetuses are at risk of harmful effects later in life . We presented this conclusion in the Report and recommended development of an educational program about mercury in fish that incorporated local habits and information about Viequense seafood consumption. The cited 2004 publication reported statistics on 41 Viequense women together with information about seafood consumption. The publication compared these data with the main island of Puerto Rico and with results from the 1999 NHANES survey in the United States. While this study showed that higher mercury levels were associated with Viequense higher fish consumption, the patients in this investigation were not randomly selected and the number of participants was very low (i.e., 41 women). Therefore, the prevalence of Viequenses with elevated mercury levels in hair is uncertain because a systematic survey of mercury levels in hair was not conducted Page | D-8 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 The 2006 PRDOH study did not find excessive mercury levels in blood. The study either did not measure for or did not report mercury level in hair. Therefore the Report concludes that some uncertainty remains concerning the prevalence of high Viequense mercury levels. Finally, the Report concludes these biomonitoring results do not permit any conclusions about exposure to the bombing-related contaminants. (See Report, Chapter 3, Section 3.5.) [Comment] 5. FISH sampling studies done by ATSDR: a. The hypothesis of the fish sampling study done by ATSDR was not clearly delineated. ATSDR Response: !D 2001 tissues from commonly consumed fish and shellfish contained levels of heavy metals and e !D 2003 Fish and Shellfish PHA). In designing the sample plan and in collecting the samples, ATSDR E! E experience in sampling and analyzing fish. In addition, ATSDR consulted with the petitioner and local residents to advise us on the sampling plan. [Comment] b. It seems to be implicit in their analysis that if the mercury contamination was produced at the LIA, it will not sublimate, travel by air, wind or water to the rest of Vieques and surrounding waters. Fish were sampled at several locations that include LIA, Isabel Segunda, the market place and the west end of Vieques. ATSDR Response: The Report states that some migration of contaminants from the soils to the marine environment undoubtedly occurs at Vieques, just as weathering of soils naturally occurs in virtually any shoreline setting. Precipitation and wind can carry soils from the LIA and can carry chemicals found in the LIA soils either directly into marine waters or into inland lagoons. And those lagoons have the potential to overflow into the nearby ocean. Although migration of contaminants clearly occurs, the rate and amount of chemical migration are important factors in determining whether significant amounts of mercury are actually entering the marine environment . From our evaluation of LIA soils, significant amounts of mercury from LIA soils are not entering the marine environment . Nevertheless , to investigate this possible exposure pathway further, ATSDR collected fish from several reefs near Vieques . !D fish from five different locations; and, land crabs were collected from three surface locations. The fish sampling investigation did not find unusually elevated tissue concentrations of mercury in Vieques reef fish. Page | D-9 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 [Comment] c. ATSDR did not have knowledge (and still is devoid of knowledge) of the alimentary habits of Vieques women and children. In particular, the researchers did not know which species of fish and at which frequency these groups consume fish in Vieques. ATSDR Response: ATSDR used multiple information sources to identify the most commonly caught and consumed species of fish and shellfish for collection during the 2001 fish sampling investigation. One important source was a Puerto Rican university report containing survey information about the frequency and types of fish eaten (Caro 2000). ATSDR substantiated the survey results with information from the petitioner and other residents, the Vieques Special Commission Report, and visits to the local fish markets on Vieques. Nevertheless, ATSDR agrees that more information about Viequenses fish-eating habits could either verify the findings of the Report or allow a more refined assessment of eating mercury-containing fish . The Report recommends a survey of Vieques residents to determine the types, frequency, and quantity of fish consumed. Information from this survey could then guide additional risk assessments and statistical analyses if necessary. But any findings that result from such assessments and analyses are not likely to change the fact that pregnant women who are high fish consumers are at risk of excessive mercury exposure, which might harm their developing fetuses (unborn baby) . [Comment] d. ATSDR did not know (and still do not acknowledges) [sic] that military activities in Vieques are the only proven source of mercury contamination. ATSDR Response: It is unlikely that military activities are a significant source of mercury in Viequenses . Bomb casing composition data originally provided by the Navy indicated that casings did not contain mercury, which is consistent with information on Material Safety Data Sheets available for steel. The Bang Box studies, however, showed that small amounts of mercury could be present in the explosive charge of some bombs . The 2003 ATSDR Air PHA indicated that the total, annual estimated mercury emissions from high-explosive ordnance used at the LIA were very low (i.e., less than 0.5 kg per year) . To provide perspective, ATSDR has added information from the mercury National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for allowable mercury air emissions from chlor-alkali plants . Developed in 1973 and last amended in 2000 by US EPA, this standard allows a chlor-alkali plant to release 2.3 kg of mercury daily into the atomosphere . Therefore, the annual estimated mercury emissions from high explosive ordnance in the LIA (less than 0.5 kg per year) can be compared with the NESHAP standard for chlor-alkali plants (844 kg per year). The estimate of less than a kg of mercury per year took into account the small amount of mercury present in some explosive charges and the amount from soil ejected into the air. But most mercury levels in LIA soils appear to be at naturally occurring levels, with no significant spatial variation to suggest that mercury levels are higher at the LIA . Therefore, the small amount of mercury in some Page | D- 10 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 bombs was not sufficient to raise mercury soil levels in the LIA, the most heavily bombed area on Vieques . Mercury exposure from frequently eating fish could be a significant source of mercury for some Viequenses. The Report also points out other possible sources of mercury. For example, case histories from the scientific literature show that residents can be exposed in the home from broken mercury thermometers and from reclaimed dental fillings. In addition, ATSDR has added other sources that could increase metal exposure, such as cooking utensils, metal residues in foods (e.g., tea and vegetables), consumption of drinks with metallic packaging, religious rites using mercury- containing capsules, skin creams, antacid formulations and antiperspirant formulations. [Comment] e. ATSDR does not know what the typical portion of fish consumed by Viequenses women and young children is. f. ATSDR is devoid of knowledge of the typical weight of Viequenses. g. weight, body mass index, diet, fish species preference, but it was not consulted by ATSDR researchers. ATSDR Response : Because of suggestions during the November 2009 scientific consultation, ATSDR specifically considered lower than standard body weights in the Report. Then ATSDR used a range of age-specific meal portion sizes and a wide range of body weights to calculate mercury exposure doses. From these calculations, ATSDR concluded that women with a varied fish diet who typically ate more than 2 oz. of fish every day had estimated E! D who typically ate more than 0.5 oz of fish every day had estimated mercury doses that E! RfD. ATSDR also has requested that the commenter share his or her information about weight, body mass index, diet, and fish species preference. [Comment] h. ATSDR did not know what the food chain relations in Vieques are. ATSDR Response: The food chain involving mercury cycling in the environment is well- known and is the most likely source of mercury in marine food surrounding Vieques. Nevertheless, even with knowledge of this well-established mercury cycle, ATSDR investigated whether bombing-related activities could have contributed significant amounts of mercury to the Vieques environment. Our evaluation shows that while small amounts of mercury were present in some military ordnance, the amount was not sufficient to affect mercury levels in the environment or in fish. Elevated mercury levels in LIA soil were not detected, and the amount of mercury introduced to the Vieques environment from bombs was very small. Page | D- 11 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 [Comment] i. ATSDR analysis of mercury reference dose was based on fish sampling that had multiple limitations which included no stated hypothesis, no rational criteria for the species sampled, no confirmation of market fish origin and sampling consisting of unique individuals for some species. 1. ATSDR arrived at the conclusion that the average was 0.1066 ppm. It is noteworthy to mention that this is 200% above the EPA screening level (0.049 ppm). 2. ATSDR does not know if the sampled fish were representative of Viequenses diet. 3. ATSDR did not find a significant difference between the mercury concentrations in fish E! 4. Evidently, ATSDR has assumed knowing in which putative sites mercury can be found in Vieques as well as knowing about its environmental dispersion and bioaccumulation. ATSDR assumed that fish stay still in one coral reef. ATSDR Response: !D 2001 muscle tissues from commonly consumed fish and shellfish contained level s of heavy metals and explosive compounds that might result in health effects. In designing the !D E! Environmental Response Team, which has extensive experience in sampling and analyzing fish. In addition, ATSDR consulted with the petitioner and with local residents for sampling plan advice. The six sample locations were chosen to represent productive fishing areas surrounding the island , which also accounts for fish that might move from reef to reef. ATSDR used multiple information sources to identify the most commonly caught and consumed species of fish and shellfish, including the petitioner and other residents, a Puerto Rican university report (Caro 2000), the Vieques Special Commi ssion Report, and visits to the local fish markets on Vieques. The Report does acknowledge 2001 fish sampling investigation was designed using the best criteria of the time, the 2001 sample design was not consistent with some criteria found in current U.S. EPA and the State of California sample designs for developing fish consumption advisories. (See the Report, Chapter 2, Section 2.2.3.) E !D highly dependent on fish family and on fish species. Mercury was higher in two fish families (i.e., grunt and hind, 0.18 ppm and 0.12 ppm, respectively) compared with other families sampled (e.g., parrotfish and snapper, 0.01 ppm, and 0.05 ppm, respectively). Mercury in hind was associated with fish weight; larger hind typically had higher concentrations of mercury. For the 104 fish samples collected from the marine areas near Vieques and from the commercial fish market, the average mercury level was 0.1 ppm and the range was nondetectable to 0.33 ppm. The mercury levels detected in Page | D- 12 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 Vieques reef fish are similar to levels reported by the FDA (FDA 2010). The mercury levels are in the low (0.02 0.2 ppm) to mid (0.2 0.6 ppm) mercury range identified by FDA in its recent risk and benefit assessment (FDA 2009). 01 E! 0049 ppm, which EPA developed for subsistence fishers41 (US EPA 2000) . Note that exceeding a screening level does not mean that harmful effects are possible but rather that a more detailed health evaluation is needed . ATSDR conducted this more detailed health evaluation by estimating the amount of mercury consumed using a range of daily fish intakes and body weights . This approach allowed ATSDR to evaluate the possibility of harmful effects for Viequenses who are occasional fish eaters as well as those who are frequent fish eaters . The Report did identify mercury exposure from frequent consumption of marine seafood as a potential public health hazard. Women with a varied fish diet who typically eat more than 2 oz of fish every day have estimated E! D. And as portion size increases, the estimated doses approach the lowest level known to cause harmful effects to a developing fetus. ATSDR concludes that if women who are pregnant consume more than 2 oz of fish daily , their developing babies have a small increased risk of neurological effects later in life. The risk of harmful effects increases as portion size increases. Possible harmful effects identified from studies of non-Viequense children exposed in utero involve language, attention, and memory, and, to a lesser extent, visual/spatial and motor functions. [Comment] 6. !D E! in Vieques. ATSDR Response: As stated earlier, ATSDR was able to review correspondence between the U.S. EPA and the Navy that does discuss the Discharge Monitoring Reports and the exceedances of D E DE permit. ATSDR reviewed a list of 126 effluent violations on Vieques that occurred between February 1994 and April 1999. Only one of the violations involved mercury. The violation for mercury was a reported value of 0.0014 mg/L, which is above the permitted 0.001 mg/L below the MCL of 0.002 mg/L .

In addition to global mercury contamination, for many years Vieques has had a significant additional source of mercury contamination: military activities. ATSDR, based on their fish sampling study, concluded that mercury in humans was most probably du e to GLOBAL mercury contamination: non sequitur ATSDR Response: ATSDR concluded mercury levels in fish in and around the LIA are most likely the result of the global reservoir of mercury circulating in the environment. This conclusion is supported by the low mercury levels in LIA soils, which appear to be at naturally occurring levels. Additionally, air modeling estimated that from the ordnance dropped on the LIA, less than 0.5 kg per year of mercury would have been emitted into the air . To provide perspective, ATSDR has added information from the mercury National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for allowable mercury air emissions from chlor-alkali plants . Developed in 1973 and last amended in 2000 by US EPA, this standard allows a chlor-alkali plant to release 2.3 kg of mercury daily into the atomosphere . Therefore, the annual estimated mercury emissions from high explosive ordnance in the LIA (less than 0.5 kg per year) can be compared with the NESHAP standard for chlor-alkali plants (844 kg per year). (See the Report, Chapter 1, Section 1.3.) [Comment] 8. ATSDR Educational document for the Viequenses cannot be followed by a highly educated human. a. ATSDR concludes that women of reproductive age in Vieques who eat 14 ounces of fish per week exceed the EPA reference dose of 0.1 microgram/kg/day (2 ounces per day). Thus, are exposing their fetuses to a neurologic disease. b. ATSDR recommended women of reproductive age in Vieques to consume up to 12 ounces of fish per week. (1.7 ounces per day). c. ATSDR does not know what the typical portion of fish per meal in Viequenses diet is, but assumed the portion is 4 ounces. d. ATSDR assumes that the typical human can establish the difference between 12 ounces and 14 ounces of fish per week OR between 1.7 ounces and 2 ounces portions of fish per day. e. There is no evidence that a highly educated human can follow these recommendations simply because the difference between healthy fish consumption and risky fish consumption is very close for Viequenses. Again, the margin of exposure is high for these susceptible groups (fetus and children). f. The FDA establishes a typical fish portion to be 6 ounces. Why use 4 ounces for Vieques? ATSDR Response: ATSDR agrees that much of this information is too technical for the public at large. Therefore, ATSDR has developed a fish consumption fact sheet that explains our findings, conclusions, and recommendations in plain language. The fact sheet also includes diagrams and pictures to help Viequenses understand the difference between risky and healthy fish consumption. We shared this fact sheet with the PRDOH. We are currently Page | D- 14 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 awaiting their input on how to make the ATSDR fact sheet more relevant and useful to Viequenses. ATSDR evaluated a range of age-specific meal portion sizes in the Report, including the 50th, 95th, and 99th percentiles. Table 2-6 shows the meal sizes for the various ages evaluated. Table 2A-1 shows the estimated doses, which were calculated on a continuous weight profile from 9.9 to 220 pounds and increasing meal size up to the 99th percentile (e.g., teenagers 15 to 18 years have a 99th percentile fish-meal portion of 20 ounces). This approach allowed ATSDR to evaluate the risk of harmful effects for Viequenses who are casual fish eaters as well as those with high fish consumption and to develop health messages for both groups . [Comment] 9. ATSDR analysis of mortality studies 1991-1998. the Puerto Rico Department of Health. Death certificates are completed by licensed physicians in Puerto Rico. No significant disease coding changes took place during the study period. Thus, there is no reason to believe that this data collection was biased during 1991- 1998. ATSDR Response: The Report does not claim that the data collection was biased due to changes in disease coding. The Report does point out, however, that the mortality data presented did not enumerate all causes of death only those that were elevated. [Comment] 10. Biological monitoring Again, as it has been the opinion of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Puerto Rico for the last 2.5 years, appropriate knowledge of all the exposures and strategic biological monitoring are critical for human risk evaluation. Disease prevention is the objective of public health. ATSDR 2011 conclusions about lack of human internal exposure to military contaminants in Vieques is not evidenced based. ATSDR Response : Because the Report found little evidence of exposure to contaminants from the site, a comprehensive biomonitoring program is not justified at this time. In addition, many chemicals are short-lived in the human body and thus cannot be measured through a biomonitoring program if the exposure occurred some time ago. Nevertheless, ATSDR is currently working with our partners in Puerto Rico to explore the value of conducting a targeted human biomonitoring program in Vieques. For example, residents are concerned about mercury exposure from eating local seafood . Therefore, measuring mercury in blood has public health value for Viequenses.

E E \u0011 D F ! for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) in draft form on December 8, 2011.1 As you know, I represent the 3.7 million residents of Puerto Rico, including the nearly 10,000 residents of Vieques, in the U.S. Congress. Since taking office in January 2009, I have met with the Director or Acting Director of ATSDR on five occasions to discuss the health and environmental issues addressed by the draft report. Specifically, I have met with Dr. Howard Frumkin on September 22, 2009 and October 22, 2009; with Dr. Henry Falk on February 4, 2010; and with you on December 14, 2010 and December 7, 2011. During our most recent meeting, you briefed me on the conclusions and recommendations in the draft report. Upon receiving that briefing, I expressed concerns related to both process and substance. Now that I have had a chance to study the draft report more closely, I would like to elaborate on those concerns and to make six specific recommendations. At the outset, it is important to make two points clear. First, my objective in providing comments on the draft report is to propose a path forward that will enable the federal government to fulfill its obligations to the people of Vieques American citizens who were asked by the federal authorities to sacrifice a critical, are intended to be constructive. The people of Vieques do not benefit one iota from attacks on ATSDR, the Navy or any other federal agency. What residents want and what they deserve is a realistic, evidence-based and fair-minded evaluation of the draft report that is designed to produce concrete action on the part of the federal government. Second, since ATSDR issued its draft report, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, in a 2-1 vote, dismissed the tort claims that had been filed by over 7,000 residents of Vieques against the U.S. government. 2 exercises conducted over the course of six decades. The appellate panel dismissed the case on procedural, not substantive, grounds, concluding that the plaintiffs did not have standing under the Federal Tort Claims Act to pursue damage claims against the U \u0011 F \u0012 adjudicated by a judge or jury. A trial would presumably have required the Navy to provide a comprehensive account of its training activities what weapons it used, where it used them, and for how long it used them. It would also have enabled both the plaintiffs and the defense to call scientific experts to testify about the prevalence of certain diseases on Vieques and the causal relationship between those diseases and past military training activities on the island. Page | D- 19 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 F \u0012 \u0012 the opportunity for residents of Vieques to establish facts and seek relief through the judicial system will be foreclosed. This means that the people of Vieques, and their elected leaders, have no alternative but to turn to the other two branches of their national government: the legislature and the executive. That explains why the First Circuit panel, at the close of its opinion, took the unusual but appropriate step of \u0012 On November 18, 2011, in anticipation of the release of the ATSDR report, I formally requested that the \u0012 significant land use, environmental and public health challenges facing the U.S. citizens of Vieques, 3 I intended to recommend to the Committee that it invite you or your designee to appear as a witness at this hearing, in order to provide testimony about the conclusions in the ATSDR report and to explain what action the agency intends to take or recommend that other federal agencies takegoing forward. !D performed since 1999 indicate that residents of Vieques have higher rates of cancer and other chronic illnesses than residents of mainland Puerto Rico. The principal questions that ATSDR seeks to answer in its report is whether there is evidence to show or suggest a causal relationship between these identified health problems and the military training exercises that were conducted on Vieques. The draft report is a re-evaluation of the conclusions reached by ATSDR in a series of public health assessments that the agency conducted on Vieques between 2001 and 2003. In those assessments, !D uld potentially have been exposed to training-related contaminants harmful to their health air, soil, fish and shellfish, and groundwater. ATSDR concluded that, although there were contaminants attributable to the training exercises in certain of those pathways, they were not at levels expected to cause adverse health effects. The methodology used by ATSDR and the conclusions reached by the agency in those public health assessments were subject to significant criticism in Puerto Rico, in sectors of the scientific community, and in Congress. In the draft report, ATSDR again examined these four pathways. It also examined a fifth pathway the consumption of produce and livestock grown on Vieques. Although there are some modest differences, the overarching conclusion reached by ATSDR in the draft report is essentially the same as the conclusion reached by the agency in its earlier public health assessments specifically, that the available scientific data does not establish or indicate that the contaminants in these pathways, certain of which can be linked to the military training activities, were at levels expected to cause the adverse health effects that residents of Vieques have been experiencing. However, as ATSDR repeatedly acknowledged throughout the draft report, this conclusion is by no means definitive or even close to it because the available scientific data upon which the agency relies is incomplete and insufficient in many respects. Page | D- 20 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 To its credit, ATSDR recommends in the draft report that further studies be conducted to fill in some of the identified data gaps so that more credible and reliable conclusions can be drawn, particularly in connection with the fish, local produce and livestock, and soil pathways. My fundamental criticism of the draft report is that the agency does not go nearly far enough. In a November 2009 release to the !D !D d biomonitoring to determine whether persons living on Vieques have been exposed to harmful chemicals, and, if so, at inconsistent with its November 2009 release and contrary to common sense, ATSDR states in the draft a targeted human 4 This recommendation is made despite the fact that ATSDR expressly acknowledges that the existing Vieques were exposed to past, military exercise-related constitue 5 I respectfully, but strongly, submit that this recommendation is inadequate. Given the reported health problems on Vieques, and the possible link between those problems and military training activities, such half-measures are misplaced. And it is certainly neither acceptable nor appropriate for ATSDR to suggest that such half-steps, if they are undertaken, ought to be conducted by local public health officials using primarily local funds. In light of the foregoing, my six recommendations are as follows: 1. I recommend that ATSDR adhere to the letter and spirit of its November 2009 release and propose a comprehensive biomonitoring effort to determine whether, and to what degree, residents of Vieques have been exposed to harmful chemicals linked to training activities. Unless that data is obtained, this entire exercise seems like a hollow one, designed to reach a pre-determined !D biomonitoring, I ask the agency to explain clearly why it does not believe this step to be justified and appropriate, and to explain why it has evidently reversed course from its November 2009 release. ATSDR Response : Because the Report found little evidence of exposure to contaminants from the site, a comprehensive biomonitoring program is not justified at this time. In addition, many chemicals are short-lived in the human body and thus cannot be measured through a biomonitoring program if the exposure occurred some time ago. Nevertheless, ATSDR is currently working with our partners in Puerto Rico to explore the value of conducting a targeted human biomonitoring program in Vieques. Because, for example, residents are concerned about mercury exposure from eating local seafood, a biomonitoring program to measure mercury in blood has public health value for Viequenses. [Comment] 2. !D identified with respect to the fish, local produce and livestock, and soil pathways. I urge that additional studies, to the extent they could be useful, be performed to fill any data gaps that have Page | D- 21 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 been identified in connection with the air and groundwater pathways. I fully understand that not all data gaps can be filled, but clearly some of them can and the federal government should take all reasonable steps to ensure that they are. ATSDR Response : Given our evaluation of the exposure pathways at the site, ATSDR has recommended a focused biomonitoring program in Vieques. If this biomonitoring program is undertaken with our partners in Puerto Rico, we would expect that concurrent sampling of soil, garden produce, and a food survey would occur. If the results from this focused biomonitoring program indicate, a more comprehensive biomonitoring program could be undertaken. If no additional biomonitoring program is undertaken, ATSDR could explore other possible ways to conduct further sampling, such as partnering with other federal agencies involved with environmental investigations in Vieques. [Comment] 3. In general, I recommend that ATSDR and other federal agencies take a far more active and assertive role in designing, implementing and especially funding the additional health and environmental studies that are needed to determine, to a reasonable degree of confidence, the precise nature and potential causes of the health problems being experienced by residents of Vieques. It is dismaying that, more than a decade after ATSDR completed its first public health assessments on Vieques, so residents remain unanswered. ATSDR Response : Because of limited resources, ATSDR seldom collects environmental samples at hazardous waste sites. For this reason, we rely on our federal and state partner agencies to collect these samples. We will continue to work with the Navy, U.S. EPA and any other agency who may collect environmental samples from Vieques. Selected Metropolitan/Micropolitan Area Risk Trends (SMART) is a part of the Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System (BRFSS) and is designed to gather health information from smaller geographic units. We have recommended that public health agencies assess the feasibility of using SMART BRFSS methods to identify prevalence estimates on asthma, diabetes, hypertension, and other chronic diseases. Implementing such a system for Vieques would provide very valuable information about the health status of Viequenses. In addition, we have offered to assist Puerto Rico health officials should they decide to conduct a biomonitoring program. ATSDR is willing to provide technical advice and laboratory support for the effort. [Comment] 4. Below, I quote at length from testimony provided by Dr. John Wargo, a Yale University professor, during a May 20, 2010 hearing held by the Subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight of the House Committee on Science and Technology. That testimony serves as an extensive, pathway- by\u00ad !D 2001 -2003 public health assessments on Vieques. Some of the shortcomings that Dr. Wargo identified in 2010 with respect to the public health assessments have Page | D- 22 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 been rectified in the 2011 draft report. For example, unlike the public health assessments, the draft report has been peer-reviewed6 pathway. However, based on my review, it also appears that many D criticisms and recommendations have not been addressed by the draft report. Therefore, I believe it would be helpful for ATSDR to include in its final report a section that explains whether, and to what extent, the report incor D ATSDR Response : During our November 2009 scientific consultation, Dr. Wargo met with ATSDR to discuss his concerns about Vieques. We considered them as we evaluated historical and new data on Vieques. We respond below with specific responses to his concerns. [Comment] 5. I urge ATSDR, as part of any broader response it furnishes to the criticisms and recommendations made by Dr. Wargo, to respond specifically to what I regard as one of Dr. !D previously prepared or data collected by others rather than designing new studies that are appropriate for local conditions and prob research on environmental contamination, human exposure, and disease prevalence, and flaws in any available studies leads them to conclude there is no credible evidence of a causal relation between hazard It would appear that this critique applies with equal force in the case of the draft report. Because it !D as the underlying work itself. By my count, 32 studies were analyzed by ATSDR in the draft report federal agencies: one by the Navy in 1978, one by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2001, and one by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in 2010. The Navy study and the EPA study are not, in fact, studies at all, but rather simply collections of sampling data of contaminant levels and thus were not peer-reviewed. And the NOAA study was not intended to !D 7 The 29 non-federal studies appear to be of uneven quality and rigor. While some tremendous work has been done by local researchers including Arturo Massol-Dey\u00e1, Elba D\u00edaz, Carmen Ortiz Roque, and researchers from the Puerto Rico Department of Health only four of the 29 studies were peer- reviewed and only three were published in scientific journals. In my view, this summary underscores the need for the federal government, working in partnership with experienced independent researchers, to assume a more prominent role in designing, implementing and funding additional studies on Vieques. ATSDR Response : ATSDR does not have the resources to conduct extensive site-related environmental investigations or human research. As such, we rely heavily on work prepared by other agencies and scientists. Also, CERCLA procedures require that the responsible party, the Navy Page | D- 23 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 in this case, pay for and conduct all investigations and remediation. The U.S. EPA oversees these activities. To ensure our conclusions are sound, we have made several recommendations about collecting more environmental and human data and are discussing these recommendations with our federal and commonwealth partners. To ensure that our evaluation of environmental and human data are sound, we gave the Report to six scientists for peer review and made numerous changes to the Report based on their comments . [Comment] 6. Finally, during a recent meeting in my office, Dr. James Porter, an Associate Dean at the Odum School of Ecology at the University of Georgia, provided me with a copy of an article that he co\u00ad E oxicological Effects of Naval Bombardment on the \u0012 60 -page piece was published in 2011 evidently not in time to be cited by ATSDR in its draft report as a chapter in G.E.

Since the concentration of explosive compounds is highest near unexploded ordnance, we recommend that !D provide information highly relevant to the fish and shellfish pathway. ATSDR Response : We have reviewed a copy of this article. It does not contain any new environmental data; it contains only the sample results already published by Dr. Porter, reviewed by ATSDR, and discussed in the Report. Consequently, we have made no changes to the Report as a D 2011 [Comment] To ensure optimal inter-agency attention and coordination, I am providing a copy of this letter to key F including its (former and current) co\u00ad chairs and its representatives from the Department of Health and Human Services, the Environmental !

It seems evident that ATSDR cannot resolve the outstanding questions on its own, given the 9 Instead, a broader federal government-wide approach is necessary. If the Administration believes it requires additional funding or authority from Congress in order to timely implement the recommendations I have made, I urge the Administration to seek such funding and authority via an amendment to its budget request for Fiscal Year 2013. I, in turn, pledge that I will do everything within my power, working with my allies in the House and Senate, to provide the Administration with what it needs. To place my recommendations in context, some background information is useful. Page | D- 24 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 10 In the 1940s, the federal government expropriated lands on the eastern and western portions of Vi eques for use by the Navy, and residents of those areas who remained on Vieques were required to relocate to the central portion of the island. The Navy established the Vieques Naval Training Range is eastern Vieques, which consisted of two facilities: (1) the Atlantic Fleet Weapons Training Facility, which was used for ship- to-shore and aerial bombing exercises, and comprised a Live Impact Area and a Secondary Impact Area, and (2) the Eastern Maneuver Area, which was used primarily for ground-based training involving smaller munitions. The Navy also established the Naval Ammunition Support Detachment in western Vieques to store munitions used in its training in eastern Vieques and to dispose of obsolete or damaged munitions. The Navy reported that it had dropped between three million and four million pounds of ordnance on Vieques each year between 1983 and 1998. \u0012 F In the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 (P.L. 106-398), Congress directed the Navy to close its facilities in western Vieques and to transfer approximately 4,000 acres of that property to the Municipality of Vieques, approximately 3,100 acres to the Department of the Interior, and approximately 800 acres to the Puerto Rico Conservation Trust. In the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 (P.L. 107-107), Congress authorized the Navy to close its training facilities in eastern Vieques if equivalent training facilities were available elsewhere and directed the Navy, upon closure, to transfer administration of the roughly 15,000 acres of that property to the Department of the Interior. In January 2003, the Navy certified to Congress that alternative training sites had been identified and confirmed that training operations would cease on Vieques by May 2003. The Ongoing Cleanup Effort on Vieques The Navy continues to be responsible for administering and funding the cleanup of munitions and contamination that resulted from its past activities on Vieques, subject to oversight by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Puerto Rico Environmental Quality Board, an agency of the Puerto Rico government. As of April 2011, over 35,000 munitions had been recovered and destroyed on Vieques, including at least 19,000 live munitions. Through the end of the Fiscal Year 2010, the Navy had spent a total of $142.4 million to support the cleanup of its former facilities on Vieques, and estimated that an additional $380.6 million would be needed from Fiscal Year 2011 onward to complete all planned cleanup actions. ATSDR Public Health Assessments on Vieques ( 2001- 2003) 11 Between 2001 and 2003, ATSDR conducted a series of public health assessments on Vieques. ATSDR ex amined four pathways through which residents of Vieques could have been exposed to contaminants harmful to their health: (1) air, (2) soil, (3) consumption of fish and shellfish, and (4) groundwater. !D ! island residents through any of these four pathways. This finding indicates that, while there may be the potential for exposure to a contaminant, such exposure is not likely to occur at a level that would cause adverse health effects, based on acceptable levels of exposure established by public health standards Page | D- 25 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 for individual contaminants. This finding does not confirm or deny the existence of certain health effects within a population, but rather indicates that the potential for human exposure to the contaminants examined does not appear to be the cause of any reported health effects. The air pathway has been a chief concern among the public because the residential population in the central portion of Vieques is located downwind of the former Live Impact Area on the eastern end of the !D data on the emissions that were released during training exercises over several decades. Given the absence of data on actual historical exposures through the air, ATSDR evaluated this pathway through the use of air quality modeling data that is, by attempting to estimate past emissions based on more limited, recent sampling. Utilizing this methodology, ATSDR concluded: Residents of Vieques have military training exercises. However, the estimated exposures are lower than levels known to be associated with harmful health effects. Airborne dust and contaminants released during tra ining activities at the former Live Impact Area disperse to extremely low levels before reaching the residents of Vieques. The soil pathway has also been a source of concern to residents of Vieques. This pathway is related to air and been deposited into the soil. However, ATSDR concluded: Touching or incidentally ingesting the soil on Vieques would not cause harmful health effects. Training activities have elevated the levels of some metals in the soil on the former Live Impact Area. However, the levels are too low to be of health concern. The safety of fish and shellfish regularly consumed by residents of Vieques has been an additional concern. The marine environment could have been contaminated by the leaching of chemicals from munitions that landed in underwater areas or from contaminated storm water runoff from the training range into the sea. This, in turn, could have contaminated edible fish and shellfish species and resulted in harmful exposure through human consumption. However, ATSDR concluded: It is safe to eat seafood from the coastal waters and near-shore lands on Vieques, including fish and shellfish from areas north and south of the former Live Impact Area. Several metals were detected in fish and shellfish collected around Vieques. However, the metal concentrations were too low to be of health concern, even if a person ate fish or shellfish every day for 70 years. Explosive compounds were not detected in any of the edible fish and shellfish that were sampled from Vieques. Finally, residents of Vieques have expressed concer !D ! 1999 Page | D- 26 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 portion of the island. In addition, the groundwater beneath the residential portion of the island has not been used as a primary source of drinking water on Vieques since 1978, because of increased saltwater intrusion within the aquifer. Instead, residents receive their drinking water primarily from the public water supply that is piped from mainland Puerto Rico. ATSDR evaluated the results of a sampling of the public water supply and concluded: A few public and private groundwater wells still exist in the residential portion of the island and are occasionally used when the public water supply is interrupted. Water from these wells was safe to drink, with the exception of one private well that contained water contaminated with nitrates and nitrites (most likely originating from agricultural sources or nearby septic systems, !D ! !D not only among island residents who believe that the health Vieques, but also among a number of independent (that is, non-federal) researchers who have studied environmental contamination on Vieques. Those researchers have asserted that the contaminant levels are higher in some cases than ATSDR reported, and that the potential health hazards are therefore likely to be greater overall than ATSDR concluded.

The only chemical we found that was a public health concern was mercury in fish. And this mercury is likely from the global reservoir of mercury circulating in the environment not from military activities on the island.

Even though site access is restricted, sampling at the LIA by independent parties has occurred: Researchers from Casa Pueblo and the University of Puerto Rico sampled vegetation from the LIA in 2000 (Massol Dey\u00e1 and D\u00edaz 2000). Page | D- 30 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 Servicios Cient\u00edficos y T\u00e9cnicos, Inc. collected soil samples during the protest from May 1999 to April 2000 (Garc\u00eda et al. 2000). ATSDR/EPA collected fish and shellfish from on and around the LIA in July 2001. NOAA collected land crabs and fiddler crabs from the LIA in June 2005 (Ridolfi and NOAA 2005). The data ATSDR evaluated are available to any scientist who wishes to review them.

ATSDR concluded that \"...the measured concentrations from this sampling effort are of an unknown quality, because no documentation can be found describing the sampling methods used or the quality assurance measures taken.\" It is unfortunate that further documentation is not available f or this sampling effort that did not find unusually elevated air concentrations of particulate matter. However, in our experience, it is not uncommon to find incomplete documentation for sampling that occurred 30 years ago. On a related note, ATSDR made numerous attempts to acquire documentation for air sampling that the Puerto Rico Environmental Quality Board (PREQB) had conducted on Vieques in the 1970s; to date no documentation of that study has been provided to ATSDR. After investing considerable effort trying to locate and evaluate past air sampling events at Vieques, ATSDR eventually concluded that \"no sampling programs extensively characterized air quality on Vieques during live bombing exercises.\" After making this conclusion, ATSDR had to make a decision regarding how to evaluate past air pollution levels. All live bombing exercises on Vieques had ceased by the time ATSDR became involved with the site. Therefore, it was impossible to conduct a new sampling study that would somehow quantify past air pollution levels. Because sampling was not an option, ATSDR's primary choices for assessing past air pollution levels were to either: (1) use models to estimate what air pollution levels might have been or (2) state that no data are available and conclude that the past air pollution levels could not be determined. ATSDR chose to pursue the modeling option in the interest of communicating scientific findings to the residents of Vieques. All air modeling evaluations have inherent uncertainties and limitations, and this was acknowledged throughout the 2003 Air PHA. However, for multiple reasons cited in the 2003 Air PHA, ATSDR believes that assumptions made in the modeling are conservative (protective) and typically erred on the side of overstating emissions and hence exposures, especially for metals and Page | D- 31 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 explosives. ATSDR thoroughly considered these uncertainties and the magnitude of the estimated air concentrations (which were several orders of magnitude lower than concentrations of health concern for most pollutants) before concluding that the modeling analysis presented a reasonable account of exposures that occurred on Vieques and did not understate the exposures that residents might have experienced. The Report carefully evaluates all assumptions and inputs into the previous modeling analysis and concludes the following: \"We reviewed the data on airborne contaminants from military exercises at the former Vieques Naval Training Facility. This review confirmed our previous findings and indicated that airborne contaminants from past military operations were very unlikely to have had health effects on Viequenses.\" For more information on this, refer to the 2003 Air PHA and Chapter 6 of the Report. A recent Gioda et.al. (2007) study examined particulate matter (PM), specifically PM 10, and metals concentrations from air samples for several Puerto Rican locations, including Vieques. This study makes some chemical-specific data available. Most of the metals analyzed in the Gioda et al. samples (cadmium, cobalt, copper, iron, nickel, lead, and vanadium) were well below their applicable health comparison values and do not represent a public health hazard. For more information about this topic see Chapter 6, Section 6.2.3 of the Report. [Comment] !D associated with military operations.

ATSDR Response : ATSDR reviewed all the soil sampling done on the LIA. The results show very few instances of contamination above background levels (see the Report, Chapter 1, Section 1.3.3). Air modeling results indicate that only small amounts of military activity-related contaminants could have migrated to the residential areas. Further, sampling for explosives was conducted along the western border of the EMA in 1999, and none were detected (CH2MHILL and Baker 1999). ATSDR has recommended collection of soil and produce samples from residential areas to confirm that these areas were not affected.

ATSDR, however, has identified mercury exposure from frequent consumption of marine seafood as a potential public health hazard. Our conclusions and recommendations about eating fish from Vieques reefs are presented in Chapter 2 and in the Executive Summary . We could find no relationship between mercury in fish and military operations on Vieques. A more plausible explanation for the mercury levels found in fish is that they resulted from the global reservoir of mercury circulating through the environment.

ATSDR Response : As previously mentioned, ATSDR is currently working with our partners in Puerto Rico to explore the possibility of a targeted human biomonitoring program in Vieques. ATSDR has also recommended that health officials consider a SMART BRFSS to determine the prevalence of various health conditions in Vieques. ATSDR evaluated the quality and stated limitations of each data source in the Report.

Page | D- 37 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 Commenter 3 [Comment] I'm commenting on the ATSDR draft document on Vieques, PR, and in particular on the concerns raised over mercury exposure to humans and fauna living on and around Vieques. Despite the considerable concern expressed by individuals and agencies over allegedly elevated levels of mercury on Vieques, and the several hypotheses as to the source of these elevated mercury levels, there appears to be a glaring omission of a likely source of direct exposure to elemental m ercury in the homes of inhabitants of Vieques, as well as to the larger terrestrial and aquatic environments. Many Puerto Ricans put elemental mercury in a wide variety of magico-religious uses, in particular within the religions of Espiritismo and Santeria. The generic belief behind this use is that mercury (azogue, asoque, mercurio ) attracts good and repels evil. Many of these esoteric uses expose mercury to indoor air, most problematically the practice of sprinkling mercury on the floors of homes. This mercury will remain in flooring for periods of several decades, while outgassing developmentally neurotoxic levels of mercury vapor. All of the mercury put to these occult domestic uses eventually enters the larger terrestrial and aquatic environments. Over the past two decades I have alerted EPA Region 2 about this issue, both here at their New York City headquarters, as well as their offices in Puerto Rico . I have also alerted numerous Puerto Rican health and environmental authorities and universities. Yet none of them have undertaken any substantive research to assess the levels of mercury in housing or botanicas in Puerto Rico. The only research on the topic that I am aware of was done by Dr. Nunez-Molina of the University of Mayaguez (attached) in the early 1990s. The Puerto Rico Department of Consumer Affairs made a (vain?) attempt at banning the importation and distribution of mercury for sale by botanicas in 1991. 1. What have the ATSDR and the Puerto Rican medical and environmental establishments done to assess magico-religious mercury use, and the domestic and environmental contamination it causes? ATSDR Response : Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA, also known as Superfund), Congress provided ATSDR with the authority to conduct certain public health assessment activities. Note, please, that CERCLA provides ATSD R with the authority to evaluate residential exposure to environmental contaminants released from hazardous waste sites or facilities under a variety of exposure scenarios. These scenarios include potential exposure to contaminants that may be brought into the home by infiltration with the ambient air, attached with soil particles on shoes, or attached to worker clothing. But CERCLA does not provide ATSDR with the authority to evaluate potential residential exposure to hazardous substances that residents choose to bring into their homes. Page | D- 39 An Evaluation of Environmental, Biological, and Health Data from the Island of Vieques (Final Release ) March 2013 That said, ATSDR recognizes the potential health effects of exposure to harmful levels of mercury vapor that residents may experience due to magico-religious uses of mercury (e.g., from the use of mercury-containing capsules) . ATSDR also recognizes that the level of residential exposure to mercury vapor resulting from magico-religious use is not well quantified. Additional research could provide valuable information on this important topic. Again, CERCLA does not provide ATS DR with the authority to conduct the fundamental research necessary to quantify this type of exposure. We suggest that the commenter contact health and environmental officials in Puerto Rico to determine what if any activities they have conducted concerning the magico-religious use of !D (http:// www.atsdr.cdc.gov/mercury/ ) contains a public service announcement ( Don't Mess With Mercury ) and four informational fact sheets in both English and Spanish, as well as several other important resources that might be useful for the commenter . [Comment] 2. Why does the document in question fail to even mention this certain source of direct human exposure to elemental mercury, and even more certain environmental mercury contamination? ATSDR Response : As pointed out by the commenter, some practitioners of certain Caribbean and Latin American religions, such as Voodoo, Santeria, Palo, and Espiritismo, use mercury ceremonially [USEPA Ozuah 1996]. Ceremonial uses of mercury include applying it to the skin, adding it to candles, or sprinkling it around the home. These practices can potentially expose practitioners and their families. Because mercury contamination in the home can persist for years, ceremonial use of mercury in the home could expose future occupants and their children, contributing to health disparities in these populations. We have added religious rites using mercury-containing capsules that release mercury to the home environment as a possible source of mercury in some residents. [Comment] 3. Why the concern of trivial amounts of mercury on uninhabited bombing ranges, yet no concern over gross domestic mercury contamination of housing with mean weights of some 9 grams of elemental mercury intentionally sprinkled on floors of Puerto Rican homes? The report as drafted needs to be amended to address the mercury input from the magico-religious use of mercury in Vieques. ATSDR Response D !D concerns that mercury in bombs may have contaminated the Vieques environment and resulted in military activity-related mercury. In response to these concerns, t he Report documents the review of environmental, biological, and health data. We have amended the Report to show that religious rites using mercury-containing capsules also may be a source of mercury exposure in Vieques.

I also very much dislike that the Navy bombed there and then you let the Navy, hardly an independent source, do the tests on the pollution they left behind. I do not think the US public can trust this report. What possessed the authorities to let the same people who bombed the island report on the pollution left behind? Fact is the Navy and US military have left pollution all over this world and all over America. The pollution left behind at military installations is always enough to kill you. This report is bogus. It needs to be done again by an independent lab - ATSDR Response: This site followed the procedures used for all U.S.-owned Superfund sites . While the owner of or responsible party for the site, the Navy in this case, pays for and conducts all investigative and remedial work, their work is overseen by the US EPA . In doing the Report, ATSDR used studies prepared by many other independent scientists, groups, and agencies in addition to reports prepared by the Navy. Page | D- 43 "}
