TXH's trailing twelve-month earnings (from 31 December 2017) of UK\u00a3730.00k has declined by -19.60% compared to the previous year. Furthermore, this one-year growth rate has been lower than its average earnings growth rate over the past 5 years of -1.49%, indicating the rate at which TXH is growing has slowed down. Why is this? Well, let's look at what's transpiring with margins and if the entire industry is experiencing the hit as well. Revenue growth over the last few years, has been positive, however earnings growth has been deteriorating. This suggest that Tex Holdings has been growing expenses, which is harming margins and earnings, and is not a sustainable practice. Viewing growth from a sector-level, the UK machinery industry has been growing its average earnings by double-digit 29.16% in the prior twelve months, and a flatter -0.39% over the past five years. This shows that, in the recent industry expansion, Tex Holdings has not been able to leverage it as much as its average peer. In terms of returns from investment, Tex Holdings has not invested its equity funds well, leading to a 6.86% return on equity (ROE), below the sensible minimum of 20%. Furthermore, its return on assets (ROA) of 3.43% is below the GB Machinery industry of 7.10%, indicating Tex Holdings's are utilized less efficiently. And finally, its return on capital (ROC), which also accounts for Tex Holdings's debt level, has declined over the past 3 years from 9.07% to 8.88%. What does this mean? While past data is useful, it doesn't tell the whole story. Generally companies that endure a prolonged period of decline in earnings are going through some sort of reinvestment phase in order to keep up with the recent industry growth and disruption.
