Id. 440 Southern California Interdisciplinary Law Journal [Vol. 21:437 Patients like Campbell's son and newborn Mackenzie were relying on herd immunity, the principle that if a significant portion of the community \u2014for most diseases, more than 80 percent \u2014is vaccinated, those who cannot be vaccinated will be protected from illness by the community members who are vaccinated because the vaccine has eliminated \"chains of contagion.\"20 Parents and guardians (hereinafter referred to as \"parents\") who choose not to vaccinate their chil dren create two potential problems: (1) If their child becomes infected because he or she is not vaccinated, the child can expose vulnerable community members to a vaccine -preventable illness; (2) A cluster of unvaccinated people undermines herd immunity, creating the risk that disease will spread, so that even an uninfected unvaccinated child \"exposes\" others through the failure to vaccinate. At the heart of the argument for vaccination is that community members cannot identify a potential source of infect ion. This means that going to a hospital, a movie theater, or a shopping mall becomes a game of Russian roulette unless the community has herd immunity. As increasing numbers of parents across the United States are taking advantage of their state's philoso phical and religious exemptions from statutes mandating childhood vaccines, the risk to the health of their communities is growing. Not only are these parents undermining herd immunity, putting the entire community's health at risk, but their actions also are raising health care costs, since preventing illnesses through vaccination is substantially more cost -effective than treating the illnesses.21 It costs approximately sixteen times more to treat vaccine -preventable illnesses than to vaccinate for them.22 For instance, \"[f]or every $1 on DTaP,23 $27 are saved.24 As a result of non -vaccination, each year in the 20.

Calandrillo, supra note 21. 2012] Protecting the Herd 441 U.S. thousands of adults contract vaccine -preventable diseases that cost $10 billion to treat and that produce 30,000 preventable deaths.25 Granting philosophical and religious exemptions becomes problematic when it begins to undermine a community's herd immunity. For polio, 80 percent of the community must be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity,26 while measles requires above a 95 percent vaccination level in school settings.27 Parents have many reasons for not vaccinating their children, ranging from religious objections to concerns about the potential adverse consequences of the va ccines. This latter point has received a great deal of attention in recent years despite scientific evidence that such concerns are largely exaggerated.28 But perhaps the greatest reason parents do not vaccinate their children is that there is little incent ive to do so since it is possible to \"free ride\" on the herd immunity that arises from others' vaccinations. Yet the individual decision to rely on herd immunity, which imposes no direct cost to the parents or their children, undermines herd immunity, pote ntially hurting other community members. Bombarded by media coverage of the \"vaccine controversy,\" it seems a rational choice to \"protect\" one's child by not immunizing him or her. In order to counteract the negative externality that arises from the refusa l to vaccinate one's child, states should impose a tax on parents who do not vaccinate their children and use the funds generated by the tax to pay treatment costs of patients who contract vaccine -preventable illnesses; contribute to the Vaccines for Child ren Program, which \"offers vaccines at no cost for eligible children\" ;29 and improve education about vaccinations.

II. PUBLIC HEALTH FOUNDA TIONS: THE STATE'S P OWER TO MANDATE VACCINATION In the early twentieth century the Supreme Court established in Jacobson v. Massachusetts that reasonable public health regulations could restrict an individual's liberty when the community's health is at risk.30 This created the foundation for public health intervention and mandatory vaccination statutes. When Reverend Henning Jacobson challenged the constitutionality of a fine for not complying with the City of Cambridge' s mandatory smallpox vaccination, the Court held that Massachusetts's mandatory vaccination regulation was reasonable in light of recent smallpox outbreaks and that the protection of public health was within the state's police power;31 therefore, the city c ould restrict Jacobson's liberty to 30. See generally Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11 (1905). 31. The police power can be defined as the \"inherent authority of the state . . . to enact laws and promulgate regulations to protect, preserve, and promote the health, s afety, morals, and general welfare of the people.\" LAWRENCE O. GOSTIN , PUBLIC HEALTH LAW: POWER , DUTY, RESTRAINT expanded 2d ed. 2008) [hereinafter GOSTIN , POWER , DUTY, RESTRAINT ]. Additionally, \"the state retains the power to restrict, with in federal and state constitutional limits, private interests.\" Id. at 92 2012] Protecting the Herd 443 determine whether or not to receive immunization.32 In the words of Justice John Harlan, \"the liberty secured by the Constitution . . . does not import an absolute right in each person to be, at all times and in all circu mstances, wholly freed from restraint.\"33 The Court held that people are subject to \"manifold restraints\" necessary for \"the common good.\"34 Further, the Court used a \"social -compact theory,\" in which citizens, by virtue of living in a community and enjoying its benefits and protections, owe duties to the community and its citizens.35 Thus, the Court established that a state could restrict individual liberty when it is necessary for the public's health or safety, as long as the law is not \"arbitrary or oppress ive,\" and the means have a \"'real or substantial relation' to their goal.\"36 Further, the Court in Jacobson established that regulations do not need to be based on universally held beliefs.37 The Court held that \"[t]he possibility that the belief may be wrong, and that science may yet show it to be wrong, is not conclusive; for the legislature has the right to pass laws which, according to the common belief of the people, are adapted to preven t the spread of contagious diseases.\"38 Thus, even a regulation that faces some controversy about its scientific validity still is regarded as \"a reasonable and proper exercise of the police power.\"39 The Court built upon this foundation by establishing that states may overrule parents when the public's interest is at stake, further fortifying the case for mandatory childhood vaccinations, even against a parent's wishes.

Massachusetts established that the right of parents to determine how to raise their children \"is not absolute,\"44 further supporting the states' ability to mandate vaccination.45 The Court held that although \"the custody, care and nurture of the child reside first in the parents . . . the family itself is not beyond regulation in the public interest.\"46 Therefore, the pa rent cannot keep the state from regulating parental decisions just because the decision involves the exercise of religion.47 The Court held, \"[a]cting to guard the general interest in youth's well being, the state as parens patriae may restrict the parent's control by requiring school attendance, regulating or prohibiting the child's labor, and in many other ways.\"48 Despite myriad developments in constitutional law, the Court continues to rely on the tenets of Jacobson in evaluating public health interventio ns.49 Additionally, \"federal and state courts . . . have repeatedly affirmed [ Jacobson 's] holding.\"50 The Court also has not accorded bodily integrity the status of a fundamental right, so it applies a balancing test 41.

AN ECONOMICS -BASED EXPLANATION OF FEAR OF VACCINES AND FALLING VACCINATION RATES A. NEGATIVE EXTERNALITIES : THE EFFECTS OF FAILURE TO VACCINATE In vaccination \"externalities arise from the concept of 'herd immunity' where any given individual's chances of getting an infectious disease fall when others in the society are immune because of previous vaccinations.\"53 Parents who opt out of vaccinating their children create negative externalities by threatening herd immunity. If herd immunity is lost, then the community is no longer protected from disease. This means that vulnerable community members bear the burden of th e negative externality because they are now at risk for disease.54 The costs to each individual include costs of treatment, loss of health or life, and lost wages.55 The costs to society are the costs of containing an epidemic, including surveillance, notifi cation, and quarantine costs, as well as lost productivity of community members and costs of treatment not borne by patients. 56 Although there are more than forty vaccines available, the smallpox vaccine is the only one to have effectively eradicated its t arget disease.57 Typically, as a disease fades away, demand for the vaccine decreases and 51.

ECON. 69, 70 (1991) ( \"[T]he possibility of contagion from the unvaccinated population represents a negative externality in itself\"). 54. Of course those who choose to be unvaccinated also are at -risk for vaccine - preventable illnesses; however, they are simply bearing the cost of the decision not to vaccinate, not the negative externality, which by definition is imposed on a third -party. 55. See Amy A. Parker et al., Implications of a 2005 Measles Outbreak in Indiana for Sustained Elimination of Measles in the United States , 355 NEW ENG. J. MED. 447, 447, 454 (2006). 56. See id. 57.

REV. 222, 222 (1997). 446 Southern California Interdisciplinary Law Journal [Vol. 21:437 then the disease returns.58 Parents choosing not to vaccinate their children play a substantial role in this cycle. 1. Failure to Vaccinate Undermines Herd Immunity The ma in negative externality of not vaccinating is that it undermines herd immunity; herd immunity is based on the fact that \"any given individual's chances of getting an infectious disease fall when others in society are immune because of previous vaccinations .\"59 Herd immunity is crucial to protecting individuals from vaccine -preventable illness. If enough people in a community are vaccinated, their collective immunity eliminates the chains of contagion so vulnerable community members are protected from disease by the rest of the community.60 For most diseases, vaccination rates of 85 percent to 95 percent are necessary for herd immunity.61 Although there has not been a substantial dip in national immunization rates, pockets of low vaccine rates have developed in certain areas, threatening the herd immunity in those communities.62 \"[A]s exemptions proliferate, disease 'hot spots' are cropping up across the United States where large pockets of children have not received many or any of their mandatory immunizations.\"63 In the past thirty years, personal exemptions have risen from 0.5 percent to 2 percent of people in the United States.64 For example, Washington had a 6 percent rate of non -medical exemptions in 2006 -2007, but within counties, the exemption rate varied fro m 1.2 percent to 26.9 percent.65 In California, most of those who gain exemptions do so through a personal belief exemption.66 For example, at Sebastopol 58.

Loss of Herd Immunity Puts Community Members at Risk Loss of herd immunity puts two main groups at risk: (1) vulnerable community members and (2) those who are purposely not vaccinated. Both groups are relying on herd immunity to protect them. Vulnerable community members rely on herd immunity because they, themselves, cannot be vaccinated. Infants, for instance, \"may be exposed to life-threatening illnesses\" before they can be immunized.74 Of the sixty - four cases of measles that occurred in the U.S. betwee n January 2008 and April 2008, thirteen of those cases were in children too young to be vaccinated.75 In fact, children who are too young to be immunized or who cannot be immunized tend to be \"more susceptible to the complications of 67.

Thus, herd immunity is important even for peo ple who have been vaccinated. Those who are purposely not vaccinated also rely on herd immunity to protect them from vaccine -preventable illnesses, so if herd immunity wanes, they are no longer protected. 3. Failure to Vaccinate Endangers the Unvaccinated Chi ld An additional problem with not vaccinating is that it also puts the unvaccinated child at risk.

Case Study: Per tussis Demonstrates Danger Posed by Pockets of Exemptors One vaccine -preventable illness, pertussis, has experienced a recent rise in cases,90 illustrating the negative effects of allowing herd immunity to falter. The pertussis vaccine is effective only 80 percent of the time,91 so herd immunity is particularly important to protect people for whom the vaccine is not effective. In addition, immunity wanes across time so the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (\"CDC\") recommend a booster shot at ages ele ven or twelve and again every ten years.92 Pertussis is currently a concern for public health officials because of increasing numbers of reported cases.93 There were reports of more than 27,000 pertussis cases in the U.S in 2010.94 Pertussis incidence \"has be en increasing since 2007,\" and \"continues to remain higher than in the 1990s.\"95 Moreover, some states have seen a particular rise in cases. In California, for instance, the number of cases reported to the state's department of public health in the first h alf of 2010 increased 418 percent from the previous year96 and included ten infant deaths.97 Eighty -nine percent of the cases were among infants younger than six months, who were too young to be full vaccinated.98 Overall in 2010, there were 9143 reported cases of pertussis in California, which was \"the most cases reported in 63 years.\"99 Furthermore, as of September 2011, the state had a 90.

In 2008 public health officials in Joseph County, which encompasses South Bend, had reported concern about the state's low vaccination rates106 because nearly 30 percent of children in Indiana were undervaccinated before they reached three years of age.107 In 2010 Indiana experienced its highest rate of pertussis \"since the 1950s,\" with 500 cases reported as of November 2010 and two infant deaths, including Callie Grace.108 100.

Almost as soon as Dr. Edward Jenner developed his smallpox vaccination in the late eighteenth century,109 people viewed it with distrust.110 When the Supreme Court decided the seminal vaccination case Jacobson ,111 the public was engaged in a lively debate about smallpox immunization.112 Anti-vaccinationists termed mandatory vaccination \"the greatest crime of the age,\" and claimed it \"slaughter[s] tens of thousands of innocent children.\"113 Resistance to vaccination was so strong in the late nineteenth century in England that Parliament passed a statute giving an exemption to a parent who could prove that \"he conscientiously believes that vaccination would be prejudicial to the heal th of the child.\"114 In the United States, however, \"[o]pposition to childhood vaccines simmered mostly on the fringes\"115 until 1998 when The Lancet , a well - respected British medical journal, published a study by A.J. Wakefield linking autism to the MMR immunization.116 The study turned out to be \"an elaborate fraud\" and twelve years later The Lancet retracted the study, but in the interim the public perception of vaccine safety was gravely damaged.117 In fact, a 2000 survey showed that more than two -thirds o f 109.

Also, people naturally tend to overestimate the risk of \"low probability but high tragedy events,\" such as a severe adverse reaction to a vaccine, and tend to underestimate the ris k of more common events, such as car accidents or contracting influenza.138 The media adds to parents' misperception of risk because it tends to cover the risks of vaccines much more than the risks of vaccine -preventable illness or the benefits of immunizati ons, making it difficult for parents to 137.

Game theory attempts to capture individual behavior in situations \u2014games \u2014in which the individual's payoff depends on the choices o f the other player. ROBERT COOTER & THOMAS ULEN, LAW & ECONOMICS 38-39 (5th ed. 2008). A prisoner's dilemma demonstrates why two people will not cooperate with one another. Cf. Chris T. Bauch, Alison P. Galvani & David J.D. Earn, Group Interest Versus Self -Interest in Smallpox Vaccination Policy , 100 PNAS 10564, 10564 (2003). In the prisoner's dilemma scenario, two people, prisoner A and prisoner B have been arrested for burglary. DAVID HEMENWAY , 2012] Protecting the Herd 459 situations in which individuals' decisions depend on other people's decisions.156 Vaccination is this type of decision. Vaccinating entails some risk, since there can be adverse reactions to the vaccine. It also provides reward, since vaccinating protects f rom disease. Viewing vaccinations through the lens of game theory, assume a world in which there are only two people: Player 1 and Player 2, each of whom must make a decision about whether or not to vaccinate for one disease, polio, with one vaccine. The r elative payoffs associated with each individual player's decision to vaccinate (or not vaccinate) for polio are shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 : The Decision to V accinate The payoffs in Figure 1 represent the total net payoff to each individual from his or her decision about whether to vaccinate for polio. These payoffs also incorporate an appropriate failure rate for the vaccine, which, PRICES AND CHOICES : MICROECONOMIC VIGNETTES 252 (rev. ed. 198 4). The district attorney tells each that they can either testify against the other or not, leading to four possible outcomes. Id.

Given these payoffs and the inability for the prisoners to coordinate with each other, each has a dominant strategy to cooperate with the prosecution (defect) because irrespective of what the other prisoner does, each will maximize his individual payoff by testifying (defecti ng).

HEMENWAY , supra note 155, at 252 -53. 460 Southern California Interdisciplinary Law Journal [Vol. 21:437 applied equally to both players, wou ld not affect the nature of the prisoner 's dilemma.157 In a world with just two participants, each player prefers to achieve the outcome in which he or she does not vaccinate, while the other player vaccinates.158 The player prefers this because the player who did not vaccinate is protected from polio, but has not risked any adverse outcomes from the vaccination.159 This payoff, \"T,\" represents each player 's temptation not to vaccinate. The temptation payoff is higher relative to other payoffs because the player who achieves this payoff enjoys herd immunity (everyone else in the world is vaccinated) , without incurring any risks of an adverse reaction to vaccination. On the other hand, each player 's least preferred outcome is to singularly vaccinate when the other player chooses not to vaccinate. Here, the player who vaccinated incurs the costs of an adverse reaction to the vaccine, as well as the possibility of a vaccine failure, without protection from the other player (although he or she does receive protection f rom the vaccination ). This payoff is represented by \"L\" for loss. In between the high and low payoffs of T and L are the outcomes in which both players have either chosen to vaccinate or not vaccinate (represented by \"C\" for cooperation and \"MD\" for mutual defection, respectively). When both players choose to vaccinate, their individual payoffs fall between T and L because each gains the benefit of both the vaccine and herd immunity , but each also incurs the cost of a risked adverse reaction to the vaccine. Thus, the payoff for C is greater than L , but less than T. When both players choose not to vaccinate, they lose the benefit of herd immunity, but each also avoids any adverse reaction to the vaccine. Thus, the payoff for mutual defection, MD, is also grea ter than L and less than T.160 Assuming the benefit of herd immunity (everyone else being vaccinated) combined with the benefit of a successful vaccine is greater than the risk of an adverse reaction combined with the risk of 157. In the United States, polio vaccination is 99 percent effective after three doses.

See HEMENWAY , supra note 155, at 7-8. 159. See id. 160. Arguably L should be greater than MD because the vaccinated player still achieves benefit from the vacc ine's protection. However, I am analyzing the game in the context of vaccine fear in the post -Wakefield study era, in which parents believe vaccines are dangerous and vaccine -preventable diseases are unlikely to occur. 2012] Protecting the Herd 461 vaccine failure, then the net pa yoff for C must be greater than the net payoff for MD. Given these relative payoffs , T > C > MD > L, it is a dominant strategy for each player to forgo vaccination. The strategy is dominant because it holds regardless of how the other player chooses to res pond.161 If Player 1 knew with certainty that Player 2 was going to opt out of vaccination, then it would be in Player 1 's best interest to similarly forgo vaccination, in which case he or she would receive the value MD, which is greater than the value L. On the other hand, if Player 1 knew with certainty that Player 2 was going to receive the vaccination, it would similarly be in Player 1 's best interest to opt out of vaccination, in which case he or she would receive the value T, which is greater than the v alue MD. It is important to note that although forgoing the vaccination is a dominant strategy for both players individually, it creates a loss among the players jointly. The combined value of both forgoing vaccination (six) is significantly less than the combined value of both players receiving the vaccination (ten). In fact, with vaccination, the perceived risk of vaccination lowers the perceived payoff of vaccination.162 \"In many cases, because of the success of the vaccination program itself, certain dise ases are rarely seen, and hence individuals tend not to vaccinate because of a low perceived risk. \"163 Then, media coverage of vaccination risks cause s individuals to view the risk of vaccination as higher than the risk presented by the disease.164 In England in the 1970s, concerns about the safety of the pertussis vaccine led to so many people refusing the vaccine that herd immunity dropped and there were \"relatively large pertussis outbreaks. \"165 Therefore, in the absence of something that increases the payoffs associated with vaccination, \"persistently high levels of immunization will be difficult to maintain in countries with voluntary vaccination policies. \"166 However, \"if certain payoffs could be worsened , the outcome of rational individual istic behavior can b e improved \" and the prisoner 's 161.

A tax decreases the value of T and, if set at an effective level, leads each player to vaccinate.168 \"Interestingly, [the players] are more li kely to reach the preferred outcome . . . if certain payoffs are made worse. \"169 In Figure 2 below, assuming the tax on not vaccinating is high enough to affect the player 's choice, the payoff to not vaccinating has decreased. Figure 2 : The Decision to Vaccinate in the Context of a T ax Thus, instituting a tax on not vaccinating is one way to change the assessment of payoffs and encourage high levels of vaccination. E. THE TRAGEDY OF THE COMMONS : RESISTANCE AT A COMMUNITY LEVEL Applied at a group level, refusal to vaccinate is an instance of \"the tragedy of the commons. \"170 In the tragedy of the commons, each individual seeks to maximize his or her gain and, in doing so, exhausts the 167. See HEMENWAY , supra note 155, at 8. 168. See id. at 138. 169. Id. at 253. 170.

This is because the marginal benefit of vaccinating has dropped close to zero since herd immunity has already been established. Thus, as demonstrated above by the prisoner 's dilemma, the dominan t strategy is to not vaccinate. \"Unfortunately, this triggers a classic collective action problem: increasing numbers o f free -riders undermine society 's ability to achieve a critical mass of people who are vaccinated. \"174 As more individuals act in their rational best interest, herd immunit y fails and infectious disease epidemics strike the community.175 Legislation mandating immunization for school attendance seeks to overcome the tragedy of the commons.176 However, religious and philosophical exemptions undermine this solution. Just as the rat ional choice was to forgo vaccination in the absence of a mandate, the rational choice now becomes to obtain a religious or philosophical exemption. Moreover, because parents are typically making the decisions about 171. Id. at 1244 (1968). Hardin describes a pasture open to and shared by all herdsmen. Id.

The choices individuals make \"depend on preferences, the costs associated with alternati ve options, and the decision maker 's opportunity set.\"177 To combat the free -rider, tragedy -of-the-commons problem in immunization, states must create a cost to opting out of vaccinations , so that immunization is the rational choice because it is less costly . Imposing a financial cost is an effective way of changing behavior. For example, after the price of cigarette packs increased 43.5 cents in 1998, smoking rates fell \"13 percent among youths and by 5 percent among adults. \"178 Similarly , increasing alcohol 's price 10 percent results in a 5.5 percent decrease in the likelihood that a person \"is a current drinker. \"179 Likewise, \"deductibles and cost sharing can be used to influence how much [health] care people consume. \"180 The RAND Health Insurance Experiment181 showed that when consumers have a substantial deductible, total dollars s pent on health care is about 30 percent less than when the consumers receive free care.182 Thus, to impose a cost on opting out of immunizing one 's children, the government should create a tax on immunization exemptions. 177.

PIGOVIAN TAXES AND VACCINATION Economist Arthur Pigou theorized that when there are negative externalities, taxation could change consumer choice , thereby eliminating the negativ e externalities.183 \"The effect of the tax . . . is to confront the generator of the externality with a price reflecting the damage \" that he or she is imposing on other community members.184 \"[T]o internalize externalities, a civil authority should impose a marginal tax on the offending party set equal to the marginal damage imposed by the offense. \"185 For instance, \"taxation of alcohol and cigarettes is often justified on the grounds that consumption of these unhealthy products creates externalities [such as i ncreased health care costs] unaccounted for in the untaxed price of a good. \"186 Thus, either the state or the federal government should institute a tax to account for the negative externality imposed by the failure to immunize. Parents will pay the tax for e ach year the child is unvaccinated until the child reaches the age of eighteen. The tax should be limited to those vaccinations for infectious diseases currently recommended by the CDC, as delineated in Table 2 below. 183.

Using Marginal Social Harm to Set the Tax Level For a tax on any activity or good to be ef ficient it must take care of the negative externality produced by that good or activity.188 For example, \"if alcohol prices do not reflect the full social costs of consumption (including the external costs), then consumers will drink too much, in the technic al 187.

Note that the chart above does not include recommended vaccinations for high -risk groups. 188. Willard G. Manning et al., The Taxes of Sin: Do Smokers and Drinkers Pay Their Way? , 261 J. AM. MED. ASS'N 1604, 1604 (1989). 2012] Protecting the Herd 467 sense that at the margin their drinks will be worth less to them than they cost.\"189 One study estimated that in the late 1980s the external cost per ounce of alcohol consumed was forty -eight cents, which included the \"lifetime [] discounted costs \" imposed on others \"through collectively financed health insurance, pensions, disability insurance, group life insurance, fires, motor -vehicle accidents, and the criminal justice system. \"190 The study 's authors contend that excise taxes should distinguish between internal costs \u2014those borne only by the person engaged in the activity \u2014and external costs \u2014those borne by other people \u2014 and consider the \"lifetime costs \" of the activity.191 In the context of vaccin ations, using the marginal social harm to set the tax is problematic because as more people become vaccinated and herd immunity increases, the marginal social harm of someone opting out of vaccination decreases to nearly zero. Thus, according to a stric t economic interpretation, 100 percent vaccination is not optimal because the very last people who receive vaccines would be better off accepting the temptation value of defection.192 Further, those who would not receive vaccinations unless made mandatory \"are clearly made worse off \" because they are forced to engage in an activity that they do not value, and arguably, at the margin, being vaccinated provides little to no additional benefit to the community because there already are enough vaccinated people to a chieve herd immunity.193 There are still, however, benefit s to having that last community member vaccinated. Those who cannot be vaccinated or may have vaccine failure could contract a vaccine -preventable illness from that person if he or she contracts a vac cine-preventable disease through travel, for instance. That person could then infect those vulnerable to vaccine -preventable illness. Economist Dagobert Brito and colleagues explain this as follows: In this case of a fifty -fifty chance that the vaccine wil l work, requiring vaccination f or all improves social welfare . . . . [I]n the case of imperfect vaccinations the public goods element remains part of the problem. Half of 189. Philip J. Cook & Michael J.

In fact, later studies argued that Manning and colleagues had produced too low an estimated cost because they failed to include such external costs as nonfat al highway injuries.

Id. at 1695. 468 Southern California Interdisciplinary Law Journal [Vol. 21:437 the vaccinated individuals are affected by the aggregate level of vaccination. Hence some individuals who would be vaccinated under the market allocation are better off as a result of compulsory vaccination since more people are vaccinated. Intuitively, a fifty -fifty chance for all is better than such a chance for those who choose vaccinat ion plus a greater chance of infection for the unvaccinated population.194 Thus, having 100 percent vaccination levels is beneficial for certain individuals. Establishing the exact marginal social cost of not vaccinating is beyond the scope of this Note. How ever, in establishing our tax, the full external costs of vaccine -preventable illnesses should be taken into account. When looking at the marginal cost of not vaccinating, policymakers should at least consider the following: the costs of treatment, contain ing the disease, additional vaccinations, adverse outcomes including death, and missed time from school and work.195 One study estimated that the cost of just containing the 2005 measles outbreak in Indiana was $167,685.196 Assuming a world in which measles is the only infection and using the numbers from the 2008 outbreak in Indiana, we can approximate the lower bound of an efficient tax level. If the total cost of the outbreak was $176,980, which included the cost of quarantining exposed children, cost of con tainment, and cost of treatment, then $2424 would be needed per unvaccinated child to cover the full cost of the disease.197 Although calculating the most effective tax level is beyond the scope of this Note, this methodology and figure provides an approxima tion of a minimum tax level based on the outbreak of one disease. The potential for additional outbreaks from other diseases would likely increase this figure. However, the logical extension of our measles example is that one could set the tax at $2000 per child per year without incurring a net loss to society from collecting taxes that might exceed the cost of the externality. 2. Using Willingness -to-Pay to Set the Tax Level Alternatively, policymakers could set the tax by determining the lowest tax that would induce people to vaccinate. Motivations surrounding vaccinations are complex because individual vaccination decisions are 194. Brito, Sheshinski & Intriligator, supra note 53, at 84 -85. 195. See Sandra W. Roush, Trudy V. Murphy & Vaccine -Preventable Disease Table Working Group, Historical Comparisons of Morbidity and Mortality for Vaccine - Preventable Diseases in the United States , 298 J. AM. MED. ASS'N 2155, 2155 (2007). 196. Parker et al., supra at 447, 454. 197. Sugerman et al., supra note 9, at 751. 2012] Protecting the Herd 469 \"prevalence elastic, \" meaning that as the preva lence of a disease rises, so does demand for vaccination.198 Looking at the incidence of measles over 1984-1990 in the United States, economist Tomas Philipson found th at \"the prevalence of measles in . . . [a] state of residence reduces the age in months at which the first measles vaccination occurs. \"199 Conversely, in communities with a high level of vaccination, the individual marginal benefit of vaccinating is low ; however, once there is a disease outbreak in a given community, the marginal benefit of vacci nating increases.200 Therefore, determining the tax level that will induce a parent to vaccinate is dependent on the prevalence of vaccine -preventable illnesses in his or her region. This, in turn, is dependent on the number of other parents who are opting o ut of vaccination for their children. Thus, in areas with fewer exemptors , a tax would likely need to be set at a higher level than in areas with many exemptors and a higher prevalence of illness. However, differentiating among communities creates unneeded complexities. Instead, policymakers should determine the willingness -to-pay of a parent in an area with few other exemptors and set the tax at that level for all areas. 3. Scaling the Tax Based on Vaccination and Income Level The tax also should be scaled ba sed on how many vaccinations parents choose not to give their child. This scale is meant to encourage vaccination at whatever level possible. If the tax was simply a blanket tax whether parents vaccinated for one or all of the illnesses, this could create a perverse incentive for a parent who wanted to opt out of just one vaccination to then decide to opt out of all of them. Pigovian taxes are regressive, so critics may argue that the vaccine - refusal tax would impose an unfairly heavier burden on people wit h lower incomes. By taxing everyone equally, parents with lower incomes would pay the same as those with higher incomes, so the wealthier person would pay a smaller percentage of his or her income.201 We could account for this disproportion , however, by adju sting for wealth so that lower income parents would pay a lower tax for not vaccinating. If we decide to institute 198. Tomas Philipson, Private Vaccination and Public Health: An Empirical Examination for U.S . Measles HUM. note 20, at 1695.

CONSTITUTIONALITY OF A FEDERAL TAX A federal tax would be the most effective approach to increasing vaccination rates because with a state tax people could move to a state that had not instituted the tax simply to avoid the tax. People moving to avoid a state tax would cause larger pockets of unvacci nated people in certain regions, further weakening herd immunity. While a federal tax could strengthen vaccination, it also could face serious constitutional challenges. The federal government derives its taxing power from Article 1, Section 8 , Clause 1 of the Constitution, which states : \"Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and E xcises. \"202 The Court has held that \"Congress 's power to tax is extremely broad. \"203 Edward Kleinbard, a tax scholar, notes that \"the Constitution can best be understood as contemplating that the principal remedy for harsh, oppressive, or stupid tax legislation is to vote the rascals out. \"204 The constraints that the Constitution places on Congress 's power to tax are that direct taxes must be apportioned a mong the states205 and must be \"in Proportion to the Census or Enumeration. \"206 Thus, the Court nearly always upholds the federal government 's power to tax.207 As Kleinbard points out,208 in McCray v. United States , the Court held that the judiciary does not have the power to negate Congress 's exercise of the taxing power even when \"the result of the enforcement of [the tax] might be to indirectly affect subjects not within the powers delegated to Congress. \"209 However, 202.

Doremus , the Court held that as long as there was a reasonable relation to the constitutional authority to tax, a tax \"cannot be invalidated because of the supposed motives which induced it. \"212 Further, in United States v. Butler ,213 the Court held that Congress has \"broad power to tax . . . for the general welfare \" as long as the tax \"does not violate other constitutional provisions. \"214 In fact, the federal government 's taxing power is typically used to regulate \"risk behavior and influence health - promoting activities. \"215 The Supreme Court has upheld a variety of federal taxes aimed at protecting society from unhealthy or dangerous activities, such as excise taxes on firearms, alcohol, and tobacco.216 Likewise, federal tax policy has sought to influence individual decisions t hat adversely affect public health, for instance through gasoline taxes to lower gasoline consumption.217 For example, t he Court has explicitly stated that \"a tax does not cease to be valid merely because it regulates, discourages, or even definitely deters the activities taxed. \"218 In fact, unless a tax requires \"behavior conformance extraneous to any tax need, \" courts will likely uphold a federal tax as long as it is not violating other provisions of the Constitution.219 There is, however, a vigorous debate amo ng scholars about whether Congress could use the taxing power to encroach upon a power specifically reserved to the states.

Vaccine -Refusal Tax Is Not an Indirect Tax or a Direct Tax Law professor Steve Willis and Nakku Chung , a graduate of the Levin College of Law, define excise taxes as taxes that tend to be imposed on activities, property use, or property transfer and that usually \"may be passed on to another, such as a customer. \"232 Under this definition, it would be difficult to define the va ccine -refusal tax as an excise tax because the cost of vaccinating is difficult to pass on, vaccinating is likely not the sale of a good, and not vaccinating is even further removed from the sale of a good. Nor is a vaccine -refusal tax likely a direct tax. Article 1, Section 9 , Clause 4 of the Constitution requires that direct taxes be apportioned among the states by population,233 unless the direct tax is an income tax, in which case it is exempt from the apportionment requirement under the Sixteenth Amendme nt.234 Thus, the vaccine -refusal tax is not a direct tax because it does not make sense to apportion it by state population.235 231.

Vaccine -Refusal Tax Would be Defined as an Income Tax The vaccine -refusal tax could be structured so that it is based on income, sim ilar to the way the individual mandate in the PPACA is structured.236 A parent would be required to pay a certain amount based on income down to a certain income level , and a parent below that income level would pay a nominal amount. If a parent could demons trate that he or she has vaccinated their child, the parent would be excused from the tax. Whether or not this argument works , however, will depend on whether the PPACA is seen as an income tax. Galle contends that it is an income tax because \"whether a fa mily pays $695 or some other amount depends on the household 's income . . . . [and] the obligation to pay the minimum $695 tax is subject to exemptions for personal hardship, which are also determined with reference to income. \"237 The federal government contends that : [The PPACA] a mends the Internal Revenue Code to provide that a non - exempt individual who fails to maintain the minimum level of insurance shall pay a monthly penalty, calculated by reference to the taxpayer 's household income, included with the taxpayer 's tax return, and assessed and collected in the same manner as other penalties imposed under the Internal Revenue Code . . . . The practical operation of the provision is as a tax.238 But, Erik Jensen, another tax scholar, argues that it is not a n income tax.239 He notes that although calculations of income are needed to compute the amount of the penalty, the cap on liability means it affects people in different income brackets in the same way; therefore, it is not an income tax.240 Kleinbard, however , contends : On its face, [the PPACA] functions as an income tax. It is a section of the Internal Revenue Code. Low -income taxpayers are exempt . . . the amount collected is measured as a percentage of income . . .

A Tax Versus a Penalty In addition, the vaccine -refusal tax may be seen as a penalty rather than a tax, in which case the federal government would need to use another enumerated power to institute it. Again, this is dependent on whethe r the PPACA is viewed as a tax. For example, s ome scholars argue that the PPACA is indeed a penalty, not a tax: \"If the individual mandate works perfectly, everyone will be incentivized to acquire insurance, no penalties will be paid, and government revenues will not be directly increased at all. \"242 Thus, they conclude that the statute does not have a \"taxing purpose \" and therefore \"has no independent reason for existence, \" so it is a penalty, not a tax.243 Other scholars have contended that it certainly is a tax.244 In addition to arguments about why it qualifies as an income tax discussed above, they contend that it does not matter whether or not Congress labeled it a tax.245 A group of one hundred law professors fr om universities across the United States wrote an open letter in which they argued that the \"penalty \" is a tax: \"[T]he Supreme Court has expressly held that a law amounts to a tax for constitutional purposes if it raises revenue. As the Court explained, th e only concern is a law 's 'practical application, not its definition or the precise form of descriptive words which may be applied to it. '\"246 However, as of February 2012, there was no clear resolution to the debate about whether or not the PPACA is a tax. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit upheld the law , but declined to determine whether the individual mandate was a legitimate use of Congress 's taxing power.247 In contrast, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that 241.

'\"249 Further, the court noted that there is a legal distinction between taxes and penalties , and that Congress has specifically enacted taxes in the Act in provisions other than the individual mandate.250 In addition, the court noted that Congress pointed to the Commerce Clause as its source of its power for enacting the law: \"The very nature of congressional findings about the individual mandate further amplifies that Congress designed and intended to design a penalty for the failure to comply and not a tax. \" 251 In fact, the Eleventh Circuit held that Congress 's tax power \"does not provide an alternative constitutional basis for upholding this unprecedented individual mandate. \"252 Meanwhile, the Fourth Circuit held that Virginia lacked standing because the individua l mandate \"imposes no obligation on the sole plaintiff, Virginia, \"253 so the court remanded the case \"with instructions to dismiss. \"254 In another case challenging the individual mandate, the Fourth Circuit may have given a boost to the argument that the indiv idual mandate is a tax.255 The court dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because the \"suit constitutes a pre -enforcement action seeking to restrain the assessment of a tax.\"256 The court held that the Anti -Injunction Act ( \"AIA\") meant the court did not have jur isdiction to hear the case.257 The AIA provides that \"no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court by any person, whether or not such person is the person against whom such tax was assessed. \"258 The Fourth Circuit noted that \"the term 'tax' in the AIA reaches any exaction imposed 248.

C. ARGUMENT FOR INSTITUTING STATE TAXES ON T HE USE OF VACCINE EXEMPTIONS A state 's power to institute taxes is limited by its constitution.261 When taxing a state resident engaged in an activity that takes place entirely within a state, the federal constitution does not typically limit the state 's taxing powers.262 Further, immunization policy has traditionally been part of states ' police powers,263 so a state tax on immunization does not raise federal pre -emption issues.264 Finally, taxing the decision not to vaccinate is a legitimate public health activity . In fact, at issue in Jacobson was Jacobson 's refusal to pay the five -dollar fine that the city imposed for not complying with the smallpox vaccination.265 Thus, the case that established the foundation for mandatory vaccination,266 also established the found ation for taxing those who do not comply with mandatory vaccination.267 Therefore, each state can impose a tax o n parents who opt 259.

For the tax to be truly effective all states must institute it. Otherwise, people who wish to avoid the tax and still not vaccinate their children could simply move to another state. Since vaccine -preventable illnesses can cross state lines, failure by some states to participate in instituting the tax could markedly undermine the program \u2014for example, if parents who refused to vaccinate congregated in states without the tax it could create even greater pockets of unvaccinated people and substantially lower herd immunity. D. SUBSIDY FOR VACCINATION COMPLIANCE Alternatively, the government \u2014most likely the state governments for the reasons previously discussed \u2014could provide a subsidy for those parents who vaccinate their children. A subsidy can influence behavior if it is set at a level high enough to change parents ' evaluation of the payoffs of vaccination. Returning to our prisoner 's dilemma analysis, the subsidy lowers T, the value of temptation to not vaccinate.268 Assuming we have correctly calculated t he level of tax, we should set the subsidy equivalent to the tax. Subsidies can be a politically easier intervention to enact because rather than \"punishing \" people for not vaccinating, they are \"rewarding \" those who do vaccinate. Subsidies , however, can b e less effective than taxes because of \"loss aversion \": people value a loss more highly than they value a gain.269 Even though the parents who choose not to vaccinate would be forgoing the same amount of money under a subsid y as they would a tax, they may value that loss less and not know they are losing money . The government would need to ensure taxpayers knew they were forgoing a subsidy by choosing not to vaccinate. A substantial difficulty with the subsidy is identifying the source of the funds. A combina tion of a tax and a subsidy could help alleviate this problem, such as taxing those who do not vaccinate and using that money to provide a subsidy. However, there would be many more people who would receive the subsidy than would receive the tax because va ccination levels are high in most communities.270 Therefore, unless the subsidy was set at a much lower level than the tax, the government would still need to 268. See HEMENWAY , supra note 155, at 252 -53. supra note 270. See supra Part III.C. 2012] Protecting the Herd 479 identify a source of funds for the subsidy, which would likely be problematic. Moreover, because va ccination rates are so high, using a subsidy to lower the numbers of exemptors is too broad an action. Most people do not need an additional incentive to vaccinate. Therefore, providing a subsidy at a level that would induce behavior change would likely to be too costly to be rational or effective. Instead, a tax better targets and penalizes the few people who choose not to vaccinate by forcing them to pay, thereby associating a financial loss with their decision. E. NO RELIGIOUS EXEMPTION TO THE TAX Under the vaccine -refusal tax, there should be an exemption for children who cannot be vaccinated because of a medical condition, as determined by a physician. However, there should not be a religious or philosophical exemption to the tax. When the public 's health is at risk, it is legitimate to differentiate between the clinical opinion of a trained medical professional that a child 's health is endangered by vaccination and the philosophical or religious belief of a parent that the child should not be vaccinated. T he Supreme Court has held that the free exercise of religion does not allow people exemption from laws that protect the public 's health, such as those mandating vaccination.271 In Employment Division v. Smith , a group of Native Americans challenged an Oregon law prohibiting the use of peyote under the Free Exercise Clause.272 The Supreme Court stated , \"We have never held that an individual 's religious beliefs excuse him from compliance with an otherwise valid law. \"273 Additionally , the Court explained that the \"right of free exercise does not relieve an individual of the obligation to comply with a 'valid and neutral law of general applicability on the ground that the law proscribes (or prescribes) conduct 271. See e.g. , Emp't Div., Dep't of Human Res. of Or. v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990) (holdin g that a law banning peyote use did not violate the First Amendment) , superseded by statute , Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA), 114 Stat. 803, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000cc et seq., as recognized in Sossamon v. Texas, 131 S. Ct. 1651 (2011) . 272. See id. at 874. Chemerinsky explains the Smith decision: \"[N]o matter how much a law burdens religious practices, it is constitutional under Smith so long as it does not single out religious behavior for punishment and was not motivated b y a desire to interfere with religion.\" CHEMERINSKY , supra note 44, at 1248. 273. 494 U.S. at 878-79. 480 Southern California Interdisciplinary Law Journal [Vol. 21:437 that his religion prescribes (or proscribes). '\"274 Subseque ntly, the Court applied Smith in Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v . City of Hialeah , in which the Court examined a city ordinance restricting cruelty to animals, as challenged by a particular religious group that engaged in animal sacrifice in its re ligious practice.275 The Court held that \"a law that is neutral and of general applicability need not be justified by a compelling government interest even if the law has the incidental effect of burdening a particular religious practice. \"276 Although the majo rity of states offer religious exemptions to mandatory immunization statutes,277 a decision by the Mississippi Supreme Court suggests that they likely do not need to offer an exemption for their immunization statute to be constitutional.278 Therefore, taxing t hose who opt for a religious or philosophical exemption would likely not be unconstitutional. In fact, states did not widely begin offering religious exemptions from vaccination until the 1970s when the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act of 1974279 and regulations adopted by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, the precursor of HHS, \"conditioned federal funding upon passage of such [religious] exemptions. \"280 Although this mandate has since been repealed,281 forty -eight states continue to offer religious exemption s to mandatory vaccination.282 Mississippi and West 274.

A 2002 Arkansas district court case demonstrates how some other courts view religious exemptions from vaccinations.289 In that case, Boone v. Boozman ,290 a mother challenged an Arkansas statute that required mandatory immun ization for school attendance, but provided an exemption if \"immunization conflict[ed] with the religious tenets and practices of a recognized church or religious deno mination. \"291 The court found that the statute discriminated against a \"nondenominational, nonsectarian individual with a sincerely held individual religious belief, or churches and religious denominations that do not have explicit policies on immunization but may 283.

Because courts have struck down segments of statutes that require the religious belief to be part of a generally accepted or organized religion,299 states should only use a \"sincerely held \" religious belief requirement as a way to screen out those people who are merely using the religious exemption to avoid vaccination.

F. ARGUMENTS AGAINST PIGOVIAN TAXES One of the primary arguments against a Pigovian tax on not vaccinating is that it interferes with l iberty. Many anti -vaccinationists argue that mandatory vaccine laws impinge both on bodily integrity and parental rights. 1. Bodily Integrity Some commentators have written that the argument against Pigovian tax policies \"supposes that the values of liberty a nd autonomy should take precedence in policy -making decisions over other values, such as increased public health and general welfare, and any increase in paternalistic policy making involves a reciprocal decrease in autonomy. \"301 As Jacobson established, the U.S. actually values the protection of public health over an individual 's absolute right to autonomous decision -making.302 The Supreme Court has ruled that \"some liberties are so important that they are deemed to be 'fundamental rights, '\" and the government cannot infringe upon those rights unless the regulation at issue meets the test for strict scrutiny.303 Although \"[t]he Court has found a constitutionally protected liberty interest in bodily integrity . . . it has yet to hold that such an interest is 'fundamental. '\"304 Instead of heightened scrutiny, the Court applies rational basis review .305 \"Laws that restrict nonfundamental liberty 300. See Silverman, supra note 41, at 286 -89.

Rogers , for example, the Court assume d for the discussion that an individual has a lib erty interest in avoiding forced administration of anti-psychotic medicine , but then also recognize d that competing state interests might outweigh that liberty interest.308 Such a competing state interest could include the protection of the public 's health. Similarly, in Washington v. Harper , the Court held that when a person with a \"serious mental illness \" poses a danger to others, medical treatment can be imposed.309 In Cruzan v. Director of the Missouri Department of Health , the Court recognized that \"determining that a person has a 'liberty interest ' under the Due Process Clause does not end the inquiry; whether respondent 's constitutional rights have been violated must be determined by balancing his liberty interests against the relevant state interes ts.\"310 The Court has been \"highly permissive of public health regulation \" under rational basis review ,311 and \"[t]he police power represents a classically adequate justification [for public health regulation] unde r substantive due process. \"312 The government, t herefore, can burden an individual 's liberty when working to protect the health or safety of the community.313 For instance, in Wisconsin v.

Nebraska defined parenting rights as a fundamental right.315 Similarly, in Pierce v. Society of Sisters the Supreme C ourt stated that the child is \"not the mere creature of the state. \"316 Nevertheless, the Court has also recognized limits to parents ' rights to make decisions about their children. As previously discussed, in Prince v. Massachusetts , the Court upheld the application of child labor laws even though they limited a parent 's freedom to make decisions for her children and freely exercise her religion.317 The Court noted that \"the family itself is not beyond r egulation in the public interest. \"318 Because parental rights are fundamental, however, courts use strict scrutiny to examine legislation that burdens them.319 In applying strict scrutiny, the Court examines whether the right is infringed upon by the government action, whether that infringeme nt is justified by a compelling government interest, and whether the means are narrowly tailored to the legislation 's goal.320 Here, our vaccine exemption tax is justified by a compelling government interest, which is upholding herd immunity and protecting vulnerable community members from vaccine -preventable illnesses . Protecting the public 's health has traditionally been a purpose sufficient for burdening individual liberty.321 Our goal is to account for the negative externality created by vaccine exemptions by taxing those exemptions. This tax is narrowly tailored because it specifically targets the people creating the negative externality. Thus, this is a legitimate and constitutionally - permissible public health intervention. 315. Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 399 -402 (1923). See also CHEMERINSKY , supra note 44, at 809.

And, if it is right to impose a financial cost, then why allow the exemption? These critics err in presuming that a person with a valid religious or philosophical objection to vaccination necessarily values that objection more than the cost that the objection and the associated refusal to vaccinate impose on society. If at least some exemptors value their belief against vaccination less than the cost imposed on society, then the justification for an outright exemption is significantly weakened, since it would only reduce social welfare. An appropriately set tax, one that roughly covers the marginal social harm of refusing to vaccinate, can be viewed as a conditional exemption: one that specifically exempts from vaccination only those who value their religious or philosophical objections m ore than the harm imposed on society. Those who value their exemption less than the cost imposed on society will simply choose to vaccinate and these choices will be consistent with social welfare. Rather than a tax on belief, this is a tax on creating a negative externality. Regardless of whether it is for religious, philosophical, or convenience reasons, the decision to opt out of vaccination creates negative externalities, so that decision is taxed. Of course, there is always a danger that the tax may b e set too low or too high, so that some exemptors will pay too much or too little relative to the costs of their objection to society. But this critique applies equally to both those who favor a tax and those who favor exemptions, as the latter are merely advocating a tax set at zero. Likewise, not having any exemption can be viewed as an infinitely high tax. The optimal outcome is, more likely, somewhere in between. Finally, other critics may argue that taxing those who do not vaccinate could increase host ility toward the government, public health efforts, and vaccination , since the government would be burdening parents ' ability to opt out of vaccination.323 Making parents feel that they have no choice might actually make parents even more resistant to vaccin ation. However, 322. Discussion with Ale xander Capron, Scott H. Bice Chair in Healthcare Law, Policy, and Ethics, and Professor of Law and Medicine, University of Southern California Gould School of Law, in L.A., CA (Mar. 29, 2011). 323. See Silverman, supra note 41, at 293. 2012] Protecting the Herd 487 given the rise of pockets of exemptors , which undermines herd immunity and threatens the public 's health, and the increase in vaccine -preventable diseases such as pertussis, the government needs to ensure that as few people as possible are taking exemptions. As explained in Part III, the tax ensures that parents feel the true cost of taking an exemption so they will not avoid vaccination lightly.324 Moreover, it also emphasizes the seriousness of taking an exemption, so that those taking an ex emption do not do so simply out of convenience. V. USING THE TAX REVENU E TO INCREASE VACCIN ATION To connect the tax closely to the revenue generated, the revenue should be used to pay for the treatment of children who contract vaccine - preventable illnesses, t he community 's costs of containing an outbreak, free vaccination for lower -income children, and education about vaccination. Since the tax seeks to address the negative externality created by failure to vaccinate, the revenue of the tax primarily should be used to pay the treatment costs of children who contract vaccine -preventable illnesses , and to help pay the public health costs of containing a vaccine -preventable illness outbreak. For example , the measles outbreak in Indiana cost more than $100,000 in c ontainment and treatment costs.325 The tax revenue could help reduce these costs. A federal initiative, the Vaccines for Children Program, offers vaccinations at no cost to eligible children, including those who are uninsured, on Medicaid, or underinsured.326 As of 2005 this program covered immunization costs for more than 50 percent of children in the United States.327 Some of the revenue from the vaccine -refusal tax could be used to expand this program. Revenue should also be used to improve education about immunization. An important aspect of an education campaign is to better arm health care professionals and school administrators with information 324. See supra Part III. 325.

The goal should be to combat misinformation through a series of television advertisements, Internet advertisements, and the creation of additional websites that offer information about the benefits and risks of vaccination and the risks to the public 's health posed by forgoing vaccinations.332 For example, \"[p]erhaps the most practical way to help curb exemption abuse is to correct any misinformation about vaccinations so that fewer individuals will improperly seek exemption for this reason. Public informational campaigns can be u sed to this end. \"333 The education campaign also should provide educational literature to parents when they decide to opt out of vaccinating their children. The CDC 's National Immunization Program has, for instance, \"identified and refuted several common mis conceptions regarding vaccination, \" so the public education campaign should specifically target those ideas.334 328.

CONCLUSION Parents who opt out of vaccinating their children put everyone in the community at risk for contracting a vaccine -preventable illness. Thus, their decision to free ride on the community 's herd immunity creates a negative externality that threatens the community 's health. To ensure that parents internalize this externality, either the federal government or the states should institute a vac cine-refusal tax. The revenue from this tax should be used to pay the costs of treatment for people who contract vaccine - preventable illnesses and the community 's costs of containing the outbreak. The revenue also should be used to increase the funds avail able to pay for vaccines for low -income children and to create an education campaign to better educate clinicians and parents about immunization. cause ha rmful side effects and illnesses; and that vaccinations are no longer necessary in the United States because of the elimination of diseases.\" Id.
