The clinical information requi red is outlined as follows: o Date of birth o Indicate whether it was a live birth o Newborn's birth weight o Gestational age at birth o Apgar scores o Disposition at birth o Gender o Type of delivery : vaginal or Cesarean; if a Cesarean, the reason the Cesarean was required o Single/multi birth o Gravida/para/ab for mother o Estimated date of confinement (EDC) and if neonatal intensive care unit admission was required Providers may use the standard reporting form specific to their hospital as long as the required information outlined above is included. 2.15 PCP Auto Assignment Process for Members During enrollment, a member can choose his or her PCP. When a member doe s not choose a PCP at the time of enrollment or during auto -assignment , we will auto -assign a PCP within two business day s from the date we process the daily eligibility file from the state. Pregnant members should select a PCP for the child prior to the birth. If we receive notification of birth prior to discharge, we will auto -assign a PCP before discharge from the hospital or birthing center. There are two stages of auto -assignment logic for members who do not self -select a PCP: The first stage u ses ex isting algorithms to assess data , such as the distance of the PCP office from the member's home, languages spoken by provider and office staff, family link and prior relationship. Many providers receive an assignment of members based upon the first stage a ssignment logic. Healthy Blue Provider Manual 39 In the event there is more than one PCP meeting the first stage assignment logic for a member, the second stage will be activated. The second stage u ses a rating system that has two components : quality and efficiency. The member will be as signed to the provider with the higher quality and/or efficiency ratings. To find out your current quality and efficiency ratings, as well as how to improve these ratings, contact your local Provider Relationship Management representative . Members receive a Healthy Blue ID card that displays their PCP's name and phone number, in addition to other important plan contact information. Members may elect to change their PCP at any time by calling Healthy Blue Member Services. The requested changes will become effective the first day of the following month , and a new ID card will be issued. 2.16 Member ID Cards Healthy Blue member ID cards look similar to the following sample. These ID card s are separate from the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NC DHHS) ID card issued to the member by the state. 2.17 Member Missed Appointments At times, members may cancel or not attend necessary appointments and fail to reschedule, which can be detrimental to their health. You should attempt to contact any member who has not shown up for or canceled an appointment without rescheduling. Contact t he member by phone to: Educate him or her about the importance of keeping appointments . Encourage him or her to reschedule the appointment . Healthy Blue Provider Manual 40 For members who frequently cancel or fail to show up for appointments, call Healthy Blue Provider Services at 844-594-5072 to address the situation. Our goal is for members to recognize the importance of maintaining preventive health visits and adhere to a plan of care recommended by their PCPs. 2.18 Members Exhibiting Potential Noncompliance Reasonable efforts should always be made to establish a satisfactory Provider and Member relationship in accordance with practice standards. You (the provider) should provide adequate documentation in the Member's medical record to support his/her efforts to develop and maintain a satisfactory Provider and Member relationship. If a satisfactory relationship cannot be established or maintained, you should continue to provide medical care for the Member until such time notification is received from Healthy Blue stating that the Membe r has been transferred from the Provider's practice, and such transfer has occurred. Contact Healthy Blue Provider Services if you have an issue with a member regarding: Behavior Treatment cooperation Completion of treatment Continuously missed or rescheduled appointments We will contact the member to provide the education and counseling to address the situation and will report to you the outcome of any counseling efforts. 2.19 Members With Special Health Care Needs Adults and children with specia l health care needs include those members with mental health disorders , physical disabilit ies, complex chronic medical condition s, long -term services and support needs, or other circumstances that place their health and ability to fully function at risk, requiring individualized health care requirements.

The plan may, at its discretion, allow vulnerable populations (for example , persons with multiple disabilities or acute or chronic condit ions, as determined by the plan) to select their attending specialists as their PCP as long as the specialist is willing to perform responsibilities of a PCP. With the assistance of network providers, we will identify members who are at risk of or have special needs. Screening procedures for new members will include a review of hospital and pharmacy utilization. We will develop care plans with the member and his or her representatives that address the member's service requirements with respect to specialis t physician care, durable medical equipment, home health services, transportation, etc. The care management system is designed to ensure that all required services are furnished on a timely basis and that communication occurs between network and non -networ k providers, if applicable. We work to ensure a new member with complex/chronic conditions receives immediate transition planning. The transition plan will include the following: Review of existing care plans Preparation of a transition plan that ensures continual care during the transfer to the plan If a new member upon enrollment or a member upon diagnosis requires very complex, highly specialized health care services over a prolonged period of time, the member may receive care from a participating spec ialist or a participating specialty care center with expertise in treating the life -threatening disease or specialized condition. Training sessions and materials and after -hours protocols for a provider's staff will address members with special needs. Pr otocols must recognize that a nonurgent condition for an otherwise healthy member may indicate an urgent care need for a member with special needs.

Provider claim payment disputes are considered a grievance . If a provider disagrees with the outcome of a claim, you may begin the claim payment dispute process. The simplest way to define a claim payment dispute is when the claim is finalized, but you disagree with the outcome. Note there are three common, claim -related issues that are not considered claim payment disputes. To avoid confusion with claim payment disputes, they are defined briefly here: Claim inquiry: a question about a claim but not a request to change a claim payment . Healthy Blue Provider Manual 77 Claims correspondence : when Blue Cross NC requests further information to finalize a claim; typically includes medical records, itemized bills or information about other insurance a me mber may have . Clinical/medical necessity appeals : an appeal for a denied service; for these, a claim has not yet been submitted ( see Section 2.41 Provider Post Service Medical Necessity Appeals ). The claim payment dispute process consists of two steps. Providers will not be penalized for filing a claim payment dispute, and no action is require d by the member. Claim payment reconsideration : This is the first step in the claim payment dispute process. The reconsideration represents the initial request for an investigation into the outcome of the claim. Most issues are resolved at the claim payme nt reconsideration step. Claim payment appeal : This is the second step in the claim payment dispute process. If a provider disagrees with the outcome of the reconsideration, the provider may request an additional review as a claim payment appeal. A claim payment dispute may be submitted for one or multiple reason(s), including: Contractual payment issues Disagreements over reduced or zero -paid claims Claim coding edit issues Duplicate claim issues Retro -eligibility issues Claim data issues Timely filing issues We will consider reimbursement of a claim that has been denied due to failure to meet timely filing if the provider can do one of the following : 1.

Healthy Blue Provider Manual 78 Written: Mail all required documentation (see below for more details), including the Claim Payment Appe al Form or the Reconsideration Form to: Blue Cross NC | Healthy Blue Provider Grievance and Appeals P.O. Box 61599 Virginia Beach, VA 23466 -1599 Claim inquiries A question about a claim or claim payment is called an inquiry. Inquiries do not result in changes to claim payments, but the outcome of the claim inquiry may result in the initiation of the claim payment dispute. In other words, once you get the answer to your claim inquiry, you may opt to begin the claim payment dispute process. Our Provider Experience program helps you with claim inquiries. Just call 844-594-5072 and select the Claims prompt within our voice portal. We connect you with a dedicated reso urce team, called the Provider Service Unit (PSU), to ensure: Availability of helpful, knowledgeable representatives to assist you. Increased first -contact issue resolution rates. Significantly improved turnaround time of inquiry resolution. Increased outreach communication to keep you informed of your inquiry status.

Correspondence is when Blue Cross NC requires more information to finalize a claim. Typically, Blue Cross NC makes the request for this information through the EOP . The claim or part of the claim may, in fact, be denied, but it is only because more information is required to process the claim. Once the information is received, Blue Cross NC will use it to finalize the claim. 2.41 First Line of Defense Against Fraud We are committed to protecting the integrity of our health care program and the effectiveness of our operations by preventing, detecting and investigating fraud, waste and abuse. Combating fraud, waste and abuse begins with knowledge and awareness. Fraud \u2014 Any type of intentional deception or misrepresentation made with the knowledge that the deception could result in some unauthorized benefit to the person committing it \u2014 or any other person. The attempt itself is fraud, regardless of whether or not it is successful . Waste \u2014 Includes overusing services, or other practices that, directly or indirectly, result in unnecessary costs. Waste is generally not considered to be driven by intentional actions but, rather , occurs when resources are misused. Healthy Blue Provider Manual 79 Abuse \u2014 When health care providers or suppliers do not follow good medical practices resulting in unnecessary or excessive costs, incorrect payment, misuse of codes, or services that are not medically necessary. To help prevent fraud, waste and abuse, providers can assist by educating members. For example, spending time with members and reviewing their records for prescription administration will help minimize drug fraud. One of the most important steps to help prevent member fraud is as simple as reviewing the membe r identification card. It is the first line of defense against possible fraud. Blue Cross NC may not accept responsibility for the costs incurred by providers supplying services to a person who is not a member, even if that person presents a member identif ication card. Providers should take measures to ensure the cardholder is the person named on the card. Presentation of a member identification (ID) card does not guarantee eligibility; providers should verify a member's status and identity. Providers sh ould encourage members to protect their ID cards as they would a credit card, to carry their health benefits card at all times, and report any lost or stolen cards to the company as soon as possible. Understanding the various opportunities for fraud and wo rking with members to protect their health benefit ID card can help prevent fraudulent activities. If you believe an individual has presented a stolen member ID and/or one that does not belong to the patient, contact Healthy Blue Member Services at 844-594-5070 . If you have a patient who has lost their ID card or suspects it was stole n, have the member call the Healthy Blue Member Services at 844-594-5070 . Reporting fraud, waste, and abuse If you suspect a provider (e.g., provider group, hospital, doctor, dentist, counselor, medical supply company, etc.) or any member (a person who receives benefits) has committed fraud, waste or abuse, you have the right to report it. No individual who reports violations or suspected fraud and abuse will be retaliated against for doing so. The name of the person and their information, if supplied, who reports the incident is kept in strict confidence by the Special Investigations Unit (SIU). Report concerns by: Visiting our www.fighthealthcarefraud.com education site; at the top of the page click \"Report it\" and complete the Report Waste, Fraud and Abuse form Participating Providers can c all Provider Experience Calling Member Services Any incident of fraud, waste or abuse may be reported to us anonymously; however, our ability to investig ate an anonymously reported matter may be handicapped without enough information. Hence, we encourage you to give as much information as possible. We appreciate Healthy Blue Provider Manual 80 your time in referring suspected fraud, but be advised that we do not routinely update individu als who make referrals as it may potentially compromise an investigation. Examples of provider fraud, waste, and abuse : Altering medical records to misrepresent actual services provided Billing for services not provided Billing for medically unnecessary tests or procedures Billing professional services performed by untrained or unqualified personnel Misrepresentation of diagnosis or services Soliciting, offering or receiving kickbacks or bribes Unbundling -when multiple procedure codes are bil led individually for a group of procedures that should be covered by a single comprehensive procedure code Upcoding -when a provider bills a health insurance payer using a procedure code for a more expensive service than was actually performed When repor ting concerns involving a provider (a doctor, dentist, counselor, medical supply company, etc.) , include the following information : Name, address and phone number of provider Name and address of the facility (hospital, nursing home, home health agency, et c.). Medicaid number of the provider and facility, if you have it Type of provider (doctor, dentist, therapist, pharmacist, etc.) Names and phone numbers of other witnesses who can help in the investigation Dates of events Summary of what happened Examples of member fraud, waste, and abuse : Forging, altering or selling prescriptions Letting someone else use the member's ID card Relocating to out -of-service plan area and not letting us know Using someone else's ID card When reporting concerns invol ving a member , include the following information : The member's name The member's date of birth, and member ID if you have it The city where the member resides Specific details describing the fraud, waste or abuse If a member appears to have committed fraud, waste or abuse or has failed to correct issues, the member may be involuntarily disenrolled from our health care plan, with state approval. Investigation Process Blue Cross NC investigate s all reports of fraud, waste and abuse for all ser vices provided to members. If appropriate, allegations and the investigative findings are reported to all appropriate state, regulatory and/or law enforcement agencies. In addition to reporting, Blue Healthy Blue Provider Manual 81 Cross NC may take corrective action with provider fraud, waste or abuse, which may include, but is not limited to: Written warning and/or education : Blue Cross NC Sending certified letters to the provider documenting the issues and the need for improvement. Letters may include education or requests for recover ies or may advise of further action. Medical record review: Blue Cross NC review s medical records to substantiate allegations or validate claims submissions. Special claims review: A certified professional coder evaluates claims prior to payment of designated claims. This edit prevents automatic claim payment in specific situations. Recoveries: Blue Cross NC recover s overpayments directly from the Healthy Blue provider. Failure of t he provider to return the overpayment may result in reduced payment of future claims and/or further legal action. If you are working with the SIU , all checks and correspondence should be sent to: Healthy Blue NC : Special Investigations Unit 740 W Peachtree Street NW Atlanta, Georgia 30308 Attn: investigator name, #case number Paper medical records and claims are sent to a different address, which is supplied in correspondence from the SIU.

The policies must provide detailed information about the False Claims Act , administrative remedies for false claims and statements, any state laws Healthy Blue Provider Manual 83 about civil or criminal penalties for false claims, and whistleblower protections under such laws, as described in Section 1902(a)(68)(A).

Include in any employee handbook a specific discussion of the laws described in Section 1902(a) (68) (A), the rights of employees to be protected as whistleblowers, and policies and pro cedures for detecting and preventing fraud, abuse and waste. 2.42 HIPAA The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA ): Improves the portability and continuity of health benefits Provides greater patient rights to access and privacy Ensures greater accountability in health care fraud Simplifies the administration of health insurance We are committed to safeguarding patien t/member information.

Contractual arrangements between us and each provider must be nonexclusive. Steerage of membership by us and/or our network providers is prohibited. If NC DHHS determines steerage has occurred, the department has wide discretion in assessing both financi al penalties and nonfinancial penalties such as member disenrollment.

Resiliency is the ability to live a fulfilling and productive life despite the continued presence of a disability. Physical and behavioral health services are rendered in a manner that allows the achievement of recovery for members experiencing mental illness and substance use disorders. Treatment supports the development of resiliency Healthy Blue Provider Manual 87 for those facing mental illness, serious emoti onal disturbance and/or substance use disorder issues. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) released a consensus statement on behavioral health recovery reflecting the desire that all behavioral health services be delive red in a manner that promotes individual recovery and builds resiliency. The ten fundamental components of recovery identified by SAMHSA are: Self-direction : Members lead, control and determine their own paths of recovery by optimizing autonomy, independ ence and control of resources to achieve a self- determined life. Individualized care : There are multiple pathways to recovery based on an individual's unique strengths and resiliency, as well as his or her needs, preferences and experiences including past trauma and cultural background. Empowerment : Members have the authority to choose from a range of options and to participate in all decisions, including the allocation of resources, that will affect their lives, and are educated and supported in doing so. Holistic : Recovery embraces all aspects of life, including housing, employment, education, mental and health care treatment and services, complementary and naturalistic services ( for example, recreational services, libraries, museums, etc.), addictions treatment, spirituality, creativity, social networks, community participation and family supports as determined by the person. Nonlinear : Recovery is not a step -by-step process but one based on continual growth, occasional setbacks and learning fr om experience. Recovery begins with an initial stage of awareness in which a person recognizes that positive change is possible. This awareness enables the member to move on to fully engage in the work of recovery. Strengths -based : Recovery focuses on val uing and building on the multiple capacities, resiliencies, talents, coping abilities and inherent worth of individuals. Peer support : Mutual support including the sharing of experiential knowledge, skills and social learning plays an invaluable role in re covery. Respect : Community, systems and societal acceptance, and appreciation of members, including protecting their rights and eliminating discrimination and stigma, are crucial to achieve recovery. Responsibility : Members have a personal responsibility for their own self -care and journeys of recovery. Hope : Recovery provides the essential and motivating message of a better future \u2014 that people can and do overcome the obstacles that confront them. Hope is internalized but can be fostered by peers, family , friends, providers and others. Hope is the catalyst of the recovery process. Resiliency is the ability of an individual or family to cope and adapt to the challenges due to changes brought on by distress or disability. Becoming resilient is a dynamic d evelopmental process that requires patience and effort to pursue steps that enhance positive responses to Healthy Blue Provider Manual 88 adverse circumstances. Accepting and managing one's life in a manner that displays optimism for personal successes manifested by traits of self -effica cy and high self -esteem is achieved by building resiliency. Resilience is learned and developed. 3.6 Systems of Care Services provided to people with serious emotional disturbances, and their families, are best delivered based on the System of Care Value s and Principles that are endorsed by Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and the Cen ter for Mental Health Services . Services should: Be person -centered and family -focused with the needs of the person and their family dictating the types and mix of services provided. Be community -based with the focus of services, as well as management and decision making responsibility, resting at the community level. Be culturally competent with agencies, programs and services that are responsive to the cultural, racial and ethnic differences of the populations they serve. Be comprehensive , covering an array of services that address physical, emotional, social, educational and cultural needs. Be personalized as evidenced by an individu alized service plan formulated to meet unique needs and potential.

Healthy Blue Provider Manual 89 3.7 Coordination of Behavioral Health and Physical Health Treatment The integration of behavioral health and physical health treatment is the cornerstone of the Healthy Blue philosophy of treating the needs of the whole person. Principles that guide this integration of care include the following: Behavioral heal th is essential to overall health and not separate from physical health. Mental illness, substance use disorders and other health care conditions must be integrated into a comprehensive system of care that meets the needs of individuals in the setting wher e they feel most comfortable. This includes primary care settings and/or behavioral health care settings. Many people suffer from mental illness, substance use disorders and other health care conditions concurrently; as care is provided, the dynamic of hav ing co -occurring illnesses must be understood, identified and treated as primary conditions. The system of care must be accessible and comprehensive and fully integrate an array of prevention and treatment services for all age groups. It is designed to be evidence informed, responsive to changing needs and built on a foundation of continuous quality improvement. It is our goal to make relevant clinical information accessible to all health providers on a member's treatment team consistent with federal and s tate laws and other applicable standards of medical record confidentiality and the protection of patient privacy. Key elements of our model for coordinated and integrated health services include but are not limited to: Ongoing communication, coordination and collaboration between primary care providers and specialty providers , including behavioral health ( behavioral health and substance use) providers, with appropriate documented consent. The expectation that primary care providers will regularly screen me mbers for behavioral health, substance use (including tobacco), co -occurring disorders and problem gaming, and refer members to behavioral health specialty providers as necessary. The expectation that behavioral health providers will screen members for com mon medical conditions including tobacco use and refer members to the primary care provider for follow - up diagnosis and treatment. Collaboration between all health care providers with support from Blue Cross NC in managing health care conditions of members . Referrals to primary care providers or specialty providers, including behavioral health providers, for assessment and/or treatment for members with co -occurring disorders and/or any known or suspected and untreated health disorders. Development of patient -centered treatment plans involving members, as well as caregivers and family members, and other community supports and systems when appropriate. Care management, condition care management programs to support the coordination and integration of care between providers. The requirement of all providers to complete an annual integrated care self -assessment using the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) Healthy Blue Provider Manual 90 Integrated Practice Assessment Tool and report their results to Blue Cross NC upon request. Fostering a culture of collaboration and cooperation helps Blue Cross NC sustain a seamless continuum of care that positively impacts our member outcomes. To maint ain continuity of care, patient safety and member well -being, communication between integrated health care providers is critical, especially for members with comorbidities receiving pharmacological therapy. To achieve our fully integrated health care sys tem for Healthy Blue members, Blue Cross NC will: Provide to NC DHHS on an annual basis a self -assessment to be inclusive of, but not limited to, such factors as provider locations, integrated or collocated provider numbers, programs focusing on members wi th both behavioral health and primary care needs, use of multiple treatment plans , and unified systems across behavioral and physical health management. Work with NC DHHS to develop a plan to conduct annual assessments of practice integration using the Integrated Practice Assessment Tool on a statistically valid sampling of providers to include but not limited to behavioral health providers, primary care providers, internists, family practitioners, pediatrics, OB/GYN s and any other providers who are likely to interface with behavioral health populations. Provide trainings on integrated care including but not limited to the appropriate utilization of basic behavioral health screenings in the primary care setting, as we ll as basic physical health screenings in the behavioral health setting. Identify available opportunities to provide incentives to clinics to employ licens ed behavioral health professionals in primary care settings and to behavioral health clinics to emplo y a primary care provider (physician, physician's assistant, nurse practitioner) part - or full -time in a psychiatric specialty setting to monitor the physical health of patients. Encourage and endorse real -time consultation of primary care providers with b ehavioral health professionals or psychiatrists for behavioral health issues or consultations on medications. Have integrated data, quality and claims systems. Have a single or integrated clinical documentation system in order to see the whole health of the member. Identify hot spot source s of high emergency department referrals and/or inpatient psychiatric hospitalization and provide pre -emptive care coordination. 3.8 Behavioral Health Provider Roles and Responsibilities The behavioral health care benefit is fully integrated with the rest of the health care programs and inclusive of our fee -for-service Medicaid members requiring behavioral health services only.

Healthy Blue wants to help, as we all work together to achieve health equity. The provider directory is available on the member website at https://healthybluenc.com . Healthy Blue Provider Manual 111 The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) defines cultural competence as the ability to honor and respect the beliefs, languages, interpersonal styles, and behaviors of individuals and families receivi ng services, as well as staff members who are providing such services. It is a dynamic, ongoing developmental process requiring long -term commitment.

A person's cultural affiliations can influence: Where and how care is accessed, how symptoms are described . Expectations of care and treatment options . Adherence to care recommendations . Providers also bring their own cultural orientations, including the culture of medicine. Offering culturally and linguistically appropriate care incorporates a variety of skills and knowledge, including, but not limited to, the ability to: Recognize the cultur al factors (norms, values, communication patterns and world views) that shape personal and professional behavior. Develop understanding of others' needs, values and preferred means of having those needs met. Formulate culturally competent treatment plans. Understand how and when to use language support services, including formally trained interpreters and auxiliary aids and services, to support effective communication. Avoid use of family members, especially minors, to act as interpreters for limited Engli sh proficient patients. Understand and adhere to regulations to support the needs of diverse patients, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Use culturally appropriate community resources as needed to support patient needs and care. Healthy B lue ensures providers have access to resources to help support delivery of culturally and linguistically appropriate services.

Healthy Blue Provider Manual 116 PRECERTIFICATION/PRIOR NOTIFICATION PROCESS Referrals to in -network specialists are not required. However, some specialty services require precertification as specified below. We encourage members to consult with their PCPs prior to accessing nonemergency specialty services. The two processes are defined below. Precertification is defined as the prospective process whereby licensed clinical associates apply designated criteria sets against the intensity of services to be rendered , a member's severity of illness, medical history and previous treatment to determine the medical necessity and appropriateness of a given coverage request. Prospective means the coverage request occurred prior to the service being provided. Elective ser vices require precertification, meaning the provider should notify Blue Cross NC by phone, fax or the provider website before providing the service. Member eligibility and provider status (network and non -network) and medical necessity will be verified. Blue Cross NC may place appropriate limits on a service on the basis of medical necessity or for the purposes of utilization control (with the exception of Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment [EPSDT] services), provided the services furn ished can reasonably be expected to achieve their purpose. Please n ote: Emergency room visits do not require precertification or notification. If an emergency room visit results in an in -patient admission, you should notify us within 24 hours of the visit or the next business day. No precertification is required for EPSDT serv ices for in - network and out -of-area network providers.

If the information submitted does not appear to meet such criteria, the utilization manager submits the information for review by the medical director or other appropriate practitioner as part of the peer review process. The reviewer, or the requesting p rovider, may initiate a peer -to-peer conversation to discuss the relevant clinical information with the clinician working with the member.

Blue Cross NC will not deny payment for treatment obtained when a member had an emergency medical condition as defined in 42 CFR \u00a7438.114(a) , nor limit what constitutes an emergency behavioral health condition on the basis of behavioral health diagnoses or symptoms. We do not deny or discourage our members from using 911 or accessing emergency services. As a matter of course, we grant authorizations for these services immediately. When a member seeks emergency services at a hospital, he or she is examined by a licensed physician to determine if a need exists for such services. The physician wil l note the results of the emergency medical screening examination on the member's chart. The attending emergency physician or the provider treating the member will determine when the member is sufficiently stabilized for transfer or discharge and that determination is binding on Blue Cross NC for coverage and payment. If there is a disagreement between a hospital or other treating facility and Blue Cross NC concerning whether the member is stable enough for discharge or transfer from the emergency room, th e judgment of the attending emergency physician(s) at the hospital or other treating facility at the time of discharge or transfer prevails and is binding on Blue Cross NC . This subsection does not apply to a disagreement concerning discharge or transfer f ollowing an inpatient admission once the member is stabilized. If the emergency department cannot stabilize and release our member, we will help coordinate the inpatient admission. Healthy Blue Provider Manual 135 Any transfer from a n out of network hospital to a n in-network hospital ca n only take place after the member is medically stable. 5.12 Urgent Care/After -Hours Care We strongly encourage our members to contact their PCPs if they need urgent care.

MCG Care Guidelines criteria will be used when no specific Healthy Blue Medical Policies or Clinical UM Guidelines exist. A list of the specific Healthy Blue Clinical UM Guidelines used will be posted and main tained on the Healthy Blue website and can be obtained in hard copy by written request. The policies described above will support precertification requirements, clinical -appropriateness claims edits and retrospective review. Federal and state law, as well as contract language, including definitions and specific contract provisions/exclusions, take precedence over medical policy and must be considered first when determining eligibility for coverage. As such, in all cases, state Medicaid contracts or Centers for Medicare & Medicaid requirements will supersede both MCG Care Guidelines and Healthy Blue Medical Policy criteria. Medical technology is constantly evolving, and we reserve the right to review and periodically update medical policy and utilization management criteria. 6.6 Clinical Criteria Healthy Blue utilization reviewers currently use MCG Care Guidelines criteri a for inpatient concurrent clinical decision support for medical management coverage decisions and for discharge planning. The criteria provide a system for screening proposed medical care based on member -specific, best medical care practices and r ule-based systems to match appropriate services to member needs based on clinical appropriateness. Criteria include the following : Acute care Long -term acute care Rehabilitation Subacute and skilled nursing facility Healthy Blue Provider Manual 138 You can obtain copies of the criteria used in a case to make a clinical determination by calling Provider Services. You may also submit your request in writing to: Blue Cross NC | Healthy Blue Medical Management 11000 Weston Parkway , Suite 200 Cary, NC 27513 Informal reconsideration/ peer-to-peer (P2P) discussion If our medical director denies coverage of a request, the appropriate notice of proposed action, including the member's appeal rights, will be mailed to the requesting provider, the member's PCP and/or servicing physician, and the member.

We will allow P2Ps to be scheduled within five business days from the issuance of the faxed denial notification for inpatient concurrent stays. o We will not complete P2P discussions on retrospective eligible, postdischarge hospitalizations. For retrospective eligible postdischarge adverse determinatio ns, follow the Healthy Blue formal medical necessity appeals process. o If the request for the P2P is outside of the established time frame, you'll need to follow the formal appeal process. The provider will be outreached by a Healthy Blue associate to sche dule the P2P within one business day. o If you're unable to accept or schedule a P2P discussion within the specified time frame, you'll need to follow the formal appeal process. The medical director will make two attempts to connect with the provider at th e provider's specified contact number. If the provider fails to return the contact to the Healthy Blue medical director, the request for a P2P will be closed and the provider's next course of action will be to follow the formal medical necessity appeal pro cess. 6.7 Medical Advisory Committee We have established a medical advisory committee to: Utilize ongoing peer review system to assess levels of care and quality of care provided Monitor practice patterns in order to identify appropriateness of care and for improvement/risk -prevention activities Review and provide input based on the characteristics of the local delivery system and approve evidence -based clinical protocols/guidelines to facilitate the delivery of quality care and appropriate resource utilization Healthy Blue Provider Manual 139 Review clinical study design and results Develop and approve action plans/recommendations regarding clinical quality improvement studies Consider/recommend actions with regard to physician quality of care issues Review an d provide input to clinically oriented quality management policies and procedures , UM policies and procedures, and disease/care management policies and procedures Review and provide feedback regarding new technologies Oversee compliance of delegated services 6.8 Utilization Management Decision Making Utilization Management (UM) decisions are governed by the following statements: UM decision making is based only on appropriateness of care and service and existence of coverage.

Decisions about hiring, promoting or terminating practitioners or other staff are not based on the likelihood or perceived likelihood that they support , or tend to support , denials of benefits. Financial incentives for UM decision -makers do not encourage decisions that result in underutilization or create barriers to care and service. 6.9 Utilization Management Committee We have established a Utilizatio n Management (UM) committee to provide relevant UM information to the Q uality Management program for quality improvement activities. This includes identifying quality of care concerns, disproportionate utilization trends, duplicative services, adverse acce ss patterns, and lack of continuity and coordination of care processes. The UM committee achieves its goals and objectives by working collaboratively with a variety of other departments external to our Health Care Management Services Departm ent such as our Regulatory, Compliance, Provider Contracting/ Provider Relationship Management , Clinical Informatics, Quality, Pharmacy, Medical Finance and the National Customer Care Departments, includ ing Member Services.

Blue Cross NC 's process will occur no less frequently than every five years consistent with the Department policy and pro cedure. After the Provider Credentialing Transition Period, Blue Cross NC will evaluate a contracted provider's continued eligibility for contracting by confirming the appearance of the provider on the daily PEF.

Healthy Blue Provider Manual 148 Claims submission quality expectations Electronic claim submissions will adhere to specifications for submitting medical claims data in standardized Accredited Standards Committee (ASC) X12N 837 formats. Electronic claims are validated for Compliance SNIP levels 1 to 4: Professional claims that meet standardized X12 EDI Transaction Standard: 837P - Professional claims Institutional claims that meet standardized X12 EDI Transaction Standard: 837I - Institutional Claims Claim submissions , whether electronic or paper , must include the following information: Member's ID number including alpha prefix Member's name Member's date of birth ICD-10-CM diagnosis code Date of service Place of service Procedures, services or supplies rendered with CPT-4 codes/HCPCS codes/ disease -related groups Itemized charges Days or units Provider tax ID number Provider name according to contract Billing provider information , and rendering provider information when different than billing or when billing a group taxonomy NPI of billing and rendering provider when applicable , or API when NPI isn't appropriate Taxonomy of billing provider, attending and rendering provider when submitted Coordination of benefits/other insurance information Precertification number or copy of precertification NDC, unit of measure and quantity for medical injectables Any other state -required data (see Appendix A ) Provider and member data will be verified against state reference data for accuracy and active status. Be sure to validate this data in advance of cla ims submission. This validation will apply to all provider data submitted and applies to atypical and out -of-state providers. NDC data will be validated for appropriate use for service rendered as well as confirming the NDC is effective on the date of service. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ([H.R. 3590 ] Section 65607 [Mandatory State Use of National Correct Coding Initiative (NCCI)] ) requires state Medicaid programs to Healthy Blue Provider Manual 149 incorporate NCCI methodologies into their claims processing systems. The purpose of the NCCI edits is to prevent improper payments when incorrect code combinations are reported. The two components of NCCI are procedur e-to-procedure edits (CCI) and medically unlikely edits (MUE) : CCI procedure -to-procedure edits are for practitioners, ambulatory surgical centers and outpatient hospital service s (only for drugs, high -tech images, ultrasounds and labs as they are billed at a CPT/HCPCS code level) that define pairs of HCPCS/CPT codes that should not be reported together. MUE are units of service edits for practitioners, ambulatory surgical centers, outpatient hospital service s (only for drugs, high -tech images, ultrasound s and labs as they are billed at a CPT/HCPCS code level) and DME. This component defines for each HCPCS/CPT code the number of units of service that is unlikely to be correct ( for example , claims for excision of more than one appendix or more than one hyst erectomy). Providers are reminded that: Services must be reported correctly . Multiple HCPCS/CPT codes should not be reported when there is a single comprehensive HCPCS/CPT code. The c ode describes these services . A procedure should not be fragmented int o component parts . A bilateral procedure code should not be unbundled into two unilateral procedure codes . Down -coding and upcoding should be avoided. The appropriate procedure code s should be used based on age and gender of the patient . If a procedure co de is submitted that requires a primary procedure code, verify that the primary procedure code has been submitted . Procedure codes are billed in the appropriate place of service as defined by AMA and/or CMS (for example, certain procedure codes are not permitted to be performed outside of an inpatient setting ). Obstetric services including antepartum care, delivery and postpartum care are billed appropriately . The appropriate evaluation and management (E&M) codes are u sed for new patients and established patients . Certain services related to a surgical procedure are included in the payment of the global surgery package . These services would include E&M and related surgical procedures performed by the same physician for the same patient . Duplicate services are not submitted for the same provider, same patient for the same date of service. Consent forms are required for t he following services: abortion, hysterectomy and sterilization. Providers must su bmit both the National DME Miscellaneous and corresponding Local W codes on claims. Local codes should be noted in the service description, as they will fail National Uniform Billing Committee service validations if used as the principal service. If the Healthy Blue Provider Manual 150 specif ied local W codes are not on the claim, the claim(s) will be denied. To view the current list of code s, visit https://www.nubc.org . Newborns must have their assigned Medicaid ID before the provider can bill for services. Newborn claims cannot be billed under the mother following the delivery. Hospitals are required to follow the requirements for reporting and reimbursing for hospital acquired conditions. 7.4 International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD -10) As of October 1, 2015, ICD -10 became the code set for medical diagnoses and inpatient hospital procedures in compliance with HIPAA requirements and in accordance with the rule issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). What is ICD -10? International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD -10) is a diagnostic and procedure coding system endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1990. It replaces the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD -9), which was developed in the 1970s. Internationally, the codes are used to study health conditions and assess health management and clinical processes; and in the United States, the codes are the foundation for documenting the diagnosis and associated services pro vided across health care settings. Although, we often use the term ICD -10 alone, there are two parts to ICD -10: ICD-10-CM ( clinical modific ation) used for diagnosis coding and ICD-10-PCS ( procedure coding sys tem) used for inpatient hospital procedure coding; this is a variation from the WHO baseline and unique to the United States . ICD-10-CM replaced the code sets ICD -9-CM Volumes 1 and 2 for diagnosis coding ; ICD-10- PCS replaced ICD -9-CM Volume 3 for inpatient hospital procedure coding. 7.5 Encounter Claim Data If you are reimbursed by capitation or have a delegated arrangement , you must send us encounter data for each member encounter. You must submit encounter data no later than 30 calendar days from the date of adjudication through: EDI submission methods A CMS -1500 (08-05) claim form Other arrangements that are approved by Blue Cross NC Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT) screening claims as well as physician -administered drugs should be filed as soon as possible within the timely filing period.

If we do not pay the claim within 30 calendar days, we will pay all applicable interest as required by law. We produce an Explanation of Payment (EOP ) and it shows t he status of each claim that has been adjudicated during the previous claim cycle. If we do not receive all of the required information, we will deny the claim either in part or in whole within 30 calendar days of receipt of the claim. A request for the missing information will appear on your EOP or 835 Electronic Remittance Advice (if regist ered to receive 835's).

If filing electronically, check the response reports for acceptance of the claim that you receive from your Clearinghouse or practice management vendor. 7.9 Reimbursement Policies Reimbursement policies serve as a guide to assist you in accurate claim submissions and to outline the basis for reimbursement if services are covered by the member's Healthy Blue benefit plan. These policies can be accessed on the provider site. Services must meet Healthy Blue Provider Manual 153 authorization and medical necessity guidelines appropriate to the procedure and d iagnosis as well as to the member's state of residence.

If appropriate coding/billing guidelines or current reimbursement policies are not followed, Healthy Blue may: Reject or deny the claim Recover and/or recoup claim payment Healthy Blue reimbursement policies are developed based on nationally accepted industry standards and coding principles. These policies may be superseded by mandates in provider , state , federal or CMS contracts and/or requirements. System logic or setup may prevent the loading of policies into the claims platforms in the same manner as described; however , Blue Cross NC strives to minimize these variations. Reimbursement hierarchy Claims submitted for payments must meet all aspects of criteria for reimbursement. The reimbursement hierarchy is the order of payment conditions that must be met for a claim to be reimbursed. Conditions of payment could include ben efits coverage, medical necessity/clinical criteria, authorization requirements and/or stipulations within a reimbursement policy. Neither payment rates nor methodology are considered to be conditions of payments. Review schedules and updates to reimburs ement policies Reimbursement policies undergo reviews for updates to state contracts , federal or CMS requirements. Additionally, updates may be made at any time if we are notified of a mandated change or due to a Healthy Blue business decision. We reserve the right to review and revise our policies when necessary. When there is an update, we will publish the most current policies to our provider website.

We use covered medical and hospital services whenever available or other public or private sources of payment for services rendered to our members. When third -party resources and third-party liabi lity (TPL) resources are available to cover the costs of trauma -related claims and medical services provided to Medicaid members, we will reject the claim and redirect you to bill the appropriate insurance carrier (unless certain pay-and-chase circumstances apply \u2014 see below). Or if we do not become aware of th e resource until after payment for the service was rendered, we will pursue post -payment recovery of the expenditure. You must not seek recovery in excess of the Medicaid -payable amount. The Medicaid program will be the payer of last resort when third -party resources are available to cover the costs of medical services provided to Medicaid members. Blue Cross NC may pay -and-chase the full amount allowed under the payment schedule for the claim and then seek reimbursement from the TPL insurer within 60 day s after the end of the month in which the payment was made, for any liable TPL of legal liability if: The claim is for prenatal care for pregnant women . The claim is for preventive pediatric services (including Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and T reatment [EPSDT] and well -baby screenings) . The claim is for a service that is provided to an individual on whose behalf child support enforcement is being carried out by the state Title IV -D agency. Blue Cross NC will cost -avoid a claim if it establishe s the probable existence of TPL at the time the claim is filed, except for the pay -and-chase circumstances as outlined above. Claims for labor and delivery and postpartum care may be cost -avoided, including the cost associated with provider and ancillary fees. Our subrogation vendor handles the filing of liens and settlement negotiations both internally and externally. Coordin ation of benefits claim examples : Scenario one \u2014 professional cl aim: Medicaid pays the allowable amount minus TPL payment or total patient responsibility amount (copay, co -insurance and/or deductible). The Medicaid allowed amount minus the TPL paid amount is less than the patient responsibility; thus, the Medicaid allowed amount is the payment. Blue Cross NC is responsible up to the Medicaid allowable amount or the patient's responsibility, whichever is the lesser amount. Scenario two \u2014 outpatient clai m: Medicaid zero pays the claim; when cost -compared, the private insurance paid more than the Medicaid allowed amount for the procedure. When compared, the lesser of the Medicai d allowed amount minus the TPL payment and the Healthy Blue Provider Manual 165 patient responsibility is the former; thus, no further payment is made by Medicaid. The claim is paid in full. Scenario three \u2014 inpatient cla im: The Medicaid allowed amount minus the TPL payment is greater tha n the patient responsibility; thus, the patient responsibility is paid on this covered service . Billing for specialized behavioral health services for dual eligibles: For dual -eligible members (Medicare and Medicaid), Blue Cross NC will be the secondary payer on hospital and professional claims for specialized behavioral health and substance use services. Providers should submit claims for dual -eligible enrollees to Med icare as the primary payer for hospital and professional claims. Claims for services delivered by unlicensed staff should be submitted directly to Blue Cross NC. 7.11 Billing Members Before rendering a service that is not covered by Blue Cross NC , inform our member that we do not cover the cost of the service; he or she will have to pay for the service. If you choose to provide services that we do not cover: Understand that we only re imburse for services that are medically necessary, including hospital admissions and other services . Obtain the member's signature on the Client Acknowledgment Statement specifying that the member will be held responsible for payment of services . Understan d that you may not bill for or take recourse against a member for denied or reduced claims for services that are within the amount, duration and scope of benefits of the Medicaid program . You cannot balance -bill for the amount above that which we pay for covered services. In addition, you may not bill a member if any of the following occurs: Failure to submit a claim on time, including claims not received by Blue Cross NC Failure to submit a claim to Blue Cross NC for initial processing within the timely filing deadline for providers Failure to dispute a corrected claim within the clean -claim submission period Failure to appeal a claim within the 60-day payment dispute period If you have any questions regarding paid, denied or pended claims, call Healthy Blue Provider Services at 844-594-5072 . Healthy Blue posts weekly Known Issues Bulletins on our provider website to share information related to known claims issues. All bulletins will be stored on our provider website within the Provider news archives ( https://provider.healthybluenc.com/north -carolina -provider/archives ). Healthy Blue Provider Manual 166 Failure to appeal a utilization review determination within 30 days of not ification of coverage denial Submission of an unsigned or otherwise incomplete claim Errors made by the provider in claims preparation, claims submission or the appeal/dispute process Exceptions to Cost sharing For NC Medicaid , member cost sharing does no t apply to subset of the following population: Children under age of 21 Pregnant women Federally -recognized American Indians/Alaska Natives BCCCP beneficiaries Foster children and disabled children under Family Opportunity Act Individuals whose medical assistance services are furnished in an institution is reduced and is based off the members' available income and not based off personal needs Family planning NC Blue Cr oss will not impose cost sharing on behavioral health services, as defined by NC DHHS.

Healthy Blue will not pay for these services. Healthy Blue has set up the administrative rules and medical necessity standards for the services or items I get. I may have to pay for them if Healthy Blue decides they are not medically necessary or are not a covered benefit. I understand I am liable for payment if I sign an agreement with my provider prior to the services 168 7.13 Overpayment Process Refund notifications may be identified by two entities : Blue Cross NC and its contracted vendors or the providers. Blue Cross NC researches and notifies the provider of an overpayment by requesting a refund check. The provider may also identify an overpayment and proactively submit a refund check or authorize setup of a claims adjustment to reconcile the overpayment amount. Once an overpayment has been identified by Blue Cross NC , Blue Cross NC will notify the provider of the overpayment. The overpayment notification will include instructions on how to refund the overpayment. If a provider identifies an overpayment , it can be recon ciled by either of the two methods listed below: Refund Notification Form : To submit a refund, a completed Refund Notification Form specifying the reason for the return must be included. This form can be found on the provider website at https://provider.healthybluenc.com > Forms . The submission of the Refund Notification Form will allow Cost Containment to process and reconcile the overpayment in a timely manner. For questions regarding the refund notification procedure, call Healthy Blue Provider Services at 844-594-5072 and select the appropriate prompt. Recoup Notification Form : To refund an overpayment via a claims adjustment, a completed Recoup Notification Form specifying the reason for the adjustment must be included. The Recoup Notification Form allows a provider to grant authorization to adjust claims and create claim offsets, which allows setup of claim adjustments that will result in overpayments being withheld from future claims payments. This form can be found on the provider website at https://provider.healthyblu enc.com . The submission of the Recoup Notification Form will allow Cost Containment to process and reconcile the overpayment in a timely manner. For questions regarding the recoup notification procedure, call Healthy Blu e Provider Services at 844-594-5072 and select the appropriate prompt. In instances where we are required to adjust previously paid claims to adhere to a new published rate, we will initiate a reconciliation of the affected claims. As such, we will determ ine the cumulative adjusted reimbursement amount based on the new rates. In the event the outcome of this reconciliation results in a net amount owed to us, we will commence recovery of such amounts through an offset against future claims payments. Such re coveries are not considered part of the overpayment recovery process described above or in the provider agreement. Changes addressing the topic of overpayments have taken place with the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA ), commonly known as the Healthcare Reform Act . The provision directly links the retention of overpayments to false claim liability. The language of 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1320a -7k makes explicit that overpayments must now be reported and returned to states or re spective PHPs within 60 days of identification of the overpayment or by the date any corresponding cost report is due, whichever is later. After 60 Healthy Blue Provider Manual 169 days, the overpayment is considered a false claim, which triggers penalties under the False Claims Act , including treble damages. In order to avoid such liability, health care providers and other entities receiving reimbursement under Medicare or Medicaid should implement policies and procedures on reporting and returning overpayments that are consistent with th e requirements in the PPACA . The provision entitled \"Reporting and Returning Overpayments - Deadline for Reporting and Returning Overpayments,\" codified at 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1320a -7k, clarifies the uncertainty left by the 2009 Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act . This provision of the Healthcare Reform Act applies to providers of services, suppliers, Medicaid managed care organizations, Medicare Advantage organizations and Medicare Prescription Drug Program sponsors. It does not apply to beneficiaries. Additionally, Healthy Blue will conduct facility claim reviews, in conjunction with our designee, CERiS. CERiS' professional review process identifies errors, unrelated charges, and non - separately billable charges on facility claims for inpatient services, on a prepayment basis. In accordance with NC DHHS guidance, hospital inpatient claims received on or after August 25th, 2022 , with a header or total billed amount greater than $250,000 will be eligible for review. Healthy Blue or CERiS may request documentation, such as an itemized bill, to conduct the review. Once contacted, please submit the requested information within seven calendar days. Healthy Blue may accept additional documentation from the provider such as other documents substantiating the treatment or health service or delivery of supplies; provider's established internal policies; or business practices justifying the health care service or supply. Claims should be billed and appropriately coded according to Blue Cross NC policies along with industry standard coding guidelines for the appli cable bill type, (including but not limited to UB Editor, AMA, CPT, CPT Assistant, HCPCS, DRG guidelines, CMS' National Correct Coding Initiative (CCI) Policy Manual, CCI table edits and other CMS guidelines). In accordance with NC DHHS guidance, Healthy B lue will not modify any line items allowed or paid amounts. It will either pay or deny each line on the claim. Providers should follow the process outlined in Section 2.4 0 for an appeal. The re is no special process for an appeal related to CERiS audits. 7.14 NC DHHS Encounter Data Submissions NC DHHS collects and uses medical, behavioral health, transportation, vision and pharmacy service encounter data for many purposes including but not limited to : Federal reporting Drug rebates Budgeting Rate setting Healthy Blue Provider Manual 170 Capitation payments Risk adjustment Qualified directed payments Services verification Medicaid managed care quality improvement activity Fraud/waste/abuse monitoring Measurement of utili zation patterns Access to care Hospital assessment updates Research studies Encounter data is created from the claim data submission from our providers. We are obligated to submit encounter data to NC DHHS , so accurate claims data will translate to complete, accurate and timely encounter data to NC DHHS. NC DHHS billing policy is the basis of encounter data quality validations, which Blue Cross NC will also use to monitor the quality of the inbound Healthy Blue claims data.
