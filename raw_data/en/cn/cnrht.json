Decisions to include TCM diagnoses in the International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision (ICD -11) by the World Health Organi zation (WHO) and campaigns to integrate TCM into national healthcare systems have occurred whilst the public perception and usage of TCM, especially in Europe, remains undetermined. Accordingly, this study investigates the popul arity, usage patterns, perception of scientific support f or TCM , and its relationship to homeopathy. Methods A cross -sectional survey was performed in Austria and data from 1382 participants were analysed. A Bayesian network model retrieved partial correlations indicating distinct associations between sociodemo graphic determinants, complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) usage patterns, readiness to vaccinate, and TCM related variables. Results TCM was broadly known by the Austrian population ( 89.9 % of women, 90.6% of men), with 58.9 % of women and 39.5% of men using TCM between 2016 and 2019. 66.4 % of women and 49.7 % of men agreed with TCM being supported by s cience. We found a strong positive relationship between the perceived scientific support for TCM and trust in TCM -certified medical doctors. Moreover, perceived scientific support for TCM was negatively correlated with the proclivity to get vaccinated. Additionally, our Bayesian network model yielded distinct associations between TCM -, homeopathy -, and vaccination -related variables. Conclusion TCM is w idely known within the Austrian general population and actively used by a substantial proportion. However, a crucial disparity exists between the commonly held public perception that TCM is scientific and findings from evidence -based studies . As pu blic opi nion towards TCM, and the proclivity to use it, are promoted through institutionalisation and official acknowledgement, it would be critical to sustain and support the distribution of unbiased, science -driven information by governmental institution s and po licymakers to encourage informed patient -driven decision -making.

We are t he first study on CAM usage patterns to graphically explore and report data using a Bayesian Gaussian copula graphical model \u2014thereby, retrieving distinct partial correlations. We provide an up -to-date summary of TCM, set forth our findings at a geo politica l scale and highlight that the discrepancy between the paucity of evidence underpinning most TCM modalities and the international promotion of TCM is also reflected in the widely -held public perception that TCM is supported by science . Due to the r etrospec tive character of our cross -sectional survey, answers are naturally prone to recall and response bias. Our sample is skewed towards the young, people with higher levels of education, and shows a relative underrepresentation of males. Therefore, we post -stratified our sample using representative data from Austria's federal statistical office \" Statistik Austria \" as a robustness check. .

Pangolin scales, tiger bones, seahorses, rhino horns and bear bi le are among a few of the items that have sparked international outcry due to reports of animal rights violations, po aching of endangered species, and the incentivisation of animal trafficking.28-32 Indeed, seizure numbers of animal -derived medicinal products tota lled 40 ,434 during 2018, in the EU alone, with Thailand and China constituting the largest exporters .33 Today, TCM is exported to over 160 countries34 with the US and the EU sp ending billions of dollars on products .35 36 With the establishmen t of verified TCM schools teaching acupuncture and herbal medicine in North America , Australia and Europe25, there ar e strong reasons to suggest that TCM has spread beyond Asia and established a foothold in these continents.37 This growth in popularity sparks concerns regarding patient safety. Contrary to other CAM practices like homeopathy , TCM endorses the application of pharmacologically active substances. However, compared to convent ional therapeutics, traditional remedies and phytotherapeutics are not subject to the same regulatory requirements and stringent testing.38 39 Due to their non -purified nature and reportedly disparate compositions, con centrations of desired active agents may vary greatly and contamination .

Thus, following two European social survey data analyses conducted by Kemppainen et al. and Fj\u00e6r et al.57 58, this study aims to elucidate the awareness, acceptance, and usage of TCM in a Central European population, as represented by Austria, wh ilst putting special emphasis on the public's perception of TCM's scientific support . Additionally, we also investigate public trust in TCM practitioners because (I) trust in CAM - practitioners has been shown to be enhanced by institutional guarantees59, thus is potentially altered by the perception of scientific support , and (II) trust in practitioners was shown to determine patient satisfaction60, thereby possibly influencing usage frequency and treatment expenditures. Finally , we explore the proclivity of TCM usage when in combination with homeopa thy; the most prevalent type of CAM in Austria .61 Furthermore, we analyse the relationship between TCM usage and the utilisation of vaccines , as data on CAM -users point s towards a redu ced readiness to get vaccinated when compared to non -users .62-65 Ultimately , using a Bayesian graphical model , we explore the multivariate conditional (in)dependence structure of all variables queried in our survey . Thereby, we retrieve partial correlations that indicate distinct associations allowing us to untangle the complex interactions that underlie CAM -usage . METHODS Data collection We performed a questionnaire -based cross -sectional study within the Austrian g eneral population. Our study was divided into two phases: (a) an interview -based street survey and (b) an online survey. The questionnaires were designe d using the online survey tool \"SoSciSurvey\". The street survey was conducted on the 6th of April 2019 b y 19 different interviewers on 12 highly frequented and socio -demographically heterogeneous places throughout Vienna , Austria . Interviewers received detailed instructions ahead of their participation and were in constant communication with the organising t eam. The online survey was uploaded as an article on the 2nd of March 2019 on the website of the most popular daily free newspaper in Austria ( named \"Heute\", translated \" Today \"). The link was open for participation for a total of six days, spanning from th e 2nd of March to the 7th of March. Procedures Individuals were approached indiscriminately by interviewers. After informed consent was obtained and electronically recorded , interviewers asked questions and recorded responses according to a pre-defined an swer scheme on a mobile device . Interviewers wer e instructed to remain impartial and cognisant of their speech and body language to minimise bias introduced by intonation, connotation and gesturing. Responses were recorded anonymously. The median duration of the survey was 189 seconds per participant. The online survey was identical to the street survey, except for minor modifications that were necessary for the survey to be fully comprehensible in the absence of an interviewer. A CAPTCHA was implemented to distinguish true participants from automated re sponders. After detailed information about data storage and privacy , consent was obtained through a digital form at the .

As SoSciSurvey does not use IP address filtering, thereby enabl ing the possibility of repeated participation by the same respondent, participants were directly addressed on the first page of the survey and specifically asked to only participate once. Moreover, we used an average relative completion speed cut -off of 2. 0 to filter out meaningless , potentially duplica te responses .66 Consistent with the street survey, responses were recorded anonymously. The median duration of the survey was 212 seconds per participant . It is probable that the increased time taken for the online survey compared to the street survey was due to the addi tion of an introductory page, a CAPTCHA, and a finishing page. Questionnaire Designed by our team to combine classical sociodemographic determinants with indicators of CAM usage, the questionnaire e specially focused on the utilisation of TCM. It included a total of 2 1 items: 6 pertained to sociodemographic factors (gender, age, citizenship, level of education, employment, and income), 8 queried TCM directly (awareness, general usage, usage frequency , perception of scientific support for TCM, trust in TCM -certified medical doctors, and TCM expenses), 4 questions focused on additional CAM usage patterns (homeopathy and vaccination hesitancy) and 3 questions were asked to further characterise our sample (study participation, chronic illness, and money spent on conventional medicine). The questionnaire was pilot tested on a heterogenous group of 20 people of varying age and sociodemographic characteristics in consecutive phases. Inputs were considered and the questionnaire optimised between phases. In some instances, the questionnaire was taken in person with the interviewer present to immediately discuss the respondents' thoughts (\"think aloud\") . This allowed for optimisation of question comprehensibility, appropriateness, order , and wording to ens ure the validity of questionnaire items. The questionnaire can be obtained from online supplementary file 1 in both German and English . Statistical analysis We used a Bayesian graphical model to explore the multiv ariate conditional (in)dependence structure of our variables. In a graphical or network model, each variable represents a node and an edge is drawn between two nodes if they are conditionally associated, that is, if they are associated after adjusting for all other variables; the edge weight is giv en by the strength of this association.67 The model allow ed us to answer questions such as \"how strongly is gender associated with TCM usage frequency after adjusting for all other variables?\". The fact that many conditional associations can be handled within a single model and intuitively visuali sed ma de this approach ideal for exploring relationsh ips between our variables. One of the most widely used graphical models is the Gaussian graphical model, which assumes that the data follow a multivariate Gaussian distribution.67 The inverse of the covariance matrix parameteri ses this model, which then yields a matrix of partial correlations when it is standardised . As m any of our variables were categorical (e.g. , gender and chronic disease ) or ordinal (e.g. , education and inco me), they did not follow a Gaussian distribution. To be able to model the dependencies between our variables without making incorrect assumptions about their univariate marginal distributions, a Gaussian copula was use d.68 69 The Gaussian copula graphical model70 71 allow ed us to separate the modelling of the dependency between variables (which is achieved through the Gaussian copula) from modelling the marginal distributions (which we do without assuming a particular parametric form69). Similar to the Gaussian graphical model, the Gaussian copula graphical model is paramet erised by an inverse covariance matrix which, when standardi sed, yields a matrix of partial correlations that encode the dependencies between our variables; the key difference is that now the different univariate marginal distributions of our variables are respected . It is this partial correlation matrix, as well as the simpl e correlation matrix, that we have focus ed on in our analysis. .

Bayesia n inference provides a principled and practical approach to quantifying uncertainty, therefore we employ ed it in our analysis . Bayesian inference requires specifying a prior distribution over parameters, which then gets updated to a posterior distribution when combined with data. We assign ed a recently introduced Matrix -F dis tribution to the inverse covariance matrix in our Gaussian copula graphical model72 73. While the Matrix -F distribution constitutes a more flexible prior compared to the widely used Wishart prior, we note that with sample sizes as large as ours, the prior ha s little influence on the poste rior. We use d the R package BGGM for our analysis.73 We re port summaries of the posterior distribution for all partial correlations as well as marginal correlations in the Gaussian copula graphical model. Furthermore, the extent to which the v ariance of each variable can be explained by all other variables is rep orted.74 75 Note that we did not conduct a statistical power analysis because our goal is not to test hypotheses and control the false positive and false negative error rates. Instead, our goal is to quantify the uncertainty across the estimated (conditional) relatio nships between variables. Our Bayesian method naturally accounts for uncertainty and guards against overconfidence. As for data excl usion, 75 participants were excluded from all analyses due to missing and inconclusive data. Moreover, 19 participants were excluded from the analysis depicted in table 1. For TCM -related analyses, 232 individuals who reported unawareness of TCM or indicat ed inconsistency in their knowledge of TCM, homeopathy, or acupuncture , and 13 participants who had skipped analysis -relevan t questions were excluded . Additionally, 34 participants were excluded for not providing information about their medical expenses in our analysis of the personal financial cost of TCM. Moreover, for the Bayesian graphical model, we imputed the income group of 156 participants and the medical expenses of the 34 participants who chose not to provide the respective data using the R packag e mice.76 Of note, as our sample was skewed towards the y oung and more educated population and suffered from a relative underrepresentation of males , we post -stratified it, using data deriving from \"Statistik Austria \"77, Austria's federal statistical office . All results displayed in this paper (except figure 1) are derived from the post -stratified sample. For reasons of transparency, al l raw descriptive statistics can be found in the R-script uploaded in . Because a way to use post -stratification in the estimation of the Bay esian Gaussian copula graphical model does not currently exist , we post -stratified manually, subsampling our dataset with replacement using post -stratification weights and estimat ing the graphical model on the subsampled data. We repeated this procedure 25 0 times. Combining the estimates from these runs yielded a post -stratified graphical model. The graphical model and figures that are based on the raw data can be found in the supp lementary file 2. All statistical analys es were conducted using the statistic al computing language R version 4.0.0.78 The R-script can be obtained from the online GitHub repository. Patient and public i nvolvement statement Other than giving feedback on t he questionnaire, neither patients nor the general public were actively involved in (I) the design and (II) the conduct ing of the study as well as (III) the reporting of outcomes and (IV) dissemination of research results. .

After exclusion of missing and inconclusive data66, a total of 1307 participants were eligible for data analysis. Demographic analysis Our study population consisted of 901 women and 406 men with a mean age of 41.7 (SD: 15.6) and 40.5 (SD: 16.9) years, respectively. The majority of participants (68% women a nd 67% men) were employed at the time of data collection (figure 1). 42.2% of women and 39.4% of men had a university degree and 32.1 % of women and 47.2% of men reported a monthly income exceeding 2000 euros (excluding 141 women and 63 men who chose not to report their income bracket). Moreover, 45.3% of women and 38.7% of men suffered from a chronic disease. Compared to the Austrian general population, men were strongly underrepresented in our sample population . Additionally, the sample was skewed towards the young with more people in the 15 -29 year age bracket (36.7% vs 21.5% for men and 26.8% vs 19.4% for women) and correspondingly less in the 65-84 age bracket (10.6% vs 17.8 % for men and 8. 6% vs 20.6 % for women). The participants also had higher level s of education compared to the Austrian general population: only 8.9% of men and 5.0% of women in our sample report ed lower secondary educati on as their highest level of education, compared to 16.9% and 22 .0% in the general population .77 Similarly, the proportion of men and women in our sample reporting to have completed a Bachelor 's, Master 's, or PhD qualification is 39.4% and 42.2%, respectively, compared to 12.7% and 12.5% in the general population.77 Thus, u sing data deriving from \"Statistik Austria \"77\u2014Austria's federal statistical office \u2014we post - stratified our sample in order to more closely represent the Austria n general population in terms of gender, age, and education. An analysis of TCM awareness and usage, acupuncture usage as well as homeopathy us age and propagation is presented in table 1. Table 1. Overview of CAM usage Gender Knows TCM Has used TCM Has used acupuncture Has used homeopathy Has recommended homeopathy Female 89.9 % 58.3 % 61.9 % 71.6 % 43.4 90.6 % 51.2 % 48.6 % 45.1% 18.7% Table 1 An overview of male and female CAM usage examining the relative frequencies of five criteria: 1) TCM awaren ess, 2) usage of TCM, 3) usage of acupuncture, 4) usage of homeopathy, 5) homeopathy propagation. TCM -related analysis Regarding the frequency of TCM usage, 58.9% of women and 3 9.5% of men used TCM at least once between 2016 and 2019. An examination of pa rticipants reporting high usage frequencies revealed a gender imbalance with 3 1.8% of women compared to 24.9 % of men rep orting usage at least five times during the same three -year period. 4 8.6% of women and 30.3 % of men used acupuncture at least once in th e past three years, with 22.0 % of women and 17.8 % of men using it at least five times.

Furthermore, we evaluated the perception of scientific support for TCM and trust in TCM -certified medical doctors. 6 6.4% of women and 49.7 % of men \"mostly agreed\" or \"completely agreed\" with TCM being scientific. This trend is congruent with 83.3 % of women and 70.2 % of men who \"mostly agreed\" or \"completely agreed\" with TCM -certified medical doctors being trustworthy alongside 7.2% of women and 18.8 % of men who either \"did not agree\" or \"rather disagreed\" .

Results conform to a Likert scale in which \"do not agree\" indicates a perception of weak scientific s upport and distrust, and \"completely agree\" indica tes perception of strong scientific support and trust. In order to better understand the personal financial cost of TCM, we evaluated the most recent three -year history of participant's medical and TCM expe nses. 52.4 % of women and 66.9 % of men spent less t han 100\u20ac on TCM -related therapies, while 14.2 % of women and 8.3% of men spent more than 750\u20ac.

The marginal correlation network provides information about how stron gly any two variables are related without taking any other variables into account. The partial correlation network, on the o ther hand, indicates how strongly any two variables are associated if all other variables are taken into account. Naturally, partial correlations are weaker than marginal correlations, as indicated by the reduced edge size observable in figure 2. Below , we focus on partial correlations with posterior means and 95% credible intervals, as shown in figure 3. Currently , a standardised way does not exist to use post -stratification in the estimation of Bayesian Gaussian copula graphical models. We therefore post -stratified manually, subsampling our dataset with replacement using post -stratification weights and estimating the graphical model on the subsampled data. Strong positive partial correlations between vaccin e usage [13] and utilisation of booster vaccines [14] ( = 0.8 5, 95% CI = [0. 80, 0.90]), homeopathy usage [11] and propagation of homeopathy [12] ( = 0.70, 95% CI = [0.5 6, 0.84]), as well as the frequency of TCM usage [7] and money spent on TCM [10] ( = 0.6 2, 95% CI = [0.5 0, 0.72]) were observed. Interestingly, a strong positive partial correlation was also found between the perceived scientific support for TCM [8] and trust in TC M- certified medical doctors [9] ( = 0.5 9, 95% CI = [0.4 6, 0.73]). Regarding money spent on TCM between 2016 and 2019 [10], next to the strong positive partial correlation with TCM usage frequency [7], positive partial correlation s with acupuncture usage frequency [15] ( = 0.26, 95% CI = [0. 08, 0.41]), overall medical expenses [5] ( = CI [0.06, 0.37]) ( 95% [0.01, 0.32]) were observed. TCM usage frequency [7] was also positively associated with the utilisation of acupuncture [15] after adjusting for all other variables ( = 0.42, 95% CI = [0.2 7, 0.57]). Moreover, medical expenses between 2016 and 2019 [5] yielded a positive pa rtial correlation with the proclivity to get vaccinated [13] ( 0.19 , both income and TCM usage frequency [7] showed positive partial correlations with the propagation of homeopathy [12] ( = 0.2 5, 95% CI = [0.0 7, 0.43] and = 0.28, 95% CI = [0. 04, 0.51]). The usage of vaccines [ 13] showed a negativ e partial correlation with perceived scientific support for TCM [8] ( = -0.26, 95% CI age [2] also negatively correlated with to get vaccinated ( = 95% CI = [ -0.29, -0.01]). Interestingly, income [3 ] showed a negative correlation with TCM usage frequency [ 7] ( = -0.19, 95% CI = [ -0.34, -0.03]), after adjusting for all other variables. A visual depiction o f all partial correlations is shown in figure 3. While the partial correlations in figure 3 sho w the (conditional) associations between pairs of variables, figure 4 indicates how much variance of each variable can be explained by all other variables in th e model.75 This is summari sed by posterior distributions of the Bayesia n R squared measure for each variable.74 A larger R squared for a parti cular variable implies that the other variables are more relevant in predicting its value. Notably, TCM expenses and acupuncture usage frequency yielded mean R squared -values of 0.6 7 (95% CI = [0.6 1, 0.7 3]) and 0.6 5 (95% CI = [0.5 8, 0.71]), respectively. M oreover, R squared values with a mean greater than 0.50 were observed for the readiness to use booster vaccines ( R2 = 0.5 6, 95% CI = [0.5 1, 0.61]), propagation of homeopathy ( R2 = 0.5 6, 95% CI = [0. 50, 0.61]), TCM usage frequency ( = 0.5 3, 95% CI = [0.46 , 0.61]), and perceived scientific sup port for TCM ( R2 = 0.5 5, 95% CI = [0.4 7, 0.62]). .

Other sociodemographic determinants yielded lower correlations, e.g. , highest level of ( R2 = 0.33, 95% CI = [0.24, 0.43]), gender ( R2 = 0.3 1, 95% CI = [0.2 2, 0.41]), medical expenses ( R2 = 0.2 6, 95% CI = [0.1 7, 0.3 6]), and state of chronic disease ( R2 = 0.24, 95% CI = [0. 13, 0.3 7]). Interestingly, while there seems to be a particularly strong partial correlation between perceived scientific support for TCM and the trust in TCM -certified medical doctors , the R squared value of 0.3 7 (95% CI = [0. 31, 0.44]) for TCM trustworthiness is comparatively low \u2014indicating the existence of important additional variables not included in our survey. DISCUSSION The fact that the majority of respondents reported awareness of TCM indicates that the practice has been promulgated throughout the Austri an population. Furthermore, with over a third of men and over half of women reporting to have used TCM between 2016 and 2019, TCM appears to have a notable role as a health care modality within the Austrian population. This is reflected in the public perception that TCM is mostly - or completely supported by scientific evidence, with almost half of men and two thirds of women holding this view. The discrepancy between percepti on of TCM and empirical support might stem from complex socioscientific interactions and is explored in the paragraphs below. It must be noted, that even experienced readers of scientific literature migh t be obfuscated encountering the dichotomy that surrounds TCM. While TCM\u00b4s appeals to tradition stand in stark contrast to modern, evidence -based medicine \u2014an observation reaffirmed by empirical evidence \u2014 written records of TCM have still led researchers on the path to medical discoveries, namely artemisinin and arsenic trioxide .23 79 -82 However, it is important to note that these treatments reached clinical acceptance through strict ad herence to scientific principles .79 80 83 -85 TCM \u00b4s coalesced scientific existenc e likely also translates to a clinical and socioscientific setting, further diversifying public perception. Personal perception of scientific support for TCM was det ermined by asking the question : \"Do you agree with TCM being a science -backed treatment modality? \". While on the surface a simple question, an accurate response depends on a mutual understanding of the definition of science. This raises is sues as, even wit hin the domain of science, the word \"science\" encompasses a num ber of definitions, including a method of inquiry, a systematised body of knowledge, and a social construct .86 In addition, it is plausible that the public interpretation of science extends beyond the formal definitions accounted for in this study. Although there is little evidence available for the Austrian population, t his is exemplifie d in a survey of a British population , in which public attitudes towards science were recorded , and science was found to be collectively understood as a broad and ambiguous topic tantamount to technological advancement. The most popular ideas that emerged when asked to think about science included the three branches of science studied at school , i.e. physics, chemistry, and biology (24%) , and simply \" school \" (12%) . included \"chemic \"tubes \", and \"nature \".87 While a survey of this nature calls into question the public's understanding of the definition of science, it does not report on the level of science literacy. Evidence in this do main suggests that the public have mixed levels of scientific literacy. Indeed, when querying an Italian population, Bucchi and Saracino found that over a third of respondents did not know that the sun is not a planet, electrons are smaller than atoms, or that antibiotics do not kill viruses .88 Complicating th e issue of ambiguity, the superficial resemblance of TCM and conventional medicine may mislead the public into believing they uphold comparable scientific rigour. This phenomenon .

Commonly experienced in a medical setting, it is conceivable that TCM transposes an illusion of medical authenticity through authority bias .90 Altogether, TCM's historical ties in the development of conventional treatments in combination with an imprecise public perception of science ; the superficial resemblance of TCM and co nventional medicine ; and the eminence -based veil through which TCM is communicated23 could be contributing factors towards a belief that TCM is sufficiently suppo rted by scientific evidence. Future studies may benefit from pre -defining the term \" science \" with key -words or including qualifying questions to assess science literacy in their survey. Notwithstanding the disparity between perceived scientific support and the absence of credible evidence that applies to many TCM treatments, the Austrian general public's trust in TCM -certified medical doctors is high. Our data shows that 83.3 % of women and 70.2 % of men \"mostly -\" or \"completely trust\" physicians w ith a TCM degree. While efforts have been made to introduce different item scales to standardise the measurement of trust between patients and physicians, high qual ity data is scarce. Nevertheless, it seems generally accepted to distinguish between two mod alities: social trust and interpersonal trust .91 92 Covering social trust, a Dutch study conducted by van der Schnee et al. showed trust in CAM to be associated with positive media coverage, recommendation by acquaintan ces, and personal experience with CAM. Moreover, the analysis showed trust in CAM practition ers to increase with awarded institutional guarantees. 86.3% of participants reported an increase of trust should the CAM practitioners also hold a degree in conven tional medicine \u2014a finding corroborated by a study analysing a German population .59 93 Analogous to the aforementioned impact of aesthetics on perceived scientific support for TCM, the showcasing of CAM certificates and degrees , as well as partnerships with of ficial CAM associations , appears to enhance trust in TCM practitioners .59 This hypothesis aligns with our results since a strong positive partial correlation between trust in TCM doctors and perceived scientific support for TCM was observed \u2014supporting the notion tha t the perception of TCM's scientific fundament by the general public might also depend on the institutionalisation, official recognition, and certification of TCM education. Indeed, official TCM degrees can be acquired for substantial amounts of money at multiple universities, TCM schools, and educational institutions in Austria .94-98 Moreover, the influence of the scientific community and scientific journals on the portrayal of TCM has to be critically examined . For example, bought special issues in Nature (2011) and Science (2014) lend credibility and visibility to TCM practices.99 100 Regarding TCM expenses, our data show that approximately 10% of participants spent more than a total of 750\u20ac on TCM betwee n 2016 and 2019. This finding is interesting since out -of-pocket payments for medical care approximate a total of 901,25\u20ac per capita per anno in Austria .57 101 Importantly, Austria employs a compulsory health care insurance system with the possibility of optional private health care. In this context it has to be emphasi sed that in Austria the coverage of CAM by tax -financed health care insurance has be en a topic of political discourse .102 Yet, the idea of integrating CAM therapies within national health care services when there is insufficient empirical evidence to validate their efficacy and safety is not unique to Austria. This development is connected to the political and economic dimen sions of TCM.5 It is a declared goal of the Chinese Communist Party that TC M should be (i) universally accessible for the Chinese population, (ii) attract health tourists to China , and (iii) spread its influence across the world.2 4 5 Indeed, the WHO Traditional Medicine Strategy 2014 -2023 , influenced by the former WHO Director -General Margaret Chan (2006 -2017), considers \"promoting un iversal health by integrating T&CM medicine and compleme ntary medicine] services and self -health care into national health systems\"7 one o f its three main objectives . An inclusion of TCM diagnostic criteria in the ICD -11 thus makes the .

Arguably, this discrepancy is also mirrored in political decisions that enhance the credibility of C AM by encouraging its institutionalisation and integration within national health care systems. Considering the lack of evidence proving TCM's efficacy and safety, its endorsement of pharmacologically active agents \u2014and simplified authorisation thereof \u2014as w ell as the efforts made to criminalise TCM criticism in China, authorities should focus on a critical examination of TCM. Accordingly , treatments supported by empirical evidence should be pursued, and critical discourse based on scientific principles shoul d be fostered . Fur thermore, authorities should adhere to strict intellectual honesty , and place an emphasis on improving the scient ific literacy of the general public to safeguard informed patient -driven decision -making, especially in the face of potential mis- and disinfor mation . Limitations As the cross -sectional survey included retrospective components, answers are naturally prone to response - and recall bias. Moreover, as we did not record (I) the number of individuals approached in the street survey an d (II) the number of individuals that accessed our online survey, we are unable to provide a survey refusal and response rate. Nonetheless, it must be noted that upon usage of multivariate models, non-response bias does not necessarily alter results .103 In order to obtain a larger sample size, an online survey was performed in addition to the street survey. Becaus e the survey was uploaded on the website of Austria's most popular free newspaper (\" Heute \"), th e collected sample might partially reflect the characteristics of its regular readership rather than the general population. Additionally, a relative underrepresentation of male participants can be found in our study population. Thus, we post -stratified ou r sample with data deriving from \"Statistik Austria\" \u2014Austria's fe deral statistical office \u2014in order to more closely represent the Austrian general population . As our data are limited to Austria, future studies are warranted to investigate our findings on an international level.
