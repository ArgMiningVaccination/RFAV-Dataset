Why does blocking prostaglandins help relieve pain ? Prostaglandins are natural molecules that are produced in the human body during an injury or infection. When prostaglandins are secreted, they make the nerves in the area very sensitive to pain, allowing the body to realize that something is wrong. Prostaglandins also worsen inflammation. The production of prostaglandins explains for example why the ankle swells and stiffens in the event of a sprain. Ibuprofen acts on prostaglandins by blocking their production. This is why it acts on pain and relieves it effectively.

It is used in the short-term treatment of fever and pain (headaches, dental pain, muscle aches, painful periods ...). The tablets are also used in the [treatment of the] [migraine] [crisis]in adults, after at least a medical opinion. This medication should not be used in the following cases: [CONTRAINDICATIONS] [(summary)] - [history]of [allergy]or [hemorrhage]during previous - [phenylketonuria](sachet: presence of aspartame); - pregnancy (from the 6th month). Prolonged treatment or [WARNING] [(Contents)] [overdosage]of [NSAIDs may result]in serious adverse reactions. Certain situations must lead to continuation of treatment only after a medical opinion: - severe heartburn or black and foul-smelling stools that may indicate irritation or bleeding of the digestive tract; - [rash]without obvious cause; - [asthma attack]; - unusual and intense fatigue, or a sharp and significant decrease in the volume of urine in a person suffering from [heart failure], dehydration or [diuretic]treatment. Precautions are necessary in the elderly or in case of a [history]of stomach or an inhibitory effect on ovulation and are likely to decrease fertility in women. This effect is reversible upon discontinuation of treatment. Some doctors consider that anti-inflammatories can decrease the effectiveness of intrauterine devices (IUDs) and expose them to an unwanted pregnancy risk. This risk is highly controversial. Conductor: This medication may be responsible, in rare cases, for dizziness or disturbances of vision. This medication may interact with other medicines, including: [DRUG INTERACTIONS] [(summary)] - aspirin and ...): increased risk of haemorrhage; - lithium ( T\u00c9RALITHE ): increase in the level of lithium in the blood; - methotrexate. [diuretic], an [ACE inhibitor], ciclosporin. Pregnancy : [PREGNANCY AND BREAST-FEEDING] [(summary)] Adverse effects to the unborn child have been demonstrated when [NSAIDs]are used during the last 4 months of pregnancy; the risk exists even with a single intake and even if the pregnancy is over term. The use of this medication is contraindicated during this period. During the first 5 months, the effect of this medication is poorly understood: only your doctor can evaluate the possible risk of its use in your case. Breastfeeding: Ibuprofen is low in breast milk: however, as a precaution, it is not recommended during breast-feeding. In order to limit the occurrence of [DIRECTIONS FOR USE AND DOSAGE] [(summary)] [digestive disorders], this medication should be taken during meals. However, in the case of acute pain, the fasting catch ensures a faster effect. The tablets should be swallowed as they are with a glass of water, without being chewed. The contents of the sachets are dissolved in half a glass of water. Usual dosage:Pain and fever: - Adult and child over 30 kg (about 11 years): 1 tablet or sachet, to be renewed if necessary after a minimum period of 6 hours, without exceeding 3 tablets or sachets per day. In the absence of medical advice, the duration of treatment should be limited to 5 days in case of pain and 3 days in case of fever. - Adult: 1 tablet, to be taken at the beginning of the crisis. There is no need to take a tablet if the effect is insufficient. On the other hand, if the symptoms reappear, it is possible to take 1 additional tablet within a minimum delay of 8 hours between the 2 catches. Do not exceed 3 days of treatment. This 400 mg dosage is intended for use when ibuprofen 200 mg is insufficiently effective. It can nevertheless be used from the outset in the treatment of severe pain. [TIPS] [(summary)] Do not exceed the recommended [dosage]or duration of treatment recommended by your doctor or pharmacist to limit side effects. Taking this medication does not dispense with the usual measures to help cede the [migraine]attack: lie down in a dark room. This medicinal product may be freely available in certain pharmacies; nevertheless, do not hesitate to ask your pharmacist for advice. Nausea, vomiting, [POSSIBLE ADVERSE [haemorrhage]of digestive tract (bloody vomiting, black stools, or mostly imperceptible blood loss, responsible for the progressive onset of [anemia]) most often during long-term treatment duration or high dose; - [allergic reaction]: [rash], itching, [edema], [asthma in blood pressure; - [dizziness], headache; - vision disorders of anti-inflammatory drugs that are not derived from cortisone (steroids), and the best known of which is aspirin. [allergy]Skin reaction (itching, pimples, swelling) or general discomfort occurring after contact with a particular substance, use of a medication, or ingestion of food. The main forms of allergy are eczema, urticaria, asthma, angioedema and allergic shock (anaphylactic shock). Food allergy can also result in digestive disorders. [anemia]Reduction in the level of hemoglobin in the blood, which usually results in a decrease in the number of red blood cells. Iron is essential for the synthesis of hemoglobin. Iron deficiency during pregnancy, a vegetarian diet, abundant or repeated haemorrhage (menstruation) is a common cause of anemia. Other causes, more rare, are related to vitamin deficiencies of group B. [antecedent]Affection healed or always in evolution. The antecedent may be personal or family. The background is the history of a person's health. [antiplatelet agents]Medication that prevents the platelets from clumping and therefore the clots from forming. The oldest platelet antiaggregant is aspirin taken in small doses. Anti-aggregants should not be confused with anticoagulants with a different mechanism of action. [anti coagulants]Medication that prevents blood from coagulating and therefore prevents clots from forming in the blood vessels. Anticoagulants are used to treat or prevent phlebitis, pulmonary embolism, certain infarcts. They also prevent the formation of clots in the heart during rhythm disorders such as atrial fibrillation or in the case of an artificial heart valve. There are two main types of anticoagulants: - oral anticoagulants, which block the action of vitamin K (antivitamin K, or AVK) and whose effectiveness is controlled by a blood test: INR (formerly TP); - injectable anticoagulants derived from heparin, the efficacy of which can be controlled by the blood assay of anti-Xa activity, Howell's Time (TH) or Cephalin Kaolin Time (TCK) depending on the products used. A regular dosage of blood platelets is necessary throughout the life of a heparin derivative. [anti-inflammatory]Medicine that fights against inflammation. It can be either derived from cortisone (steroidal anti-inflammatory), or not derived from cortisone (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory or NSAID). [asthma]Disease characterized by difficulty breathing, often resulting in wheezing. Asthma, permanent or occurring by crisis, is due to a narrowing and inflammation of the bronchi. [beta blockers]Family of drugs used primarily in cardiology. They block the action of adrenaline (and other related hormones) on the heart, vessels and bronchi. [Crohn]inflammation of the intestine, which can cause ulcers and narrowing. It often becomes chronic and can be accompanied by persistent diarrhea and malnutrition. [diuretic]Medication allowing increased kidney water removal. Most often, this loss of water follows the loss of salts caused by the drug (salidiuretic). Diuretics are mainly used in the treatment of high blood pressure, while their mechanism of action in this disease is poorly understood. They are also prescribed in acute or chronic heart failure, edema and other rarer ailments. These drugs cause loss of sodium and potassium (except for some of them called \"potassium-sparing\"). Their prolonged administration therefore requires regular blood potassium control, to avoid heart problems that may result from hypokalemia (lack of potassium in the blood). Lack of sodium is another possible but less frequent consequence of the prolonged use of diuretics; it is also detected by a blood test. [duodenum]A part of the intestine into which food from the stomach penetrates. [skin rash]Appearance of pimples or plaques on the skin. These lesions can be due to a food, a drug, and translate an allergy or a toxic effect. Many viruses can also cause pimple eruptions: rubella, roseola and measles are the most common. [gastritis]Inflammation of the stomach favored by stress, tobacco, alcohol and certain drugs such as aspirin or anti-inflammatory drugs. [hemorrhage]Loss of blood from an artery or vein. Hemorrhage can be external, but also internal and go unnoticed. [angiotensin II inhibitor]These drugs are sometimes called sartans, for the names of the molecules belonging to this family end with sartan (losartan, candesartan, etc.). This family of drugs blocks the action of angiotensin II, a substance that increases blood pressure and tires the heart. Angiotensin II inhibitors are used to treat high blood pressure. [ACE inhibitor]This family of drugs blocks the action of an enzyme, which converts angiotensin I (naturally inactive substance) to angiotensin II. This last substance increases blood pressure and fatigue the heart. ACE inhibitors are used to treat high blood pressure, heart failure or myocardial infarction. [heart failure]Inability of the heart to fulfill its function as a pump. The main symptoms of heart failure are fatigue and shortness of breath during an effort. [Hepatic insufficiency]Inability of the liver to perform its function, which is essentially the elimination of some waste, but also the synthesis of many biological substances essential to the body: albumin, cholesterol and coagulation factors (vitamin K, etc.). [renal failure]Inability of the kidneys to eliminate waste or medicinal substances. Advanced renal insufficiency does not necessarily result in a decrease in the amount of urine excreted. Only a blood test and creatinine dosage may reveal this disease. [lupus erythematosus]Skin disease causing redness of the central part of the face. There are two main forms: discoid lupus (only cutaneous) and disseminated lupus (associated with lesions of the deep organs). [migraine]Special headache usually affecting the right or left half of the head, often associated with a fear of light and noise. [blood count]The count measures the number of red blood cells (red blood cells), white blood cells (leukocytes) and platelets in the blood. The blood formula specifies the percentage of different white lymph causing localized swelling. [phenylketonuria]An inherited disease that is characterized by the absence of an enzyme and that leads to the accumulation in the blood of a toxic product. Screening is systematic at birth. Treatment is based on a specific diet during early childhood. [dosage]Quantity and distribution of the dose of a drug according to the age, weight and general condition of the patient. [allergic reaction]Reaction due to hypersensitivity of the organism to a drug. Allergic reactions can take a wide variety of aspects: urticaria, angioedema, eczema, eruption of pimples resembling measles, etc. Anaphylactic shock is a generalized allergic reaction that causes discomfort due to a sudden drop in blood pressure. [ulcerative colitis]Inflammatory disease of the rectum and colon, which evolves by flare-ups. Each flare is accompanied by fever, bloody stools. [overdose]Excessive intake of a drug may result in an increase in the intensity of adverse effects or even in the development of specific adverse effects. This overdose may result from accidental or voluntary poisoning for suicide, so consult your local Poison Control Center (listed in the appendix to the book). However, in most cases, overdose is the result of an error in the understanding of the prescription, or the search for an increase in efficacy by exceeding the recommended dosage. Finally, untimely self-medication may lead to excessive absorption of the same substance contained in different drugs. Some drugs are particularly prone to this risk because they are (wrongly) considered to be harmless: vitamins A and D, aspirin, etc. Stopping or decreasing drug intake helps to remove the disorders associated with an overdose. [crisis management]As opposed to long-term treatment, short-term and episodic treatment in the context of seizure or outbreak diseases. [transaminases]Enzymes dosed in the blood, which rate rises during some hepatitis. They are included in blood tests as SGOT and SGPT or ASAT and ALAT. [digestive disorders]Set of symptoms indicating irritation or malfunction of the digestive tract. One or more disorders may be present: nausea, vomiting, aerophagia, abdominal pain, heartburn, bloating, flatulence, diarrhea or constipation, etc. Antibiotics can promote candidiasis, often responsible for digestive disorders. [ulcer]Injury of skin, mucous membranes or cornea. - Leg ulcer: chronic wound due to poor circulation of blood. - Gastroduodenal ulcer: a localized wound in the mucosa of the stomach or duodenum due to excess acidity and very often to the presence of a bacterium (Helicobacter pylori). The ulcer is favored by stress, alcohol, smoking and certain medications (aspirin, NSAIDs, etc.). [dizziness]Symptom that can mean an impression of loss of balance (common sense) or, more strictly, a sense of rotation on oneself or the environment (medical sense).

HEALTH EDUCATION COUNCIL \"WHAT TO DO IN THE EVENT OF FEVER\": The normal temperature of the body is variable from one individual to another and between 36.5 \u00b0 C and 37.5 \u00b0 C. An increase of more than 0.8 \u00b0 C is considered a fever. In adults and children over 30 kg (11-12 years of age): if the disorder is too troublesome, you can take a medication containing ibuprofen at the indicated dosage. With this medication, the fever should drop rapidly. However: \u00b7 if other signs appear (such as a rash), \u00b7 if the fever persists for more than 3 days or if it worsens, \u00b7 if the headache becomes violent, or in case of vomiting, CONSULT YOUR DOCTOR IMMEDIATELY. \"WHAT TO DO IN CASE OF PAIN\": \u00b7 In the absence of improvement after 5 days of treatment. \u00b7 If the pain returns regularly. \u00b7 If it is accompanied by fever. \u00b7 If she wakes you up at night. CONSULT YOUR DOCTOR IMMEDIATELY. \"WHAT TO DO IN THE EVENT OF MIGRAINE\": What is migraine? Migraine is a disease that results in severe headaches, occurring in seizures, for 4 to 72 hours and can be repeated several times a month. It can sometimes be preceded by visual and / or sensory signs called aura (impression of luminosity or flicker of the visual field, illusion that a fly seems to cross the visual field ...). Migraine or headache? 1. Your headache evolves in crises from a few hours to 3 days (without treatment). Between crises, you do not suffer from the head. Yes No 2. You have presented at least 5 crises in your life. Yes No 3. Your headache has at least 2 of the following characteristics: Yes No located at one side of the head, pulsatile, increased by effort (climb stairs, run, cough), the painful intensity of the crisis goes from strong to very strong. 4. Your headache is accompanied by at least 1 of the following signs: Yes No desire to vomit or vomit, discomfort with light (photophobia) and / or noise (phonophobia). If you answered YES: the 4 questions: you are surely migraineous, to 3 questions: you are probably migraineous, 1 or 2 questions: you are probably not migraine. Discuss these results with your doctor so that he / she can confirm the diagnosis and agree with you the most appropriate treatment. How to deal with crises? Certain elements such as fatigue, stress, food (chocolates, alcohol, etc.), sensory factors (noise, flashing light, perfumes, etc.) or physiological factors such as menstruation are likely to trigger migraine attacks. Knowledge of the triggering factors as well as the warning signs that can precede the crisis makes it possible to start a treatment early (ideally within an hour after its start and while it is still of mild intensity). The earlier the treatment, the more effective and often short-lived (early treatment limits migraine recurrence). Note on a diary or notebook the date of your seizures and their duration, the intensity of the pain, the triggering factors and the medications used for each attack will help your doctor assess your migraine and its treatment. A failure on a first crisis does not necessarily mean failure on subsequent crises. The efficacy of 400mg ibuprofen should be evaluated on 2 or 3 seizures. To help you, you can answer the following questions and discuss them with your doctor and pharmacist. Are you relieved 2 hours after taking? Yes No Do you have side effects (digestive or other)? Yes No Do you use a single medication intake? Yes No Can you resume your usual activities 2 hours after taking? Yes No When to see your doctor?
