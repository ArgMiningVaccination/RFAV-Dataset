This procedure also lists the minimum requirements for acceptance of incoming cells to the BDP (R&D, PA/QC, or GMP areas. 2.0 Scope This procedure applies to Leidos Biomedical Research , Inc., BDP personnel responsible for receiving and/or testing incoming cells. The procedure does not apply to cells obtained from a patient or healthy donor (e.g. apheresis) that are intended for manufacture or development of a cell therapy product. 3.0 Authority and Responsibility 3.1 The BDP Director of Regulatory Compliance has the authority to define this procedure. 3.2 BDP Process Development Personnel are responsible for ensuring that cells to be transferred to GMP manufacturing areas for banking have been tested per specifications in the applicable section of this procedure. Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD Biopharmaceutical Development Program Qualification of Cells and CGMP Cell Banks SOP 13200 Rev. 09 Page 2 of 14 3.3 The BDP Production Manager responsible for cells, along with the assigned Project Scientist, are responsible for ensuring adherence to this procedure for each particular project. 3.4 BQA is responsible for quality oversight of this procedure. 4.0 Definitions 4.1 Quarantine/I ncoming Cells - Cells that have not been tested for adventitious agents or identity or have only been tested by non -GMP protocols. 4.2 Accession Cell Bank (ACB) - A pre -GMP cell bank used to establish the Master Cell Bank (MCB ). The ACB requires a traceable, documented history that is sufficient to support the preparation of the MCB and eventual CMC section of the IND . 4.3 Master Cell Bank - An aliquot of a single pool of cells which have been prepared in compliance with CGMP's, from the selected cell clone under defined conditions, dispensed into multiple containers and stored under defined conditions. The MCB is used to derive working cell banks. 4.4 Working Cell Bank - The WCB is prepared in compliance with CGMPs from aliquots of a homogen eous suspension of cells obtained from culturing one or more vials of the MCB under defined culture conditions. 4.5 End of Production Cells - EOP Cells are cells at the limit of In Vitro cell age or beyond the passage number used for production. For fermentat ion runs where induction is performed, take a sample immediately prior to induction. If the bacterial EOP bank is vialed within 1 hour of the time the sample is taken, the sample may be stored at 2 -8\u00baC until it is vialed. Otherwise, continue incubating t he sample at the temperature and agitation rate used for the last seed flask stage of the fermentation process until the bank is vialed. 5.0 General Considerations for Cells and GMP Cell Banks Not Covered by this SOP 5.1 Provisions must be made to document the rec eipt and handling of any types of cells not specifically covered in this SOP (e.g., by deviation) until such time as those types may be incorporated into this SOP. 6.0 Testing and Acceptance Criteria for Quarantine/Incoming Bacterial and Yeast Cells 6.1 Submit in coming bacterial or yeast cells received by the BDP for culture purity testing prior to process development and scale -up in the CGMP bacterial cell production areas. Quarantined cells may be used for Research and Development use only and not CGMP production until released by BQA. BQA is responsible for composing a release letter of quarantined cells for GMP procedures. 6.2 Outsourced tests shall be performed by BQA qualified vendors whenever possible. 6.3 The cells must be a pure culture. In the event that a culture is impure, the recei ving party may return the culture to the requestor and request a pure culture. If this option is not exercised, the receiving party is responsible for obtaining or preparing a pure culture and submitting it for DNA sequencing prior to further work with th e culture. Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD Biopharmaceutical Development Program Qualification of Cells and CGMP Cell Banks SOP 13200 Rev. 09 Page 3 of 14 6.4 Cultures obtained from audited CGMP or Good Laboratory Practices ( GLP)-compliant facilities which have either provided a certificate of analysis or traceable, audited CGMP or GLP-compliant test results to the BDP, do not need to have testing r epeated as described in Steps 6.1 through 6.3, provided these tests were performed in a qualified CGMP/GLP laboratory according to current technical \"state -of-the art\" standards. 6.5 The Project Scientist shall consult with the Director of BQA (or designee) and the appropriate National Cancer Institute ( NCI) Project Manager regarding testing of incoming cell lines which were obtained from a CGMP -compliant commercial vendor prior to initiation of testing. 7.0 Testing and Acceptance Criteria of Bacterial and Yeast Accession Cell Banks 7.1 Required tests for a bacterial and yeast cell accession bank are culture purity, DNA sequencing, and usually product expression level. 7.2 The accession cell banks must be tested and found to be pure and capable of an acceptable product expression level, to be defined by the Project Scientist, if appropriate. 7.3 This testing must be performed before the accession bank can be used to create the MCB. 7.4 Outsourced tests shall be performed by BQA qualified vendors whenever possible. 8.0 Testing and Acceptance Criteria of Bacterial and Yeast Master, Working, and End of Production Cell Banks 8.1 Submit test requests to qualify cells to the QC laboratory following SOP 22002 - Request for Quality Control Testing.

Testing should include DNA sequencing, restriction mapping, and strain typing (or other supplementary test for identity). Addi tional testing of the plasmid or bacterial /yeast strain ( e.g. PCR, Southern Blot, etc.) may be requested by the Project Scientist. 8.3.3.1 If the final product is the plasmid DNA or is expressed from plasmid DNA , the entire plasmid must be sequenced. If the final product is a protein expressed by a chromosomally localized exogenous gene, critical regions for analysis include the inserted gene and its flanking regions encompassing critical regulatory elements must be sequenced (e.g., promoter, initiation and transl ation site, translation termination codons/transcription termination site, antibiotic resistance genes if any). Additional sequencing may be performed for protein products expressed in prokaryotes per the Project Scientists' discretion. 8.3.3.2 Plasmid copy numbe r should be determined and compared with end of production cells to show plasmid stability. 8.3.3.3 Restriction mapping of plasmids by agarose gel electrophoresis should include the following: (Refer to SOP 22149 - Restriction Endonuclease Enzyme Digestion Gel Electrophoresis (A.G.E.) and Detection of Nucleic Acids and SOP 22120 - Digital Gel Imaging Using the Kodak 400 Image Station ). Appropriately sized molecular markers. Undigested plasmid. Unique site digestion and plasmid linearization within the plasmid insert region (if reasonably possible). One or two restriction enzyme digestions (as appropriate) of the plasmid insert's 5' and 3' ends to demonstra te the ability to remove the therapeutic insert from the plasmid vector ; and/or a 3-5 restriction site digestion(s) of the entire plasmid using multiple enzymes or a multi -site enzyme. Multi -site enzymes should be chosen so that no fragments are <100 bp or are within 200 bp of one another. Post-restriction fragment numbers and sizes should approximate the expected fragment size based on the plasmid sequence information. Refer to SOP 10001 - Project Acceptance and Completion of Projects for Clinical Use. Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD Biopharmaceutical Development Program Qualification of Cells and CGMP Cell Banks SOP 13200 Rev. 09 Page 6 of 14 8.4 The bacterial or yeast Working Cell Bank (WCB) must be qualified by assays for microbial content ( 22713 - Morphology ), Gram stain ( SOP 22137 - Preparation of a Gram Stain: Manual Method ) and identity of the cells (e.g., Vitek, RiboTyping, BacSeq, or other qualified automated identification system), restriction mapping, and cell viability. The BDP Project Scientist may request additional specif ic testing. Cod on repeat /copy number and stability are determined for prokaryotic constructs that are chromosomally encoded ( i.e. lack plasmids). 8.5 The integrity of the construct in bacterial or yeast End of Production Cells (EOP) must be determined at leas t once . (Analysis is not required at the end of each production run). EOP cells are qualified by assays for microbial content ( 22713 - sequencing, contamination with bacteriophages, Shiga -like toxin, and/or toxin gene detection (where appropriate) , cell viability, plasmid copy number, and plasmid genetic stability by retention of antibiotic resistance or other methods . The BDP Project Scientist may request additional specific testing. 8.6 Outsourced tests shall be performed by BQA qualified vendors whenever possible. 8.7 Acceptance Criteria for Bacterial and Yeast Master, Working, and End of Production Cell Banks . 8.7.1 Bacterial and Yeast Cell Banks must exhibit the correct cell mo rphology and Gram stain designation, as discerned by the purity and Gram stain assays. Minimum cell viability is determined on a project -by-project basis as determined by the BDP Project Scientist. 8.7.2 DNA sequence analysis will be performed on the MCB and E OP cells (refer to SOP 22111 - Submitting DNA for Sequencing and DNA Sequence Analysis ). If the DNA sequence analysis reveals mutations, insertions, deletions, or other sequence discrepancies, the BDP Project Scientist, Director of BQA, and the Program an d Technical Director of the BDP must be notified immediately. The Project Scientist will also notify the NCI Project Officer to determine, with the Director of BQA and the Program and Technical Director of BDP, if the project can proceed. Upon approval, the MCB sequence will become the official BDP reference sequence. The EOP sequence should be comparable to the MCB and reference DNA sequences. 8.7.3 The restriction map should conform to expected fragment sizes. EOP fragment sizes should be comparable to the MCB and the expected fragment sizes. 8.7.4 There must be no contamination with adventitious bacteriophages, toxins, other Plasmid copy number and plasmid integrity, determined from the end of production cells, should be consistent with plasmid copy number and plasmid integrity of the master cell bank (and, if applicable, the working cell bank).

The third cell line for testing should be the same species as MCB line. 3 This could be karyotyping, isoenzyme analysis, STR/CODIS, or any currently accepted identity test to confirm species of origin. Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD Biopharmaceutical Development Program Qualification of Cells and CGMP Cell Banks SOP 13200 Rev. 09 Page 10 of 14 4 Transgene sequencing is only required for integrated transgene where the source construct sequence cannot be confirmed or where it is desirable to determine the number and location of transgene integration sites. 5 Specifically, oncogenic HPV strains 16 and 18 should be included in any HPV assay panel. 6 If retroviral testing is shown to be infectious, co -cultivation is performed on human cells. 7 Tumorigenicity is generally only performed for Human epithelial cells or live virus vaccines. Tumorigenicity is only required for cell lines where the tumorigenici ty is unknown. If a cell line is known to be tumorigenic testing for this is not required. 8 Bovine/porcine adventitious agent testing should be performed where there are components used that could possibly introduce such agents. 11.1.2 Additional tests may be required depending on the cultivation history of the individual cells and whether cross -contamination opportunities by other cell lines existed. For example, primate cell lines that have been in contact with any simian materials should be screened for sim ian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), simian T lymphotrophic virus (STLV), and simian foamy virus. Cell lines from non -human primates should be additionally tested for the presence of simian retroviruses (SRV). Cell lines exposed to bovine or porcine compone nts (e.g., serum, trypsin) should be tested for bovine or porcine adventitious agents. A requirement to test for Hepatitis A on human cell lines has also been suggested when the donor history is unknown for the cell line. Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) has b een suggested for certain human epithelial cell lines. Please consult with the BDP Project Scientist and Regulatory Affairs to decide if any additional testing is required based on the derivation history of a particular cell line. 11.2 Recommended QC Testing o f Mammalian/Insect Working Cell Banks 11.2.1 It is recommended that the Working Cell Bank be qualified by the following tests. 2 (The WCB may be created before testing on the MCB is complete.) Sterility Mycoplasma Genetic be karotyping, isoenzyme analysis, STR/CODIS, or any currently accepted identity test to confirm the species of origin. 2 Bovine/porcine adventitious agent test ing should be performed where there are components used that could possibly introduce such agents . Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD Biopharmaceutical Development Program Qualification of Cells and CGMP Cell Banks SOP 13200 Rev. 09 Page 11 of 14 11.3 Required QC Testing of Mammalian/Insect End of Production Cells is listed in Table 5. Table 5: Mammalian/Insect Cell End Of Production Cell Testing 1 This could be karotyping, isoenzyme analysis, STR/CODIS, or any currently accepted identity test to confirm the species of origin. 2 Tumorigenicity is generally only performed for Human epithelial cells or live virus vaccines.

For example, primate cell lines that have been in contact with any simian mater ials should be screened for simian simian T lymphotrophic virus (STLV), and foamy virus. Cell lines from non - human primates should be additional tested for the presence of simian retroviruses (SRV). A requirement to test for Hepatitis A on human cell lines has also been suggested when the donor history is unknown for the cell line. Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) has been suggested for certain human epithelial cell lines . If any viral tests were positive with the Master Cell Ba nk, it is also advisable to retest them at the EOP stage and perform a co -cultivation assay. Please consult with the Leidos Biomedical Research , Inc. BDP Project Scientist and Regulatory Affairs to decide if any additional testing is required based on the derivation history of the particular cell line. 11.4 Outsourced tests shall be performed by BQA qualified vendors whenever possible. 11.5 Acceptance Criteria for Mammalian/Insect Master, Working, and End of Production Cell Banks 11.5.1 The CGMP cell banks must be sterile and free of mycoplasma contamination, per 21 CFR 610. 11.5.2 The identity test must conform to species specific identification. 11.5.3 Endogenous retroviruses and lysogenic virus sequences may be expected in certain cell lines. Viral contamination should be quantified and identified if possible, to establish the extent of virus clearance achievable through process purification. 11.5.4 Material contaminated with LCM, reovirus, Sendai virus, Hantaan, HTLV -1, or not be used by the BDP . Consult with the Director of QA. PA/QC, and NCI Project Manager for use of cells contaminated with any viruses. 12.0 Documentation 12.1 Approved Assay Profiles are prepared for CGMP Cell Banks by Leidos Biomedical Research , Inc., BDP Process Analytics with input from the Project Scientist. 12.2 An appr oved Certificate of Analysis is prepared by Leidos Biomedical Research , Inc., BDP Process Analytics that lists test results. 13.0 References and Related Documents Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Part 610: General Biological Products Standards.
