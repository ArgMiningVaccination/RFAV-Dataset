PROCEDURES 6.1. Overview . The procedures contained in this Inst ruction pertain to actions to be taken before, during, and after deployments. For purposes of this Instruction, th e fourth definition of deployment in Reference (k) applie s. Deployment is defined as: 9DoDI 6490.03, August 11, 2006 \"The relocation of forces and materiel to desired operational areas. Deployment encompasses all activities from origin or home station through destination, specifically including intra-continental Unite d States, intertheater, and intratheater movement legs, staging, and holding areas.\" 6.2. Health Risk Assessment and Risk Management . Health risk assessments shall be conducted as part of the risk management processes of the Military Services. The risk management process shall be institutionalized and be an inherent part of all deployment health operations (before, during, and after deployment) to address health threats in deployed environments. 6.2.1. Procedures shall be established to en sure health risk assessments and risk management decisions are documented, arch ived, and periodica lly reevaluated. 6.2.2. Health risk assessments are conducted to anticipate, identif y, and assess health threats; develop controls and c ountermeasures; make risk decisi ons; and implement controls to mitigate unavoidable health threats. 6.2.3. Health risk assessments use inform ation from sources such as OEH site assessments, Preliminary Hazard Assessments (PLHAs), industrial hazard assessments, environmental baseline surveys, health surveilla nce activities, medical intelligence products, lessons learned, and other availa ble data for the deployment area ( Reference s (s), ( w), and (x))(References (s) and (w)) . At the minimum, consult the Services' deployment health surveillance support hubs such as the Air Force Institute fo r Operational Health United States Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine , Navy Environmental Health Center Navy Marine Corps Public Health Center , and U.S. Army Center for Health Prom otion and Preventive Medicine U.S. Army Institute for Public Health for deployment OEH historical exposure and monitoring data, and mission and site information; AFMIC (via su pporting intelligence office or organization) for current intelligence on foreign medical capabilitie s, infectious disease threats, environmental health risks, toxic industria l chemical threats, and developments in biotechnology and biomedical subjects of military importance; DoD Veterina ry Service Activity for food and bottled water sanitation audit information; a nd the Defense Pest Management Information Analysis Center, for information on animals and plants that may impact the DoD mission. Other sources of information to be considered includ e the World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). 6.2.4. Health risk communication plans shall be developed as part of the health risk assessment and risk management process before, during, and after deployments. 6.3. Pre-Deployment Phase 6.3.1. Pre-Deployment Health Activities . Pre-deployment health activities are based on DoD and Service policies and the health risk assessm ents for the joint operat ions area or area of operations and for the specific deployment loca tion. Pre-deployment health activities are found in Attachment 1 to Enclosure 4. 10DoDI 6490.03, August 11, 2006 6.3.1.1. An overall health risk assessment for the joint operations area or area of operations must be accomplished before each de ployment to identify the deployment-specific health threats and appropriate protective measur es, and determine the c ontent of health risk communication messages and materials, including pre-deployment health threat briefings. Specific health risk countermeasures (e.g., immu nizations, prophylactic medications, or personal protective equipment) will be based on the heal th threats or potential health threats. 6.3.1.2. If the COCOM has not completed a heal th risk assessment, then the Service component must accomplish it along with its site-s pecific health risk assessments to identify deployment-specific health threats and determine a ppropriate protective measures and health risk communications. 6.3.1.3. For outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) deployments greater than 30 days with non-fixed U.S. medical treatment facilities (MTFs), al l pre-deployment health activities apply. (See Attachment 1 to Enclosure 4 and Table E4.T1.) 6.3.1.4. For OCONUS deployments of 30 days or less, OCONUS deployments with fixed U.S. MTFs, and continental United States (CONUS) deployments, pre-deployment health activities are based on the health threats identifie d as part of the health risk assessments as described in paragraph 6.2.3. 6.3.1.5. The following pre-deployment health activities are required for all deployments defined in paragraph 6.3.1.4: 6.3.1.5.1. Administer deployment-specific immunizations, prophylaxis, FHPPPs; 6.3.1.5.3. Issue personal protective equi pment as required by occupational specialty or threat to deploying personnel; and 6.3.1.5.4. Conduct health threat briefings wh enever health thr eats are identified and/or protective measures are required. 6.3.2. Additional deployment health activities, as shown in Table E4.T1, are based on the health risk assessments and the decisions of the COCOM commander, Service commander, or commander exercising operational control. Adequa te measures must be implemented to provide the necessary level of health protection for deployed personnel. 6.4. Deployment Phase . The deployment phase begins when advanced party or initial cadre personnel arrive into the deployment area. 6.4.1. Deployment Health Activi ties (During Deployment) 11DoDI 6490.03, August 11, 2006 6.4.1.1. For OCONUS deployments greater th an 30 days with non-fixed U.S. MTFs, all the deployment health activ ities apply. (See Table E4.T2.) 6.4.1.2. For OCONUS deployments of 30 days or less, OCONUS deployments with fixed U.S. MTFs, and CONUS deployments, deploym ent health activities are based on the health threats identified during the deployment (as desc ribed in subparagraph 6.4.1.3.), the health risk assessment, and the decisions of the COCOM commander, Service component commander, or commander exercising operational control. 6.4.1.3. Deployment health activities are ba sed on the pre-deployment health risk assessment of the health threats for the joint opera tions area or area of ope rations and the specific deployment location and should be updated as th e deployment proceeds based on health risk assessments, OEH site assessments, routine, a nd incident-driven monitoring and sampling, and other health surveillan ce activities. The minimum deploym ent health activiti es are found in Enclosure 4. If health threats increase or can be anticipated to increa se during the deployment, commanders should implement additional deployment health activities to ensure personnel are adequately monitored and protected. 6.4.1.4. OEH site assessments, site reconnais sance, and food and water vulnerability assessments are conducted to validate actual or potential health threats, evaluate exposure pathways, and determine courses of action and count ermeasures to control or reduce the health threats and protect the health of deployed personnel. See E4.A2 for guidance on conducting OEH activities during the deployment phase. The DoD-approved or Service-approved automated health information management system(s) shall be used to capture OEH monitoring data. 6.4.2. Once-Daily Location Tracking of Personnel . During deployments, a process will be in place to record once-daily individual serv ice member locations. Se e Enclosure 5 for data and reporting requirements. 6.4.3. Deployment Health Exposure and Monitoring Data Documentation 6.4.3.1. All deployment patient encount ers and significant occupational, environmental, and incident exposure data mu st be documented on an SF 600 or equivalent (electronically, when available). Reports from OEH or CBRN exposure incidents that result in an acute illness or that have the potential to cau se latent illness will be included in the patient records of those individuals affect ed or possibly exposed. File in the deployment health record (DD Form 2766) or equivalent. (S ee paragraphs E4.A2.6. and E4.A2.7.) 6.4.3.2. Deployment occupational and environmental area monitoring and sampling results must be documented. Submit results via DOEHRS data portalSubmit results via MESL or per DoD- or Service-specific data collection system and Table E4.T4. (See E4.A2 .8.)(See paragraph E4.A2.7.) 6.5.1. Post-Deployment Health Activities 6.5.1.1. For OCONUS deployments greater th an 30 days with non-fixed U.S. MTFs, all the post-deployment health activ ities apply. (See Table E4.T3.) 6.5.1.2. For OCONUS deployments of 30 days or less, OCONUS deployments with fixed U.S. MTFs, and CONUS deployments, post- deployment health activities are based on the health threats identified during the deployment, th e health risk assessment, and the decisions of the combatant commander, Service commander, or commander exercising operational control. 6.5.2. Post-Deployment Health Surveillance 6.5.2.1. Exposure to environmental health threats may have acute, chronic, or latent effects, and, when indicated, long -term medical surveillance should be conducted to detect latent diseases. (Consult References (q) and DoD 6055.5 -M (Reference (af))DoD 6055.05-M (Reference (ae)) for guidance.) 6.5.2.2. Health surveillance data are used to document any occurrence of disease or health outcomes due to exposures, conduct ep idemiological investigations, determine new prevention strategies and countermeasures for curr ent or future deployments, and develop health risk communication materials. 7.

(See http://www.pdhealth .mil) Post-Deployment Health Clinical Practice Guideline (PDH-CPG). (See http://www.pdhea lth.mil/guidelines /default.asp). This evaluation shall ideally be conducted by the individual's primary care mana ger or team (or other authorized provider) and will be documented using the PDHCPG PDH-CPG diagnostic Internati onal Classification of Diseases code V70.5_6 in the DoD electronic patient medical record or other automated patient- tracking program. E4.A3.2.4. Medical Follow-up E4.A3.2.4.1. Post-Deployment Health Clinical Practice Guideline . Positive responses require the use of supplemental assessment tools and/or referrals for medical consultation. The provider shall document concerns and referral needs and discuss resources available to help resolve any post-deployment health issues , based on the DoD guidance in the PDHCPG. E4.A3.2.5. Post-Deployment Follow-Up for Reserve Component Members E4.A3.2.5.1. Reserve Component members retu rning from a deployment, who require a more detailed medical evaluation or treatment may, with the member 's consent, be kept on active duty until they are fit for duty or processed th rough the Disability Evaluation System. The member may request to be released from active duty before completing the Line of Duty (LOD) medical treatment and possible Disability Evalua tion System processing. A Reserve Component member who is subsequently released from active duty before resolution of an LOD health condition is still entitled to treatment through th e military health care sy stem and processing for LOD condition through the Disability Evaluation System, if warranted. Once the member is released from active duty and returned to his/her Reserve unit, LOD care and follow through of the Disability Evaluation System, if required, wi ll be coordinated with the member's unit of assignment. Ensure Reserve Component person nel are made aware of how to access follow-up care for Service-connected health issues. E4.A3.2.5.2. All Reserve Component members, before release from active duty, shall: E4.A3.2.5.2.1. Maintain copies of the DD Form 214, \"Certificate of Release of Discharge from Active Duty\" (once received ); the DD Form 2697, \"Report of Medical Assessment,\" and the DD Form 2796. E4.A3.2.5.2.2. Maintain copies of any doc umentation of deployment health care encounters filed in their permanent medical record. E4.A3.2.6. Integration of Medical a nd Exposure Documentation . Integrate the DD Forms 2766 and copies of the DD Forms 2795 and 2796, documentation of theater inpatient and outpatient health care encounter s, environmental and occupational exposure summaries (SF 600), and incident documentation with the individuals' permanent medi cal health records within 30 days of redeployed personnel returning to a demobilization site or home station. For Reserve Component members, these records should be returned to the medical re cord custodian at the member's Reserve unit of assignment. DoDI 6490.03, August 11, 2006 ATTACHMENT 3 31 E4.A3.2.7. Post-Deployment Tuberculosis Screening . Tuberculosis screening shall be based on the potential of a high -risk exposure to tuberc ulosis or per COCOM or Service component policy. E4.A3.2.8. Post-Deployment Serum Specimens . As part of the redeployment process, when required, a serum sample shall be obtained from each individual no later than 30 days after arrival at the demobilization site, home stati on, or in-patient medical treatment facility (preferably during the face-to-face health a ssessment) and forwarded to the DoD Serum Repository using the existing trans-shipment cen ters. Serum samples for personnel separating from active duty, including Reserve Component members who are demobilizing, should be obtained during demobilization. Individuals must be informed if the post-deployment serum sample will be tested for HIV. E4.A3.2.9. Biomonitoring . The need for biomonitoring will be based on the deployment health threats, possible exposures , and available bioassays. Use References (af) and/or (aj), as appropriate. E4.A3.2.10. Post-Deployment Health Debrie fings and Risk Communications . A health threat de-briefing must be provided to re deploying or redeployed DoD personnel during in-theater medical out-processing or followi ng a deployment. Post-deployment health debriefings inform personnel of any health-rela ted medical, occupational, environmental, or CBRN exposures that they may have experienced ; address individual concerns and information about required medical follow-up; and help personnel reintegrate and ad just back to routine activities following a deployment. E4.A3.2.11. Post-Deployment Medical Surveillance . Appropriate medical surveillance should be conducted to detect emerging (latent) health conditions on redeployed personnel. (See References (af) and (aj).) E4.A3.2.12. Post-Deployment Health Reassessment (DD Form 2900) . Complete DD Forms 2900, \"Post-Deployment Health Reassessment (P DHRA),\" when required. A DD Form 2900 will be administered to each redeployed individu al within 90 to 180 days after return to home station from a deployment that required completi on of a post-deployment health assessment. For individuals who received wounds or injuries that required hospita lization or extended treatment before returning to home station, the reassessment will be administered 90 to 180 days following their return home. After the DD Form 2900 is completed, a trained heal th care provider will discuss health concerns indicated on the form an d determine if referrals are required. Educate individuals on post-deployment h ealth readjustment issues and provide information on resources available for assistance. The original of th e completed DD Form 2900 must be placed in the deployed individual's permanent medical record. Submit copies of the completed DD Forms 2900 electronically to the DMSS. Services may require submission of the forms to DMSS via their surveillance hubs. E4.A3.2.13. Post-Deployment OEH Activities .

During deployments, a process will be in place to record once-daily individual Service member locations. R ecord once-daily locations in either: six-digit grid coordinates, latitude/longi tude or geographi c location codes as a \"location record.\" Once an initial in-theater location record is established in the Service-specific system of record for each newly arrived individual, s ubsequent changes are required only when the individual changes their previously recorded once-daily location or wh en the Service member departs the theater. Location records will help determine the population at risk for occupational and environmental exposures, for any associated medical follow-up required, and for reporting to OSD. Location records shall be electronically reported to the DMDC via the Service-specific system of record (at the SECRET level and belo w) at least weekly. The DMDC system will have the capability to create re ports on individuals and units fo r specified locations and dates. E5.2. Deployment Location Data E5.2.1. Personnel/Location Data . Each unit deployed in a theater of operations shall establish, maintain, and report a daily accountability or when changes in location occur of all personnel assigned, attached, or temporary duty or temporary additional duty to the unit, along with their once-daily location reco rds. Location data is expresse d in six-digit grid coordinate, latitude/longitude coordinates, or geog raphic location code. (See Table E5.T1.) E5.2.2. Data Currency . While this information need not be submitted to DMDC in real time, it will be reported to DMDC (at the SECRET leve l and below) via the Serv ice-specific system of record at least weekly. E5.2.3. Data Classification . Personnel and operational data ma y be classified or unclassified as directed by the Joint Staff or the Combatant or Service component commander. DMDC maintains classified data at the SECRET leve l and below. COCOM commanders or Service component commanders will retain all location records for missions that exceed the SECRET classification. When these records are downgrad ed to the SECRET level of classification (or lower), they will be transmitted electronically to DMDC for archiving via the Services' system of record. E5.2.4.
