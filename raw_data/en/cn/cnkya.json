He also is benefiting from new glucose sensor technology available at NorthShore University HealthSystem (NorthShore). It provides him with instant feedback to manage his Type 2 diabetes. \"It can be difficult to control your blood sugar levels,\" said Alexander, who developed diabetes at age 17. \"This sensor is a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system. It tells me what's going on all day long with my blood sugar levels, so I can more proactively control it.\" \"The CGM sensor monitors glucose levels in the interstitial fluid directly under the skin every five minutes,\" explained NorthShore Endocrinologist Herman Blomeier, MD, who holds an academic title at the Pritzker School of Medicine. \"It communicates wirelessly via a transmitter on the sensor to a receiver or monitor, which may include an insulin pump, to help control blood sugar throughout the day.\" In Alexander's case, the technology has improved his blood sugar variations significantly. In addition to providing information on glucose levels in real time and sending this information to an insulin pump, the innovative technology also gives patients and physicians the opportunity to monitor trends over time and better manage diabetes. \"We used to base treatment decisions on only four or five readings a day,\" noted Dr. Blomeier. \"But now we have 288 data points per day to see how insulin, exercise and diet impact a patient's glycemic control.\" According to NorthShore Certified Diabetes Educator Harriet Salzberg, patients using CGM still need to check their blood sugar with a glucose meter a minimum of two to four times a day. \"But CGM helps them see a pattern to their blood sugar readings,\" she explained, adding that with new technology some patients will be able to use the system with a smartphone or smartwatch. \"This new technology has freed me up,\" added Alexander. \"With it, I can go about my normal, everyday activities and I don't have to stop and take a blood sugar reading. Most of all, I don't have to worry about my diabetes getting out of control.\"Frontiers in Diabetes Management By Martha Floberg Jerome Alexander is more in tune with his diabetes, thanks to NorthShore's latest technology tools.

An accomplished equestrian, Vannatta, 44, was at a horse show in Florida last December when she suddenly \"felt completely out of it\" and knew something was wrong. A friend took her back to the barn, where she called Vannatta's husband Jeremy at home in Evanston. \"I knew immediately something was amiss. Jill sounded drunk and not at all like herself. I had to get somebody to take her to a hospital,\" said Jeremy Vannatta. \"Two hours later, I got a call and learned they had found a mass in her brain.\" Jeremy Vannatta was in Florida the next morning. Following a procedure to insert a shunt to relieve some of the pressure on her brain, Jill Vannatta was on a plane home to Chicago, which was met by an ambulance that took her to NorthShore Evanston Hospital's Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Adv ANced t ecHNiqUe foR HARd-to-Re AcH tU moRS The couple met with Julian Bailes, MD, the Bennett-Tarkington Chairman of Neurosurgery and renowned Surgical Director of NorthShore Neurological Institute. \"In the ICU, many people told us what good hands we were in with Dr. Bailes,\" said Jeremy Vannatta. Dr. Bailes opted to let the swelling go down a bit more and give the Vannattas' three children a chance to see their mother before surgery the next day.

The Next Level of Brain Tumor Treatment The NICO BrainPath 6 Pillar Approach is a highly advanced, minimally invasive technique that enables safe and effective removal of brain tumors that were once considered inoperable. 6 Pillar technology integrates leading-edge brain mapping, navigation technology and high- definition optics. Through an opening smaller than a dime, it provides access into the brain to remove tumors through small openings between folds. Before surgery, Neurosurgeon Julian Bailes, MD, studied the wiring of Jill Vannatta's brain to navigate the safest route to access her tumor. Sophisticated optics and a GPS-like navigation system helped him move through the brain to preserve the normal fibers. \"NorthShore continues to be a leader in the surgical treatment of brain disorders,\" noted Dr. Bailes. \"We're committed to further exploration and discovery, and application of enhanced surgical treatment to continue to improve patient outcomes.\" mAke AN Appoi Ntme Nt Want to learn more about symptoms and the latest treatment options for brain tumors?

A very small tube, or neuroport, provides safe and effective access deep into the center of the brain. The innovative surgery was a success, something Jill and Jeremy Vannatta said they never doubted going into the proce - dure. Their shared optimism and confidence in her care has helped make her recovery easier. After two weeks in the ICU, Vannatta was moved to an inpatient rehabilitation unit, where the couple celebrated with occasional \"date nights\"\u2014ordering in dinner and watching movies. A family member slept at the hospital every night of her stay so she was never alone. \"There was nothing I wanted more than to get her home with us,\" recalled Jeremy Vannatta. poStSUR gic Al tR eAtme Nt Four weeks after surgery, with pathology results in hand, Vannatta met with Neuro-Oncologist Ryan Merrell, MD, to discuss further treatment and clinical trial options to keep the tumor in check.

Every day is a great day, in my mind. This whole experience has helped show me that.\" She also started receiving oral chemo - therapy five days a month as part of a clinical trial, one of several trials offered to NorthShore neuro-oncology patients. While she has experienced some vision issues as a side effect from the clinical trial medication, the family continued to be thrilled with her progress. \"I feel really, really good,\" said Jill Vannatta, who has an MRI every eight weeks and sees Ophthalmology Division Head Marian Macsai, MD, who helps manage her ocular side effects. Coordination between Dr. Merrell and Dr. Macsai, and everyone on the clinical team, has been a hallmark of her care. \"My father has been a physician for 40 years. He said the continuity of care Jill has received is unparalleled,\" added Jeremy Vannatta. \"It really is a big team effort,\" said Dr. Merrell, who, along with Dr. Macsai, holds an academic appointment at the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine. \"We have a team of research nurses and coordinators that is the lifeblood of our clinical trials.

A bass-baritone with the Nashville Opera, the profes - sional freelance singer rehearses constantly and travels extensively for performances. Two years ago, it looked like nothing could get in Soare's way of pursuing his passion. But then he was diagnosed with atrial fibrilla - tion, a type of arrhythmia, or irregular heartbeat. \"One day, I woke up and my heart was racing,\" recalled Soare. \"I went to the Emergency Department, where they diag - nosed atrial fibrillation. The nurse on duty said to me, 'If you were my son, I'd send you to Dr. Fisher at NorthShore Cardiovascular Institute.'\" \"Atrial fibrillation is a serious heart condi - tion and the second leading cause of stroke,\" said Westby Fisher, MD, a cardiologist who specializes in electrophysiology and holds an academic appointment at the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine. He prescribed a blood thinner medication for Soare and closely monitored his condition with a portable device. But Soare's heart continued to beat irregularly. The blood thin - ner also began to affect his vocal chords, which could have derailed his singing career. So, Dr. Fisher recommended nonsurgical catheter ablation. \"During ablation therapy,\" explained Dr. Fisher, \"physicians use sophisticated monitoring and heart electrical mapping technology, as well as ultrasound and real-time X-ray, to guide a series of wires through a catheter to the specific area of the arrhythmia within the patient's heart.\" Then, working carefully to avoid damaging surrounding heart tissue, small electrical currents are sent to cauterize\u2014or deaden\u2014the area and permanently isolate the arrhythmia's source. \"Most patients undergo this procedure with general anesthesia, using a tube that passes through their vocal cords,\" added bravo!

Prior to Jillian's birth, Marcelin and his wife Sara Gerstmayr lost twins to a rare complication of twin gestation. In light of their loss, Jillian is not only a gift in their lives, but an inspiration. In the very early stages of labor with her twins, Gerstmayr was transferred to Evanston Hospital from another hospital. She had already lost one of her twins. \"Everyone at NorthShore was very support - ive and very understanding. They truly helped us get through it. They took care of us, and we could tell they cared,\" said Gerstmayr, who praised the entire team of physicians, nurses and social workers. \"We really wanted children but feared going through something like that again,\" said Marcelin. \"They told us how they could help ensure a full-term pregnancy,\" recalled Gerstmayr, who became pregnant just three months later. She was treated as a high-risk pregnancy patient. \"It's important for women to have hope for subsequent pregnancies even after suffering a tragic loss,\" said NorthShore Maternal-Fetal Medicine Specialist Beth Plunkett, MD, a member of the caring team who helped Gerstmayr through both the trauma of losing her babies and the joy of a successful pregnancy. Dr. Plunkett also holds an academic appointment at the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine. Even with two other hospitals much closer to home, Gerstmayr was happy to drive to Evanston almost weekly for continued moni - toring throughout her pregnancy. At 30 weeks, Jillian was born at Evanston Hospital. She spent her initial weeks at the Infant Special Care Unit (ISCU). Her parents were delighted with her care, especially from her primary nurse Megan Ealey. \"I felt so prepared when Jillian was born, and it was so much easier knowing the great care we were going to receive,\" said Gerstmayr. \"Our nurses, Perinatal Family Support Center and ISCU team provide consistently exceptional care, which is particularly valu- able in these more complicated cases,\" said Dr. Plunkett.

White at 61, Michael Heyman was semiretired, leading an active and healthy life. He was unaware that a cancer was growing in his throat until his dentist noticed a small lump on his neck. The real shock hit when a needle biopsy confirmed stage 4 oropharynx cancer\u2014origi - nating in the back of the tongue or tonsils. Left untreated, it would surely kill him. Heyman's first objective was to find the right oncologist to direct his treatment. He turned to head and neck cancer expert Bruce Brockstein, MD, at Kellogg Cancer Center and had no question he was in the right place. Dr. Brockstein laid out all of Heyman's options, thoroughly explain - ing the disease and a recommended treatment plan. As part of NorthShore's ongoing collaboration with the Mayo Clinic Care Network, Dr. Brockstein also offered Heyman, of Glencoe, a second-opinion consultation from Mayo Clinic Oncologist Katharine Price, MD. \"They sent the pathology out that day, and I had the advantage of another expert weighing in and confirming it was the right course,\" said Heyman, who also uses the convenient online portal NorthShore Connect to manage appointments and check lab results. An initial surgery removed Heyman's tonsils and an enlarged lymph node. Lab tests confirmed Heyman's cancer was related to the human papillomavirus (HPV), which is actually linked to a better prognosis and higher cure rate than non-HPV-related head and neck cancers, explained Dr. Brockstein, who holds an academic appoint - ment at the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine. The primary source of the cancer was at the back of the tongue, where Heyman received seven weeks of daily, focused radiation treatments. \"I couldn't eat, drink or speak for weeks,\" Heyman recalled. Even swallowing the nutritional drinks that helped sustain his weight could be excruciating. \"I knew it would be a mountain to climb,\" he said. \"I had to win the battle.\" Almost a year later, it appears that he has. \"I feel great, except for my mouth and throat. I'm living each day and enjoying it,\" added Heyman, who is on a self-described crusade to help others avoid this cancer by promoting the importance of the HPV vaccine. It is an advocacy he shares with his NorthShore oncologist. \"There's clear evidence that links HPV to both cervical and throat cancers,\" Dr. Brockstein said, \"yet the vaccination rates for both girls and boys still remains too low.\" Oral cancer patient Michael Heyman is back to pursuing his love of the outdoors with wife Claire and their dog Champ .

But his love of the game was temporarily shattered last summer while teaching 8-year-olds at a local golf camp when he was struck in the eye with a golf club. The injury was devastating. \"The injury was as severe as any I've ever seen, similar to a gunshot wound,\" explained NorthShore Ophthalmologist Milap Mehta, MD, who specializes in ocular plastic surgery. \"The eye had lost all vision and the muscles were shattered.\" Fortunately, the Lake Bluff teen was minutes away from Evanston Hospital, a Level I trauma center staffed and equipped to treat the most serious injuries.

After a breast cancer diagnosis and subsequent bilateral mastectomy in 2014, the 46-year-old wife and mother of two made the decision to work with NorthShore experts on a treatment regimen to lower the risk of her cancer returning. The journey was something she never would have predicted. \"I work out, I don't smoke, I eat well, so I was really surprised to learn I had breast cancer,\" she recalled. Fortunately, the cancer was limited to one breast and had not spread. Still, she chose to have both breasts removed in a procedure performed by NorthShore Surgical Oncologist David Winchester, MD, who holds an academic appointment at the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine. Following surgery, Bertsch turned to Kellogg Cancer Center experts and the Center for Personalized Medicine to create a treatment plan, which included special tests to confirm the specific biological characteristics of her particular cancer and the most effective course of treatment. The tests found that she was \"triple positive\"; her tumor tested positive for two hormone recep - tors\u2014estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR)\u2014plus a third protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER 2). Since cancer cells feed off these hormones, they need to be blocked to prevent recurrence. Armed with this critical new information, Bertsch's Medical Oncologist Douglas Merkel, MD, created a treatment plan to best fight her form of the disease.center for Personalized m edicine d rives Targeted disease Prevention and t reatment By Andy Buchanan continued on the next pageJ MeDiciN e GETS PErSoNaLThe Strength of Precision TreatmentHealthcare for what's next.

The result is a better way to predict, prevent, diagnose and treat certain diseases through tailored care plans. \"Instead of a one-size-fits-all approach, our highly specialized testing and other assessments allow us to tailor therapy specifically for a patient and his or her disease type,\" explained Dr. Merkel, who also holds an academic appointment at the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine. \"It's an acknowledgment that not all cancers\u2014and all patients\u2014are the same.\" Bertsch, of Chicago, appreciated the precise nature of her care plan. She wanted nothing more than to move on with her busy life, which includes her husband, two children, ages 9 and 7, and her job at a Lake Forest nonprofit organization. \"My treatment was right on. It was just what I needed,\" she said. \"Having the testing done and understanding what a triple positive was gave me confidence my physicians were on target and doing the right thing.\" Hig Hly tAR geted m edic Atio NS \"I met with Dr. Merkel soon after my surgery because I wanted to get things moving as quickly as possible,\" Bertsch said. \"When I found out I was triple positive, I did some reading and had a sense of what kind of treatment was coming.\" What followed was a fairly intensive chemotherapy regimen: 12 concurrent weeks of two drugs\u2014Taxol and Herceptin\u2014followed by additional doses of Herceptin. What i s Pharmacogenomics? A drug that works well for one person may not work for another, even if they are both fighting the same disease. Our unique genetic makeup influences how we respond to medications. That is the impetus behind pharmacogenomics and NorthShore's decision\u2014as part of the Center for Personalized Medicine\u2014to create a special clinic around the practice. Led by Mark Dunnenberger, PharmD, BCPS, pharmacogenomics allows NorthShore physicians to tailor medications based on patients' genetic makeup, not just their age, lifestyle and overall health. For example, physicians can now use a genetic test to help determine which drugs work best for a cardiac patient following a stent placement. NorthShore's Pharmacogenomics Clinic is the only one of its kind in Chicagoland and one of only a few in the country. Patients can talk with genetic counselors, pharmacogenomic experts and medical geneticists\u2014and even schedule genetic testing.

Other clinical specialties are using similar techniques to tailor treatment for patients. NorthShore Cardiovascular Institute is now assessing patients' genetic information to better predict and prevent heart attacks and strokes. \"We have the ability to do a cholesterol-based assessment that goes much deeper than your average lipid panel,\" said NorthShore Cardiologist David Davidson, MD. \"By understanding a patient's unique genetic profile, I can pick the most powerful course of therapy and medication and fine-tune more impactful changes to diet and lifestyle. It helps us better understand what's going on with a particular patient and how best we can address it.\" For example, patients with a family history of heart attacks could come in for a genetic assessment that shows if they, too, are at greater risk for an attack and what type of therapy they are most likely to respond to. \"It's great to have access to this information and be able to act on it to the benefit of our patients,\" said Dr. Davidson.implications Beyond Cancer Care \"I worked with an a -Team of doctors to get me through,\" said Joanne Bertsch , relaxing at home with her husband Shane .Dr. David Davidson She also began a program of active ovarian suppression with drug therapy designed to prevent the ovaries from making estro - gen. It was a lot to navigate, but Bertsch said she tolerated it well with the support of her collaborative care team. She continued to work, take care of her family and even exercise. \"It was demanding. But with my kids and everything else I have in front of me, I was determined to do what it takes to try to prevent this from coming back,\" she said. \"I've taken every opportunity to ensure the cancer doesn't come back. I feel good now and am moving forward.\" Bertsch uses NorthShore Connect to track test results, manage her many appointments and email her caregivers with questions. \"My team's response time was incredible, and it helped put me at ease knowing my questions and concerns would be addressed right away,\" she said. Bertsch is also grateful for the warm and understanding care she received at NorthShore, including access to the assessment that helped physicians create a plan just for her. \"Dr. Merkel and everyone else were just wonderful,\" she said. \"I felt like I was getting the most up-to-date care, and they were so compas - sionate, too. I worked with an A-Team of doctors to get me through.\" NorthShore has made a significant investment in the Center for Personalized Medicine, including recruiting world-renowned experts in genomic research and informatics. It also is one of only a few health systems developing a standardized process to analyze a patient's genome and link it with more than 10 years of collective research and clinical data from its Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system. This combined data will be used to create innovative approaches for predicting, preventing and treating various diseases and conditions. \"It's great to be at a place like NorthShore that's on the leading edge of this movement and delivering customized care to our patients,\" added Dr. Merkel. Help shape the next generation of medicine by participating in NorthShore's Genomic Health Initiative. Adult NorthShore patients can donate a blood sample and allow our researchers to study your DNA in combination with research data obtained from your Electronic Medical Record (EMR). All DNA samples and data obtained from patients' EMRs are de-identified and kept strictly confidential.

NorthShore-affiliated pediatrician Lynn Gettleman-Chehab, MD, MPH, is on a mission to educate children and teens about the harmful effects of sugar. Her goal is to teach them to make healthier choices. \"We wanted to come up with healthy behaviors that are good for anyone\u2014 regardless of their weight,\" said Dr. Gettleman-Chehab, who helped create a wellness program around healthy weight at Evanston Township High School. Kids get most of their sugar from sweetened beverages, like soda, sports drinks, fruit juice and chocolate milk. The American Heart Association recommends that children consume no more than 4 teaspoons of added sugar daily. Yet one 20-ounce soda can have 19 teaspoons! It can be difficult to figure out how many teaspoons of sugar are in products. Nutritional labels list sugars in grams, so the grams need to be converted to teaspoons by dividing by four. For example, 16 grams of sugar equals 4 teaspoons. Research has shown that consuming too much sugar contributes more to obesity, diabetes, heart disease and cavities than fat. \"When you eat too much sugar, your body is programmed to store excess sugar as fat,\" explained Dr. Gettleman-Chehab, who holds an academic title at the Pritzker School of Medicine. That is why she and registered dietitian Arleen Temer-Witcoff, at Willard Elementary School in Evanston, created \"The Sugar Show\" presentation. It teaches third- through fifth-graders about healthy drink choices, like water. Their presentation complements the national Rethink Your Drink campaign through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In the presentation, students are shown a plastic bag containing the 19 teaspoons of sugar found in a 20-ounce soda and then asked if they would take a spoon and eat the sugar. \"It's amazing the light bulbs that go on,\" Dr. Gettleman-Chehab said. \"The biggest response I hear to that suggestion is 'that's nasty.'\" Willard students are now being surveyed about their drink habits before and after watching \"The Sugar Show\" to see if the presentation has led them to change their drink choices. \"The Sugar Show\" is part of ongoing outreach with area schools to encourage more students to make smarter and healthier choices.sugar s mackdown Physician Offers Reality Check for Youngsters By Barb Hailey Community Wellness Rethink Your Drink As part of its sponsorship of the Rethink Your Drink campaign, NorthShore donated new water fountains to Willard Elementary School in Evanston to encourage its students to choose water over sugar-sweetened drinks. The pilot program will measure water fountain usage and survey students to determine their consumption of sugar- sweetened drinks. \"These high-quality fountains are similar to those at private gyms offering cold, filtered water,\" said Pediatrician Lynn Gettleman-Chehab, MD, who also is a Willard parent spearheading the pilot program. \"They make it fun to drink water.\" health n ews You Can u se Looking for preventive medicine and wellness information?

It is important to reflect on, discuss and share your medical preferences with loved ones and your healthcare team\u2014even when you are healthy. NorthShore-affiliated Internist Claudia Petersen, MD, answers commonly asked questions about developing an advance care plan. WHAT IS AN ADVANCE CARE PLAN? An advance care plan is a discussion with your loved ones that helps clarify important goals and values regarding your health and your future. It should result in an advance healthcare directive that clearly communicates your medical and personal wishes. It also designates a healthcare power of attorney, who can make decisions if you are unable. Advance care planning reduces stress and anxiety for your loved ones, as they will know how to act in accordance with your wishes.

But less than a year ago, he was sidelined with crippling pain in his back and numbness in his left leg. \"I was really suffering. I'd have to take a break after a shower and sit down until the pain went away,\" recalled Villanueva, 58. \"Then I'd brush my teeth, get dressed and take another break.\" He also noticed that his left leg was dragging when he walked. One day while teaching high school, Villanueva collapsed in excruciating pain. \"It was like an electric jolt from my lumbar spine all the way down my left side to the big toe,\" he said. \"It paralyzed me and I couldn't get up.\" His wife took Villanueva to the closest hospital where they took X-rays and advised him to see a spine special - ist. The next day, Villanueva saw NorthShore Spine Center Specialist and Surgeon Eldin Karaikovic, MD, PhD, who holds an academic appointment at the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine. Villanueva was diagnosed with congenital spinal stenosis\u2014a narrowing of the spinal canal\u2014which was aggravated by arthritis, bulging disks and disk degrada - tion. As nerves in the spinal cord are increasingly pinched, pain escalates and\u2014as in Villanueva's case\u2014can ultimately lead to numbness and weakness in the legs. It was immediately clear that surgery was Villanueva's best option. \"We begin with a conservative approach and then create the best treatment plan that's tailored to a particular patient's needs,\" Dr. Karaikovic explained. In Villanueva's case, he performed a laminectomy, removing parts of the lower vertebrae to take pressure off the damaged nerves. \"I was totally confident going into surgery,\" said Villanueva, who also appreciated the convenience of the spine c enter's a dvanced Care Puts c oach b ack on h is Feet By Susan J.
