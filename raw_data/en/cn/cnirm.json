With [kidney stones](https://pettao.com/crystal-stone-kidney-stones/), dogs experience the same discomfort people do. In people, the most common description of kidney stone pain is an intense, sharp, or cramping pain that can come in waves. Some people describe the pain of kidney stones as one of the most severe they have ever experienced, comparable to childbirth or even worse. The pain is typically felt in the back or side, below the ribs, often radiating to the lower abdomen and groin. It may fluctuate in intensity and may be accompanied by other symptoms such as: - Severe pain causing restlessness and difficulty finding a comfortable position. - Hematuria (blood in the urine) can make the urine appear pink, red, or brown. - Frequent urination or a persistent urge to urinate. - Cloudy or foul-smelling urine. - Nausea and vomiting. - Fever and chills (if an infection is present) Passing a kidney stone through the urinary tract can be a painful process, often described as feeling like a sharp object or a jagged stone scraping or stabbing the ureter (the tube that connects the kidneys to the bladder). The pain often comes and goes as the stone moves. Once the stone has passed, the pain usually subsides, although some discomfort may persist until any inflammation or irritation in the urinary tract resolves. Unfortunately, dogs can't talk or explain just how bad they feel.
