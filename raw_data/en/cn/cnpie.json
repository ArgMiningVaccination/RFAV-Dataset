Essentially, the neurological, endocrine, and immune systems all share common signalling molecules and receptors, allowing them to coordinate with each other and form an organic network. This network is the biological basis to maintain the body's homeostasis. Acupunture stimulates the NEI network in a variety of ways to promote internal regulation. Unlike most pharmaceuticals, [acupuncture](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6409053/) works by motivating or inducing your body's natural regulatory systems to function more effectively. In the immune system, acupuncture has been shown to: Improve the number and function of phagocytes (disease-fighting cells) [Increase](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6409053/)the number and activity of natural killer cells Promote the synthesis, secretion and biological activities of cytokines (proteins that regulate immunity) In addition, acupuncturists can offer recommendations for various formulations of Chinese herbs that boost immunity. These can help extend the benefits of your acupuncture treatment. Your acupuncturist will carefully determine the right formula for your unique body and health needs. Benefits of Chinese herbs include but are not limited to: Strengthening the lungs Increasing white blood cell count Inhibiting the growth of bacteria and viruses Increasing the number of natural killer cells and other immune cells Most of these herbs can be safely combined with pharmaceuticals and other treatments to improve patient outcomes.
