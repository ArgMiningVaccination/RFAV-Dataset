Reprint requests: Jean Bousquet, MD, PhD, Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA), Service doi:10.1067/mai.2001.118891S148Introduction Allergic rhinitis is clinically defined as a symptomatic disorder of the nose induced by an IgE-mediated inflam-mation after allergen exposure of the of rhinitis include rhinorrhea, nasalobstruction, nasal itching and sneezing which arereversible spontaneously or under treatment. It is subdi-vided into \"intermittent\" or \"persistent\" disease (Table1). The severity of allergic rhinitis can be classified as\"mild\" or \"moderate-severe.\" Previously, allergic rhinitis was subdivided, based on the time of exposure, into seasonal, perennial and occu-pational diseases (1-3). Perennial allergic rhinitis is mostfrequently caused by indoor allergens such as dust mites,moulds, insects (cockroaches) and animal danders. Sea-sonal allergic rhinitis is related to a wide variety of out-door allergens such as pollens or moulds. However, this is not entirely satisfactory as: There are some places where pollens and moulds are perennial allergens (e.g. grass pollen allergy in South-ern California and Florida (4) or Parietaria pollen allergy in the Mediterranean area (5)). Symptoms of perennial allergy may not always be present all year round. The majority of patients are sensitised to many differ- ent allergens and therefore present symptoms through-out the year (6). In many patients, perennial symptomsare often present and patients present seasonal exacer-bations when exposed to pollens or moulds. Many patients allergic to pollen are also allergic to moulds and it is difficult to define the pollen season (7). Due to the priming effect on the nasal mucosa induced by low levels of pollen allergens (8) and minimal per-sistent inflammation of the nose in patients with symp-tom free rhinitis (9), symptoms do not necessarilyoccur strictly in conjunction with the allergen season. Thus, a major change in the subdivision of allergic rhinitis has been proposed in this document with the terms\"intermittent\" and \"persistent\". However, in the presentdocument, the terms \"seasonal\" and \"perennial\" are stillretained to enable the interpretation of published studies. Allergic rhinitis is characterised by nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, sneezing, itching of the nose and/or post-nasal drainage. It is often associated with ocular symp-toms. Several other conditions can cause similar symp-toms: infections, hormonal imbalance, physical agents,anatomical anomalies and the use of some drugs. There-fore, a detailed and correct aetiological diagnosis formsthe basis for selecting optimal treatment. Allergic rhinitis represents a global health problem. It is an extremely common disease worldwide affecting 10to 25 % of the population (1, 10-12). However, this fig-ure probably underestimates the prevalence of the dis-ease, as many patients do not recognise rhinitis as a dis-ease and therefore do not consult a physician (10). Anincreasing prevalence of allergic rhinitis over the lastdecades has been recognised (13, 14). Allergic rhinitishas been identified as one of the top ten reasons for vis-its to primary care clinics (15). Although allergic rhini-tis is not usually a severe disease, it significantly altersthe social life of patients (16, 17) and affects schoollearning performance (18, 19) as well as work produc-tivity (20). Moreover, the costs incurred by rhinitis aresubstantial (21). Other conditions associated with allergic rhinitis are asthma, sinusitis, otitis media, nasal polyposis, lower res-piratory tract infection and dental occlusion. The cost oftreating these conditions should be considered when eval-uating the socio-economic impact of allergic rhinitis (22). Asthma and rhinitis are common co-morbidities sug- gesting the concept of \"one airway, one disease\" (23).Rhinitis and asthma are linked by epidemiological,pathological and physiologic characteristics and by acommon therapeutic approach (24-27). Although notuniversally accepted (28), the term \"allergic rhinobron-chitis\" has been proposed to link the association betweenallergic asthma and rhinitis (29). Non-allergic asthmaand rhinitis are also associated (30) but the mechanismsunderlying the two diseases are not fully understoodexcept, possibly, for aspirin-induced asthma (31). More-over, costs for asthma are significantly increased inpatients with allergic rhinitis (32). Patients with persis-tent allergic rhinitis should therefore be evaluated forasthma, and patients with asthma should be evaluated forrhinitis. A strategy combining the treatment of bothupper and lower airway disease in terms of efficacy andsafety appears to be optimal. Clinical guidelines are systematically developed state- ments designed to help practitioners and patients makedecisions about appropriate and effective health care(33). Guidelines have existed in various countries fordecades and hundreds of them have been published forTABLE 1: Classification of allergic rhinitis 1- \"Intermittent\" means that the symptoms are present: Less than 4 days a week, Or for less than 4 weeks. 2- \"Persistent\" means that the symptoms are present: More than 4 days a week, And for more than 4 weeks. 3- \"Mild\" means that none of the following items are present: Sleep disturbance, Impairment of daily activities, leisure and/or sport, Impairment of school or work, Troublesome symptoms. 4- \"Moderate-severe\" means that one or more of the following items are present: Sleep disturbance, Impairment of daily activities, leisure and/or sport, Impairment of school or work, Troublesome symptoms. J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 108, NUMBER 5Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group S149 many diseases (34) including asthma (35, 36) and aller- gic rhinitis (1-3, 37-40). There is considerable interest inguidelines as a tool for implementing health care basedon proof of effectiveness. Guidelines should be informa-tive, simple, easy to use and in a form that can be wide-ly disseminated within the medical community in orderto improve patient care. Unfortunately, many guidelinesare not tested and may be difficult to use by non-specialists. Evidence-based medicine is an importantmethod of preparing guidelines (41). Moreover, theimplementation of guidelines is equally important. New knowledge on the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying allergic inflammation of the airways has resultedin better therapeutic strategies. New routes of administration,dosages and schedules have been studied and validated. Inaddition, asthma co-morbidity should be well understood inorder to achieve optimal treatment for patients. The present document is intended to be a state-of-the- art for the specialist as well as for the general practitioner: to update their knowledge of allergic rhinitis, to highlight the impact of allergic rhinitis on asthma, to provide an evidence-based documented revision on the diagnosis methods, to provide an evidence-based revision on the treat- ments available, to propose a stepwise approach to the management of the disease. The ARIA Paper is not intended to be a standard of care document for individual countries. It is provided asa basis for physicians and organisations involved in thetreatment of allergic rhinitis and asthma in various coun-tries to develop relevant local standard of care documentsfor their patients.S1501- Classification Rhinitis (rhinosinusitis) is classified as follows (Table 2). The differential diagnosis of rhinitis is presented in Table 3. 1-1- INFECTIOUS RHINITIS Acute viral rhinosinusitis is one of the most common health complaints, affecting millions of people annually(42). It has been estimated that 0.5-2% of viral upper res-piratory tract infections progress to an acute bacterialinfection. Chronic rhinosinusitis affects 5-15% of theurban population (43) and thus exceeds the prevalence ofmany other chronic conditions (44). Four principal clin-ical types are recognised: acute, recurrent acute, chronic, acute exacerbations of chronic disease. Attempts have been made to define these in terms of pathophysiology, microbiology, radiographic imaging,severity and duration of symptoms (45-47). This lattercriterion has proved to be the most widely utilised,although, in the case of acute infectious rhinosinusitis,the accepted duration of symptoms may range from oneday to less than twelve weeks (48-50). In acute infectious rhinitis Rhinovirus, Influenza and Para-influenza, viruses the Streptococcus pneumoniae (20-35%) and Haemophilus influenza (6-26%) remain the most com- mon bacteria (51). However, other agents includingMoraxella catarrhalis, Staphlycoccus aureus and anaer- obic bacteria are also found. The same bacteria are regarded as significant in chronic infectious rhinosinusitis where they are found inhigh titres from sinus aspirates. They may also causeacute exacerbations of the chronic disease. In conditionssuch as cystic fibrosis, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are regarded as important pathogens. In addition, many other bacteria may beencountered whose role is as yet undetermined (52).Fungi such as Aspergillus or the Dermataceous fungi, Alternaria, Bipolaris , appear to be assum- rhinoscleroma-tis, Mycobacterium protozoan infection (leishmaniasis)and parasitic infection have been described. Ciliary abnormalities, both congenital and acquired, immunodeficiency and direct trauma may all predisposeindividuals to the development of both acute and chron-ic infection (58-60). 1-2- ALLERGIC RHINITIS (Table 1).1-3- OCCUPATIONAL RHINITIS Occupational rhinitis arises in response to an airborne agent present in the workplace and may be due to anallergic reaction or non-allergic hyperresponsiveness.Many occupational agents are irritant. Causes of occupa-tional rhinitis include laboratory animals (rats, mice,guinea pigs, etc.), grains (bakers and agricultural work-ers), wood dust, particularly hard woods (mahogany,Western Red Cedar, etc.), latex and chemicals such asacid anhydrides, platinum salts, glues and solvents (61).TABLE 2: Classification of rhinitis Infectious ViralBacterialOther infectious agents Allergic IntermittentPersistent Occupational (allergic and non-allergic) IntermittentPersistent Drug-induced AspirinOther medications Hormonal Other causes NARESIrritantsFoodEmotionalAtrophicGastroesophageal reflux Idiopathic TABLE 3: Differential diagnosis of rhinitis S151 1-4- DRUG-INDUCED RHINITIS A range of medications is known to cause nasal symp- toms. These include: aspirin and other preparations such as \u00df-block- ers (65), chlorpromazine, oral contraceptives. The term rhinitis medicamentosa (66, 67) applies to the rebound nasal obstruction which develops in patientswho use intranasal vasoconstrictors chronically. Rhinitismedicamentosa can be a contributing factor to non-aller-gic non-infectious rhinitis, which may be the reason thepatient uses the vasoconstrictor. Cocaine sniffing is often associated with frequent sniffing, rhinorrhea, diminished olfaction and septal per-foration (68, 69). 1-5- HORMONAL RHINITIS Changes in the nose are known to occur during the menstrual cycle (70), puberty, pregnancy (71, 72) and inspecific endocrine disorders such as hypothyroidism (73)and acromegaly. Hormonal imbalance also beresponsible for the atrophic nasal change in post-menopausal women. Persistent hormonal rhinitis or rhino-sinusitis may develop in the last trimester of pregnancy in otherwisehealthy women. Its severity parallels the blood oestrogenlevel. Symptoms disappear at delivery. In women with perennial rhinitis, symptoms may improve or deteriorate during pregnancy (74). 1-6- OTHER CAUSES 1-6-1- Nasal symptoms related to physical and chemical factors Physical and chemical factors can induce nasal symptoms which may mimic rhinitis in subjects withsensitive mucous membranes, and even in normal sub-jects if the concentration of chemical triggers is highenough (75, 76). Skier's nose (cold, dry air) (77) andgustatory rhinitis (hot spicy food) (78) have beendescribed as distinct entities. However, the distinctionbetween a normal physiological response and a diseaseis not clear; all rhinitis patients may exhibit an exag-gerated response to unspecific physical or chemicalstimuli. Little information is available on the acute orchronic effects of air pollutants on the nasal mucosa(see chapter 3-2) (79). 1-6-2- Food-induced rhinitis Food allergy is a very rare cause of isolated rhinitis (80). However, nasal symptoms are common among themany symptoms of food-induced anaphylaxis (80). On the other hand, foods and alcoholic beverages in particular may induce symptoms by unknown non-aller-gic mechanisms. Some spicy food such as red pepper can induce rhin- orrhea, probably because it contains capsaicin. This isable to stimulate sensory nerve fibres inducing them torelease tachykinins and other neuropeptides (81). Dyes and preservatives as occupational allergens can induce rhinitis (82), but in food they appear to play a rolein very few cases (80). 1-6-3- Eosinophilic rhinitis Persistent non-allergic rhinitis with eosinophilia is a heterogeneous syndrome consisting of at least two sub-groups: NARES and aspirin intolerance. Non-allergic rhinitis with eosinophilia syndrome (NARES) was defined in the early 1980s (83, 84).Although it probably does not represent a disease entityon its own, it may be regarded as a subgroup of idiopath-ic rhinitis. It can be characterised by the presence ofnasal eosinophilia and perennial symptoms of sneezing,itching, rhinorrhea, nasal obstruction and occasionally aloss of sense of smell in the absence of demonstrableallergy. It occurs in children and adults. Asthma isuncommon but approximately 50% of patients have non-specific bronchial hyperreactivity (85). NARES seems toevolve in three stages (86): migration of eosinophils from vessels to secretions, retention of eosinophils in the mucosa which might be linked to activation of unknown origin, nasal polyposis. It has been suggested that some NARES represent an early stage of aspirin-sensitivity (87). NARES is not responsive to DSCG (88) but responds usually although not always to intranasal glucocortico-steroids (89). 1-6-4- Emotions Stress and sexual arousal are known to have an effect on the nose probably due to autonomic stimulation. 1-6-5- and underlying bone(90), nasal cavity widely patent but full ofcopious foul-smelling crusts. It has been attributed toinfection with Klebsiella ozaenae (91) though its role as a primary pathogen is not fully documented. The conditionproduces nasal obstruction, hyposmia and a constant badsmell (ozaenae). It must be distinguished from secondaryS152 Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL NOVEMBER 2001 atrophic rhinitis associated with chronic granulomatosis conditions, excessive nasal surgery, radiation and trauma. 1-6-6- Gastroesophageal reflux Gastroesophageal reflux can be associated with rhini- tis, especially in children (92, 93).1-7- Unknown aetiology (idiopathic rhinitis) Otherwise sometimes termed \"vasomotor rhinitis\", these patients (usually females aged between 40-60years) manifest an upper respiratory hyperresponsivenessto non-specific environmental triggers such as changes intemperature and humidity, exposure to tobacco smokeand strong odours.S1532- Epidemiology and genetics 2-1- EPIDEMIOLOGY OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS Despite the recognition that allergic rhinitis is a glob- al health problem and is increasing in prevalence (94-98), there are insufficient epidemiological data withregards to its distribution, aetiological risk factors andnatural history. However, new national or multinationalstudies are rapidly improving our knowledge in theprevalence of rhinitis and its possible risk factors. Theseinclude: the second National Health and Nutrition Examina- tion Survey (NHANES II) (99, 100), the European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS) (101), the International Study on Asthma and Allergy Asth- ma in Childhood (ISAAC) (12), the Swiss Study on Air Pollution and Lung Diseases in Adults (SAPALDIA) (11), the Swiss Study on Childhood Allergy and Respirato- ry Symptoms with Respect to Air Pollution, Climateand Pollen (SCARPOL) (102) . 2-1-1- Epidemiological definitions Before defining rhinitis for epidemiology, several terms need to be determined (36). 2-1-1-1- General definitions P r evalence is the percentage of the population with a disease or an abnormality. Cumulative prevalence isthe total number of individuals who have had the dis-ease at any time. Point prevalence is the number ofindividuals with the disease at any given time. Incidence is the number of individuals who develop an abnormality within a given time (usually a year). Morbidity is the degree to which quality of life is impaired. Atop y: The epidemiological definition of atopy is not based on the definition of atopy found in the glossary.The epidemiological definition of atopy is onskin prick test positivity to allergens or allergen-specific serum IgE. Therefore, depending on the defi-nition of skin prick test criterion used, there have beenconsiderable differences in estimations of prevalenceand incidence of atopy in populations. 2-1-1-2- Definition of rhinitis The clinical definition of rhinitis is difficult to use in epidemiological settings of large populations where it isnot possible either to visit every person or to obtain lab-oratory evidence of the immune response. Initial epidemiological studies have assessed allergic rhinitis on the basis of simple \"working definitions\".Various standardised questionnaires have been used tothis effect (103, 104). The first questionnaires aiming at assessing seasonal allergic rhinitis dealt with \"nasal catarrh\" (BritishMedical Research Council, 1960) (105) and \"runnynose during spring\" (British Medical Research Coun-cil, 1962) (106). Successively, questions introducing the diagnostic term of \"seasonal allergic rhinitis\" were used: \"Haveyou ever had seasonal allergic rhinitis?\" or \"Has adoctor said that you suffer from seasonal allergicrhinitis?\" In the ECRHS full-length questionnaire, the question asked on was: any nasal aller-gies including (107). Inorder to identify the responsible allergen, the ECRHSstudy has included potential symptom triggers. A score considering most features (clinical symptoms, season of the year, triggers, parental history, individ-ual medical history, perceived allergy) of allergicrhinitis has recently been proposed (108). Taking thedoctor's diagnosis (based on questionnaires, examina-tions and skin tests to common aeroallergens) as agold standard, such scores had good positive and neg-ative predictive values (84% and 74% respectively)for identifying patients suffering from allergic rhinitis.Perennial rhinitis has been defined as having frequentnon-seasonal nasal or ocular symptoms (\"rhinocon-junctivitis\"). In a study, the length of the disease was also taken into consideration in order to differentiate perennial rhini-tis from \"the common cold\" (a viral upper respiratoryinfection) (109). Objective tests for the diagnosis of IgE-mediated allergy (skin prick test, serum specific IgE) can also beused (110-112). The diagnostic efficiency of IgE, skinprick tests and Phadiatop \u00aewas estimated in 8,329 ran- from the SAPALDIA. For the diagnosisof allergic rhinitis, the skin prick test had the best posi-tive predictive value (48.7%) compared to Phadiatop \u00ae (43.5%) or total serum IgE (31.6%) (113). Future work-ing definitions are intended to encompass clinical symp-toms, immune response tests, nasal function and, eventu-ally, specific nasal challenge (114). 2-1-2- Prevalence 2-1-2-1- Monocentric studiesEstimates of the prevalence and incidence of allergic rhinitis have varied with the populations studied, defini-tions of the conditions and methods of assessment(\"working definitions\"). Most data concern seasonal allergic rhinitis, but not exclusively (6, 99, 100, 109). The prevalence of seasonal allergic rhinitis ranges from 1 to 40% (Table 4). The prevalence of perennial rhinitis varies from 1 to 18% (Table 4). In a survey, skin prick testing with 8 non-standardisedS154 Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL NOVEMBER 2001 extracts of inhalant allergens confirmed that perennial rhinitis was often associated with allergy as there was anexcess of skin prick test positivity to cats or dogs amongindividuals suffering from perennial rhinitis (99, 100). Non-allergic rhinitis was reported to account for 30 to 70% of patients with chronic perennial rhinitis (146). In the Tucson study, it was found that 42% of children had physician diagnosed rhinitis at the age of 6 years (145). The prevalence of seasonal allergic rhinitis is higher in children and adolescents than in adults. Perennialrhinitis is more common in adults than in children butlittle reliable data exist (146) . In many parts of the world, pollen allergy is very com- mon, but in Eastern Asia, Latin America and tropicalareas, mite allergy is more common (see chapter 3-1). In a study carried out in the US, the prevalence of aspirin-induced rhinitis and asthma was approximate-ly 10% of the adult asthmatics (147). This percentagemay be even higher when aspirin provocation tests areroutinely carried out (148). In a recent Scandinavianpopulation-based study, aspirin intolerance was higherin those with allergic-like rhinitis than in those with-out (2.6% versus 0.3%) (149). However, there may bedifferences between geographical areas in the worldconcerning aspirin intolerance. More data are needed. 2-1-2-2- ISAAC The aetiology of asthma and allergic disease lacks understanding despite considerable research. The ISAACwas founded to maximise the value of research into asth-ma and allergic disease, by establishing a standardisedmethodology and by facilitating international collabora-tion. Its specific aims are (150): to describe the prevalence and severity of asthma, rhini-TABLE 4: Prevalence of rhinitis by questionnaire or examination Number of Nasal Study Y ear subjects Study Age group Country Seasonal Perennial symptoms Varjonen (116) 1992 1712 Quest 15-16 Finland 14% Harf (117) 1992 629 Quest Adult France 5.9%Vervloet (111) 1991 2067 Exam 20-60 18.5% Pariente (118) 1992 3984 Quest 9-11 Germany 9.5%Weiland (119) 1994 2050 Quest 13-16 1996 2167 Quest 20-70 Holland 29.5%Astarita 1998 915 Quest 9-15 Italy 13.1%Matricardi (121) 1997 1649 Quest Men Italy 13.3%Ogino (122) 1990 471 Exam 18-22 Japan 32.7%Okano (123) 1999 431 Quest school 22.5Okuma (124) 1994 1013 Quest 6-15 Japan 12.9%Min (125) 1997 9069 Exam All Korea 1.14%Bakke (126) 1990 4492 Quest 15-70 Norway 10%Dotterud (127) 1994 551 Quest 7-12 Norway 20.6%Breborowicz (128) 1995 6-15 Poland 16.7%Ng (129) Quest 10-40 Spain 10.6% (Basque) Hattewig (132) 1990 1654 Exam 7 Sweden 8%Aberg (133) 1995 2481 Quest 7 Sweden 13%Norrman (134) 1994 1112 Exam 13-18 17%Varonier (135) Exam 5-6 (135) 2451 1.0%Wuttrich 1995 8357 Exam Switzerland 14.2%Kalyoncu (136) 1999 738 Quest 6-13 Turkey 18.7%Burr (137) 1989 965 Exam 12 UK 14.9%Howarth (138) 1989 1792 Quest 16-20 Quest Quest 5-59 UK 29%Strachan (141) 1995 12355 Quest 23 UK 16.5%Hagy USA 10.2%Turkeltaub (144) 1988 Quest USA 20.4% Wright (145) 1994 747 Quest 6 USA 42% Modified from (115)J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 108, NUMBER and the ARIA Workshop Group S155 tis and eczema in children living in different centres, and to make comparisons within and between countries, to obtain baseline measures for the assessment of future trends in the prevalence and severity of thesediseases, to provide a framework for further aetiological research into genetic, lifestyle, environmental andmedical care factors affecting these diseases. The ISAAC design comprises three phases (151): Phase 1 uses core questionnaires designed to assess the prevalence and severity of asthma and allergic diseasefor two age groups. It was completed in 156 collabo-rating centres in 56 countries and a total of 721,601children participated. In the 13-14 year-old age group,155 centres from 56 countries participated, of which 99centres completed a video questionnaire (463,801 chil-dren). For the 6-7 year age group, there were 91 col-laborating centres in 38 countries (257,800 children).Rhinitis was described as \"a problem with sneezing\",or \"a runny or blocked nose when you (your child) didnot have a cold or the flu\". Additional questions wereasked about rhinitis associated with itchy-watery eyes,interference with activities and a history of seasonalallergic rhinitis. One of the major problems raisedwithin this study was that only a questionnaire wasapplied and that responses for rhinitis may overesti-mate the real prevalence of the disease. In the SCAR-POL (152), the validity of the ISAAC core questionson rhinitis was tested on a population of 2,954 Swissschool children by comparing them to skin prick testresults. The specificity of the ISAAC questions washigh, ranging from 77.5 to 97.6%, but the sensitivitywas low (2.6 to 42.7%). The positive predictive valuefor atopy among children with symptoms was 63% forsneezing accompanied by itchy-watery eyes, 67% forsymptoms occurring only during the pollen season and70% for reported seasonal allergic rhinitis. The authorsconcluded that the ISAAC core questions on rhinitisare highly specific and therefore useful in screeningchildren without atopy. In addition, they have a highpositive predictive value in detecting atopy among chil-dren with symptoms. However, they are not helpful fordetecting atopy in a general population of children (lowsensitivity). Moreover, there was a season-of-responseeffect on questions concerning rhinitis symptoms sug-gesting a recall bias relating to recent symptoms (153). Phase 2 will investigate possible aetiological factors, particularly those suggested by the findings of Phase 1. Phase 3 will be a repetition of Phase 1 to assess trends in prevalence. ISAAC Phase 1 has demonstrated a large variation in the prevalence of asthma and rhinitis symptoms in chil-dren throughout the world. The prevalence of rhinitiswith itchy-watery eyes (\"rhinoconjunctivitis\") in the pastyear 6-7 in the year-oldgroup (12, 130, 154-174) (Figure 1). The overall correla-tion between the prevalence of asthma and rhinitis inschool children was significant ( = 0.65, p<0.0001) (12, 154). In particular, it was found that countries with a verylow prevalence of asthma (<5%) such as Indonesia, Alba-nia, Romania, Georgia and Greece had low prevalencesof rhinitis. On the other hand, the countries with a veryhigh prevalence of asthma (>30%) such as Australia,New Zealand and the United Kingdom had a high preva-lence of rhinitis (15-20%). Other countries with a veryhigh prevalence of rhinitis (Nigeria (>35%), Paraguay(30-35%), Malta, Argentina, Hong Kong (25-30%),Brazil (7-25% in different centres)) had asthma preva-lences ranging from 10 to 25%. It is likely that environ-mental factors were responsible for these major differ-ences between countries. The results provide a framework for studies between populations in contrasting environments. These are like-ly to yield new clues about the aetiology of asthma andrhinitis. 2-1-2-3- ECRHSNo co-operative study on allergic rhinitis has been car- ried out among adults but the ECRHS asked for compa-rable representative samples on \"nasal allergy\" (107).The ECRHS was carried out in order to answer specificquestions about the distribution of asthma and health caregiven for asthma in the European Community. Specifi-cally, the survey is designed: to estimate variations in the prevalence of asthma, asthma-like symptoms and airway responsiveness, to estimate variations in exposures to known or sus- pected risk factors for asthma, to assess to what extent these variations explain the variations in the prevalence of disease, FIGURE 1: Prevalence of \"hay fever\" in 13-14 year-old children in ISAAC centres. Data from Strachan et al (12).S156 Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL NOVEMBER 2001 to estimate differences in the use of medication for asthma. The protocol provides specific instructions on the sampling strategy adopted by the survey teams, on theuse of questionnaires, the tests for allergy, lung functionmeasurements, tests of airway responsiveness, blood andurine collection. Results for the prevalence of \"nasal allergy\" were pub- lished in a few studies only (30, 101, 112, 175-177). Thefindings of Droste et al. (112) confirmed the close rela- tionship of skin test positivity with reported symptoms ofnasal allergy in a general population. Specific IgE posi-tivity also shows a close relationship with nasal symp-toms in response to allergen exposure in a general popu-lation. Skin testing and specific IgE measurement may beconsidered complementary to one another when diagnos-ing allergic rhinitis. 2-1-2-4- SAPALDIASAPALDIA focuses on the long-term health effects of low to moderate levels of air pollutants as typically seenin different parts of Switzerland. The aim of the SAPAL-DIA cross-sectional study carried out in 1991-1993 was: to determine the prevalence of bronchial asthma, chronic bronchitis and allergic conditions in the adultpopulation of Switzerland, to identify and to determine the respective importance of potentially influencing factors (178). These couldbe both personal (smoking habits (179), allergy status,family history, occupation) and environmental (out-door and indoor pollution (180), aeroallergens, cli-mate). SAPALDIA investigated a random population sample (18-60 year-olds) in eight Swiss areas with differentenvironments. In total, 9,651 adults (60%) participated inthe cross-sectional investigation (part 1, 1991) whichconsisted of the following standardised procedures:questionnaires (interviews), forced atopyassessment (Phadiatop \u00ae, total skin tests (113) and end expiratory CO-measurements. Sub-jects with a history of respiratory symptoms, increasedbronchial reactivity, reduced lung function (FEV 1/FVC < 80% predicted) and 150 healthy persons who had neversmoked were included in the subsequent diary study(part 2; n = 3281, 1992/93). Peak flow (morning andevening), symptoms, medication, personal activity andvisits to the doctor were monitored. A further aim of thecross-sectional study consisted in the identification ofindividuals susceptible of presenting symptoms during atwo year observation period and who could be includedin the SAPALDIA follow-up study (181). The prevalence of allergic rhinitis was also assessed in the SAPALDIA (11). On the basis of a positive Phadiatop \u00aeand/or a positive skin prick test to common aeroallergens, 32.3% of thestudy population were considered atopic (males35.7%, females 28.8%; p < 0.001). The highest rate of positive skin prick tests was observed for grass pollen (12.7%), followed by housedust elicited less than 1% of positive skin prick tests. The prevalence of allergic rhinitis (rhinitis symptoms associated with atopy) was 13.5% (males 14.3%,females 12.6%; p < 0.05). The prevalence of current seasonal allergic rhinitis varied between 9.1% (questionnaire answer and a pos-itive skin prick test to at least one pollen), 11.2%(questionnaire answer and presence of atopy) and14.2% (questionnaire answer only) with no significantdifference whether male or female. In multivariate logistic regression models, the preva- lence of positive Phadiatop \u00ae, positive skin tests and atopy decreased significantly with age. The odds of hav-ing a positive Phadiatop and skin test, or being atopic,were found to decrease on average by 23, 21.1 and 21%respectively, with every 10-year increase in age (182). Smoking was found to increase total serum IgE but was associated with a lower prevalence of allergic rhini-tis (182). Air pollution had effects on the prevalence of dyspnea, on symptoms of chronic bronchitis, on FEV 1, on the incidence of respiratory symptoms and on the length ofsymptom free intervals, but not on the prevalence of asth-ma (183). Environmental tobacco smoke showed animpact on wheezing, asthma, bronchitis and chronicbronchitis (179). 2-1-2-5- SCARPOLThe impact of long-term exposure to air pollution on res- piratory and allergic symptoms and illnesses was assessedin a cross-sectional study of school children (aged from 6to 15 years, n = 4,470) living in 10 different communitiesin Switzerland (184). Air pollution measurements (particu-late matter of less than 10 \u00b5m in diameter (PM10), nitrogendioxide (NO 2), sulfur dioxide (SO 2) and ozone) and mete- orological data were collected in each community. Report-ed symptom rates of chronic coughs, nocturnal dry coughsand bronchitis, adjusted for individual risk factors, werepositively associated with PM10, NO 2and SO 2. In the SCARPOL, rhinitis was studied in a population of 2,954 school children (152). Sensitisation to any aller-gen was most strongly associated with reported seasonalallergic rhinitis (OR = 5.7), nose problems accompaniedby itchy-watery eyes (OR = 4.4), symptoms occurringonly during pollen season (March to September) (OR =4.9) and a combination of these two latter symptoms (OR= 5.8). Finally, the under-diagnosis of allergic rhinitiswas found to be common. The prevalence of seasonal allergic rhinitis and allergic sensitisation in farmers' children and their peers living inthe same rural community was then studied. Childrengrowing up on a farm were less likely to be sensitised tocommon aeroallergens and to suffer from allergic diseasesthan children living in the same villages but in non-farmingfamilies (adjusted OR = 0.31) (102).J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL Workshop Group S157 2-1-3- Risk factors Allergic rhinitis is highly related to asthma and eczema. However, the geographical and temporal distrib-utions as well as the associations of such diseases differlargely and these differences can be used to better under-stand the mechanisms of allergic diseases. Risk factors ofrhinitis may intervene at all ages in life and epidemiolo-gy has greatly contributed in exploring them. 2-1-3-1- Genetics and familial historyA genetic component in allergic rhinitis as well as in other allergic disease has been shown (185) and the bestestablished risk factor for allergic rhinitis is a family his-tory of allergy, especially allergic rhinitis (186). Further-more, seasonal allergic rhinitis increases the risk of asth-ma significantly on the basis of analyses of all individualsand of discordant twin pairs (187). For the past decade,various antigens of the HLA system have been identifiedas being responsible for seasonal allergic rhinitis (185).Some genes have also become candidates for explainingthe genetic component of allergic rhinitis but problemswith the definition of the studied phenotypes prevent usfrom generalising them (see chapter 2-2). It is clear thatthe recent increase in prevalence of allergic rhinitis can-not be due to a change in gene pool. 2-1-3-2- Early life risk factorsSeveral studies have provided evidence that sensitisa- tion to allergens may occur in early life (188). However,early life risk factors have rarely been related to rhinitis(189). As a consequence, existing results are contradicto-ry and need to be confirmed. Young maternal age, multiple gestation, prematurity, low birth weight, growth retardation and perinatal asphyxiawere all significantly related to a decreased risk of aller-gic rhinitis among male conscripts in Sweden (190). Prospectively, in the Tucson Children's Respiratory Study, early introduction of solid foods, heavy mater-nal cigarette smoking in the first year of life (at least20 cigarettes per day) and higher IgE were all associ-ated with the development of rhinitis in the first yearsof life (145). This supports the fact that allergic rhini-tis is an early manifestation of an atopic predispositiontriggered by early environmental exposures. Maternal age during pregnancy, birth weight, gesta- tional age and in utero smoking were not related to seasonal allergic rhinitis in off-springs of a Britishbirth cohort (104). However, in two British birth cohorts, there were sig- nificant trends in the increase of allergic rhinitis preva-lence with decreasing birth order, increasing maternalage, in utero smoking and increasing duration of breast feeding (191). The month of birth has been related to allergic rhinitis but findings could have been biased by the absence ofconsideration of negative studies (192-196). 2-1-3-3- Ethnic groups Although some studies have been carried out in asth- ma, few studies have examined the role of ethnic originsin the development of allergic rhinitis. In England, nativepersons were at lower risk than those born in Asia or theWest Indies (197). Similarly, Maori people suffered morefrom allergic rhinitis than New Zealanders from Englishorigin (198). Little evidence as to whether this is relatedto genetic, environmental, socio-economic or culturalfactors exists up to now (99, 199). 2-1-3-4- Sib-ship size and order and infections in the neonatal period Several studies have found an inverse relationship between atopy, seasonal allergic rhinitis (and asthma)and sib-ship size and order (191, 200, 201). Seasonalallergic rhinitis is less frequent in large families evenafter taking the month of birth into account (104). Theapparent protective effect of large household size andasthma and/or rhinitis could not be explained by anincrease in reported early respiratory illness. The timingand mechanism of the inverse association betweenincreasing sibling numbers and atopic disease are not yetunderstood (202). A possible but unproven explanation has been demon- strated using the Th1/Th2 paradigm (203). In children oflarge families where infections are common, the immunesystem may be Th1 cell oriented to respond to the aggres-sion of external agents such as viruses and bacteria (204,205). With children living in small families where infec-tions are rare, Th2 cells may develop instead of Th1 cells.As a consequence, IgE responsible for immediate sensi-tivity is produced. Moreover, there are probably as manypros and cons in this theory. It has been observed that var-ious confounders intervene in the relationship betweeninfection and allergy (206), for instance the age of entryinto nursery where infections are also very common(207). Some studies have proposed that early BCG expo-sure was associated with a reduction of atopy (208), butother studies have found no relationship (209). Themeasles infection was also associated with a reduction inallergic disease in some but not all studies (210-212). Another hypothesis has recently been proposed (213). Bacterial antigens may favour the development of Th1cells from naive CD4-positive T-cells through a CD14-dependent pathway. The CD14 gene maps to chromo-some 5q31.1, a candidate region for loci regulating totalserum IgE. Genetic variants in the CD14 gene couldinfluence Th-cell differentiation and thus total serumIgE. CD14/-159 plays a significant role in regulatingserum CD14 levels and total serum IgE levels. 2-1-3-5- Allergen exposureAllergens are known risk factors for the development and the triggering of allergic rhinitis (214). They operateearly in life (188, 215). Outdoor allergens appear to con-stitute a greater risk for seasonal rhinitis than indoorallergens (152). In NHANES II, the prevalence of peren-nial rhinitis increased significantly in four years withpositive skin prick tests to indoor allergens such as housedust, cats or dogs (100). Recently, new hypotheses havebeen raised on the effect of allergenic exposure (157,216, 217), as early exposures to feather bedding, pillowsand cats or dogs might have protective effects in someS158 Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL NOVEMBER 2001 individuals. However, although challenging, these hypotheses need to be confirmed by further studies. 2-1-3-6- Rural-urban differences and modification of life style Different studies in North America (100), Europe (103, 218) and South Africa (219) have shown that theprevalence of atopy (defined as positive skin tests tocommon aeroallergens) and allergic rhinitis is higher inurban areas than in rural areas. Besides the fact thatselection bias acts in selecting people who live in thecountryside (11, 100, 220-222), pollution, which is high-er in town than elsewhere, increases the allergenic poten-cy of pollens (223, 224). Furthermore, it is not excludedthat observed differences could be due to confounderssuch as socio-economic factors, variations in the diagno-sis and in the management of the disease. Recently, it hasbeen found that farmers' children have less allergic rhini-tis than other children, suggesting therefore that lifestylein the countryside could protect children from the devel-opment of allergy (102). The putative role of endotoxinshas been raised but not yet confirmed (212). Asthma and allergy in developing countries may be associated with the adoption of an urbanised \"western\"lifestyle (225, 226). In Africa, urbanisation leads to anincrease in asthma and allergy. This was largelyexplained by urban-rural differences in environmentalfactors, including indoor animals, sharing a bedroomwith a smoker, parental education, house ventilation andexposure to motor vehicles. In 1989, in East German children, there was a reduced prevalence of atopy and seasonal allergic rhinitis com-pared to West German children (218, 227). Similar trendshave been observed in the Baltic States and in Scandinavia(228). Although there is some controversy (229, 230), itseems that the prevalence rate of atopy and seasonal aller-gic rhinitis is now similar in all parts of Germany (189). 2-1-3-7- Outdoor and indoor air pollutionEnvironmental studies of the health effects of air pollu- tion have contributed to the understanding of such effects. 2-1-3-7-1- Acute effects of outdoor air pollutionAcute effects on humans due to the outdoor and indoor exposure to several gases/fumes and particulate matter(PM) have been demonstrated in studies (231). However,these effects have not been clearly studied on nasalsymptoms. 2-1-3-7-2- Chronic effects of outdoor air pollutionThe chronic effects of atmospheric pollutants have been studied but, except for the known effects of partic-ulate matter on lower airways, they have not been stud-ied conclusively (232). There are ongoing studies con-cerning the chronic effects of certain pollutant classessuch as ozone, acid rain, airborne toxics and the chemi-cal form of particulate matter (PM) (including dieselexhaust) (233). However, there are some studies assess-ing the effects of outdoor air pollution on rhinitis: As demonstrated in Mexico City, pollution is an important cause of nasal symptoms in non-allergicsubjects (79, 234, 235). In Turkey, high school students living in polluted areashave significantly higher prevalence rates for symp-toms of allergic rhinitis (22.8%) than those living inunpolluted, residential areas (6%) (236). In Italy, Corbo et al. (237) showed that 7-11 year-old children living in a polluted area (n = 1477) had 1.7times more ENT symptoms than those not exposed(n=749). In Thailand, policemen working in heavy traffic have more cough and rhinitis symptoms and lower FEV 1 and FVC than the normal Thai population (238). In Taiwan, nasal symptoms of children living in the petrochemical communities were more prevalent thanin those living in the rural community (239). Outdoor pollution appears to induce symptoms in patients with allergic rhinitis (76, 119). Diesel exhaust particles may induce a Th2-like inflam- mation (see chapter 3-2), but epidemiogical data on theoccurrence of rhinitis and/or asthma are still lacking. 2-1-3-7-3- Chronic effects of indoor air pollutionSince most of the time spent by the Western popula- tion is indoors, the effect of indoor air pollution is ofgreat importance (240). Pre-natal (145, 191) and early post-natal exposure to tobacco smoke enhances allergic sensitisation in somegroups of subjects such as boys (241) or children withatopy in the first three years of life. In the French ISAAC study which involved approxi- mately 15,000 children, dermatitis (242, 243) wasincreased in smoking households. A study of 9 to 11 year-old children in South Bavaria has found a reduced risk of seasonal allergic rhinitis inhomes where coal and wood were used for heating.Coal and wood, which are used in lower social class-es, increase the risk of respiratory infections for rea-sons that are uncertain (244). The effect of gas cooking in the epidemiology of rhini- tis is still unclear (245). 2-1-3-7-4- Future studies Key elements of further studies are: The assessment of total exposure to different pollu- tants (occurring from indoor and outdoor sources) andthe interactive effects of pollutants. Major research areas include: (i) determination of the contribution of indoor sources and of vehicle emis-sions to total exposure, (ii) how to measure such expo-sures and (iii) how to measure human susceptibilityand responses (including those at the cellular and mol-ecular level). Cotinine levels should be measured ifpassive smoking is studied. Biomarkers of exposures (246, 247), doses and respons- es, including immunochemicals, biochemicals (248)and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) adducts (249, 250),are beginning to promote some basic knowledge ofexposure-response, especially concerning mechanisms. These will be extremely useful additions to standard physiological, immunological and clinical instruments,and to the understanding of biological plausibility.J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 108, NUMBER 5Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group S159 2-1-3-8- Active smoking The effect of active smoking differs according to age. Cross-sectional studies showed that children or adoles-cents with allergic rhinitis smoke more than others (119).In another study, it was found that allergic patients aremore frequently ex-smokers than others (251). Converse-ly, smokers suffer less seasonal allergic rhinitis than non-smokers (251). However, in the absence of longitudinalstudies, it is difficult to establish whether smoking is acausative factor of allergy or not (252, 253). Tobacco smoking may increase allergenic sensitisa- tion to haptens in occupational settings (254, 255). 2-1-3-9- Social class and occupationThese factors may also be involved in the prevalence of rhinitis: In the 1958 British birth cohort, children of fathers with higher social class occupations were more likelyto have seasonal allergic rhinitis (145, 256). Similarly, the Tucson Children's Respiratory Study indicated a higher prevalence of seasonal allergicrhinitis in children whose mothers had more than ahigh school education (145). In Nottingham, in a study of 2,114 individuals, those with perennial symptoms were no more likely to havebeen working in a dusty or smoky environment (257). In the Guinea-Bissau study, children born from more educated mothers had more allergies than those bornfrom poorly educated ones (212). 2-1-4- Increase in prevalence of allergic rhini- tis and putative factors An increase in the prevalence of allergic rhinitis has been observed over the last 40 years (95, 133, 139, 145,191, 199, 258) (Table 5). These studies propose different reasons for such trends which may be related to allergen load or co-factors: Changes in lifestyle (265), Increase in exposure to allergen (266), pollution and irritants (smoke, gas...) (267), Modification in diet responsible for the diminution of protective nutrient intake, Decrease in infections (268), Stress. Thus, interaction between the environment and indi- vidual susceptibility (269) might be responsible for theobserved increase in prevalence. One study has specifi-cally attempted to examine the reasons for the increase ofallergic rhinitis prevalence. No factors were found apartfrom the increase of mould exposure. However, thisstudy encountered a few methodological problems. Thesame definition of allergic rhinitis as well as objectiveassessments of exposure have to be taken into account instudies which attempt to explore the causes of increase inprevalence. 2-1-5- Natural history Most longitudinal studies have explored the develop- ment of asthma in individuals suffering from allergicrhinitis. Few have reported directly on the prognosis ofallergic rhinitis. Prognosis of allergic rhinitis depends on age and sex. Remission may be observed after long periods of time, especially in seasonal allergic rhinitis. Rhinitis symptoms tend to become milder (99, 145, 191) and simultaneously the allergic skin reactivitydecreases (270). Some studies found an increased prevalence of aller- gic rhinitis in young adults (142, 271-278). After a ten year course of the disease, 20% of patients with non-allergic rhinitis reported spontaneous disap-pearance and 36% reported improvement (146). 2-1-6- Conclusion Allergic rhinitis is a very common disease in western lifestyle countries. It tends to be more common in devel-oped countries. Furthermore, an increase in the preva-lence of allergic rhinitis is commonly observed. Howev-er, knowledge of allergic rhinitis is far from complete.More studies on the epidemiology of allergic rhinitisshould be advocated as they may provide useful clues tothe interpretation of the immunological abnormalitiesassociated with allergic diseases in general. 2-2- THE GENETICS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS The hereditary character of allergic rhinitis and other atopic diseases was shown in the first studies of familiesand twins (220). Genetic studies were focalised on thegenes of the immune response, whether specific to theallergen or not. The genetics of rhinitis has not been stud-ied as much as that of asthma and atopy. One of the prin-cipal reasons for this is the difficulty of the precise anddiscriminating \"allergic rhinitis\" phenotype characterisa-tion in a general population or in families and the factthat numerous rhinology disorders can show the samesymptoms. However, atopy, which is a frequent cause ofallergic rhinitis, has been the subject of many geneticstudies and some of the susceptibility genes for atopyhave been determined. 2-2-1- Family segregation studies In 1916, Cooke and Vander Veer, whilst studying 504 families, concluded that the \"sensitisation tendency\" wastransmitted by a \"monogenic theory\". Another studysuggested control by each one transmittedaccording to a recessive Mendelian autosomic mode(280). Studies using a clinical definition of allergy arenot therefore concordant (this definition only detecting30% of atopic subjects). Whilst atopy is defined partly as the aptitude of the immune system to secrete excessive quantities of IgE inresponse to minimal allergenic stimulation, the results ofthe studies founded on the elevation of total serum IgEare not concordant. This is probably due to a non-negli-gible percentage of atopics who have only a low level ofS160 Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL NOVEMBER 2001 total IgE. A recessive autosomal monogenic transmission has been proposed for \"high IgE responders\" (281). Forother authors, the transmission of atopy, and more partic-ularly low IgE response, occurs through monogenic auto-somic dominant inheritance (282). In 1988, Cookson andHopkin (283) showed that atopy was transmitted accord-ing to a dominant hereditary maternal autosomal mode.In 1995, Martinez et al. (284) and Meyers et al. (285, 286) recognised the influence of several genes, in partic-ular one major gene which was transmitted according toa respectively co-dominant autosomal and recessiveautosomal mode. Some other familial segregation studies are currently being carried out in different countries throughout theworld. 2-2-2- T win studies The study of twins confirmed the hereditary transmis- sion of atopy. The concordance of allergy in monozygot-ic, genetically identical twins is higher than in dizygotictwins (220). The role of heredity is however small in theclinical expression of atopy and in the sensitivity to a par-ticular allergen (here, environmental factors appear todominate genetic factors).2-2-3- Molecular studies 2-2-3-1- Candidate gene approach versus genome wide search Some genetic linkages have been demonstrated using molecular markers located in and around genes whoseproducts are involved in the pathophysiology of atopy orspread along the whole genome (287, 288). The first approach using \"candidate genes\" has allowed the localisation of six chromosomal regions ofsusceptibility: 5q31.1q33.1 (containing the genes of the interleukin cluster 4 or IL4) (289, 290), 6p21.3 (containing the genes of the major histocom- patibility complex HLA D and the TNF- gene), 11q13 (containing the gene of the \u00df chain of the high affinity IgE receptor or Fc RI\u00df) (291), 12q15-q24.1 (containing the interferon gamma gene or IFN ) (292), 14q11.1 (containing the T-cell receptor gene alpha/delta or TCR /) (293). Evidence for linkage between the development of asthma in childhood and the T-cellreceptor \u00df chain gene was found in the Japanese (294).Chromosome 14q may contain a locus close to TCRTABLE 5: Changes in the prevalence of seasonal allergic rhinitis Country Study Y ears Age (yrs) Prevalence (%) Australia Australian bureau of statistics (1991) (259) 1977-1990 No changeDenmarkLinneberg et al.

The genome wide search approach has demonstrated an association between certain phenotypes and markers onchromosomes 4 (with bronchial hyperreactivity), 6 IgE,eosinophilia and bronchial hyperreactivity), 11 (with totalserum IgE, positive allergy skin tests and asthma), 13 (withatopy) and 16 (with total serum IgE, bronchial hyperreac-tivity and asthma) (297). However, in another study (298),no single locus generated overwhelming evidence for link-age in terms of established criteria and guidelines for agenome-wide screening. This supports previous assertionsof a heterogeneous aetiology for Der p-specific IgE respon-siveness. Two novel regions, 2q21-q23 and 8p23-p21, thatwere identified in this study, merit additional studies. No fine mapping or particular genetic polymorphisms has been described so far in allergic rhinitis subjects. 2-2-3-2- Candidate genesSome of these genes are involved in the specific immune response (HLA D, TCR), others are genes of the(total) IgE response (IL-4, IL-4R, IFN ,F cRI\u00df) or genes involved in the inflammatory process (TNF- ). 2-2-3-2-1- Genes associated with the HLA systemThe genetic control of the specific IgE response is dif- ferent to that of the total IgE response. The presentationof allergens to T lymphocytes by antigen presenting cellsinvolves both HLA class II molecules and the T-cellreceptor (TCR). These molecules are logically gene can-didates. The genes susceptible to numerous illnesses havebeen localised in the HLA region (psoriasis, rheumatoidarthritis, diabetes). These illnesses are all characterised byan abnormal immune response. The expression of partic-ular HLA haplotypes could also favour thymic maturationof T lymphocytes, reacting more with certain allergens. In subjects monosensitised with a low level of total serum IgE (low responders) (282), a linkage disequilibriumhas been observed between particular HLA haplotypes andthe sensitisation to a purified allergen. For example, the IgEresponse to Amb a 5 antigen of ragweed (Ambrosiaartemisiifolia) pollen is strongly associated with haplotypeHLA D2/Dw2 (299), and that of rye grass ( Lolium peren- nae) pollen or Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus with haplotype HLA-DR3. or 1101 of patients allergic to ragweed pollen, a sig- nificant association was found between the presence of aspecific and a particular clinical phenotype: haplotype HLA-B8, SC01,DR3 was more frequent in rhinitis-only sufferers (301). 2-2-3-2-2- Genes non-associated with the HLA systemA genetic association has also been found between the TCR -chain of the lymphocytes (localised on chromo- some 14) and the sensitisation to p 1 (major allergen ofDermatophagoides pteronyssinus ), Amb a5 (302), Fel d 1 (major allergen of the cat) and grass pollen allergens. Thiswas found in both English and Australian subjects (293). The genes whose products regulate the synthesis of IgE are not linked to the HLA system. The genes of IL-4 andIL-13, localised on the 5q chromosome, are therefore, in\"classical\" genetics, candidate genes for atopy, as is the IL-5 gene. Marsh et al. (289) found an association between markers in 5q31.1 and the presence of a high level of totalserum IgE. This study, confirmed in the general population(303), is undergoing thorough genetic exploration. In 1989, in a study of 20 families, Cookson and Hopkin used a serological definition of atopy and localised a geneon the chromosome 11q12-13 (291). They then found dif-ferent polymorphisms on the beta chain of the high affini-ty IgE receptor (Fc RI-\u00df-Leu181 and Fc RI-\u00df-E237G variants), is localised in this region (304-306).However, some discrepant results have been found (307). A linkage and an association between atopic asthma and markers on chromosome 13 was found in the Japan-ese population (308). Susceptibility loci on chromosome 12q have been described for both asthma and allergic rhinitis (309). 2-2-4- Conclusion The present data are fragmented. They require repro- duction by other teams and confirmation in the generalpopulation. One should remain cautious (most of the dataare to be confirmed) and patient (we are still far from aprecise physical identification of all the susceptiblegenes). The final stage will consist of modelling theinteraction of all these genetic and non-genetic factors(notably those of the environment), which lead to thephenotype \"allergic rhinitis\".S1623-1- ALLERGENS Allergens are antigens which induce and react with specific IgE antibodies. Since drugs or insect venoms,reactive haptens from occupational agents or drugs andthe discovery by Charles Blackley in the 1860s that pol-lens can cause allergic diseases, the number of allergenicsubstances which have been identified has expandedenormously. Allergens originate from a wide range ofanimals, insects, plants and fungi or are small molecularweight chemicals. They include proteins or glycoproteinsfrom inhalant allergens, foods, drugs or insect venoms,reactive haptens from occupational agents or drugs and,more rarely, glycans (as in the case of Candida albicans allergy (310)). 3-1-1- Nomenclature of allergens The allergen nomenclature has been established by the WHO/IUIS Allergen Nomenclature Subcommittee (311).Allergens are designated according to the taxonomicname of their source as follows: the first three letters ofthe genus, space, the first letter of the species, space andan Arabic number. The numbers are assigned to the aller-gens in order of their identification and the same numberis generally used to designate homologous allergens ofrelated species. For example, Der p 1 was the first Der- matophagoides pteronyssinus allergen identified and Der f 1 refers to the homologous allergen of Der- matophagoides farinae. If necessary, an additional letter is added to the genus or species abbreviation to avoidambiguity. For example, a distinction is made betweenantigen 5 of Vespula vulgaris and Vespula vidua by Ves v 5 and Ves vi 5. In the allergen nomenclature, a definition of \"major\" and \"minor\" allergens has been proposed. When over50% of the patients tested have the corresponding aller-gen-specific IgE, allergens can be considered as \"major\". 3-1-2- Molecular characteristics and function of allergens The first purified allergens were obtained in the 1960s by protein chemistry (312). However, major advanceshave been made on allergen characterisation andsequence determination using chemical, immunochemi-cal, biochemical and molecular biology techniques (313).Since 1988 when the first cDNA sequence of an allergenwas published, tremendous progress has been made inidentifying, cloning and expressing major allergens(314). The cDNAs of a large number of important aller-gens including mites, insects, Hymenoptera venoms, ani-mal proteins, pollens, moulds and foods have now beenisolated and sequenced (for review see 315, 316). These new technologies make it possible to characterise the structure of allergens and thus improve the standardisa-tion of allergen vaccines (317). Also, they are likely toimprove the diagnosis and treatment of allergic patients. Asan example, Bet v 1, the major allergen of birch pollen, isone of the best studied allergens and is part of of a multi-gene family. Several Bet v 1 isoforms and homologous pro-teins from closely related species (alder, hazel and horn-beam) have been isolated and their cDNAs cloned andcharacterised. This considerable degree of heterogeneityhas been attributed to glycosylation (or other post-transla-tional modifications), to isogenes coding for Bet v 1 iso-forms and/or to allelic variants (318). It was shown thatindividual birch trees produce various subsets of isoaller-gens which display differences in reactivity both towardsIgE antibodies and T-cells in humans (319). Recombinantisoforms of Cor a 1, the major allergen of hazel pollenwhich shares a large homology with Bet v 1, show differ-ent reactivities with allergen-specific clones(320). The dissection reactivity ofisoforms of the major birch pollen allergen Bet 1 suggestsa potential use of hypoallergenic isoforms for immunother-apy (321). X-ray crystal structures of Bet v 1, birch pollenprofilin and Phl p 2 have been studied (322, 323). Newforms of specific immunotherapy may be found since adetailed description of the major reactive epitopes may receptor aggregation, thereby reducing allergicresponse. Another promising strategy to increase the safetyof specific immunotherapy is through the use of allergenderivatives, which do not cause anaphylaxis. Such hypoal-lergenic isoforms have been produced in vitro for Der p 2 and Bet v 1 by site-directed mutagenesis (324, 325). Most allergens have associated activities with potent biological functions. The majority of allergens can bedivided into several broad groups based either on theirdemonstrable biological activity or on their significanthomology with proteins of known function (326). Theyinclude enzymes, enzyme inhibitors, proteins involved intransport and ubiquitouslow molecular weight (13,000-15,000 M(r)) actin bind-ing formation of F-actinstructures in vivo . It is localised to specific cellular regions through interaction with proline-rich sequences.It was shown to be essential for cytoskeletal rearrange-ments such as those essential to the process of pollentube growth (328). The major birch pollen allergen, Betv 1, shows ribonuclease activity (329). It may include asubset of defence-related genes that are activated in thepresence of microbial pathogens (330) and may beinvolved in anther ontogeny (331). Most mite allergensare associated with activities. of theseare digestive enzymes (332) whose specificities may dif-fer depending upon the substrate on which the mites aregrowing, e.g. human skin scales for Dermatophagoides or grain and fungi for storage mites.3- Allergens and trigger factorsJ ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL 3-1-3- Aeroallergens are very often involved in allergic rhini- tis (333). The increase in domestic allergens is partly responsible for the increase in the prevalence of allergic respiratorydisease or in the severity of asthma (266). The allergenspresent in the bedroom are derived principally from mites,pet animals, insects or from plant origin (e.g. ficus). 3-1-3-1- Mites3-1-3-1-1- House dust mitesMites make up a large part of house dust allergens. Asthma and perennial allergic rhinitis therefore dominatethe clinical picture. The majority of asthmatics andpatients suffering from persistent allergic rhinitis are sen-sitised to mites. House dust mites belong to the Pyroglyphidae family; subclass Acari, class of are:Dermatophagoides 346-348) and Blomia kulagini (349), particularly, but not only, in tropical and sub-tropical regions (350-352). These mites caninduce both asthma and rhinitis (353). Other house dust mite species present in tropical envi- ronments (354). Mites of the species of Dermatophagoides and Euro- glyphus feed on human skin danders which are particu- larly abundant in mattresses, bed bases, pillows, carpets,upholstered furniture and fluffy toys (355-360). Their growth is maximal under hot (above 20\u00b0C) and humid conditions (80% relative humidity). When humidi-ty is lower than 50%, the mites dry out and die (361). Thisis the reason why they are practically non-existent above1,800 metres in European mountains as the air is too dry. In fact, even though mites are present in the home all year round, there are usually two peak seasons (Septem-ber/October and April/May) in many but not in all Euro-pean countries (362, 363). Patients allergic to mitestherefore have symptoms all year round but with arecrudescence during these peak periods (364). More-over, the symptoms of patients allergic to mites areaggravated when it is humid. House dust mite allergen is contained in faecal pellets (10-20 \u00b5m). Airborne exposure occurs with the activedisturbance of contaminated fabrics and settles rapidlyafter disturbance. It has been shown that 100 mites per gram of house dust (or 2 \u00b5g of allergens per gram of dust) are sufficient to sen-sitise an infant. With approximately 500 mites per gram ofhouse dust (or 10 \u00b5g of allergens Der p1 (major allergen ofDermatophagoides pteronyssinus) ), the sensitised patient shows a relative risk of around 5 of developing asthma ata later date (365-367). The higher the number of mites, theearlier the first episode of wheezing (366). The prevalenceof sensitisation to mites in the general population is high-er in humid regions (20-35%) than in dry ones (15%). 3-1-3-1-2- Other dust mitesCertain are present in stocked grains and flour (368). These species are not found in bedding but have a definiteallergic importance in the house dust of very damp hous-es, in tropical environments where the growth of mouldsincreases their development, and in rural habitats. Thesemites are particularly important in agricultural allergies(369-371) and can induce persistent rhinitis (372, 373). Other species of mites intervene in other selected envi- ronments such as spider mites ( Panonychus ulmi) in Panonychus Tetranychus urticae sylviarum in poultry breeders (378). 3-1-3-2- PollensPollens were among the first allergens identified. The pollen grain is the male gametophyte of the vegetablekingdom. According to their mode of transport, one can distin- guish anemophilous and entomophilous pollens. The anemophilous pollens are very aerodynamic and are carried by the wind. They represent a major prob-lem for sensitised patients as they are emitted in largequantities, can travel long distances (such as 200 km)and consequently can affect individuals who are farfrom the pollen source. It is, however, those who arenearest the emission of the pollen who generally showthe most severe symptoms. The entomophilous pollens are those carried by insects. Attracted by colourful and perfumed flowersthey carry the pollens from the male flower to thefemale portion of the flower. The pollens are stickyand adhere to the antennae or other parts of the insects.Little pollen is liberated into the atmosphere and sen-sitisation thus requires direct contact between the sub-ject and the pollen source. This is the case, for exam-ple, with agriculturists (379) or florists (380) who arein contact with weeds or trees. However, atopicpatients may occasionally develop sensitisation tothese entomophilous pollens (381, both ento- mophilous and anemophilous. The capacity of pollens to sensitise is theoretically universal, but the nature and number of pollens varieswith geography, temperature and climate (383-385). Thepollen concentration in the atmosphere depends on thevegetation and climate of a given geographic zone. Thereare important regional differences. The pollens causingmost allergies are found among: grasses, certain weeds such Compositeae family (mug- and ragweed such as the birch, other Betulaceae (392-397), Oleaceae (the ash and olive tree (398-400)), the oakS164 Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL NOVEMBER 2001 (Fagaceae family), the plane tree (401), Cupressaceae (the cypress tree (402-405)), junipers (406), thuyas(407), the Japanese cedar (408) and the mountaincedar (409, 410) . Trees generally pollinate at the end of winter and at the beginning of spring. However, the length, durationand intensity of the pollinating period often vary fromone year to the next, sometimes making the diagnosisdifficult. Moreover, those patients allergic to tree pollenare often sensitised to other pollens, but the first pollenseason \"induces\" inflammation of the nasal mucousmembrane ascribed to the priming effect (8) (see chapter4-5-2). Grasses pollinate at the end of spring and begin-ning of summer, whilst weeds such as Ambrosia flower at the end of summer and beginning of autumn. Pari- etaria often pollinates over a long period of time (March- November) and is considered a perennial pollen. The size of the pollen varies from 10 to 100 \u00b5m on average. This explains pollen deposition in the nostrilsand more particularly in the eyes and also why mostpatients allergic to pollen have rhinitis and conjunctivitis.However, pollen allergens can be borne on micronic andsub-micronic particles (411, 412) and can induce and/orcontribute to the persistence of rhinitis and asthma. Thisis particularly the case in asthma attacks that occur dur-ing thunderstorms (413-417). Cross-reactivities between pollens are now better under- stood as they have been extensively studied and using mol-ecular biology techniques (418-420). However, it is notclear as to whether all in vitro cross-reactivities observed between pollens are clinically relevant (421). Major 422, 423), Betuleacea family (424)and Cupressaceae family (425) but not those of theUrticaceae family (426, 427). Moreover, there is clinicallylittle cross-reactivity between Ambrosia and other members of the Compositae family (428-430). For the grass pollenfamily, cross-reactivity is (431-433) Cynodon and Bahia grass (436). 3-1-3-3- Animal danders3-1-3-3-1- Cat and dog allergensThe modification of relationships between man and animals, and in particular the increase in the numberand variety of domestic animals, means that exposureand therefore sensitisation to animal allergens haveconsiderably increased in the last 20 years, especially inurban environments within industrial countries. It isestimated that in many European countries, cats are pre-sent in 1 in 4 residences. The dander and secretions of many animals carry or contain powerful allergens capable of causing severehypersensitivity reactions (437). Cats and dogs are themain culprits, especially since they are often in the bed-room. The major cat allergen (Fel d 1) is a glycoproteinwhich is transported in the air by particles smaller than2.5 \u00b5m (438). These particles can remain airborne forprolonged periods. They are also adherent and can thuscontaminate an entire environment for weeks or monthsafter the animal is removed (439). Additionally, theyadhere to clothing and are carried to areas in which thepet has no access such as schools and public buildings. The principal allergen sources are the sebaceous glands, saliva and the peri-anal glands. The principalallergen reservoir is cat fur. Fel d 1 is also present in highamounts in domestic dust, in upholstered furnishingsand, to a lesser degree, in mattresses. However, cat anddog allergens can be found in various environmentswhere animals do not live such as schools (440-442) andhospitals (360, 443). The low level cat exposure thatoccurs in many homes without cats is capable of induc-ing symptoms in some patients who are very sensitive tocats (444). Sensitisation to cats ranges from 2 to 30% ofthe general population and 15 to 50% of children withrhinitis or asthma are sensitised. The major dog allergen (Can f 1) is principally found in the dog's fur and can also be found in the saliva (445),skin and urine (446). This allergen can be transported inairborne particles. Patients allergic to cats and dogs frequently display IgE reactivity against allergens from different IgE epitopes ofthe major cat and dog allergens which can be demon-strated by IgE inhibition studies (450). 3-1-3-3-2- Horse (Equus caballus, Equ c)After a decrease in the last 20 years, allergy to horses is becoming more frequent. Most patients allergic tohorses initially develop nasal and ocular symptoms butlife-threatening asthma exacerbations are not uncommon. The allergens being very volatile, sensitisation is made by direct or indirect contact (451). The allergens arefound in the mane, sweat and urine. The major allergenof horse dander, Equ c1, has been identified (452, 453). Cross-sensitisation can sometimes be found with other equidae (pony, mule, donkey, zebra) and with cat, dogand guinea pig albumin. 3-1-3-3-3- Cattle (Bos domesticus, Bos d) Cow's dander allergy still remains present in rural environments within cattle breeding areas (454-456). Theallergens are found primarily in the danders and fur, butalso in urine, saliva, tears and the meat. Cross-reactionswith mutton, goat and even deer allergens have beendescribed (457). 3-1-3-3-4- Rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus, Ory c) 5 to 7% of patients sensitised to animals are allergic to rabbits (breeding rabbits in rural environments, domesticanimals in urban environments, laboratory animals). Theallergens are found in the fur and saliva (but are not pres-ent in the urine or serum). Cross-reactions with otherrodents have been described. 3-1-3-3-5- Other rodents: guinea pigs, hamsters, (Rattus norvegicus, Rat n), mice (Mus musculus, Musm), gerbils These animals can induce occupational sensitisation in laboratory personnel (10-40% of the exposed subjects)(458). Allergy to laboratory animals was also found toJ ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 108, NUMBER 5Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group S165 occur in children whose parents were occupationally exposed to mice, rats and hamsters (459). Two distin-guishable syndromes were identified (460). The first ischaracterised by rhinitis with negative skin prick tests. Thesecond consists of rhinitis leading progressively to asthmawith positive skin prick tests. Atopy (461, 462) and activesmoking (463) represent a risk for the development of lab-oratory animal allergy. Prick tests are diagnostically usefulonly in the latter. Allergens are contained in the fur, urine(464), serum (465) and saliva. Cleaning the cages of thesemammals mobilises large quantities of allergens. It has been shown that children can be sensitised to rodents in less than one year when directly exposed to them. Cross-reactive allergens between different rodents and rabbits have been demonstrated. 3-1-3-4- Fungal allergensSuperior fungi, moulds and yeast, are plants which do not possess chlorophyll but which liberate large quanti-ties of allergenic spores into the atmosphere. Widespreadin the air and resulting from putrefying organic matter,fungi and moulds are present everywhere except in areasof low temperatures or snow, which hinders their growth.Their development is increased particularly in hot andhumid conditions, which explains their seasonal peaksand abundance in certain hot and humid areas. The mould spores are small in size (3-10 \u00b5m) and pen- etrate deeply into the respiratory tract. They can provokerhinitis as well as asthma. For unknown reasons, childrenare more often sensitised to mould than adults (466). Three important types of mould and yeast can be distinguished according to their origin (467). The principal atmospheric moulds are represented by Cladosporium (468) , Alternaria (469-471) the summer whereas Aspergillus and Penicillium do not have a defined sea- son. Large regional differences are found (472-478). Domestic moulds are also very important allergens (475, 477, 479, 480). Microscopic fungi present insidehouses are capable of producing spores all year roundand are responsible for persistent symptoms, especial-ly in hot and humid interiors. Indoor moulds have beenassociated with dampness (481-484). These mouldscan also grow in aeration and climatisation ducts (cen-tral heating and air conditioning) and around waterpipes. They are particularly abundant in bathrooms andkitchens. The moulds also grow on plants which arewatered frequently or on animal or vegetable waste,furnishings, wallpaper, mattress dust and fluffy toys. In food, one can observe a certain number of moulds, which can be responsible not only for inhalant aller-gies but also food allergies. The predominant mouldsare and Fusarium and, more rarely, Mucor . Moulds and yeasts are present in some foods as they are used in the fabrication of numerous foodstuffs andmay be allergenic. Candida albicans, Saccaromyces cerevisiae and are the most allergenicyeasts. IgE-mediated sensitisation to yeast has been shown, atopic dermatitis (486-489). Mostyeast presents cross-reactive antigens in the atmosphere and Sporobolomyces roseum is responsible for asthma and rhinitis in Great Britain andin the Mediterranean region. Basidiomycetes and Ascomycetes spores are found in large quantities in the atmosphere and were found to beallergenic in patients with asthma and rhinitis (491, 492)but their role as an atmospheric allergen is still difficultto define. Occupational allergy to superior fungal sporeshas been described (493). 3-1-3-5- Insects Inhalation of insect waste can induce an IgE immune response and respiratory allergies. In this case, IgE isdirected against the protein fragments of insects, whichbecome airborne. However, allergen concentration mustbe very high to induce sensitisation. Certain allergens suchas haemoglobin of Diptera have been identified (494, 495). Allergy to insects such as the cricket can occur from occupational exposure (496). In certain hot and humid regions of the United States (497, 498) or tropical areas (499-501), allergies tocockroaches are as frequent as, or even more frequentthan, allergies to Ambrosia pollen or to house dust mites. However, cockroaches are also prevalent inmany European countries (443, 502, 503). Cockroach-es are particularly important in low income housing(\"inner city\") where they cause severe asthma (504).Cockroach allergen is found in gastrointestinal secre-tions as well as on the chitin shell. The allergen is dis-tributed in large particles that do not become airborne.Cockroaches tend to cluster in hiding places and for-age after dark. Seeing cockroaches during the day sug-gests that they are present in very large numbers. Theallergen is usually distributed throughout an infestedhome (505). Chironomides are particularly important in some trop- ical areas like the Sudan (506, 507). 3-1-3-6- Other Ficus benjamina , known as Java willow, Ceylon wil- low or Bali fig tree, is a tropical non-flowering plant usedornamentally in many homes and public places. Inhalantallergy to Ficus has been reported (508) and appears to be relatively common, probably because Ficus allergens are cross-reactive with those of latex (509). The allergensoriginally located in the sap of the plant are also presentin dust collected from the leaf surfaces as well as in floordust where the allergen may persist over months afterremoval of the plant (510). The allergic role of bacteria is controversial. At the present stage of our knowledge, it can be esti- mated that asthma or rhinitis induced by a bacterialallergy is exceptional, even though specific IgE to bac-teria have been found. However, the enzymes originating from bacteria used in industrial environments can cause a high prevalenceof asthma or rhinitis (511, 512). S166 Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL NOVEMBER 2001 Telluric bacteria, whose genes are used in certain transgenic plants, could also cause allergies but thedemonstration is not yet conclusive (513). 3-1-4- Food allergens Food allergy is a rare symptom in subjects with aller- gic rhinitis and without other symptoms. On the otherhand, rhinitis is a common symptom of food allergy inpatients with multiple organ involvement. Despite thewide variety of foods ingested, only relatively few causeallergic reactions. In infants of less than 6 months, themajority of allergic reactions are due to milk, egg orsoya. In adults, the most common food allergens causingsevere reactions are peanuts (514), tree nuts, fish, Crus-tacea, egg, milk, soya beans, sesame, celery and somefruits like apples and peaches (for review see 515). Most food allergens are native proteins but the aller- genic activity of some food allergens may be destroyedby heating (516) or during storage (e.g. in apples (517)).Others (e.g. casein, egg and fish) are not denaturated bycooking and digestion. Neo-allergens can also be pro-duced by heating and cooking (518). Differences may occur in the protein profiles of food as a result of agronomic factors. For example, agronom-ic conditions may affect the allergenicity or the storageproteins in peanuts and soya beans (80). Concern has been expressed about the introduction of allergenic proteins into food plants by genetic engineering.The US Food and Drug Administration has directed devel-opers and manufacturers of new plant varieties to considerthe allergenic potential of donor organisms in assessing thesafety of foods derived from genetically engineered plants(519). Such a concern was justified since 2S albumin fromBrazil nuts can be transferred into another food (soyabeans) by genetic engineering, enabling the transgenicsoya to induce positive skin tests in Brazil nut allergicpatients (520). Since numerous crop plants developed byplant technology have been introduced into the market-place, assessment of the allergenic potential of the foodsderived from these crops has been a critical component ofthe overall food safety assessment of these products. 3-1-5- Cross-reactive allergens between food and inhalant allergens are common. Patients with allergic rhinitis/conjunctivitis due to birch and, to a lesser extent, other Betulaceae (hazel,alder) pollen are frequently allergic to tree nuts, fruitsand vegetables, including apples, carrots and potatoes(521). Most patients develop mild symptoms but ana-phylaxis may occur from these cross-reacting foods.Some birch or hazel pollen allergens cross-react withthose of apple, other fruits (522, 523) or various nuts(424). Most patients with food hypersensitivity areseverely Some Compositae react with foods of the Ombelliferae family (celery, inparticular) (524). Although IgE antibodies to foodallergens are highly prevalent in patients allergic toBetulaceae and Compositeae pollens, only a proportionof patients present food allergy symptoms (525, 526). Ragweed ( Ambrosia ) (527) or grass pollen (528) sen- sitive individuals may present symptoms when eatingbanana or melon. On the other hand, clinically insignificant cross-reactiv- ity exists among cereal grains and grass pollens (529). Cross-reactive antigens have been identified between latex and banana, chestnut or kiwi fruit (530, 531). Although it is common to find positive skin tests and IgE antibodies to a range of legumes in peanut allergicpatients, only a small percentage of the individualsalso have clinical responses to legumes other thanpeanut. Such reactions are often less severe than to thepeanut itself (532). However, recent concern has beenraised for lupine, another member of the legume fam-ily, which appears to induce systemic reactions inpeanut allergic patients. Molecular biology-based approaches have also improved knowledge about cross-reactivity among aller-gens. The identification of allergens in fruits and vegeta-bles showed IgE cross-reactivities with the importantbirch pollen allergens, Bet v 1 (533) and Bet v 2 (birchprofilin) (534-537). Many other cross-reactive antigenshave also been identified and characterised. Depending onthe main cross-reactive allergen, different symptoms maybe observed. Bet v 1 in apples, cherries, peaches andplums primarily causes mild symptoms such as the oralallergy syndrome (538). However, Bet v 1 associated withother allergens may cause generalised symptoms. Sensiti-sation to Bet v 2 is more often associated with generalisedsymptoms, in particular urticaria and angioedema (539).Lipid-transfer proteins are relevant apple and peach aller-gens and, considering their ubiquitous distribution in tis-sues of many plant species, could be a novel pan-allergenof fruits and vegetables (540, 541). 3-1-6- Occupational allergens Occupational rhinitis is far less well documented than occupational asthma. Symptoms of rhinoconjunctivitisare often associated with occupational asthma and in onestudy, it was found that 92% of the subjects with occu-pational asthma experienced associated rhinitis (542). Rhinitis is less common than asthma in occupational reactions to low molecular weight agents. It more oftenappears before occupational asthma (542, 543). In Finland, furriers, bakers and livestock breeders had the highest relative risk of developing occupational rhini-tis (543). The prevalence of rhinitis in allergy to labora-tory animals is high (chapter 3-1-3). 3-1-6-1- LatexLatex allergy has become an increasing concern to patients and health professionals because of the over-whelming use of latex gloves (544) and its extensive usein many devices such as catheters. Health professionalsshould therefore become aware of this problem anddevelop strategies for treatment and prevention.J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 108, NUMBER 5Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group S167 Latex is almost exclusively obtained from the tree Hevea brasiliensis (Euphorbiaceae family). The first clinical case of immediate-type allergy (urticaria and angioedema) wasapparently reported in 1927 by Stern. In 1979, Nutter et al. reported a case of contact urticaria to latex gloves (545). Rubber is an important industrial and consumer prod- uct encountered in many household items and medicaldevices. The chemical additives used in its manufacturewere a well recognised cause of delayed-type hypersen-sitivity (allergic contact dermatitis) (546). However, dur-ing the past decade, immediate-type allergy to naturalrubber latex proteins (latex allergy) has emerged as aserious health issue. Frequent, prolonged wearing of nat-ural rubber latex gloves (547), especially amongst physi-cians, nurses and health professionals (548-551), andworkers (552) using rubber is a major risk factor for suchsensitisation. Moreover, natural rubber latex allergy iscommon in patients who have had multiple surgical pro-cedures or in those with spina bifida (553). Immediate type hypersensitivity reactions to latex are caused by an IgE-mediated allergic reaction and a Th2-type response (554). Eosinophilic inflammation (555) ofthe nasal mucosa has been observed. Symptoms of latex allergy include contact dermati- tis (type IV reaction), contact urticaria, rhinitis, asth-ma and, more occasionally, anaphylaxis (556). Skin tests and serum specific IgE can be used for the diagnosis of latex allergy (557, 558). If needed, provoca-tive challenge can be carried out. 3-1-6-2- Low molecular weight compoundsMany occupational agents inducing rhinitis are low molecular weight compounds such as isocyanates(559), aldehydes (560), ninhydrin (561), pharmaceuti-cal compounds (562) and others (563). More than 250different chemical entities have been identified.Although these can act as reactive haptens, non-immunological mechanisms are common. Some com-pounds like chlorine can induce irritant rhinitis in 30 to50% of exposed workers (75, 76). Formaldehyde is a low molecular weight volatile chemical widely used in industry and as a sterilisingagent in medicine. At high concentrations, it is toxic andcan induce irritant reactions, but as a reactive, hapten canbecome and contact dermatitis. However, IgE-mediated aller-gic reactions appear to be related mainly to the pharma-ceutical use of formaldehyde (564, 565). In homes,schools or occupational settings, formaldehyde maybecome an irritant (566, 567) and can cause, exception-ally, an IgE mediated reaction (568, 569). 3-1-6-3- Other occupational allergensBakers often present with rhinitis and asthma (570- 572). Sensitisation to bakery allergens seems to be themain cause of baker's asthma and rhinitis, but not inall cases (573). Swedish bakers studied in the 1970sand 1980s had a higher (x2) risk of developing rhini-tis than non-bakers (574). Nasal inflammation in bak-ers exposed to flour dust can be mediated by neu-trophils (575).Many other high molecular weight allergens can induce IgE-mediated rhinitis and asthma. These includecoffee beans (576), proteolytic enzymes (511, 577, 578),other enzymes (579), plants and flowers (580). Wood dust can induce rhinitis and asthma but the mech- anisms for these reactions are still unclear (581-583). 3-2- POLLUTANTS Epidemiological evidence suggests interaction between pollutants and rhinitis (see chapter 2-1-3-7). Themechanisms by which pollutants cause or exacerbaterhinitis are now better understood (584). 3-2-1- Characteristics of air pollution 3-2-1-1- Evolution of outdoor air pollution In the 1960s and 1970s in Europe and the USA, episodes of atmospheric winter pollution were frequent-ly responsible for acute mortality epidemics of cardio-vascular and respiratory diseases. The responsibility forsuch effects was given to high concentrations of sulphurdioxide (SO 2) and particulate matter (PM) in the air of cities, usually due to unfavourable meteorological con-ditions and air stagnation. There has been a significantreduction of industrial pollution in Western countrieswith the use of efficient filters in factory chimneys andof combustibles such as petrol and electricity, whichpollute less than coal. Such an effort is however notoperative in many developing countries. Moreover,urban-type pollution is still of major concern in Westerncountries due to several factors: improvement in the quality of life in Europe and the United States implicating a larger consumption ofenergy per capita , substitution of petrol in place of coal, and above all, since the 1970s, an increase in the num- ber of cars and, in Europe, diesel motors. 3-2-1-2- Automobile pollution Urban-type pollution originates essentially from auto- mobiles. The principal atmospheric pollutants emitted byautomobiles can be classified as:o xidant pollutants which are likely to chemically evolve in the troposphere due to sunrays. These are: carbon monoxide (CO), a result of incomplete coal combustion, but with no apparent involvement inrhinitis. nitric oxides (NO x) and especially NO and NO 2,a result of nitrogen oxidation in the air at high tem-peratures. volatile organic compounds (VOC) including hydro- carbons and some oxygen composites. The formed secondary pollutants are mainly ozone but there are also other species of oxidants (peroxyacetyl-nitrates, aldehydes, nitric acid, oxygen peroxide...). sulphur pollutants such as SO 2formed from diesel sulphur. High levels of SO 2sign acid-particulate pol- lution of industrial origin in relation to the combustionof coal and fuels, rich in sulphur. S168 Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL NOVEMBER 2001 o rganic c hemical a ones such as benzo(a)pyrene, benzo(k)fluoranthene, benzo-(b)fluoranthene, benzo(g,h,i)pirylene and benzo(a)-anthracene. The heavy composites, which are quantita-tively the most important, are adsorbed on the surface ofthe microparticles, whereas the volatile compositesremain in the gaseous phase. carbon dio xide (CO2), produced by the oxidation of the carbon of fuels. metals (notably lead), present initially in oils and fuels. par ticles(particulate matter, PM), produced mainly by the incomplete combustion of fuels and lubricants. 3-2-1-3- Characteristics of diesel emission These emissions are made up of a complex mixture of relatively light gases and of particles with a carbon coreon which are adsorbed organic composites of high mole-cular weight. The gaseous phase of diesel exhaust contains toxic or irritant substances: gases which are typically produced during the com- bustion of fuels (carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxideand nitric oxides, precursors to the formation ofozone). The emissions of CO are comparable or slight-ly inferior to those of a petrol engine. the lo w molecular w eight h ydrocarbons and their derivatives. The particulate phase of diesel emission is com- posed of aggregates of spherical micro-particles with acarbon core (approximately 0.2 \u00b5m of aerodynamic median diameter), on which are adsorbed organiccomposites of high molecular weight. These nano-particles represent a unique model in pulmonary toxi-cology, as they possess a very large specific surface,which is available for the adsorption of toxic organiccomposites such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons. Typi-cally, 10-40% of the mass of diesel particles is madeup of these organic chemical molecules, of whichsome are known carcinogens. Nevertheless, recentprogress in the preparation of diesel fuels has reducedthe particle content by approximately 95% comparedto older diesel engines. 3-2-1-4- Indoor air pollutionIndoor air pollution is of great importance since sub- jects in industrialised countries spend over 80% of theirtime indoors. Indoor pollution includes domestic aller-gens and indoor gas pollutants (156, 585), among whichtobacco smoke is the major source. However, other pol-lutants may have a role, especially when a fuel or wood-burning stove is present in the house (586, 587) with theemission of carbon oxides, nitric oxides, PM, VOC andSO2. Gas cooking may also be involved in respiratory symptoms (245), especially in women and atopics (588).Certain furniture may also liberate compounds utilisedduring the manufacturing process (plywood, glue, fab-ric, giving off formaldehydes and isocyanates) (567).However, in these studies, nasal symptoms were notusually examined.3-2-2- Pollutants of possible relevance in allergic rhinitis 3-2-2-1- Ozone Ozone (O 3) is a secondary pollutant formed from NOx and VOC, through a chain of sunlight dependent chemi-cal reactions. This transformation can take several hoursor days, in such a way that ozone is only usually formedat a distance from the source of primary gases (NOx andVOC) on the outskirts of large urban centres (589). Theproduction of ozone is maximal in steep-sided or verysunny geographical sites such as Southern California(590), Switzerland, Austria, Germany, the south ofFrance and around large cities. The ozone peaks occurfrom April to September in the Northern Hemisphere.During recent years, the situation seems to have wors-ened because of a deterioration in the quality of the air orthe climatic conditions. Nearly 40% of the inhaled ozone is absorbed by the nasal mucosa. In vitro , ozone can induce inflammation (591). Ozone challenge results in nasal congestion,increased response to nasal (596) but has no effect on the early-phase reac-tion (597). In a longitudinal study (598), in order toinvestigate nasal inflammation after ambient ozone expo-sure, nasal lavage fluid was collected from 170 schoolchildren on 11 occasions between March and October.The results showed acute inflammation of the nasalmucosa after the first increase in ambient ozone levels.There was a significant dose-dependent increase inleukocyte and ECP levels, and a possible adaptation ofthe nasal mucosa in spite of constant high levels of ozoneexposure in the children during the summer season. Afterone month of exposure to air pollution (Mexico City) andhigh levels of ozone, most subjects developed nasalsymptoms with significant nasal epithelial lesions (79). Zwick et al. (599) have compared one group of 218 children exposed to high levels of ozone (more than120 \u00b5g/m3during 45% of the period with a maximum of 376 \u00b5g/m3) to another group of 281 children exposed to low doses of ozone (less than 1% of the period to aconcentration of more than 120 \u00b5g/m3with a maximum of 190 \u00b5g/m3). The concentrations of NO 2and SO 2 were identical in both groups. No significant difference between the two groups was found in the frequency ofallergic rhinitis, total IgE levels and positive skin teststo common aeroallergens. Bronchial hyperreactivitywas however higher in the group exposed to high lev-els of ozone. However, no correlation between thesymptoms of rhinitis and high ozone peaks wasobserved and there was no difference between atopicand non-atopic children. 3-2-2-2- Sulphur dioxide (SO 2) In Eastern European countries, SO 2pollution was still common in 1989. However, in Western Europe and NorthAmerica where, at the present time, most measuring net-works indicate an annual average S0 ARIA Workshop Group S169 even less than 10\u00b5g/m3(EU 24 hour limit : 250\u00b5g/m3, WHO 24 hour limit : 125\u00b5g/m3), the prevalence of sea- sonal allergic rhinitis and skin test reactivity to aeroaller-gens is more frequent (218). Thus, S0 2 does not greatly influence clinical sensitisation to aeroallergens. In con-trast, high automobile pollution appears to be involved. It has been shown that exposure to S0 2decreases the secretion of nasal mucous and increases the resistance ofthe nasal airways (600, 601). Ten teenagers sufferingfrom allergic asthma were exposed to 1400\u00b5g/m 3of S02 during 5 consecutive days and during physical effort.There was a significant increase in the upper airwayresistance. 3-2-2-3- Nitric dioxide (NO 2) In Europe, NOx are emitted in approximately equal quantities from energy sources and road traffic. NO 2lev- els do not generally exceed the EU limit value(200\u00b5g/m3per hour). Moreover, for a complete evalua- tion of the effect of NOx on respiratory health, one mustalso take into account the production of these gasesinside homes, in particular the domestic use of naturalgas should be considered. The effect of exposure to NO 2was studied in 625 0-5 year-old Swiss children living in three different areas:cities (31 and 22 \u00b5g/m3of NO 2), sub-urban areas (19.4 \u00b5g/m3of NO 2) and rural zones (11.1 \u00b5g/m3of NO 2)(602). Symptoms of irritation of the upper respiratory tract were higher in the zones with high concentrations of NO 2. 3-2-2-4- Particulate matter (PM)They can be classified according to their diameter: PM 10 (less than 10\u00b5m), PM 2.5 (less than 2.5\u00b5m) andnanoparticles (less than 1\u00b5m). The finer the particles,the deeper they penetrate into the respiratory tract.They are also capable of passing through the air-bloodbarrier (603). Pope et al. (604) studied the relationship between upper respiratory tract symptoms and exposure to PM10in two groups of subjects: one group consisted of 591 9-10 year-old children and the other comprised 66 asth-matics. They found a 1.5 increased risk of ENT symp-toms with regard to the rise of PM10 concentrations inthe group of 591 children only. In another study (605),the same authors studied 60 asthmatic children and 60non-asthmatic children. In the group of asthmatics, theENT symptoms increased with the concentrations ofPM10, from 21 to 33%. No difference was found in thenon-asthmatics. 3-2-2-5- Volatile organic compounds (VOC) and formaldehyde Even though formaldehyde and VOC are mainly indoor pollutants, they are detectable in some cities suchas Los Angeles (6-100\u00b5g/m 3), at concentrations able to induce irritating symptoms of the upper respiratory tract(606): from 0.1-20 ppm (120\u00b5g to 20,000\u00b5g/m 3) (see chapter 3-1-6). 3-2-2-6- Automobile pollutionThere is growing evidence that fossil fuel combustion products act as adjuvants in the immune system and maylead to the enhancement of allergic inflammation (607,608). Through this mechanism, particulate air pollutantsmay be an important contributor to the increased preva-lence and morbidity of asthma and allergic rhinitis.Diesel exhaust particles were shown to skew theimmune response towards IgE production (609) andinduce allergic inflammation (610-612). Experimentalstudies in animals (613-617) and humans (618) haveshown that diesel exhaust particulates enhance IgE pro-duction by a variety of mechanisms. These includeeffects on cytokine and chemokine production (619), aswell as activation of macrophages and other mucosalcell types including epithelial cells (620-623). Dieselexhaust particulates may also act as an adjuvant ofpollen allergens (624). Metabolic and cellular activationpathways were linked to chemicals such as polycyclicaromatic hydrocarbons contained in diesel exhaust par-ticulates (625). Cross-sectional studies have demonstrat-ed that allergic rhinitis in general and pollinosis toJapanese cedar pollen in particular (626, 627) is moreprevalent in subjects living in areas of heavy automobiletraffic (627). However, these epidemiological studiesneed confirmation. 3-2-2-7- Tobacco smokeIn smokers, eye irritation and odour perception are more common than in non-smokers (628). Moreover,there are smokers with reported sensitivity to tobaccoTABLE 6: List of the NSAIDs that cross-react with aspirin in respiratory reactions Generic well tolerated by the majority of patients, especially in doses not exceeding 1000 mg/day. Nimesulide and meloxicam in higher doses might precipitate nasal and bronchial symptoms. The tol-erance of the celecoxib = be tested.S170 and the ARIA Workshop Group J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL NOVEMBER 2001 smoking, some of the symptoms being headaches and nose irritation (rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, postnasaldrip and sneezing) (629). The more the subjects smoke,the more they report chronic rhinitis (251) . Objective assessments have confirmed that smoke-sensitivepatients present with rhinorrhea and/or nasal obstruc-tion when challenged with tobacco smoke (630).Tobacco smoke does not appear to be allergenic in con-tradistinction to tobacco leaves in exposed workers(631, 632). Tobacco smoke can alter mucociliary clear-ance (633) and can cause an eosinophilic and the nasal mucosa of non-atopicchildren (634). 3-3- DRUGS 3-3-1- Aspirin intolerance and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) commonly induce rhinitis and asthma(Table 6). In a population-based random sample, aspirin-intolerance was more frequent among subjects with aller-gic rhinitis than among those without (2.6% vs. 0.3%,p.<0.01) (149). In about 10% of adult patients with asth-ma, aspirin and other NSAID that inhibit cyclooxygenase(COX) enzymes (COX-1 and -2) precipitate asthmaticattacks and naso-ocular reactions (148, 635). This dis-tinct clinical syndrome, called aspirin-induced asthma, ischaracterised by a typical sequence of symptoms, intenseeosinophilic inflammation of nasal and bronchial tissues,combined with an overproduction of cysteinyl-leuko-trienes (CysLT). After ingestion of aspirin or otherNSAID, an acute asthma attack occurs within 3 hours,usually accompanied by profuse rhinorrhea, conjunctivalinjection, periorbital edema and sometimes a scarletflushing of the head and neck. Aggressive nasal polypo-sis and asthma run a protracted course, despite the avoid-ance of aspirin and cross-reacting drugs. Bloodeosinophil counts are raised and eosinophils are presentin nasal mucosa and bronchial airways. Although at onetime aspirin-induced asthma was thought not to occur inatopic patients, positive skin test responses to commonaeroallergens can be present in patients with aspirin-induced asthma. 3-3-2- Other drugs See chapter 1-4.S1714- Mechanisms Allergy is classically considered to result from an IgE- mediated allergy associated with nasal inflammation ofvariable intensity. However, it is now also appreciated that allergens, on account of their enzymatic proteolytic activity, maydirectly activate cells (636). House dust mite allergenshave been shown to activate epithelial cells in vitro (637). They induce cytokine and chemokine release(638) and thus have the potential to induce airwayinflammation independent of IgE. Moreover, Der p1 isable to alter the epithelial tight junctions (639) therebyincreasing epithelial permeability (640). The relativeimportance of non-IgE to isundetermined. Pollen-induced rhinitis is the most characteristic IgE- mediated allergic disease and is triggered by the interac-tion of mediators released by cells which are implicatedin both allergic inflammation and non-specific hyperre-activity (641). This disease can be mimicked by nasalchallenge with pollen allergens (642) but such a chal-lenge differs from the natural course of the disease inthat it is a single provocation and does not reflect themultiple triggers which occur during the pollen season.In persistent allergic rhinitis, allergic triggers interactwith an on-going inflammatory situation. Symptoms arecaused by this complex interaction. Histamine was discovered just after the turn of the century and rapidly became known as the mediator ofallergic and anaphylactic reactions. In the late 1930s, itappeared that other chemical mediators such as the slowreacting substances of anaphylaxis (SRS-A) wereinvolved in allergic reaction. The mechanisms of allergicreaction are now better understood and although hista-mine (released by mast cells and basophils) is still one ofthe major effectors of the allergic reaction, many othermediators produced by different cell types are involved.Thus, mediators, cytokines, chemokines, neuropeptides,adhesion molecules and cells co-operate in a complexnetwork provoking the specific symptoms and the non-specific hyperreactivity of allergic rhinitis. Allergic rhinitis is characterised by an inflammatory infiltrate made up of different cells. This cellularresponse includes: chemotaxis, selective recruitment and transendothelial migration of cells, localisation of cells within the different compartments of the nasal mucosa, activation and differentiation of various cell types as well as a prolongation of their survival, release of mediators by these activated cells, regulation of the local and systemic IgE-synthesis, communication with the immune system and the bone marrow. These events take place only in subjects who have already been sensitised to allergens, e.g. allergen-specif-ic IgE-antibodies have been formed and bound to themembrane of mast cells and other cells. They do not takeplace in healthy individuals, who do not show a measur-able reaction of the nasal mucosa to the same allergens. Understanding the mechanisms of disease generation provides a framework for rational therapy in this disor-der, based on the complex inflammatory reaction ratherthan on the symptoms alone. 4-1- THE NORMAL NASAL MUCOSA 4-1-1- Anatomy and physiology of the nose Whereas the form of the external nose is shaped by the upper and lower cartilages wrapped by skin and facialmuscles in prolongation of the nasal bony pyramid, theinternal nose mainly consists of a with respiratory mucosa. The nasal septum dividesthe nasal cavity into two sides and is composed of carti-lage and bone, again covered by mucosa. Only the firstfew millimetres are covered by skin. The continuousslow growth of the septum up to the age of 30 mightexplain frequently observed septal deviations in adults,leading to some degree of nasal obstruction. From an aerodynamic point of view, the nose may be divided into: the vestibule, lined with stratified squamous epitheli- um, the isthmus region, accounting for approximately 50% of the total resistance to respiratory airflow, the nasal cavity, where the inferior, middle and supe- rior turbinates increasethe mucosal surface to about 150 to200 cm 2and facilitate humidification, temperature regulation and filtration of inspired air. Nasal air flow changes from laminar to turbulent depending on the speed of inspiration and the anatomicalsituation. Together with the differential pressure betweenthe nostril and the nasopharynx, it can be measured byactive rhinomanometry (643). The olfactory mucosa is located above the middle turbinate, inferior to the cribriform plate. It containsodour-receptor cells and also receives taste signals.Severe nasal obstruction, chemical signals that mediate sexual andterritorial behaviours, has been described in vertebratesand may also be functional in the human nose. The lateral nasal wall receives the openings of the maxillary, anterior ethmoidal and frontal sinuses as wellas drainage from the naso-lachrymal duct, whereas thesphenoid drains into the posterior wall. In the middlemeatus, lateral and below the middle turbinate, theS172 Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL NOVEMBER 2001 ostiomeatal complex is located where the anterior eth- moidal cells, the maxillary sinus and the frontal sinus aredrained into the nasal cavity. Any obstruction, caused byanatomical deviations or mucosal swelling and scar for-mation, may heavily impair the drainage and ventilationof these sinuses with a consecutive sinus disease. The nasal mucosa consists of three layers (Figure 2): the ciliated epithelium, the basement membrane the lamina propria or submucosa. Three types of cells are identified within the epithelium: basal cells, goblet cells, ciliated or non-ciliated columnar cells, which are all attached at the basement membrane. They also adhereto neighbouring cells, forming the epithelial barrier. The submucosa contains cellular components, serous and seromucous nasal glands, nerves and a complex vas-culature. A thin layer of mucus, consisting of a low viscosity sol phase and a viscous gel phase, covers the nasal epitheliumand is constantly transported to the nasopharynx by ciliarymovements. secretions have multiple sources suchas the glands, goblet cells, tears and exudationfrom Secretions consist of albumin,immunoglobulins, proteolytic and and cells, an infection. Mucociliary transport is dependent onthe right consistence of the mucus and on the effectivemovement of the cilia, which beat about 1,000 times perminute, moving the superficial gel layer and the debristrapped therein at a speed of about 3 to 25 mm/minute.Viral or bacterial infections as well as allergic inflamma-tion have been shown to heavily decrease or abrogatemucociliary clearance (644). When airborne allergen par-ticles are inhaled through the nose, the majority of parti-cles larger than 5 mm in size are deposited on the surfaceof the nasal mucosa and then transported from the nose tothe pharynx within 15 to 30 minutes. During this process,particles do not appear to penetrate directly into the nasalmucosa due to their large size. However, water-solubleantigenic substances are eluted from the particles and maybe absorbed quickly by the nasal mucosa. 4-1-2- Nasal microvasculature The microvasculature of the nose consists of (645) (Figure 3): a dense subepithelial network of capillaries, with fen- estrations between the endothelial cells. This networkprovides nutrients to the epithelium and glands andallows passage of water into the lumen for evaporationand air-conditioning. arteriovenous anastomoses which allow rapid passage of blood through the mucosa. They are probablyimportant in air-conditioning and in the counter cur-rent mechanisms that tend to keep the brain cool in ahot dry climate. The anatomical interrelationshipsbetween these different systems are not well under-stood, nor is their differential control in terms of medi-ator and nerve actions. a system of capacitance vessels or sinuses which, when they distend, block the nasal lumen, and whenthey empty, open the nasal passages. Changes in theirvolume will affect the filtering and air-conditioningfunctions of the nose. The arteries are surrounded by a FIGURE 2: The nasal mucosa. FIGURE 3: Nasal vasculature.J 5Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group S173 smooth muscle layer that controls blood supply into the venous sinusoids, also referred to as capacitancevessels. With these elements, the nasal mucosa canshrink or expand rapidly by changing the blood vol-ume in response to neural, mechanical, thermal orchemical stimuli. The high degree of vascularisation isone of the key features of the nasal mucosa andchanges in vasculature may lead to severe nasalobstruction (646). Changes in the blood content ofthese structures also regulate the free lumen of the twonasal cavities. In most individuals under normal con-ditions, this results in a rhythmic alternating conges-tion and decongestion of the mucosa, referred to as thenasal cycle (647, 648). 4-1-3- Mucous glands Nasal fluid is a heterogeneous substance. Fluid accu- mulated in the nasal cavity can be produced by the nasalmucous membrane, derived from the eyes or from theparanasal sinuses. In normal subjects, it consists largelyof a secretory product derived from the small seromu-cous glands (649). Secretory products from glands andgoblet cells are of importance for the composition offluid on the mucosal surface. Furthermore, water andelectrolyte transport over the surface epithelium andglandular ducts are also significant. 4-1-3-1- Goblet cells and mucous glandsThe density of goblet cells in the nose and in the large airways is approximately 10,000/mm 2 (650). The number of goblet cells and mucous glands does not appear toincrease in chronic rhinitis (651-653). Anterior serous glands consist of 200 purely serous glands located to the entrance of the nose, the internalostium. Their contribution to the total amount of rhinor-rhea is unknown. Small seromucous glands are present in the submu- cosa of the nasal mucosa (650). After birth, the density ofnasal glands decreases constantly. At birth, the number ofglands in the nose reaches a maximum of 34glands/mm 2, while there are 8.3 glands/mm2in the adult nose. These differences may explain why rhinorrhea iscommon in infants and children. There are only slightdifferences in gland density within different parts of thenose. The total number of glands in the nose is approxi-mately 100,000. Normal paranasal sinuses have very few glands (50- 100 glands in each sinus), while pathologicallyinflammed sinus mucosa contains newly developed andpathological glands which are purely mucous (650).Therefore, sinus secretions, derived from mucous ele-ments surface epithelium, consist of high-ly viscoelastic mucus. This does not contribute to wateryrhinorrhea but to post-nasal drip. 4-1-3-2- Sources of nasal fluid rhinorrheaIn rhinitis, hypersecretion from nasal glands is of para- mount importance. However, an active secretory processin the nose appears to be the main cause of watery rhi-norrhea (654). Moreover, there is an enhancement inmucus discharge from the inferior turbinate goblet cellsof patients with perennial allergic rhinitis, attributed to increase of nasal goblet cell functionalactivity (655). Plasma exudation is a sign of inflammation and it has been proposed that plasma exudation contributes signifi-cantly to the volume of nasal surface fluid (656). A normal production of nasal secretions can be asso- ciated with nose blowing when the mucociliary transportsystem does not work at all. This is the case in primaryciliary dyskinesia (657) and when its function is reduced. 4-1-3-3- Control of the secretory processThe airway glands are controlled by the parasympathet- ic nervous system. Stimulation of sensory nerves, e.g. bycold air or by histamine, initiates a reflex arc, which resultsin the stimulation of glandular cholinoceptors. Conse-quently, the effect of anticholinergics can be used as ameasure of the contribution of parasympathetically stimu-lated glandular secretion to the volume of nasal fluid. 4-1-4- Cells of the nose The structure of the nasal mucosa of normal subjects has been widely studied. It has been found that there aremany different cell types present including CD1 + Langerhans-like cells, cells, CD4+T-cells, B-cells, macrophages and some eosinophils (658-662). Secretory immunity in primary defence of the nasal mucosa. B-cells involved in this local immune sys-tem are initially stimulated in mucosa-associated lym-phoid tissue, including tonsils and adenoids. secretory IgA (a immunoglobulinwith an incorporated secretory component and J chain tofacilitate external transport), as well as IgG and to a lesserextent pentameric IgM and IgD form the humoral defenceof the nasal mucosa. Plasma cells can be seen in the nasalmucosa of patients with allergic rhinitis (664). 4-1-5- Nerves of the nose The nerves present in nasal mucosa have been charac- terised and include of system (NANC). Senso-ry C fibres from the trigeminal contain sub-stance neurokinin A and K (NK) and calcitoningene-related peptide (CGRP). These are contained with-in nerve endings around the sphenopalatine ganglioncells and around blood vessels as well as beneath or with-in the epithelium. Pre-ganglionic cholinergic fibressynapse nasal secretion. J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL NOVEMBER 2001 Parasympathetic nerve stimulation induces glandular secretion, which is blocked by atropine and causesvasodilatation. These effects are used for testing nasalreactivity with methacholine, a cholinomimetic agent. Sympathetic nerve stimulation causes vasoconstric- tion and thus decreases nasal airway resistance. Peptides from sensory nerves, such as calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP), substance P and neurokinin A,are suspected to play a role, both in normal subjects andallergic patients, in vasodilatation, plasma extravasation,neurogenic inflammation and in mast-cell nerve interac-tions (675, 676). However, the nasal reaction to neu-ropeptides is still controversial (677). Substance P and gastrin releasing peptide (CGRP) may induce glandular secretion (672, 678-682), butintranasal provocation needs high dosages of exoge-nous peptides to provoke positive responses. Intranasal Substance P did not induce hypersecretion (683) or any other symptom (684). Intranasal Substance P and Neurokinin A increased nasal airway resistance without a clear dose-response-relationship (685). Eosinophil recruitment also requires a very high dose of Substance P compared to the amount released locally(686). Intranasal CGRP did not induce hypersecretion (683). On the other hand, intranasal application of NPY evoked a dose-dependent reduction of nasal mucosalblood flow (687) and probably functions as a long-act-ing vasoconstrictor (688). Bombesin was found to cell secretion in glandular Cells Using immunohistochemistry, it was shown in the late 1980s that not only eosinophils and metachromatic cells butalso IgE-positive cells migrate into the nasal epithelium.Compared to the status outside season, they are thenredistributed towards the epithelial surface due to seasonalallergen exposure. Later, it was also found that macrophagesand monocyte-like cells invade the mucosa after artificial,seasonal and perennial allergen exposure The same phe-nomenon is observed for Langerhans cells representingstrong antigen presenters to the local immune system. Fur-thermore, a subset of T-cells, activated T helper cells, wereshown to increase in number or at least increase in activitywithin the mucosa under natural allergen exposure. 4-2-1-1- Mast cellsSince the discovery of the granule laden mast cell(Mastzellen ) in 1879 by Paul Ehrlich and the description by Riley et al. (691) about the presence of the preformed mediators, histamine, in the mast cell, much has beenlearnt about its biochemical characteristics and function-al properties. In 1966, Enerback first classified mast cells(in rats) based on the morphology, size and density ofgranules as well as on their staining properties (692).Subsequently, Irani et al. classified human mast cells into two phenotypically distinct subpopulations. These werebased on the type of neutral proteases they express,namely MC(T) that contain only tryptase and G and carboxypeptidasein addition Mast are derived from CD34 +hematopoietic progenitor cells (694, 695), which migrate to and maturein the peripheral tissues (696). Interactions between thetyrosine kinase receptor c-kit expressed on the surface ofmast cells and their precursors and the c-kit ligand, stemcell factor (SCF), are essential for normal mast celldevelopment and survival (697). Stem cell factor isexpressed on the plasma membrane of a variety of struc-tural cells like fibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells.The extracellular cleavage (698) .In fact, CD34 + c-kit-tryptase-IgE-cells (presumably progenitor cells) were detected in the surface compartment of allergicnasal mucosa (699, 700). When activated by an IgE-dependent or independent mechanism, mast cells release: histamine and granule proteins such as of membrane phospholipids cytokines. These are present in mast cells as pre- formed mediators. When mast cells are activated viathe high affinity IgE receptor (Fc RI), a release of sev- eral cytokines has been observed. This release is fasterthan that of T-cells in which cytokines are not pre-formed. These include Th2 such as and TNF- (704, 705). Mast cells were release chemokines such as GM-CSF, MCP-1, IC-8RANTES, MIP-1 and CC-chemokines. responsive toMCP-3, MCP-4, cells IL-5, 6 and 7, whereas MC(TC)mast cells preferentially express IL-4 (706, 707). Therelease of Th2 cytokines by mast cells may be of greatimportance in the regulation of the IgE immuneresponse. It has been shown that nasal mast cells caninduce the synthesis of IgE (707) (Figure 4). Mast cells were recently shown as being sentinels of innate immunity (708). In the nasal mucosa of patients with allergic rhinitis, there is a significant increase in the numbers of intraep-ithelial MC (T) mast cells (700). Morphologically, mastJ 108, NUMBER 5Bousquet Workshop S175 cells in nasal epithelium and superficial lamina pro- pria resemble MC(T) and in the deep lamina pro- pria resemble MC(TC) (709). Several studies have shown that nasal mast cells are activated in rhinitis (641,710). Several mast cell derived mediators 711), CysLT in nasal secretions after allergen chal-lenge and during the season in pollen-induced rhinitis.Nasal mast cells recovered from patients with allergicrhinitis can release IL-4, IL-6 and IL-13 when stimulat-ed by mite allergen (707, 714). Recently, it has been shown that mast cells in the aller- gic nasal mucosa exhibit increased expression of VLA-4and VLA-5 Mast cell extra cellular matrix interac-tions increase cytokine secretion from these cells (716).Such a mechanism may contribute to the enhancement ofmast cell activation, especially when the levels of antigenin the microenvironment are rather low. Thus, mast cells are not only effector cells of the immediate-phase response. They also act as immunoreg-ulatory cells of the late-phase allergic reaction as well asof the on-going allergic inflammation the CD34+hematopoietic progenitor cells. They ordinarily differentiate and mature in the bone marrowand then circulate in the blood (694, 719). Interleukin 3(IL-3) appears to be an important developmental factorfor basophils, although other growth factors may alsoinfluence basophil development (720). The basophil isthe least common blood granulocyte in humans, with aprevalence of approximately 0.5% of total leukocytesand 0.3% of nucleated marrow cells. While humanbasophils appear to exhibit kinetics of production andperipheral circulation similar to those of eosinophils, thebasophil, unlike the eosinophil, does not normally occurin peripheral tissues in significant numbers (717).Basophils can infiltrate sites of many immunological orinflammatory processes, often in association witheosinophils (721). Basophils are not normally detected in the nasal mucosa or surface lining fluid. Basophilic granulocyteshave been demonstrated in the lung and sputum of in the nasal mucosa and secretion patients and in lesions of atopic dermati-tis patients. The number of basophils correlates with theseverity of the disease (722). Analyses of mediator pro-files and cellular contents of lavages of the nose, skin andlung during allergic late-phase reactions (LPR) havedemonstrated histamine, but not cells have been characterised asbasophilic granulocytes (723). This indicates that infil-trating basophils are activated and release their inflam-matory contents in the LPR. Although the ability of basophils to produce cytokines has been less extensively studied than mast cell cytokineproduction, several reports have demonstrated thatmature human basophils isolated from peripheral bloodcan release IL-4 and IL-13 in response to Fc RI-depen- dent activation (724, 725). This release can be enhancedin basophils exposed to IL-3 but not to certain othercytokines (726). Basophils may also participate in theTh2-type immune response. As they can be activatedrapidly after allergen challenge, it has been postulatedthat they may have a prominent effect in the early regu-lation of the IgE immune response (727). 4-2-1-3- EosinophilsEosinophils were described by Paul Ehrlich in 1879 based on their specific staining behaviour. Over the fol-lowing decades, they rapidly became associated withasthma, cutaneous and parasitic diseases as bystandercells. However, today, their pro-inflammatory functionsand their important role in chronic allergic diseases areclearly recognised (728), turning them into major targetsfor basic and therapeutic research. They may howeverpossess some anti-fibrosis effects (Figure 5). Eosinophils derive from the bone marrow from a pro- genitor cell (CD34+) that may develop into eithereosinophils or basophils (729). Eosinophil progenitors canbe found in the nasal mucosa seasonal allergic rhinitis(730) and in nasal polyps (731). Eotaxin appears to be crit-ical for the maturation and release of eosinophils from thebone marrow. In the peripheral blood, where they repre-sent only a small fraction (about 1%) compared to tissues,eosinophils have a short half-life of about 8 to 18 hours.They migrate into tissue upon an appropriate signal by a FIGURE 5: The role of eosinophils in rhinitis.

IL-5 (732, 733) and GM-CSF act to enhanceeosinophil recruitment, terminal maturation and theexpression of their adhesion molecules (734-736).Chemokines such as RANTES (737, 738) and eotaxin(739) also act on eosinophil recruitment to enhance theirrecruitment and possibly their activation. Within the tissue,eosinophils mature and stay alive for several days or evenweeks. They are dependent on survival signals from theenvironment which overcome programmed cell death(apoptosis) (740, 741). The regulation of apoptosis bycytokines, surface receptors and intracellular signal path-ways is now better understood, opening new perspectivesfor the treatment of eosino-philic diseases (742). Mature eosinophils are easily recognisable by their bi- lobed nucleus and specific granules consisting of an elec-tron dense core and an electron lucent matrix (crystal-loid) containing: major basic protein Furthermore, enzymes includ- ing acid phosphatase and arylsulfatase B (746) which isable inhibit CysLT. intermediates, and crystal proteins (750) and histaminase (751). Eosinophils express various membrane receptors for (752-754), adhesion ligands (755) andsoluble as following in such as ECP or MBP Eosinophilsalso increase in the nasal epithelium and submucosa ofpatients with seasonal (758) or perennial allergic rhinitis(661). In house dust mite allergic patients, eosinophils andtheir mediators are also found glucocorticosteroids profoundly reducenasal (760). increase vascular permeability and mucus secretion. Eosinophilsmay also be deleterious in rhinitis by the release of high-ly toxic products (MBP, ECP, EDN and oxygen free radi-cals) which induce an alteration of the surface epithelium. 4-2-1-4- T-lymphocytes T-lymphocytes are among the principal factors thatregulate and co-ordinate immune responses in allergicdiseases. Although a strict dichotomy is not as clear as inthe murine system (761-764), two helper T-cell subsetshave been identified humans (203, 765): Th1 T-cells which mainly release IFN- and IL-2 involved in the delayed hypersensitivity immunereactions, Th2 T-cells, which mainly release IL-4 and IL-5 and are involved in IgE-mediated allergic inflammation (Figure 6). An imbalance of Th1 and Th2 cells has been proposed in various diseases. In atopy, Th2 cells are thought to pre-dominate regulating IgE synthesis and cell recruitment atthe sites of inflammation. T-cell differentiation, activationand cytokine production is determined by several factors(766) including cytokines (767), growth factors (768),inflammatory mediators (769) and hormones (770). There is growing evidence that Th1 and Th2 subsets can be differentially recruited into tissues to promote dif-ferent types of inflammatory reaction (771). Th1 but notTh2 cells are recruited through P and E selectin intoinflamed tissues, where they induce delayed-type hyper-sensitivity reactions. eotaxin-receptor CCR3,originally described on eosinophils and basophils, wasalso found on Th2 cells. The attraction of Th2 cells byeotaxin could represent a key mechanism in allergic reac-tions because it promotes the allergen-driven productionof IL-4 and IL-5 necessary to activate basophils chemokines Mucosal inflammation in allergic rhinitis charac- by infiltration of T-lymphocytes and CD25+(activated) T-cells) both in the sub- mucosa and the epithelium (756, 774). There is a signif-icant correlation between the increase in CD4 +T-cells during the late-phase allergic reaction following an aller-gen challenge and the number of infiltrating eosinophilsin the mucosa (756). This is associated with an increasedexpression IL-5, GM-CSF in CD4 +T memory cells, CD4+T cells and B-cells in the nasal mucosa (774). This is associated withan increase in the number of IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 posi-tive cells suggesting a pattern increase in intra-epithelial /T-cells in peren- nial allergic patients (774, 778). /T-cells of impor- FIGURE 6: The role of the ARIA Workshop Group S177 tance as they are able to regulate allergic immune responses through their capacity to induce IgE synthesisby B-cells (779-782). 4-2-1-5- B-lymphocytesIn the associa- tion with stromal cells (783) which interact by direct con-tact or via cytokines to induce differentiation (784). Mostof the progenitors, precursors and immature cells will diewithin the bone marrow. However, after screening forauto reactivity, some B-cells will complete their matura-tion and express not only IgM but also IgD (mature vir-gin B-cells) (785). These mature cells will then migrateto secondary lymphoid tissues (spleen, tonsils and lymphnodes) and form part of a re-circulating lymphocyte pool.There, in the T-cell zones, they are activated contact with antigen-presenting cells (APC). Theyenter the lymphoid follicle to proliferate and establish agerminal centre. Within the light zone of the germinalcentre, B-cells undergo a selection process based on theaffinity of the antibodies synthesised and controlled byfollicular dendritic cells. These cells are capable ofretaining antigen-antibody complexes for prolongedperiods of time. This affinity maturation process resultsin isotype switching, the production of highly efficientantibody-secreting plasma cells and the development ofmemory B-cells. B-cells can be found in the of the nasal mucosa (786). B-cells compriseabout 20% of the total lymphocyte population (774).Recent studies have shown that in seasonal allergicrhinitics, B-cells can undergo class switch to IgE locallyin the nasal mucosa (787). Nasal CD23 +B-cells decrease patients during provocation, indicating thatmature virgin CD23 +B-cells switch into a memory B-cell phenotype CD23 expression (788). 4-2-1-6- Macrophages and dendritic cellsAllergic reactions occur in a mucosal environment that is rich in both dendritic cells and macrophages. Howev-er, there are significant differences between the lowerand upper airways: alveolar macrophages form morethan 90 % of the cell population in bronchial alveolarlavage (789), but airway macrophages on the nasalepithelial surface account for just 1 to 2 % of the cells(790). The number of nasal macrophages increases mucosa such as orbrushing (790, 791). However, in seasonal and perennialallergic rhinitis, a significant increase in macrophageshas also been found in the nose (790). Langerhans cells represent an important group of den- dritic cells in the nose, characterised by the expression ofCD1 and Birbeck granules (792). These cells increaseafter allergen challenge (791) or in patients with allergicrhinitis (658, 793). Antigen presentation is a critical first step in the T-cell activation process. In the primary immune response, den-dritic cells in the respiratory tract form a tightly meshednetwork at the epithelial surface and are the principalantigen presenting cells (APC). In the secondaryresponse, any cell expressing surface Major Histocom-patibility Complex (MHC) class II may serve in thisfunction. 4-2-1-6-1- MacrophagesThe mononuclear phagocyte system consists of a migratory, specialised family of cells derived fromhaemotopoietic precursors that circulate in blood asmonocytes and are widely distributed as macrophages intissues and body fluids. Mononuclear phagocytes havealways been the scavenger cells of the body (794).Although this traditional role remains critical, these cellshave a much wider function in biology and pathology. Byvirtue of their specialised plasma membrane receptorsand versatile biosynthetic and secretory responses,macrophages play a major role in inflammation (795,796) and repair (797). Macrophages are capable ofsecreting IL-1,TNF- , TGF-\u00df, PDGF and interferons, depending on their state of maturation and elicit immune modulatoryfunctions. It has long been known that macrophage func-tion is controlled by activated T-cells (798).Macrophages also have a role in specific immunity bytheir accessory cell function. However, compared to den-dritic cells, macrophages do not function efficiently asAPC for T-cells (799). 4-2-1-6-2- Dendritic cellsDendritic cells are a highly potent APC-population. They specialise in the presentation of antigen to naive T-cells and deliver antigen specific activating signals to T-memory cells (800-802). For the interaction betweendendritic cells and T-cells, with the T-cell receptor recog-nising an antigen associated with an MHC-molecule, co-stimulatory such as CD28 and are necessary (801). Resting Langerhans cellsare well equipped for antigen binding and processing, butrequire maturation in order to efficiently stimulate rest-ing T-cells. There is recent evidence that antigen presen-tation by airway dendritic cells leads to the preferentialdevelopment of a Th2 response, possibly by the selectiveproduction of cytokines (803). Dendritic cells form a network of APC in the human respiratory mucosa. The density of dendritic cells is at itshighest in the epithelial surface of the upper airways anddecreases in the peripheral bronchi (799, 804). The airways are continuously bombarded by pathogens, allergens and other irritants. Airway mucosaldendritic cells play an important role in the primary sen-sitisation or tolerance to antigens (805). Airway dendritic cells are also essential for presenting inhaled allergen to previously primed Th2-cells (805,806). Further studies have to clarify, however, whether thematuration of Langerhans cells takes place within thenasal mucosa or is dependent on the migration of thesecells to mucosa associated lymphoid tissue. The depletionof dendritic cells in animals leads to an almost completesuppression of eosinophilic airway inflammation (807). Glucocorticosteroids are the most effective treatment for reducing dendritic cell numbers and functions (808).Such an effect has been found in the nasal mucosa (760,S178 Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL NOVEMBER 2001 809) whereas these drugs are ineffective on the number of macrophages. 4-2-1-7- Epithelial cells The nasal epithelium forms an interface between inter- nal and external environments acting as the first line ofdefence against invading organisms or inhalant allergens.For many years, epithelial cells were considered as barri-ers while being involved in the secretion of mucus orremoval of foreign agents by their cilia. However, recentstudies have shown that epithelial cells have a muchwider range of activities including the release ofeicosanoids, endopeptidases, cytokines and chemokines(810-812). They are also involved in the degradation ofneuropeptides and fibronectin release (812, 813). Epithe-lial cells in allergic individuals (asthmatics and rhinitics)are in an activated state, as shown by: the increased expression of adhesion molecules like ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 (814-819), the increased expression production tory mediators like IL-6, IL-8, GM-CSF and TNF- thus contributing to the enhancement of allergicinflammation (820-824). Furthermore, epithelial cells in atopic asthmatics and allergic rhinitics release significantly greater levels ofeosinophil chemoattractants like RANTES (825) andeotaxin (826, 827), as well as growth factors (828,829) and metalloproteases (830). Epithelial cells are also an important source of growth and of survival factors like SCF for mast cells (831)and GM-CSF for eosinophils. It has also been shown that epithelial cells in allergic individuals are more sensitive to air pollutants like dieselexhaust particles. This has been attributed to the greaterconstitutive and pollutant induced release of pro-inflam-matory cytokines (622). Again, under normal conditions, it is difficult for aller- gens to penetrate the epithelial layer and come into con-tact with the effector cells (lymphocytes, macrophagesand mast cells). However, in allergic individuals, there isan increased permeability of the epithelial layer. It has been shown that epithelial cells from asthmatics express Fc RI and Fc RII. The activation of these recep- tors in asthmatic patients leads to the release ofeicosanoids or pro-inflammatory mediators (832, 833).More recently, it has been shown that epithelial cells candirectly interact with allergens resulting in the increasedproduction of IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1 (834).This to protease dependentas well as protease independent. Moreover, epithelial cellscan be inflammatory histamine (835-837), induce an increased production ofcytokines and chemokines in epithelial cells. Mucoussecretion is regulated by cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-13(839, 840). Finally, a proportion of epithelial cells fromallergic rhinitics express HLA-DR and CD86 and mayalso play a role in antigen presentation (824). Thus, theepithelial cell can participate in the genesis and develop-ment of allergic inflammation. 4-2-1-8- Endothelial cells The infiltration of effector cells is crucial to the devel- opment of allergic diseases like asthma and allergic rhini-tis. Structural cells like endothelial cells appear to play adual role in the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma andallergic rhinitis (816, 841). These cells participate in therecruitment of leukocytes to the site of the allergicresponse by releasing neutrophil chemotactic factors andmodulating on nasal endothelial cells obtained in the nasalbiopsies of patients with perennial allergic rhinitis ascompared to non-atopic healthy volunteers (843).Endothelial cell VCAM-1 is over-expressed during thepollen season (844). Moreover, the expression of VCAM-1 in nasal tissues was related to the number of infiltratingeosinophils (845, 846) and T-cells (844). There is alsoincreasing evidence that cytokines such eotaxin (850) and RANTES play a key role inenhancing the expression of these adhesion molecules. Cells from allergic patients increase endothelial cell activation through the release of cytokines and chemo-kines (851). Endothelial cells in allergic rhinitics andasthmatics are also an important source of severalcytokines and chemokines like RANTES and eotaxin(852). Moreover, like epithelial cells, endothelial cellsalso express the H1 receptor, and stimulation with hista-mine induces the activation of these cells (853, 854). 4-2-1-9- Fibroblasts Structural cells like fibroblasts play an important role in allergic inflammation through the production of anarray of cytokines and chemokines or eotaxin (859). Theyappear therefore to be essential for the recruitment ofeffector cells and for the growth and survival of mastcells and eosinophils (860, 861). Interaction with fibro-blasts results in the modulation of the proteoglycan con-tent in mast cells and in the preferential development ofMCTC type mast cells. However, in rhinitis, the role offibro-blasts is much less studied than in asthma where itseems to be a critical cell in airway inflammation (862). 4-2-2- Pro-inflammatory mediators 4-2-2-1- HistamineHistamine, a ubiquitous cell-to-cell messenger, was identified in 1910 by Dale and Laidlaw (863) and wasrecognised in the 1920s as a major mediator of allergicdisorders such as rhinitis, asthma, urticaria and anaphylax-is. Histamine consists of a single heterocyclic ring (imida-zole) connected directly to the ethylamine group, theunsubstituted amino-terminal. The real mechanism of theaction of histamine remained unknown until 1966 whenthe H1-histamine receptor was identified (864). Knowl-edge of the histaminergic system evolved with the laterdiscovery of the H2-receptor (865), responsible for gastricacid secretion, and the H3-receptor (866), apparently rep-resented mostly in the central nervous system of humans. In the 1950s, Riley et al. described the presence of his-J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 108, NUMBER 5Bousquet Workshop Group S179 tamine as a preformed mediator in the mast cell (691). Histamine is released upon activation by allergen afterthe IgE mediated activation of mast cells and basophilsthrough Fc RI. However, histamine can also be released by non-specific triggers such as codeine. Histamine isquantitatively the major mediator released after immuno-logical challenge by mast cells and basophils. Histamine can mimic many symptoms of the nasal allergic reaction (rhinorrhea, sneezing, pruritus and nasalobstruction (867-869)). However, the effects of hista-mine on nasal obstruction are not marked and require rel-atively high concentrations. The response is of shortduration (870). Action on sensory nerves induces itchingand sneezing (871), whereas the action of histamine onblood vessels, possibly by direct action on plasma exudationand edema formation. Histamine bya direct action that increases plasma protein extravasa-tion and by an indirect reflex mechanism that stimulatesglandular secretion (875-877). Histamine increases glan-dular secretion in the ipsilateral side by direct effect onmucous cells and vessels and in the ipsilateral and contralateral sides through neural reflexes. (878). Histamine is probably the major mediator of the early- phase reaction following an allergen nasal challenge(642) but it is also important in the response(723). Basophils and mast cells release histamine duringthe early-phase reaction (642) whereas basophils areconsidered to be the main source of histamine in the late-phase reaction (723). Increments of histamine have alsobeen observed in seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitisin some (879) but not all studies (759, 880), possiblybecause of its rapid metabolism (870, 881, 882). More-over, a few molecules of a given mediator released in situ may cause allergic symptoms without any release in thenasal secretions (883). Histamine also possesses pro-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties (884, 885). It has beenshown to cause a profound increase in the numbers ofrolling leukocytes within minutes of exposure to allergen(886, 887). The duration of adhesion of these cells to theendothelium was increased with histamine and was medi-ated by P-selectin. Histamine also increases the of and LFA-1 onvascular cells cytokines like IL-6 or adhe-sion cells. Recentstudies have shown that histamine induces increasedICAM-1 expression in nasal the production of key cytokines andchemokines from bronchial epithelial cells (835-837). In conclusion, histamine plays a key role in allergic reactions of the nose, not only through its effects on sen-sory nerves, glands or vessels, but also through its pro-inflammatory effects. 4-2-2-2- Arachidonic acid metabolitesWritten in collaboration with C. ChavisThe arachidonic acid metabolic pathway leads to the formation of compounds named eicosanoids and includesprostanoids, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs),leukotrienes (LTs) and lipoxins have potent effects in rhinitis(890-892). Upon physiological stimulation, arachidonic acid is released from submit-ted to oxidation (893) by: eicosanoids, radicals catalysed by lipid peroxidation which lead to iso-eicosanoids (894) (Figures 7 and 8). Eicosanoids are extremely potent. They are able to cause profound physiological effects at very dilute con-centrations and act locally at the site of synthesis throughreceptor mediated G-protein (by paracrine (or evenautocrine) effects). Two major and one minor pathwaysare involved in the enzymatic synthesis of eicosanoids: prostaglandins (PGs) and thromboxanes pathway by cyclooxygenases(COX), HETEs, LTs and LXs from the linear pathway by lipoxygenases (LO). Other epoxygenases belonging to the cytochrome P450 family. These lead to some HETEs and epoxy-eicosatetraenoic acids, the exact function of whichremains to be demonstrated in airway diseases (895). FIGURE 7: of origin of leukotrienes. RBC, Erythrocytes.S180 Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop NOVEMBER 2001 pathways: Biosynthesis and biological to the family of eicosanoids gener- ated by the COX pathways. COXs are of the PGG 2, the of prostanoids. PGH 898): the constitutive COX1 which regulates physiological activities and is inhibited by aspirin but not by dexa-methasone (899), the inducible COX2 which is probably more related to inflammatory states (900-902). However, in the nasalmucosa of normal subjects, there exists a small COX2expression (903). COX2 is rapidly induced by LPS,cytokines or growth factors and is inhibitable by dex-amethasone (904). Prostaglandins are divided into several groups. PGD 2 is the predominant prostanoid released following mast cell degranulation. Nasal challenge with PGD 2induces a sustained nasal obstruction (905, 906). It appears thatPGD 2is ten times potent than suggestedthat PGE 2may have different effects in the bronchi and in the nasal cavities. Whilst there is little doubt thatPGE 2 generally acts as a vasodilator, there have been reports that this mediator has vaso-constrictor effects inthe nasal mucosa and for this reason it been tested asa nasal decongestant (908). been measured in the nasal secretions of normal subjects and patients with seasonal allergic rhini-tis (909-911). Concentrations of PGD 2were found to increase after allergen challenge (early but not late-phasereaction) and during seasonal allergic rhinitis (912). Onthe other hand, no significant differences were observedin concentrations of either PGF 2or 6-keto-PGF 1 between control and allergic subjects (911). The blockage of prostaglandin release by NSAID does not improve ocu-lar symptoms of allergic patients, suggesting that in thesepatients, prostaglandins alone may not play a major rolein the mediation of symptoms (913). In a nasal challengestudy, Flurbiprofen was nearly as effective as chlorpheni-ramine in reducing the severity of induced rhinitis sug-gesting the role of prostaglandins (914). The combinedblockage of histamine and COX products appears toimprove symptom control in ragweed hay fever (915). In aspirin-intolerant patients with rhinitis, studies of eicosanoid biosynthesis in the nose have stirred consid-erable interest (31). Recent data indicate that COX-2mRNA expression is down regulated in the nasal polypsof patients with aspirin-intolerant rhinitis/asthma (916).In keeping with these findings, it has been reported thatcultured epithelial cells obtained from patients withaspirin-intolerant asthma produce less PGE 2than those cultured from rhinitis patients who tolerate aspirin (917).Whether these abnormalities are linked to distinctchanges in bronchial COX function in aspirin-inducedasthma (918) or to enhanced LTC 4synthase over-expres- deserves further Biosynthesis and biological properties of to the family of eicosanoids gener- ated by the LO pathways. Lipoxygenases are dioxygenases,which incorporate one molecule of oxygen at a certain posi-tion of unsaturated fatty acids such as arachidonic. Arachi-donate 5-LO is responsible for leukotriene synthesis (921).This mechanism differs from radical lipid peroxidation inthat singlet oxygen attacks both sides of the molecular planand leads to a racemic mixture (922). Among essentialpolyunsaturated fatty three activated methylene groups(on the carbons in positions 7, 10 and 13). It is thus a privi-leged target for LO after it is released from membrane phos-pholipids by phospholipase A2 (PLA2). Three mammalianlipoxygenases have been purified, cloned and expressed.They are differentiated by a number which corresponds tothat of the carbon atom where oxygen attacks preferential-ly: 5, 12 and 15. Lipoxygenases are cytosolic, calcium-dependent and translocable to nuclear membranes after acti-vation. Four types of AA metabolites are biosynthesised.The of catalysed by theaction of one LO, leads to the formation of hydroperoxy-eicosatetraenoic acids (HPETEs). These highly reactiveand short-lived intermediates HETEsby peroxidases, peroxides.The three most important HETEs are 5,12 and 15-HETE generated by 5, 12 and 15-LO respectively. Di-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (di-HETEs): two successive oxygenation steps by 2 different LO lead tothe generation of di-HETEs. The most common deriv-atives are 5(S),15(S)-diHETE (unknown physiologicalrole) and 14(R),15(S)-diHETE reported to show thesame activity LTB 4and LTC 4are generated following 2 successive steps from the same bi-func-tional LO (923). LTD 4and LTE 4are the metabo- lites generated by 4and LXB 4are generated by the interaction of 2 different LO. At least one ofthese is bi-functional. In the eicosanoid nomenclature, number 4 indicates that the eicosanoids come from AA metabolism and havekept the 4 double bonds of their precursor. LO enzymes are involved in inflammatory process but the most important in allergic rhinitis and asthma are 5-LO and 15-LO. 5-LO has NUMBER 5Bousquet and In activated leukocytes, FLAP have been localised in nuclear envelop andendoplasmic reticulum, but neither in other cell compart-ments nor in plasma membrane. The LT and LX biosyntheses are described in Figure 7. Firstly, 5-LO catalyses arachidonic acid oxidation on thecarbon atom in and leads to 5-HPETE. Second-ly, 5-LO transforms 5-HPETE into the intermediate epox-ide LTA opening by LTA 4hydrolase leads to glutathione to LTC 4 metabolised by the elimination of glu- tamic residue to LTD 4and then to LTE 4by the elimination of glycine. The alsonamed sulfido-peptide or cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLT),are the constituents of the unknown lipid material charac-terised in early investigations of mechanisms of asthma as\"slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis\" (SRS-A). Theyplay an essential role in asthma and rhinitis. Generally, LTsare synthesised inside a determined cell type and releasedin the extracellular medium. However, in the peripheral cir-culation, LTC 4may be synthesised by cellular LTA 4released by neu- trophils from the 5-LO pathway taken by platelets whichlack 5-LO but have LTC 4synthase enzymes. Several physiological properties of the eicosanoids from 5-LO pathway have been observed: CysLTs induce vascular permeability and in the nose and bronchi and bronchial obstruction bycontraction of the airway smooth muscle, vasodilata-tion and mucous production (927, 928). CysLTs are involved in eosinophil recruitment in the airways (929). CysLTs are probably important mediators in allergic rhinitis (930). L T B 4induces the recruitment of neutrophils. In contrast, anti-inflammatory properties are conceded to LXA 4, and LX presence in asthma has suggested their impact in cell regulation (931). CysLTs are released in nasal lavage fluid obtained during the early and late-phase reactions after allergen challenge(712, 932, 933) and in seasonal (934) and perennial rhinitis(759). LTB 4was found to be released in nasal secretions after allergen challenge but little is known about this medi-ator in seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis (932, 934). 4-2-2-2-3- Leukotriene receptorsThe actions of C 4,L T D 4and LTE 4on target cells are mediated through specific receptors. The cDNAfor LTB 4receptor was cloned from leasttwo receptors, designated CysLT(1) and CysLT(2). TheCysLT receptor was recently cloned (936, 937). Bothzafirlukast and montelukast have affinities that areapproximately two times greater than that of the naturalligand LTD 4. The CysLT(1) receptor has been found in human airways. The CysLT(2) receptor, however, has notyet been found in human airway smooth muscle. 4-2-2-2-4- Aspirin-induced asthma and rhinitisAttacks of sneezing, rhinorrhea and nasal blockage that appear within 20-120 minutes after aspirin ingestion,and are often followed by bronchoconstriction, are relat-ed to the inhibition of COX in the airways (938). Origi-nal observations (635, 939) that drug intolerance can bepredicted on the basis of its in vitro inhibition COX have since been consistently reaffirmed (940, 941). Afteraspirin desensitisation, cross-desensitisation to otherNSAIDs which inhibit COX also occurs. At the baseline, CysLT urinary excretion is augment- ed and aspirin administration leads to its further tempo-rary increase. After aspirin challenge, CysLTs arereleased into nasal and bronchial secretions and can urine (918). LTC 4synthase, the terminal enzyme for CysLT production, is markedly overexpressed in eosinophils and mast cells from bronchialbiopsy specimens of most patients with aspirin-inducedasthma (919). An allelic variant of LTC 4synthase that enhances enzyme transcription is associated with aspirin-induced asthma (920). Aspirin-induced asthma should be clearly differen- tiated from other forms of aspirin-associated reac-tions. Up to 10% of patients with chronic urticariadevelop an obvious increase in wheals and swellingafter taking aspirin or NSAID. Usually, urticaria is notassociated with rhinitis and accompanied by nasal blockage, usually occurwhen urticaria is active. Although the reason for thesereactions is not known, it appears that different mech-anisms may be responsible in different patients.Another distinct clinical entity which needs to be dif-ferentiated from aspirin-induced asthma is allergy topyrazolone drugs (942). 4-2-2-3- KininsIt has been proposed that kinins are involved in the mechanism of virus induced (943) allergic and perennialrhinitis (944). The effects of kinins in the human nasalmucosa (sneezing, pain and discomfort, as well asreduced patency, protein secretion and nasal discharge)are characteristic of rhinitis due to different causes.Increased concentrations of kinins have been reported innasal secretions after allergen challenge (945, 946).Some studies with bradykinin antagonist B2 have alsobeen performed on patients with allergic rhinitis. The application of tachykinins to the nasal mucosa results in: an increase in plasma exudation, nasal discharge, blockage in a manner independent from histamine (947, 948). Substance P is generated in vivo following nasal chal- lenge of allergic individuals with bradykinin (949). Application of capsaicin to the nasal mucosa causes painful sneezing and nasal application of capsaicin to the mucosaameliorates the symptoms of perennial rhinitis (954). Therefore, kinins are considered to play a role in rhinitis. S182 Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop IMMUNOL NOVEMBER 2001 4-2-3- Cytokines \"Cytokine is one term for a group of protein cell reg- ulators, variously called lymphokines, monokines, inter-leukins and interferons, which are produced by a widevariety of cells in the body, play an important role inmany physiological responses, are involved in the patho-physiology of a range of diseases and have therapeuticpotential\" (955). Most cytokines usually have a short action radius and act through an autocrine or paracrine mode of action.However, some cytokines also display a hormone typeeffect acting at a distant site (e.g. TNF, IL-1 and IL-6 inseptic shock). Cytokines control growth, differentiation, death and function of cells in lymphocytic, hemopoietic systems.Together with nerve cells, they provide a pertinent modelfor studying intercellular communications and intercellu-lar signal networks (956). The action or production of cytokines is mediated through a number of signal transduction pathways, whichhave recently been elucidated. These include (i) path-ways integrating the activation of extracellular receptorsand subsequent intracellular events leading to alterationsof gene expression, (ii) cytoskeletal organisation, (iii)DNA synthesis and cell survival and (iv) the direct acti-vation of intracellular transcription factors via cell per-meable hormones (957, 958). Cytokine functions are (959, 960): pleiotropic (a cytokine has more than one function), redundant (structurally dissimilar cytokines have an overlapping spectrum of actions), synergistic (the effect of two cytokines on a target cell is not just additive) or antagonistic. Furthermore, a cytokine may start the synthesis of a cascade of other cytokines It may also induce the synthe-sis and release of its own antagonists and, in addition,downregulate its biological activity at the level ofcytokine receptor expression. As a consequence, a verycomplex network of effects and relations can be observed. For didactic reasons, cytokines are divided into pro- inflammatory and Th2-related factors in this document. 4-2-3-1- Pro-inflammatory cytokinesPro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)- and IL-18 are mul-tifunctional unspecific enhancers of inflammation. Theyhost defence and display multiple biological effects.Among them, they are involved in: endothelial cell adherence and the accumulation of inflammatory cells. Pro-inflammatory cytokines havebeen shown to induce the expression of E-selectin the activation of T- and B-lymphocytes in the enhance- ment of basophil histamine release, the induction of arachidonic acid metabolism, the release of antagonists to pro-inflammatory cytokines (for review, see 961). Recently, a new pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-18, hasbeen identified. It is related to the IL-1 family in terms ofstructure, synthesis, receptor family and signal transduc-tion pathways (962, 963). Similar to IL-1, IL-18 activatesT- induces the expression of the release of pro-inflammatorycytokines and chemokines. Interestingly, IL-18 mightpreferably be involved in chronic inflammatory processes. The release of pro-inflammatory cytokines into the tissue leads to regulatory processes involving the synthe-sis of IL-1r and sIL-1RII, both being antagonists to IL- 1, as well as the down regulation of the expression of theactive IL-1 receptor on the cell membrane (964). Theseprocesses are naturally limiting the effects of IL-1 in situ and prevent the spreading of inflammation. Their failuremay be connected to disease persistence (961). These cytokines are involved in the early and late- phase allergic response (for review, see 965, 966). Afterallergen challenge of the nasal mucosa, increased con-centrations nasal secretions during early-phase reaction and arefurther increased in the LPR (967-969). They may there-fore be involved in the early initiation of the adhesioncascade by the induction of adhesion molecule expres-sion on endothelial Histamine increases the adhe-sion of leukocytes to the endothelium (970) and may thuspotentiate the effect of cytokines (868). Furthermore, under natural exposure conditions such as seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis, increased con-centrations of IL-1 were found in nasal secretions ofallergic subjects compared to controls (971-973). Inter-estingly, this release persists for several weeks after thepollen season (973) suggesting that a persistent inflam-matory process continues after allergen exposure, andsupports the recently proposed of \"minimal per-sistent inflammation\" (9, 817). In nasal secretions of normal subjects, a strong molar excess of IL-1 antagonists has been measured (973). Innormal subjects, there is approximately a 3,000-foldexcess of IL-1r and a 17-fold excess of the soluble IL- 1 RII over IL-1\u00df in nasal secretions. In 14,000-fold and IL-1r excess about 1,500-fold higher. This points to the importance ofthe receptor antagonist to limit inflammation in tissue bybinding to the receptor without biological activity,whereas in serum, sIL-1RII seems to be of greater impor-tance. However, IL-1r requires a 100-fold excess to pre- vent binding of IL-1\u00df to the receptor. As sIL-1RII bindsto IL-1\u00df at a ratio of 1:1, this molecule may also havestrong antagonistic properties in vivo . During the pollen season, IL-1\u00df and also IL-1r and sIL-1RII are upregulated during pollen exposure andthere was a significant correlation between these factors(Bachert, unpublished data). This again indicates thatpro-inflammatory effects of IL-1\u00df are a tightly regulatedevent protecting the host from harmful effects. However,the ratio of the agonist to its antagonists showed a rela-tive deficit of the antagonistic systems under naturalallergen exposure. This indicates that the balanceJ ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 108, NUMBER 5Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group S183 between agonist and antagonists may play a crucial role for the net biological effect of this cytokine. Solublereceptors with antagonistic properties (TNF- binding proteins) also exist for TNF- . Their upregulation has recently been demonstrated in nasal secretions during thepollen season (974). A significant increase of IL-18 concentration in nasal secretions occurred later in the season compared to IL-1\u00df(Bachert, unpublished data). This suggests that IL-18might be involved in sustaining a persistent inflammato-ry process. As discussed for IL-1, possible antagonistshave been suggested for IL-18, but nothing is known sofar about the occurrence and activity of these factors inallergic rhinitis. Little is known about the cell source of pro-inflamma- tory cytokines in allergic rhinitis. It is likely that thesecytokines are initially released by IgE-dependent mecha-nisms but that they are re-released by inflammatory cellsthrough the cytokine cascade. TNF- has been co- localised to mast cells the nasal mucosa of perennialallergic rhinitis patients (705, 714). However, mast not produce sufficient amounts of IL-1\u00df to explain thelevels of this cytokine in nasal secretions. A possiblesource for this cytokine, however, could be the macro-phage, able to release IL-1\u00df (975), and its naturally occur-ring receptor antagonist cytokines are classified as Th2-cytokines since, in initial studies, they were mainly released by Th2-typelymphocytes (203, 763, 977, 978). These include IL-3,IL-4 and IL-5. GM-CSF is released by Th1 and Th2cells. IL-13 has an effect close to IL-4 but does not act onT-cells. On the other hand, IFN- and IL-12 are Th1- related cytokines. Although the dichotomy between Th1and Th2 cells is less evident in humans (764) than inmice (761), this concept is important in the understand-ing of allergic diseases. IL-4 and IL-13 are important in the regulation of IgE (chapter 4-3-1). On the other hand, IL-3, GM-CSF andIL-5 play a significant role in increasing the productionof eosinophilic progenitors, in activating eosinophilsand in supporting the recruitment, maturation and sur-vival of these granulocytes. However, these cytokineshave many other properties. IL-13 and IL-4 bemucous secretagogues. In allergic rhinitis, mRNA for Th2-type shown to be allergen The release of IL-5 into nasal secretions could bedemonstrated hours after allergen challenge (968, 979). During the pollen season, patients allergic to pollens show an increased number of cells expressing Th2cytokines (968, 972, 980-982). Allergen-induced synthe-sis of interleukin-5, but not of IgE, appears to be linkedto symptomatic episodes of seasonal allergic rhinitis insensitised individuals (983). Topical glucocorticosteroidtreatment results in the inhibition of IL-5 mRNA expres-sion and eosinophil infiltration (981, 984). In patientswith perennial allergic rhinitis, there is also an increasein some Th2 cytokines (776, 985). In contrast, there wasno difference in the number of subjects expressing IFN-mRNA (986). Apart from IL-4 and IL-5, the IL-4 and IL-5 receptors have been shown to be upregulated due to allergen chal-lenge in allergic rhinitis subjects, whereas the receptor forIFN- was down regulated. Receptor expression correlat- ed with eosinophil infiltration in the tissues. Pre-treatmentwith intranasal glucocorticosteroids before nasal allergenchallenge resulted in a decreased expression of IL-4 andIL-5 receptors and an increased expression of IFN- receptors. Thus, cytokine receptor expression follows asimilar pattern to the corresponding cytokines (987). However, the source of Th2 cytokines within the nasal mucosa is not clear, as in situ hybridisation and immuno- histochemistry show that they can be released by T-cells,mast cells, basophils, eosinophils and epithelial cells(707, 775, 988, 989). IL-12 is a structurally distinct Th1-associated cytokine produced by B-cells and macrophages, which may play asuppressive role in the development of allergic sino-nasalmucosal responses (990). 4-2-3-3- Other cytokines and growth factorsApart from and Th2-related kines, a variety of other cytokines and related factorsmay well be involved in the regulation of allergic inflam-mation. In culture, nasal epithelial cells produce stemcell factors (SCF), a cytokine supporting mast cellgrowth and differentiation. SCF was present in nasallavage fluids in seasonal allergic rhinitis patients and cor-related to the mast cell chemotactic activity, which wasnot suppressed by intranasal glucocorticosteroid or H1-antihistamine treatment (991). Also, in a second study,SCF production was correlated to the number of mastcells and the histamine content within allergic nasalmucosa. Therefore, SCF may be important for the attrac-tion and activation of mast cells in allergic inflammationin the nose (831). Recently, increased levels of NGF (nerve growth fac- tors) have been shown in allergic subjects compared tocontrols. This correlates to an increased sensitivity of thesneezing reflex, increased secretion and plasma extrava-sation due to sensory nerve stimulation (992). NGF lev-els are increased in the serum of allergic patients (993).Thus, this neurotrophin may be implicated in neuralhyperresponsiveness and in rhinitis. 4-2-4- Chemokines Over the past ten years, more than 30 chemokines have been identified as attractants of different types ofblood leukocytes to sites of infection and inflammation(994). They are produced locally in the tissues and act onleukocytes through selective receptors (995-997). Che-mokines are now known to function also as regulatorymolecules in leukocyte maturation, in traffic and homingof lymphocytes and in the development of lymphoid tis-sues. Not only a specific expression of adhesion mole-cules, but also the presence of chemokines may beresponsible for preferential migration processes of sub-S184 Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL NOVEMBER 2001 sets of cells. Chemokines form several families, which can be differentiated according to their structure and totheir target cells. Whereas CXC chemokines such as IL-8 act especially on neutrophils (998, 999), CCchemokines such as RANTES or eotaxin mediateeosinophilic migration (1000). Nasal epithelial cells from atopic individuals release significantly greater amounts of RANTES and other fac-tors than those from non-atopic individuals. In the atopicindividuals, those exposed to pollen again released greateramounts than those not exposed to allergen (1001). Whenallergic patients are challenged with allergen, there is anincreased release of RANTES (748). was with allergic rhinitis (1003, 1004). It ismainly released by epithelial cells. Eotaxin probably akey eosinophilic chemokine (1005). However, it also rep-resents a major regulator of allergic reactions acting onTh2 cell chemotaxis, migration and differentiation ofmast cells and on bone marrow progenitors (1006).Although eotaxin is not the only chemokine acting oneosinophil progenitors, it is central to the release ofeosinophils from bone marrow to peripheral blood(1007). Glucocorticosteroids inhibit nasal allergen challenge in sensitised patients during early and late-phase reaction. This releaseis accompanied by an increased number of neutrophils innasal lavages. However, the effect of neutralising IL-8antibodies in vitro to the chemotactic activity of lavage fluid was only marginal, suggesting that IL-8 acts in con-nection with other chemotactic factors (1009). IL-8 canregularly be found in the nasal secretion of controls andis strongly upregulated during viral infections (1010), butseems to be unchanged or even decreased during thepollen season in allergic rhinitics (973, 1011). In contrast, MCP-1, a monocyte and basophil activating factor, increases during the pollen season. MCP-1 is con-stantly produced by macrophages (999) and can be detect-ed in the nasal mucosa of patients with seasonal and allergic shown to upregulate and monocytes. They may be closely related to theinflux of these inflammatory cells and thus contribute tothe pathogenesis of allergic rhinitis (1014). Furthermore, chemokines may elicit histamine-releas- ing activities, which might be of interest in the allergiclate-phase reaction. The histamine releasing activity ofchemokines for basophils is significantly increased and GM-CSF (1015, 1016). Further studies will beneeded to completely understand in tethering circulating leukocytes to the vascularendothelium at sites of inflammation. There is accumulat-ing evidence for their involvement in the pathophysiologyof airway mucosal allergic inflammation, such as thatfound in rhinitis (1017). The best characterised adhesionmolecule families selectins (1018, 1019). Neu-trophils or eosinophils have little ability to adhere to restingendothelium in vitro . Endothelial cells can be activated IL-4, IFN- , TNF- , participate of three types of blood cells. However,only eosinophils and basophils express VLA-4 and canbind to appears to be a major ligand foreosinophil adhesion to activated endothelium. In the resting nasal mucosa, selectins are not expressed until their induction is caused by pro-inflam-matory cytokines and other mediators such as histamine.Using an ex model of the nasal mucosa, E-selectin expression is inducible as early as 1 hour after exposureto allergen in sensitised individuals. This expression ispartly preferentially expressed in the sub-epithelialvasculature and have been shown to increase in seasonalallergic rhinitis specimens compared to controls (1021).E-selectin expression and VCAM-1 expression were alsoenhanced 24 hours after local allergen challenge (1022).An increase in VCAM-1 expression is found on nasalendothelial cells in perennial rhinitis patients, probablydue to a persistent activation of the mucosa (843). Theexpression of VCAM-1 on endothelial cells is likely to berelated to a selective recruitment of eosinophils. 4-2-5-2- ICAM-1Immunoglobulin supergene family members are mem- brane-bound protein molecules that are characterised by thepresence of one or more immunoglobulin domains. Theycan be found on mast cells, lymphocytes, eosinophils,epithelial and endothelial cells. ICAM-1, the major rhi-novirus receptor (1023), is constitutively expressed, but mayalso be induced 1 to 24 hours after stimulation (1024, 1025). ICAM-1 and its counter molecule LFA-1 are increased in nasal epithelial cells of patients with seasonal (817,1026) and perennial rhinitis (9). ICAM-1 and LFA-1expression is nasal inperennial (843). Topical glucocorticosteroids mines (835, 1027-1029) inhibit the upregulation ofICAM-1 on epithelial cells during early and late-phasereactions following allergen challenge. J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME the ARIA Workshop S185 4-2-5-3- Soluble adhesion molecules Most of these adhesion molecules might also be shed from the cell surface and be present in nasalsecretions and serum as markers of inflammation. Sol-uble ICAM-1 was found to increase in the serum ofallergic rhinitis patients compared to non-atopic con-trols in perennial allergic rhinitis (1030). It alsoincreased systematically and locally in patients withseasonal allergic rhinitis under natural conditions (819,1031). Moreover, nasal ICAM-1 levels remainedincreased after the pollen season (819). However, theconcentrations of soluble adhesion molecules such assoluble VCAM-1, E-selectin and ICAM-1 were not dif-ferent in another study comparing perennial allergicrhinitis subjects to controls (1032). 4-2-6- Survival of inflammatory cells The survival of inflammatory cells at the site of the allergic reaction depends on several factors. They mayundergo cell death during the evolution of airwayinflammation (1033) depending on their adhesion toextracellular matrix (1034) or other cells like epithelialcells (1035). Programmed cell death or \"apoptosis\" is involved in the removal of superfluous and damaged cells in mostorgan systems. In contrast to necrosis, which may also beseen at inflamed sites, apoptosis represents granulocytefate whereby a number of mechanisms would tend tolimit inflammatory tissue injury and promote the resolu-tion rather than the progression of inflammation. Prelim-inary characterisation of the recognition mechanismimplicates CD36 (thrombospondin receptor). Eosinophil survivalwas shown to be increased in asthma due to decreasedapoptosis which was further linked to GM-CSF (1036).In vitro eosinophils were shown to release increased amounts of various cytokines including GM-CSF (1037)and others. Supernatants from nasal epithelial cells werefound to increase the survival of inflammatory cells(1038). However, direct apoptosis has never been studiedin the nasal mucosa even though the survival ofeosinophils in nasal polyps was shown to be associatedwith reduced apoptosis (740). Moreover, serum-solubleFas levels were used as a marker to distinguish allergicand non-allergic rhinitis (1039). The expression of adhesion molecules on epithelial cells rapidly increases after exposure to cytokines(IFN- or TNF- ) or to eosinophil-derived proteins (MBP and ECP) (1035). The enhanced expression ofadhesion molecules on epithelial cells was found toincrease the persistence of inflammatory cells in vitro (1035). 4-2-7- Conclusions The inflammatory reaction in the nose results from an increased recruitment of inflammatory cells and a pro-longed survival of these cells in the nasal mucosa. This isdue to interactions with adhesion molecules 9 and 10).4-3- 4-3-1- noradrenaline, identified in central and peripher-al neurons and are presumed to be involved in the eventsrelated to allergic reaction (neurogenic inflammation)(676) (see chapter 4-1-5). However, the amount of theseneuropeptides released in nasal fluid present in biopsiesand the threshold concentrations for the positive manifes-tation of symptoms in nasal provocation are controversialand are still being discussed. Thus, neuropeptides may beof less importance than the classical neurotransmitters innasal allergic reaction. Further investigations are neces-sary to confirm their specific involvement in the mecha-nisms of allergic rhinitis as has been discussed for medi-ators in allergic rhinitis. 4-3-2- Nitric oxide Nitric oxide (NO) is an endogenous soluble gas acting as an intercellular transmitter, both in the central and periph-eral nervous system. It is synthesised from arginine by anenzyme nitric oxide synthase (NOS) of which there arethree isoforms. In addition to nerve cells, NO is also pro-duced by epithelial cells and by the endothelium. NO playsa key role as a vasodilator, neurotransmitter and inflamma-tory mediator (1040-1042). A significant increase of NO inthe nose is detected in patients with allergic rhinitis (1043, FIGURE 9: The nasal inflammatory response. FIGURE 10: Recruitment of cells in the nasal mucosa.S186 Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group IMMUNOL NOVEMBER 2001 1044) and sinusitis (1045). However, in other studies, nasal NO was not significantly different from controls outsidethe pollen season and did not increase significantly in thepollen season (1046). The production of NO is increased inpatients with perennial nasal allergy (1047, 1048), but theblood flow in the nasal mucosa of patients is reduced(1049). In the same study, nitrotyrosine formation suggeststhat there is a process of ONOO(-)-induced damage in themucosa of patients with perennial nasal allergy. This dam-age may limit the dilatation of blood vessels, despite thepresence of excessive NO. Nasal nitric oxide does basal congestionfollowing allergen challenge in allergic rhinitis (1050).Nitric oxide may be an important mediator of the effectorarm of the naso-nasal reflex that increases vascular perme-ability but it is not involved in the sensory nerve afferentpathway (1051). Further studies on the role of NO in aller-gic rhinitis are necessary for a final conclusion. 4-4- THE IgE IMMUNE RESPONSE Allergy is generally caused by a sustained overproduc- tion of Immunoglobulin E (IgE) in response to commonenvironmental antigens such as pollen, foods, house dustmite, animal danders, fungal spores and insect venoms.Elevated levels of serum IgE are thus a hallmark of atopicdiseases like allergic rhinitis. IgE itself constitutes a veryminute fraction of the total antibody in the human serum(50-300 ng/ml of IgE versus 10 mg/ml of IgG). However,the biological activities of IgE are powerfully enhanced bythe activities of specific cell surface receptors to which itbinds and which may be of high or low affinity phenotype. 4-4-1- Regulation of the IgE immune response Written in collaboration with H. Yssel (F) One of the typical aspects of airway inflammation in allergic rhinitis is the infiltration of the nasal mucosa byT helper 2 (Th2) cells (203, basophils,Langerhans cells, eosinophils and mast cells. Each ofthese cells contributes to the physiological changes thatcharacterise rhinitis. It is believed that this inflammatoryprocess is initially triggered by the presentation of aller-gens in the micro-environment of the nose, in the pres-ence of an appropriate cytokine milieu. This results in theinduction of IgE via the isotype switching of B-cells(Figure 11). 4-4-1-1- Antigen presenting cells The role of antigen presenting cells in the airways appears to be of importance for the development ofimmune response. In particular, in animal experiments, thebalance between dendritic APC and macrophages and/orthe reaction of the T-cell system to the stimuli given bythese cells plays an important role in the occurrence of Th1tolerance or Th2 hypersensitivity (1052). Antigen presen-tation by airway Langerhans cells leads to the preferentialdevelopment of a Th2 response which can be short lived (ashort boost of IgE production, followed by active suppres-sion) or persist to develop a polarised, long lived Th2response (806). Moreover, monocyte-derived dendriticcells from allergic asthmatic patients, when compared tohealthy controls, already showed phenotypic differences inthe expression of of B-cells into IgE-secreting plasma cells is a complex cascade of events in which cytokinesplay a crucial role (for review see 1054). Cytokines donot only induce Ig synthesis, but also regulate isotypeswitching. Human IL-4, and more recently IL-13, havebeen shown to induce IgE synthesis in vitro in cultures of mononuclear cells derived from peripheral blood, tonsilsand spleen (1055, 1056). In addition, IL-4 induces IgEsynthesis in B-cells obtained from cord blood, foetalspleen and liver, whereas even foetal bone marrow-derived B-cells, characterised by the absence of surfaceIgM expression, can be induced to produce IgE in vitro . This indicates that these cells are mature in their capaci-ty to produce IgE (1057). Both IL-4 and IL-13 induce the transcription of germline mRNA in purified B-cells (1058). With appropriate co-stimulatory signals (see chapter 4-4-1-3),this results in the switching and production of IgG 4and IgE of B, as well as pre-B cells (1059, 1060). However,IL-13 induces the IL-4 (1057). Furthermore, IL-4 and IL-13 donot have synergistic effects or additional effects on IgG 4 and IgE synthesis. Although both cytokines are human B-cell growth factors of equal potency, IL-4-inducedIgG4and IgE synthesis is about three folds higher, at sat- urating concentrations, compared to that induced by IL-13 (1057). Consistent with this motion, it has been foundthat IL-13 is most effective in inducing IgE synthesis insituations where little or no IL-4 is present (1061). In addition to their inducting effect on IgE synthesis, IL-4 and IL-13 share many other biological functions(reviewed in 1062): Both cytokines promote the growth and differentiation of pre-activated B-cells, they induce the expression of several and the ARIA Workshop Group S187 they inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by monocytes. However, in allergic inflam-mation, the anti-inflammatory properties of IL-4 maybe less effective (1063). Despite these functional similarities and the utilisation of shared signal transduction components of their respec-tive receptors, there are some major differences in thebiological activities of IL-4 and IL-13, which may partlyreflect their different roles in the immune response toallergens. Unlike IL-4, IL-13 is not preferentially produced by human Th2 cells, but is produced by both Th1 and Th2cells (1064). Furthermore, IL-13 is produced earlier following the activation of T-cell clones and peripheral blood T-cells, its production is sustained for much longer periods as compared to that of IL-4 (1064, 1065). IL-13 fails to activate T-cells because of the absence of a binding component of the IL-13 receptor on T-cells(1064). These findings suggest that IL-13 may not only be involved in early immune responses. It may have aunique function in inducing and sustaining B-cellgrowth and differentiation, including the induction ofIgE synthesis in the absence of T-cell expansion. IL-4, unlike IL-13, is not only a potent growth factor for T-cells. It is required for the differentiation ofimmunologically naive T-cells into IL-4- and IL-5-producing Th2 cells. IL-13, in contrast to IL-4, is not able to directly induce its own production. The enhancement of IL-13 produc-tion by Th2 cells is dependent on the presence of IL-4. IL-13, but not IL-4, is produced by immunologically naive CD45RA+T-cells isolated from cord blood, as well as peripheral blood, following activation (1065).This may induce IgE synthesis in situations where noIL-4 is present, underscoring the observation that acti-vated CD45RA+T-cells efficiently modulate IgE syn- thesis in vitro (1066). 4-4-1-3- Co-stimulatory signals IgE production by B-cells not only requires the pres- ence of IL-4 or IL-13, but also a physical interactionbetween T- and B-cells, involving number of surfaceand adhesion molecules. This T-B cell-mediated signalcan be replaced by an antibody directed against CD40(1060), as well as transfectants expressing CD40 ligand(CD40L) (1067). This indicates that the CD40/CD40Linteraction is pivotal in the induction of B-cell switchingleading to IgE synthesis. The process during which T-cells help B-cells for the production of Ig, including IgE,is thought to be the result of a reciprocal dialoguebetween these populations which starts if either the T-cellor the B-cell is activated (reviewed in 1068). CD40L ligand CD28 enhancescytokine production and CD40L expression by T-cells.This series of mutual T- and B-cell activation, via interac-tions between CD28/CD80 and CD40/CD40L respective-ly, is thought to be short-lived, as a consequence of thetransient expression of CD40L on activated T-cells. Thisresults in the loss of signal transduction through CD40and in the abrogation of induction of IgE synthesis. 4-4-1-4- Cells involved in Th2-cytokine synthesisThe production of IL-4 and IL-13 is not restricted to T- cells. Preformed IL-4 is expressed in human mast cells andreleased upon cell activation (701, 702, 988). It is found inthe cytoplasm of in-vitro activated human peripheral blood basophils (724). After IgE-dependent activation, IL-4 andIL-13 mRNA are transcribed in basophils which produceIL-4 and IL-13 in addition to various mediators (1069-1071). Although basophil numbers are low in peripheralblood, these cells are stronger producers of IL-4 than T-cells (727). Moreover, human recombinant histamine-releasing factor directly stimulates IL-4 and IL-13 secretionfrom basophils of selected atopic donors in a reactionrequiring the expression of a particular type of IgE, referredto as IgE +(1072-1074). This broadens the possible role, in chronic allergic inflammation, of this cell type. Basophilproduction of IL-4 and IL-13 early in the course of allergenstimulation may therefore shape subsequent T-cell respons-es both in vivo and in vitro . Moreover, it has been shown that freshly isolated mast cells and basophils can beinduced to express CD40L and that IgE synthesis can beinduced by the interaction of B-cells with mast cells in thepresence of exogenous IL-4. Basophil-mediated IgE syn-thesis can even take place in the absence of exogenous IL-4 or IL-13 (1075). These results suggest that mast cells andbasophils can induce the production of IgE, independentlyof T-cells. Nasal mast cells in perennial allergic rhiniticsexhibit increased expression of Fc RI, CD40L, IL-4 and IL-13, and can induce IgE synthesis in B-cells (707, 714). Conclusions In conclusion, IgE production results from complex interactions between B-cells, T-cells, mast cells andbasophils. It involves a series of surface molecules, aswell as the presence of IL-4 and IL-13cytokines. In viewof the location of the tissue distribution of these varioustypes of cells, it is likely that IgE synthesis takes placenot only in the germinal centres of the lymph node, butalso in the nasal mucosa. 4-4-2- Local IgE immune response Local production of specific IgE in the nasal mucosa has been proposed in the past (1076). During the pollenseason, there is an increase in the level of allergen-specific serum IgE (1077). After nasal antigen-specific serum IgE levels wasobserved, but not all individuals showed this response(1078). The magnitude of the allergen-specific IgEresponse to nasal challenge appeared to be greater thanthe response to seasonal exposure. Moreover, the appli-cation of a diesel exhaust particulate into the noseinduces a local production of IgE measured in nasalsecretions (609). These data suggest that IgE can be pro-S188 Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group J ALLERGY CLIN 2001 duced locally into the nasal mucosa. Nasal allergen provocation has demonstrated that allergen-inducedrhinitis is associated with an increase in local IL-4mRNA, IgE heavy chain (C ) and IgE heavy chain pro- moter (I ) RNA and that pre-treatment with intranasal glucocorticosteroids inhibits the increase in these tran-scripts (1079). IgE class switching occurs locally withinthe nasal mucosa of subjects with seasonal allergic rhini-tis but not in patients receiving intranasal glucocortico-steroid treatment (1080). In patients with perennialallergic rhinitis, IgE heavy chain (C ) expression was detected and its levels were upregulated under naturalallergen exposure (1081). Nasal epithelial B-cells areable to produce IgE and mRNA for IgE (609, 1082).Plasma cells in the nasal mucosa been of IgE-expressing B-cells (activated or memory) toIgE producing plasma cells takes place in the nose(1084). Many of the cytokines produced by T-cells andmast cells after allergen provocation such as IL-4, IL-6and IL-13 are B-cell proliferating (707, cell/basophilic induction andstimulation on B-cell IgE production indicate thatimmunoglobulin switching, previously thought to takeplace only in lymph node germinal centres, may alsooccur in peripheral organs such as the nose. However, itis not clear which impact this mast cell/B-cell interac-tion has on the amount of IgE production. Local IgEsynthesis may explain why some \"atopic\" patientsdevelop rhinitis whereas others have either no clinicalmanifestations or develop atopic disease elsewhere(787). 4-4-3- Systemic IgE immune response Allergic diseases can affect the nose, lung, eye, skin and gastrointestinal tract, concurrently or subsequently, duringthe course of a patient's life span. Atopic dermatitis andfood allergy often precede respiratory by inhalant allergens. Moreover, allergenchallenge of a sensitised target organ is associated withallergic changes at the level of other target organs. It hasbeen observed that patients with asthma also presentsymptom-free inflammation of the salivary glands andbowel (1085, 1086). Patients without clinicalmanifestations (1087). After allergen challenge, GM-CSFmay play a role in vivo to increase the production of eosinophilic progenitors in allergic airway disease (730). Bone marrow actively participates in the production of IgE-receptor positive inflammatory cells such aseosinophils, basophils and mast cells, which are activelyrecruited to tissues in atopic individuals. Increases inbone marrow inflammatory cell progenitors are associat-ed with allergen-induced airway hyperresponsivenessand inflammation in asthmatics (729) and animals(1088). There appears to be a critical involvement ofbone marrow in the development of eosinophilic airwayinflammation (1089, 1090) suggesting that asthma andrhinitis represent a systemic disease (729).Inhaled glucocorticosteroids were shown to reduce the baseline but not the allergen-induced increase in bonemarrow inflammatory cell progenitors of asthmatic sub-jects (1091). 4-4-4- IgE receptors Ishizaka and Tomioka (1092) were the first to describe the high affinity IgE receptor on mast cells (Fc RI). They found that these cells were able to degranulate after aller-gen stimulation. Degranulation induces the release of his-tamine whereas activation of the cells causes leukotrieneand cytokine release. 4-4-4-1- The high affinity receptor for IgE (Fc RI) The structure of Fc RI has been extensively studied (1093-1095). IgE binds to mast cells and basophils by itsFc fragment to Fc RI, which is a tetrameric receptor. The ligand-binding and signal transduction functions of thisreceptor are carried out by distinct sub-units. The extracel-lular portion of Fc RI contains the entire IgE-binding site. The distribution of Fc RI was initially restricted to mast cells and basophils, but it has been shown to be present on: Langerhans cells (1096, bronchial epithelial cells from asthmatics (832) . However, the expression is about 10 to 100 folds lower on these cells than in mast cells. Moreover, these cellsusually express a trimer and not the tetramer as seen inmast cells. It is believed that this structure serves the anti-gen presenting cell function by specifically targeting theantigen-IgE-Fc RI complexes to the intracellular antigen presenting compartment. This APC function is even moreeffective in dendritic cells. The APC function has alsobeen described in mast cells (1101). Interestingly, in atopic patients, there is an increased expression of Fc RI on basophils, subjects(1100, may be due to elevated IgE lev-els (1104, 1105) which Fc RI on mast cells (1109). In patients with allergic rhinitis, enhanced expression of Fc RI has been observed on: mast cells, eosinophils, macrophages and dendritic cells (707, 1110). The increased expression of Fc RI on the mast cells of patients with allergic rhinitis has been associated with agreater binding to IgE molecules and an increased releaseof histamine and cytokines (714). Only few nasaleosinophils were shown to bear Fc RI in allergic rhinitis patients (1111). The activation of mast cells and basophilsoccurs within seconds after allergen challenge and resultsfrom the binding of IgE molecules bound on Fc RI with allergen. Histamine is released immediately minutesJ ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL 108, 5Bousquet S189 and cytokines later (2-4 hr) (1112). Mast cells isolated from nasal tissues of patients with allergic rhinitis releasehistamine, cytokines and Cys-LT. The activation of othercell types through the Fc RI is able to induce the release of eicosanoids (832) and cytokines (1099). 4-4-4-2- The low affinity receptor for IgE (Fc RII, CD23) The low affinity IgE receptor Fc RII was charac- terised as a B-cell receptor for IgE. It is known to play animportant role in the humoral responses acting in anti-gen-presentation to T-cells and in the adhesion of B-cellsto each other. It is found on various cells such as: B-cells, macrophages (1113), epithelial cells of bone marrow and thymus (1116), bronchial epithelial cells from asthmatics (833). There are two forms of Fc RII, differing only by their N terminal amino acids. Fc RIIis a developmentally reg- ulated gene expressed only in antigen-activated B-cellsbefore their differentiation into immunoglobulin-secretingplasma cells. It is present as an antigen IgE-Fc RIIcom- plex and presents antigen very effectively to T-cells.FcRIIis inducible on all cell types, in particular by IL-4. FcRII is strongly expressed in tonsils and lymph nodes and it appears to play an important role in the mat-uration of B-cells. 4-5- FROM NASAL CHALLENGE TO CHRONIC RHINITIS The mechanisms of allergic rhinitis have been clarified by using nasal challenge with allergen or pro-inflamma-tory mediators and by measuring cells and mediatorsreleased during the early and late-phase allergic reaction.However, the priming effect of the nasal mucosa is ofimportance as a single challenge does not perfectly mimicthe ongoing allergic reactions induced by repeated aller-gen exposure. In intermittent and persistent allergic rhini-tis, the same cells and mediators are important but non-specific nasal hyperreactivity develops Nasal challenge: early and late-phase reactions Nasal challenge studies have improved our knowledge of the mechanisms of allergic rhinitis over the past tenyears. The elegant studies by Naclerio et al. (642) using nasal allergen challenge followed by the measurement ofcells and mediators in the nasal fluid have made it easierto analyse the events occurring during allergic reaction. 4-5-1-1- The early-phase reactionPatients present symptoms within minutes of a nasal challenge with pollen grains. These are characterisedmainly by rhinorrhea, obstruction, sneezing and occa-sionally pruritus (711).4-5-1-1-1- Release of vaso-active mediatorsPathological studies have shown that mast cells are acti- vated after allergen challenge (660) and the measurementof mediators nasal secretions has shown that severalmast cell derived mediators are released. These include: histamine (642, 711, 934), PGD 2 (642, 711, 905), CysLT, (712, 932, 934, 1117-1119) tryptase (713, 1120). When individual patients are challenged, there is a great heterogeneity in the release of mediators and/or in the symp-toms induced. This suggests that the mediators liberated (orthe levels released) vary from subject to subject. Moreover,histamine release is not always correlated with the occur-rence of symptoms (642, 711, 1118, 1121) except possiblysneezing (1122). A better correlation is often found betweenthe release of lipid mediators and symptoms (642, 711,1118). CysLTs may be of interest as their release appears tobe prolonged and they induce sustained nasal obstruction. 4-5-1-1-2- Plasma exudationDuring the early-phase reaction, nasal mucosal flow decreases (646) and plasma exudation is a majorfeature observed and related to both nasal hypersecretionand congestion. The exudation process is a non-injurious,fully reversible process of an almost unfiltered bulkblood flow of different sized proteins (1123). The plasmaexudate provides a wide range of befound in nasal fluids. Kinins and related compounds mayplay a role (947, 952, 1128, 1129). 4-5-1-1-3- Activation of epithelial cellsEpithelial cells are activated rapidly after allergen chal- lenge as shown by an increased expression of adhesionmolecules (1024). However, it is not clear whether thisactivation is direct or whether it is induced by mast cell-derived mediators such as histamine (833, 836). The acti-vation of epithelial cells may be of importance in rhinitisbut further elucidation is required (1035) (Figure 14). 4-5-1-1-4- NeuropeptidesPruritus and sneezing are major symptoms caused by the histamine-induced activation of nerve endings locat-ed in epithelial tight junctions. Glandular secretion isdirectly stimulated by -adrenergic and cholinergic ago- nists Although the release of substance P byan axon reflex has yet to be demonstrated in humans, itis likely that a cholinergic reflex occurs and that this maylead to hypersecretion (1130). 4-5-1-1-5- Release of chemotactic chemotactic (1132, 1133) are released bymast cells and epithelial cells. This can lead to a morecomplex ongoing inflammatory response. A mixedinflammatory infiltrate is observed shortly after the onsetof the reaction (1134). S190 Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL NOVEMBER 2001 FIGURE 12: Symptoms induced by allergen challenge (early and late-phase reaction) and of intermittent and persistent rhinitis. J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 108, S191 4-5-1-2- Cell activation release of pro-inflam- matory mediators After a single allergen challenge, approximately 30 to 40% of patients develop a late- phase reaction (LPR) (start-ing 4 to 5 hours and peaking 6 to 12 hours after the chal-lenge) which is manifested in the form of nasal obstructionand, to a lesser extent, rhinorrhea and sneezing (723). TheLPR is characterised by the appearance of inflammatorycells at the site of the allergic reaction (1117): Neutrophils. The role of neutrophils in the late-phase reaction remains to be clarified. These cells are usual-ly found in increased numbers when lavages are car-ried out 3 to 8 hours after challenge but they are pres-ent in patients with and without a late-phase reaction. FIGURE 14: Activation of epithelial cells. FIGURE 13: Mechanisms of allergic rhinitis. S192 Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL NOVEMBER 2001 The of neutrophils is not There is a time relationshipbetween the increase in eosinophils and levels of ECPor MBP and the development of symptoms of a LPRafter allergen challenge (1140). The magnitude of thenasal blockage is related to the of cells, par-ticularly eosinophils, during the late-phase +T-cells and CD25+(interleukin 2 receptor bear- ing) cells (756). In some but not all studies, macrophages have been found in increased numbers (790). Among the mediators recovered in thought that PGD 2was not released during the late-phase reaction but recent studies have shown that,in at least some patients, there is a significant releaseof this mediator. 4-5-1-2-2- Cytokines, chemokines and the late-phase reaction The regulation of the late-phase reaction is becoming better understood. It is now clear that cytokines andchemokines, more than any pro-inflammatory mediators,are involved in the recruitment, activation and perpetua-tion of cells in the inflammatory infiltrate. Eosinophil (IL-5, are released between \"Th2-type\" +) eosinophils. This suggests that CD4+T-cell recruitment and activation and the release of Th2-typecytokines in vivo contribute to the development of late nasal responses and are associated with tissueeosinophilia. GM-CSF appears to be of importance in therecruitment (and possibly survival) of eosinophils duringthe LPR (1145). However, the picture of cytokine andchemokine release is more complex than previouslythought. The increase in IL-4, IL-10 and IL-13 mRNAlevels (981) potentchemoattractant for CD4 +cells in vitro and may play a significant role in recruiting CD4+cells in the LPR (1146). Moreover, the nasal administration of rIL-5 intothe nasal mucosa of patients allergic to Cryptomeria japonica pollen induced an accumulation and degranula- tion of eosinophils together with the development ofnasal hyperreactivity to histamine (1147). The precise cell origin of these cytokines and chemokines is yet to be determined, although initial datasuggested the principal cellular provenance (at least atmRNA level) to be T-lymphocytes (1148), the contribu-tion from mast cells appearing to be important (702, 985,1148). RANTES may be mainly released by macrophagesin the mucosa (1149). 4-5-1-2-3- Recruitment of inflammatory cells and adhesion molecules The accumulation of inflammatory cells in the nasal mucosa is characteristic of the LPR. The tissueeosinophilia may involve both the recruitment of matureeosinophils and the proliferation of their progenitors. Akey factor for the influx of cells into the inflamed nasaltissues is the passage of blood cells through the endothe-lium to the submucosa (Figure 10). Nasal challenge withallergen biopsies (1022) onepithelial ofsICAM-1 into nasal secretions (1031). 4-5-1-2-4- Survival of inflammatory cells The survival of inflammatory cells at the site of the allergic reaction depends on the fate they undergo in celldeath during the evolution of airway inflammation.Although several studies have been carried out in asthma,less is known in rhinitis. 4-5-2- The priming effect Nasal challenge with pollen grains differs from the natural course of the disease during the pollen season as,in the latter case, patients are exposed for days or weeksto allergens leading to significant inflammation of thenasal mucosa and hyperreactivity.Moreover, during a single nasal challenge with pollen,the number of grains required to induce symptoms is fargreater than that inhaled during the pollen season (642,711). In 1968, Connell (8, 1150) suggested that nasalchallenge with allergen was able to prime the mucosa.When he performed serial nasal provocations, heobserved that the number of pollen grains required toelicit a positive nasal challenge was reduced by 10- to100-fold when a second challenge was repeated the fol-lowing day. He called this effect \"priming\". Conversely,this priming effect disappeared when patients were chal-lenged at weekly intervals. The mechanism behind this important finding was poorly understood at the time but is now thought to bedue to the influx of eosinophils and metachromatic cellsattracted to the mucosa by the first challenge (1151), thisinflammation subsiding after a week or so. It is also pos-sible that inflammatory cells are primed by cytokines ormediators as has been shown in vitro for basophils (1152) and eosinophils (1153). The priming effect can be mim-icked using challenge with very low repeated doses ofallergen. In such a challenge, changes in eosinophilmediator release in nasal lavage can be seen despite no,or minimal, clinical symptoms releas-ing factors (HRFs) are released into nasal secretions butthey are present both in normal subjects and in patientswith chronic rhinitis. However, these HRFs have beenshown to potent IMMUNOL ARIA Workshop Group S193 rhinitic patients than on those of control subjects (1155) and glucocorticosteroids reduce such HRF activity(1156). Other mechanisms may also explain the primingeffect. The effects on nasal microvascular blood flow canbe detected by means of laser Doppler flowmetry. In astudy, patients reacted to the birch pollen provocationwith an increase in blood flow. This increase was greaterafter the pollen season than before when the same pollendoses were used, indicating a priming phenomenon ofthe resistance vessels (1157). The priming effect on the nasal mucosa explains the importance of the tree pollen season in patients allergicto tree and grass pollens (1158). The tree pollen seasonshortly precedes the grass pollen season. When treepollen counts are high, the nasal mucosa is primed andpatients develop symptoms, not only during the treepollen season but also with very small amounts of grasspollens, e.g. very soon after the tree pollen season hasended. On the other hand, when tree pollen counts arelow, patients sensitised to grass pollens only or polysen-sitised patients start to present symptoms only severaldays following the onset of the grass pollen season asthere is no priming of the nasal mucosa. 4-5-3- Minimal persistent inflammation The concept of \"minimal persistent inflammation\" is a new but important hypothesis that was recently proposedby Ciprandi et al. (9) and confirmed in perennial (9, 759) and seasonal allergy (1159). In patients with perennialallergic rhinitis, the allergen exposure varies within theyear and there are periods in which there is little exposure.This is the case in the Mediterranean area for house dustmites during the summer, or when allergen avoidance iseffective. However, these patients, even though they aresymptom free, still present inflammation of the nose. 4-5-4- Persistent inflammation 4-5-4-1- Seasonal allergic rhinitis4-5-4-1-1- Inflammatory cells Studies of cells infiltrating the nasal mucosa during the pollen season show that there is an increase in thenumber of various inflammatory cells and that this iscorrelated with both the severity of symptoms (641,1160-1162) and nasal non-specific hyperreactivity(869, 871). Eosinophils are almost always found in the mucosa between non-desquamated epithelial cells as well as inthe submucosa (661, 1160-1162). This tissue eosino-philia may result chemo-taxis, vascular adhesion, increased bone marrow pro-duction of eosinophils or prolonged survival ofeosinophils in tissues in relation to the release ofcytokines and growth factors (973, 980, 984). Mast cells are present in increased numbers in the epithelium and the submucosa but they are oftendegranulated (660, 661, 699, 1163-1165). Neutrophils are also often observed in seasonal aller- gic rhinitis (1166), but the significance of the presenceof these cells is still under scrutiny. CD4+T-cells increase in number during the pollen season. Moreover, in allergic patients, there is an increase in Langerhans-like cells (CD1+) during the season (793). 4-5-4-1-2- Epithelial cells The importance of epithelial cells in allergic rhinitis has often been discussed. By contradistinction to asthma, the epithelial layer is not shed even though numerous activated eosinophilsare found among epithelial cells (1167). In seasonal allergic rhinitis, epithelial cells bear ICAM-1 molecules (817). Moreover, although hyper-permeability of the mucosa is thought to be a characteristic of rhinitis, an inversefinding was observed using the mucosal absorption ofchromium-51 labelled EDTA suggesting that the air-way epithelial barrier, which is subject to prolongedeosinophilic inflammation, may rather increase itsfunctional tightness (1168). However, it is likely that epithelial cells are activated in seasonal allergic rhinitis. 4-5-4-1-3- Pro-inflammatory mediators A range of mediators are released the ECP (1171), increased when compared with pre-season levels (880, 1172).However, it has been shown that tissue histamine lev-els are correlated with symptoms during the pollenseason (1173). Tryptase, whose levels were found not to increase (1172). 4-5-4-1-4- Cytokines and chemokines During the pollen also IL- 1rand sIL-1RII, are upregulated during pollen expo- sure, and there was a significant correlation betweenthese factors (Bachert, unpublished data). In patients allergic to pollens, there is an increased number of cells expressing Th2 cytokines during thepollen season 980-982). Eotaxin mRNA was found upregulated with allergic rhinitis (1003, 1004). IL-8 levels seem to be unchanged or even decreased during the season in allergic rhinitics (973, 1011). MCP-1 levels increase during the pollen season. 4-5-4-1-5- Edema The airway mucosa responds to inflammatory provo- cations with bulk exudation of (mucosal of plasma is a promi-nent feature of airway inflammation and has been demon-strated in rhinitis (1123). The plasma exudation responsealso represents a first-line defence, allowing potent plas-ma proteins to appear on the airway mucosa and act as abarrier towards undue luminal material (656). S194 Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL NOVEMBER 2001 4-5-4-1-6- Neuropeptides The role of neuropeptides is unclear: Substance P and vasoactive intestinal peptide have been shown to be released into nasal secretions duringthe pollen season (1174). acetylcholine receptors have beenobserved in rhinitis. Atopic subjects present an increased cholinergic hyperresponsiveness during the pollen season (1177)suggesting that inflammatory changes occurring in themucosa increase its sensitivity to neuropeptides. 4-5-4-2- Perennial allergic rhinitis 4-5-4-2-1- Inflammatory cells Nasal eosinophilia is not a permanent feature of this disease (83, 759, 1178-1180) even in patients withallergic rhinitis. In a study examining the importanceof eosinophils in perennial rhinitis, it was observedthat eosinophils were often present in the nasal secre-tions of allergic, symptomatic patients (759). Neutrophils are present in non-infectious perennial rhinitis and a study performed by Knani et al. showed that neutrophil levels were increased in the non-aller-gic group (759). Epithelial mast cells are increased in numbers in the nasal mucosa of patients with allergic (1181) and non-allergic perennial rhinitis (1182). However, other stud-ies did not show the increase in mast cells in non-aller-gic patients (1183). Perennial allergic rhinitis is tive increase in CD4 B-cells and /T-cells in the nasal mucosa in CD4+memory T-cells in the allergic nasal epitheli- um may have critical implications in the pathogenesisof perennial allergic rhinitis. 4-5-4-2-2- Epithelial cells The importance of epithelial cells in allergic rhinitis has often been discussed but studies on the integrity ofthe nasal epithelium and the thickness of the basementmembrane in patients with perennial rhinitis have notdemonstrated any changes which are significantly dif-ferent from control subjects (1184). Goblet cell numbers do not appear to be significantly different in perennial rhinitis subjects when comparedto control subjects (653). 4-5-4-2-3- Pro-inflammatory Eosinophil-derived mediators were recovered lavages of rhinitis (759). CysLTs are also released (759). Myeloperoxidase is released by activated neutrophils and increased levels of this mediator have been foundin the nasal secretions of many patients suffering fromallergic Cytokines An imbalance in local T-cell cytokine in favour of enhanced IL-5 and reduced IL-2 expressionis observed in the nasal mucosa of patients with allergic rhinitis (777). IL-5 is increased in nasal lavages carried out in patients with house dust mite-induced rhinitis, and thelevels of this cytokine are decreased by intranasal glu-cocorticosteroids (1186). An increase in expression of IL-4 and IL-5 mRNA in the nasal mucosa of patients with perennial allergicrhinitis is observed during natural allergen exposure(986). IL-13 gene expression was detected in the epithelial compartment of the nasal mucosa of most patientswith allergic perennial rhinitis but was innormal volunteers and non-allergic patients withperennial rhinitis (776). ICAM-1 expression patients immunolocalisation of of patients with perennial rhinitis showed thatboth mast cells (988) and T-cells (775) were able torelease IL-5. However, the precise importance of thesetwo cell populations is still unclear. 4-5-4-2-5- Adhesion molecules A few studies have been performed to investigate the origin of cells present in the inflammatory infiltrate. Ithas been observed that the expression of adhesion mol-ecules is increased on the vascular endothelium ofbiopsies from patients with chronic rhinitis (843,1188). In the study of Saito et al. , the increased expres- sion of ICAM-1 in the mucosa associated with aninfiltration of activated lymphocytes. Other pro-inflammatory mediators may be involved but furtherexperiments are required for their characterisation(1189). 4-6- ASPIRIN INDUCED RHINITIS Inflammatory cell populations and cytokine expression were studied the nasal mucosa ofaspirin-sensitive rhinitis subjects (1190). In compari-son to normal subjects, there was an increase ineosinophils, mast cells and activated T-cells. Markedincreases were observed in the numbers of IL-5mRNA +cells in aspirin-sensitive patients, whereas lower numbers of IL-4 mRNA+cells were observed. No differences were observed for either IL-2 or IFN- . The predominance of macrophages and the dispropor-tionate increase in IL-5 compared to IL-4 mRNAexpression suggests that factors other than \"allergic\"mechanisms may be important in this disease. A simi-lar increase in IL-5 and over expression of LTC 4syn- thase was reported in the bronchi of patients withaspirin-induced asthma (919, 920). Activated eosinophils can be detected in nasal polyps of and non-allergic rhinitis (1194). It can bedefined as an increased nasal response to a normal stimu-lus resulting in sneezing, nasal congestion and secretion,either as a single symptom or in various combinations. This phenomenon can be observed after nasal stimula- tion (1195) such as: heating of methacholine (1202). Although histamine and metha-choline are widely used non-specific provoca-tion tests (871, 1194, 1198, 1199), they are not validat-ed in patients with non-allergic, cold air. In patients with non-allergic, non-infectious rhinitis, intranasal cold dry air results in an increasedmucus production and nasal blockage in a dose-depen-dent manner. It has proved to be a reliable method forthe measurement of non-specific nasal can also occur after non-nasal stimulation like for example: change of posture (1207), change in body temperature (1195), exercise (1208), consumption of hot drinks (soup) (1209). Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the mechanisms of nasal hyperreactivity in allergic and non-allergic rhinitis (675). They include: damage to the epithelial barrier, increased sensitivity of irritant receptors in the mucosa (1210, 1211), change in nerve transmission in periphery or in CNS (1212), release of pro-inflammatory mediators (1213), changes in receptor sensitivity of target cells or metab- olism and/or influx of inflammatory cells (1214). The late- phase reaction following allergen challenge may beinvolved in the development or hyperreactivity (871, 1213, 1215, 1216). allergic are variably exposed to diverse inciters, which modulate inflamma-tion (Figure 15). In normal subjects and patients with allergic rhinitis, indoor and outdoor pollutants induce symptoms of rhini-tis (see chapters 2-1-3-7 and 3-2). Tobacco smoking or passive smoking can, in some patients, induce a nasal reaction interfering with aller-gens and thereby participating in the symptomatology ofrhinitis (1217) (see chapter 3-2). Viral infections are known to induce the activation of various cell types including nasal epithelial cells (1218)and the release of various cytokines (972, 1219, 1220). Cold air can induce an inflammatory response with the activation of mast cells (1221, 1222) and the occurrenceof a late-phase mucous membrane. However, markers of inflam-mation are not examined in daily clinical work. There-fore, the term rhinitis is used for a disease of the nasalmucosa, which results in nasal itching, sneezing, rhinor-rhea and nasal blockage. The disease is \"non-allergic\" when allergy has not been proven by proper allergy examination (history, skin pricktesting, measurement of serum specific IgE antibodies). Rhinitis is called \"non-infectious\" when the nasal dis- charge is clear and watery, and not purulent. The detec-tion of micro organisms (viruses, bacteria, fungi) is notused in clinical work and therefore it can not form abasis for the diagnosis. \"Non-allergic, non-infectious rhinitis\" does not usually have a well-defined season and the disease is often called\"perennial non-allergic rhinitis\", although symptoms tendto be worst in the cold winter months. Formerly, the term\"vasomotor rhinitis\" was often used, but this implies thatthe underlying cause is a vascular and/or neurological dys-function of the mucosa, and there are no sound data tosupport this notion. Therefore, the term \"idiopathic rhini-tis\" is more correct for the disease of unknown aetiology. 5-1- PREVALENCE AND NATURAL HISTORY It is estimated that 2-4% of the general population suf- fers from a chronic nasal disease with daily symptomsand a need for medication. The figures are uncertainbecause of the vague definition of the disease and thelack of studies. Surprisingly, the U.S. National Health Interview Survey data of 1983-1985 placed \"chronic sinusitis\" (a term oftenused for nasal symptoms) first in rank among the mostcommon chronic conditions, with a prevalence of 13.5%. In contrast to allergic rhinitis, which usually makes its first appearance in children and youngsters, non-allergic,non-infectious rhinitis usually develops in middle-agedpersons. Perhaps ageing-related changes of the nasalmucosa predispose for the development of this condition,isolated rhinorrhea in particular. The course of the disease is capricious, but severe, persistent symptoms usually predict a long course. Thus,perennial non-allergic rhinitis does not have the samefavourable rhinitis are often unclear. 5-2-1- Drug response and mediators Our knowledge in this area is poor. The response to H1-antihistamines in patients who have sneezing as apredominant symptom points at histamine as an impor-tant mediator, but H1-antihistamines are generally inef-fective in most patients. Some effects of leukotrienereceptor antagonists in aspirin-sensitive patients indicatethat leukotrienes are of some significance in this sub-group. A response to glucocorticosteroids can be takenas proof of an inflammatory pathogenesis, but a sub-group of patients have neither signs of inflammation norresponse to glucocorticosteroids. In patients with a non-eosinophilic disease, studies on nasal secretions andmucosal biopsies have failed to identify any differencesbetween these patients and healthy controls, with respectto cellular or biochemical markers of inflammation. Itappears therefore that in these individuals, the disorder isnot of an inflammatory nature. If so, nasal hyperrespon-siveness may have a totally different pathophysiologicalbasis from that seen in chronic inflammatory disorders. 5-2-2- Nasal rhinitis. 5-3- SYMPTOMS A specific precipitating factor cannot be identified, but symptoms are often precipitated by non-specificstimuli such as smoke, strong odours, perfumes, alco-holic beverages, cold air and hot spicy food. The symptoms are usually the same as in allergic rhinitis, but eye symptoms are less frequent and nasalblockage more prominent. From a clinical point of view,it can be practical to make a distinction between diseasesbased on the prominent nasal symptom, because thisrelates to response to pharmacotherapy. 5-3-1- Sneezers The patient has the same symptoms as a patient with perennial allergic rhinitis and the symptoms usuallyrespond to treatment with antihistamines and glucocorti-costeroids. 5-3-2- Runners Some patients, especially elderly gentlemen, suffer exclusively from watery rhinorrhea. They do not respondto treatment with antihistamines and glucocortico-steroids but they can by an intranasalcholinoceptor antagonist (ipratropium bromide). 5-3-3- Blockers These patients are made to feel uncomfortable by nasal stuffiness or congestion with reduced or abolished nasalbreathing. The nasal mucosa is swollen due to vasodilata-tion, edema formation and/or hyperplasia. Anatomicabnormalities can contribute to the symptoms. Thesepatients do not respond to H1-antihistamines but may ormay not respond to glucocorticosteroids or to vasocon-J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME and the ARIA Workshop Group S197 strictors, which initially may be most effective when given systemically for some days before intranasal treatment. 5-4- CAUSES AND CLASSIFICATION The aetiology is unknown in most cases and the disease is therefore idiopathic. However, it is useful to analysewhether there can be causal or contributing factors. 5-4-1- Physiological symptoms The nose serves as an efficient humidifier, heater and filter for inhaled air thereby protecting the lower airways.The nasal mucosa is constantly exposed to unconditionedand occasionally polluted inhaled air causing irritation,sneezing, reflex-mediated hypersecretion and nasalblockage. When the nasal mucosa is exposed to environ-mental challenges (cold air, polluted air), symptoms area natural response. All subjects contract rhinorrhea fromexposure to cold air and from eating hot spicy soup. 5-4-2- Aetiology of non-allergic, non- infectious rhinitis There non-allergic, non- infectious rhinitis (see chapter 1-6). 5-4-3- Inappropriate awareness of normal nasal symptoms Occasional sneezing and rhinorrhea in the morning and upon exposure to cold and polluted air is consideredto be a normal nasal response. Some persons considereven slight nasal symptoms to be abnormal and seekmedical advice for that reason. Inquiry about the numberof daily sneezes and nose blowings and about the hourswith daily symptoms may help in making a distinctionbetween a normal physiological response and a disease. 5-4-4- Anatomical abnormalities Mild anatomical abnormalities are frequent. When nasal symptoms occur without a recent nasal trauma, ananatomical abnormality is usually not the aetiological fac-tor, but it may contribute to the symptoms of a disease ofthe mucous membrane. Septal deviation is a well-knowncause of nasal obstruction; it is often bilateral (S-shapeddeviation). A septal deviation with a spur, resulting in septal and lateral mucous inducesreflexes abnor-malities, such as an air-filled middle turbinate, concha bul-losa, can also cause nasal symptoms, especially blockage. 5-5- DIAGNOSIS Although a diagnosis is based on the patient's symp- toms, a diagnostic work up is required to differentiatethis syndrome from perennial allergic rhinitis and toexclude differential diagnoses. involves allergytesting, nasal endoscopy, preferably a nasal smear foreosinophils a CT-scan of nose andparanasal sinuses. In the NARES syndrome, eosinophils findingeosinophils (1226). 5-6- DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS Other conditions may mimic some of the symptoms of non-allergic, non-infectious rhinitis. Careful examination of a patient with non-allergic, non-infectious rhinitis is indicated in order to make thecorrect diagnosis and to exclude differential diagnosesand concurrent structural abnormalities. Congenital choanal atresia can be a cause of unilater- al obstruction, with discharge in an infant, but a foreignbody is much more common at that age. Enlarged ade-noids are a frequent cause of mouth breathing. Unilateral symptoms, bleeding and pain are important warning signals of malignancy. Malignant tumours in thenose, paranasal sinuses or nasopharynx and Wegener'sgranulomatosis usually with uncharacteristic symp-toms. A first diagnosis of perennial rhinitis is not uncom-mon in these cases. 5-7- CONCLUSIONS When allergy and infections have been excluded as the cause of rhinitis, a number of poorly defined nasal con-ditions of unknown aetiology and pathophysiology mustbe included in the differential diagnosis. These condi-tions are generally difficult to treat with the exception ofaspirin-induced rhinitis, nasal polyposis and other rhini-tis forms, which may respond to glucocorticosteroids. Adiagnostic work up is required to differentiate this condi-tion from perennial allergic rhinitis.S1986- Co-morbidity and complications Allergic inflammation does not necessarily limit itself to the nasal airway. Multiple co-morbidities have beenassociated with rhinitis. These Introduction The nasal and bronchial mucosa present similarities and most patients with asthma also have rhinitis (25, 28).Dysfunction of the upper and lower airways frequentlycoexists. Epidemiological, pathophysiological and clinicalstudies have strongly suggested a relationship betweenrhinitis and asthma. These data have lead to the conceptthat upper and lower airways may be considered as aunique entity influenced by a common, evolving inflam-matory process, which may be sustained and amplified byinterconnected mechanisms. Allergic rhinitis is correlatedto, and constitutes a risk factor for, the occurrence of asth-ma (145). It has been proposed that the prevention or earlytreatment of allergic rhinitis may help to prevent theoccurrence of asthma or the severity of bronchial symp-toms. Therefore, when considering a diagnosis of rhinitisor asthma, an evaluation of both the lower and upper air-ways should be made. However, although the nasal andbronchial mucosa present similarities, there are also dif-ferences between rhinitis and asthma. 6-1-2- Epidemiology 6-1-2-1- Association between asthma and rhinitisEpidemiological studies have consistently shown that asthma and rhinitis often co-exist in the same patients (6,32, 145, 175, 187, 1227). In a study in which a poll baseof 20,000 households were screened for symptoms ofrhinitis, 16,786 responded (109). The point prevalence ofperennial rhinitis (patients with at least 6 months of con-tinuous symptoms) was 4.1% and the association ofperennial rhinitis with a history of asthma was highlysignificant (13.4% in those with perennial rhinitis vs.3.8% in those without; odds ratio 3.26). Asthma appearsto be more often associated with perennial rhinitis thanwith seasonal rhinitis (30). The majority of patients with asthma present seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis symptoms (175). Rhinitisusually occurs in over 75% of patients with allergic asth-ma and in over 80% of patients with non-allergic asthma(6, 30). However, in many instances, symptoms predom-inate in one of the organs and may be hidden in the other.Data from Northern Sweden also demonstrate the asso-ciation between asthma and allergic rhinitis. Resultsshow that an adult with a family history of asthma orrhinitis has a risk of three to four-fold for developingasthma and of two to six-fold for developing rhinitis overan adult without a family history (95). The age of onset of atopy may be an important con- founding factor for the development of asthma and rhini-tis or rhinitis alone. In an Australian study, it was foundthat atopy acquired before the age of 6 years is an impor-tant predictive factor for asthma continuing into latechildhood whereas atopy acquired later was only strong-ly associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (1228). Sev-eral surveys in children and adults have shown signifi-cantly lower prevalences of asthma and allergic diseasesin Eastern Europe than in western countries. In formerEast Germany, tremendous changes towards westernlifestyle have occurred since unification (189). In 1995-1996, 2,334 school children in Leipzig participated in across-sectional study that used the same methods as a pre-vious survey done shortly after the fall of communism in1991-1992 (218, 227). The prevalence of seasonal aller-gic rhinitis and sensitisation increased significant-ly between 1991-1992 and 1995-1996. However, therewas no significant change in the prevalence of asthma orbronchial hyperresponsiveness (189). These findings sug-gest important differences in the development of atopicdisorders. Factors operating very early in life may be par-ticularly important for the acquisition of childhood asth-ma and rhinitis, whereas the development of atopic sensi-tisation and seasonal allergic rhinitis may also be affect-ed by environmental factors occurring beyond infancy. 6-1-2-2- Association between rhinitis and non- specific bronchial hyperreactivity Many patients with allergic have increased bronchial sensitivity to methacholine or histamine (1229,1230). with seasonal al bronchoconstriction unassociated with clinical exercise-induced bronchoconstriction patients birch pollen(1232-1234). In subjects with perennial allergic rhinitis, bronchial hyperreactivity appears to be more common and moresevere than in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis(1240, 1241). In an epidemiological study of the generalpopulation, it was confirmed that bronchial hyperreactiv-ity was increased mainly in patients with perennial andseasonal rhinitis in comparison to those with seasonalrhinitis alone or healthy subjects (176). In the NARES syndrome, 46% of patients with NARES but without histories of respiratory symptomshad a measurable bronchial hyperresponsiveness (85). Inthe same study, the CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME ARIA Workshop Group S199 siveness was associated with an increased number of eosinophils in induced sputum but not with the inflam-matory process in the nose. Responsiveness of the bronchial mucosa in asthma patients is approximately 50 times that of normal (non-allergic or non-asthmatic) subjects, whereas that of thenasal mucosa in allergic rhinitis is only 2-8 times subjects (1242, 1243). The inflammatory processinvolved in hyperresponsiveness is similar in both condi-tions, involving an increased infiltration of eosinophilsand subsequent increased mediator release. The greaterdegree of bronchial hyperresponsiveness seen in asthmamay be a consequence of the anatomical differencesbetween the upper versus the lower airways. 6-1-3- The same triggers can cause rhinitis and asthma Among the causative agents inducing asthma and rhinitis, some (e.g. allergens (6) and aspirin (1244,1245)) are well known to affect both the nose and thebronchi (1246, 1247). In the general population, allergy to house dust mite or animal dander is a risk factor for asthma and rhinitiswhereas pollen allergy is a risk factor for rhinitis (1248-1251). In aspirin sensitivity, after aspirin challenge, CysLTs are released into both nasal and bronchial secretions(148). An interesting model for studying the relationship between rhinitis and asthma has been offered by occupa-tional sensitisation. Subjects with occupational asthmamay also report symptoms of rhinoconjunctivitis. In thecase of low molecular weight agents, rhinitis is less pro-nounced. Rhinitis more often appears before asthma inthe case of high molecular weight agents (561-563). Inallergy to small mammals, rhinitis may be very severebut usually appears before asthma (1252). This high-lights the importance of the cessation of allergen expo-sure in occupational allergic rhinitis in order to preventasthma. Thus, there is strong epidemiological evidence show- ing a close link between rhinitis and asthma, and sug-gesting a common genetic background for both these dis-eases. Some genes may be restricted to nasal symptoms.Some HLA-DR haplotypes distinguish subjects withasthma only in ragweed pollenallergy (301). 6-1-4- Natural history of the diseases Studies have also identified a temporal relationship between the onset of rhinitis and asthma, with rhinitisfrequently preceding the development of asthma. Aller-gic rhinitis developing in the first years of life is an earlymanifestation of an atopic predisposition, which may betriggered by early environmental exposures (145). Aller-gic rhinitis and positive allergy skin tests are significantrisk factors for developing new asthma (275). A 10-yearprognosis study for childhood allergic rhinitis was car-ried out and it was found that asthma or wheezing haddeveloped in 19% of cases and was more commonamong those with perennial allergic rhinitis than amongthose with seasonal allergic rhinitis (276). Individualswith either of these diagnoses are about three times morelikely to develop asthma than negative controls (275).However, upper and lower airway symptoms can alsodevelop simultaneously in about 25 % of patients. In aspirin-induced asthma, the clinical syndrome develops according to a pattern, characterised by a defi-nite sequence of symptoms (31). Rhinitis is the firstsymptom of the disease and is usually related to a flu-likeinfection in the majority of patients. It appears on aver-age at the age of 30, is characterised by discharge fromthe nose, often watery, nasal blockage, oral andless frequently by pain in paranasal sinuses. Rhinitis isperennial, difficult to treat and leads to a loss of smell inaround 50% of the patients. In an average patient, thefirst symptoms of asthma appear two years after the onsetof rhinitis. Intolerance to aspirin and other NSAID aswell as nasal polyps become evident years later. In themajority of patients, aspirin intolerance, once developed,remains for the rest of their lives. Repeated aspirin chal-lenges are, therefore, positive though some variability inintensity and spectrum of symptoms occurs. However, inan occasional patient, a positive aspirin challenge maybecame negative after a period of several years. 6-1-5- The mucosa of the airways In normal subjects, the structure of the airway mucosa presents similarities between the nose and the bronchi.Both nasal a basement membrane. Underneath the epithe-lium, in the submucosa, vessels and mucous glands arepresent with structural cells (fibroblasts), some inflam-matory cells (essentially monocytic cells, lymphocytesand mast cells) (1253) and nerves. There are also differences between the nose and the bronchi. In the nose, there is a large supply of subepithe-lial capillary, arterial system and venous cavernous sinu-soids. The high of vascularisation is a key featureof the nasal mucosa and changes the vasculature maylead to severe nasal obstruction (646) . On the other hand, smooth muscle is present from the trachea to the bron-chioles explaining bronchoconstriction in asthma. The nerves present in nasal mucosa include adrenergic and cholinergic nerves and nerves of NANC (non-adrenergic non-cholinergic system) (675, 690, 966).Neurotransmitters and neuropeptides theautonomic nervous system exert homeostatic control ofnasal secretion (by plasma extravasation) as well as ofmucous and serous cell secretion. Sensory neuropeptidesare present in human bronchial nerves beneath and with-in the epithelium, around blood vessels and submucosalglands and within the bronchial smooth muscle layer(1254, 1255). Cholinergic nerves are the predominantbronchoconstrictor pathway. On the other hand, there isno direct functional adrenergic supply to human airways.S200 Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL NOVEMBER 2001 The role of the NANC system is still poorly understood in asthma (1256) although it has been proposed that animbalance between sensory neuropeptides may play arole in the mechanisms of asthma (676, 1257). Moreover,adrenergic control of the nose and bronchi agonists in asthma. Nitric oxide (NO) is an intercellular transmitter, both in the central and peripheral nervous system. In additionto nerve cells, NO is also produced in the epithelial cellsof various tissues and in the endothelium. NO is pro-duced in large amounts in the noses of normal individu-als. NO is an important mediator of the effector arm ofthe naso-nasal reflex that increases vascular permeabilitybut is not involved in the sensory nerve afferent pathway(1258). NO appears to play a key role as a vasodilator,neurotransmitter and inflammatory mediator in thebronchi and is produced in increased amounts in asthma(1259). In healthy subjects, exhaled NO originates main-ly from the upper airways with only a minor contributionfrom the lower airways (1260). 6-1-6- Relationships and differences between rhinitis and asthma Recent progress achieved in the cellular and molecular biology of airway diseases has clearly shown that inflam-mation plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of asthmaand rhinitis. A growing number of studies theinflammation of nasal and bronchial mucosa is sustainedby a similar inflammatory infiltrate, which is representedby eosinophils, mast cells, T-lymphocytes and cells of to be involved in the nasal and bronchialinflammation of patients with rhinitis and asthma. How-ever, differences may exist in the extent of the inflamma-tory indices, eosinophilic inflammation and epithelialshedding being more pronounced in the bronchi than inthe nose of the same patients suffering from asthma andrhinitis (1184). Inflammatory cells assessed by sputuminduction are present not only in the airways of patientswith asthma but also in the airways of patients with sea-sonal allergic rhinitis, outside of season (1267). Atopic patients without asthma present some degree of bronchial inflammation, in particular a few activatedeosinophils (1087). An irregularly distributed subepithe-lial fibrosis observed in subjects withallergic rhinitis (1268). It results from the deposition oftype I and III collagens and fibronectin and suggests thepresence of an active structural remodelling in the lowerairways of allergic rhinitic subjects, similar in nature tothat seen in asthma, although less marked. Afterbronchial segmental allergen challenge in non-asthmaticrhinitics, an early and beobserved (1269) suggesting that the bronchial mucosa ofrhinitics is capable of being triggered by allergens. Anincrease in airways inflammation was found after seg-mental challenge in the same patients (1269). It is well established that bronchial mucosal inflamma- tion causes epithelium shedding, increased thickness ofthe reticular layer of the basement membrane and hyper-trophy of smooth muscle cells (1270). On the other hand,in perennial rhinitis, epithelium is not usually shed (1167,1226). In a biopsy study carried out in the nose andbronchi of the same asthmatic patients with rhinitis, it wasshown that epithelium was not generally shed in the nosewhereas shedding was observed in the bronchi (1184). Airway remodelling exists microscopically in most if not all asthmatics (862) including bronchial wall thick-ening, deposition of collagen and proteins on the base-ment membrane, increase in smooth muscle mass and therelease of fibrogenic growth factors. In allergic rhinitis,such a remodelling process is still under discussion andrequires further studies. In a biopsy study carried out inthe nose and bronchi of the same asthmatic patients withrhinitis, it was observed that the size of the reticular base-ment membrane was close to that in the nasal biopsies ofnormal subjects. (1184). The early and late bronchial responses were compared in 123 patients with allergic rhinitis and mild asthma. Inthis study, the presence or the absence of asthma symp-toms in allergic subjects was related to a quantitativelydifferent airway responsiveness to allergen (1271). Nasal and bronchial abnormalities observed in asth- matics therefore appear to present distinct entities, butinter-related conditions are not yet excluded. Compara-tive studies showing whether the release of inflammato-ry cytokines, chemokines and inflammatory mediators inthe nose and the bronchi causes similar or different struc-tural alterations of the mucosa remain to be fully evalu-ated (Figure 16). 6-1-7- Physiological relationships between rhinitis and asthma The inflammatory reaction of the nose can cause a worsening of asthma by several different mechanisms(26). Although a nasal challenge with allergen does notinduce airflow limitation of airways, it maycause non-specific bronchial responsiveness (1272,1273) . Several mechanisms have been proposed to link uncontrolled allergic rhinitis and the occurrence or wors-ening of asthma (1274): Nasal challenge induces the release of mediators, which can in turn cause a bronchoconstriction. The post-nasal mucous drip may induce contraction of the bronchial smooth muscle or inflammation of thelower airways. However, this mechanism may not berelevant in conscious human beings. Mouth breathing secondary to nasal obstruction is a common feature in asthmatics and may play a role inthe severity of asthma. A putative reflex between the nose and the lungs has been proposed (1275) but has to be confirmed.J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 108, NUMBER 5Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group S201 There are also close links between nasal infection by viruses and asthma exacerbations (1276). Rhinoviruseshave been widely identified in nasal in both children and relationships between rhinitis and asthma Few studies have examined the chronology of symp- toms during the pollen season. Usually, nasal symptomsoccur early in the pollen season and reach a maximumwith peak pollination or just after it. On the other hand,bronchial symptoms usually begin after the onset of theseason, peak later than the peak pollen counts and persistfor some time after (1284). In some patients, non-specif-ic bronchial hyperreactivity may be prolonged for weeks(see chapter 6-1-2). 6-1-9- Costs Asthma is a common and costly condition. Concomi- tant asthma and allergic rhinitis have been shown toincrease the medication costs for people with asthma. Astudy has compared medical care costs of those with andwithout concomitant allergic rhinitis. Yearly medical carecharges were on average 46% higher for those with asth-ma and concomitant allergic rhinitis than for personswith asthma alone, allowing for age and gender (32). 6-1-10- Conclusion Upper and lower airways may be considered as a unique entity supporting the concept of a \"united airways\", butthere are also differences which should be highlighted.Allergic rhinitis is correlated to, and constitutes a risk fac-tor for, the occurrence or severity of asthma. The treatmentof asthma and rhinitis presents similarities since the samedrugs are effective in rhinitis and asthma (e.g. glucocorti-costeroids) and differences since different drugs are effec-tive in upper and lower airways (e.g. - and \u00df-adrenergic agonists respectively). Moreover, some drugs are moreeffective in rhinitis than in asthma (e.g. H1-antihista-mines). Finally, an rhinitis maypartly improve coexisting asthma. 6-2- Prevalence of the association Symptoms of \"red eye\" occur in a large proportion of patients with rhinitis. However, the prevalence of the asso-ciation between rhinitis and conjunctivitis cannot easily bedefined. Conjunctival symptoms are often considered to beof minor importance (1285) and possibly not spontaneous-ly reported by patients with rhinitis and/or asthma in med-ical interviews or in questionnaire-based studies such as theISAAC and the ECRHS (107, 150). Moreover, severalsigns of involvement of the external eye (Table 7) can be FIGURE 16: Similarities and differences between asthma and rhinitis. In rhinitis, there are numerous blood vessels explaining nasal obstruction. In asthma, there is smooth muscle ARIA Workshop Group J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL NOVEMBER 2001 documented only with an accurate eye examination, which was not part of the protocol in most studies of rhinitispatients. Accordingly, the association between rhinitis andconjunctivitis is underestimated in epidemiological studies. A second even more relevant reason which makes sev- eral clinical studies on the prevalence of conjunctivitis inrhinitis patients of limited value is represented by the het-erogeneity of the red eye syndrome, usually referred to as\"conjunctivitis\". In fact, a red eye can be caused by aller-gic and non-allergic agents. Moreover, allergic eye dis-eases represent a heterogeneous entity including differentforms of conjunctivitis with different signs, symptoms,pathophysiology, degree of severity and response to treat-ment (1286-1288). Allergic conjunctivitis is usually classified as acute, seasonal, perennial, vernal or atopic conjunctivitis. Animmunological mechanism has also been postulated forconjunctival symptoms in contact lens wearers (Table 7). Acute aller gic conjuncti vitis (AA C) is an acute hyper- sensitivity reaction with hyperaemia and chemosisaccompanied by intense tearing, itching and burningof the eye. This is caused by an accidental exposure toseveral substances such as gas and liquid \"irritants\" oranimal danders. aller gic conjuncti vitis typical conjunctival reaction in seasonal allergic rhinitisrhinoconjunctivitis or following exposure to seasonalpollen allergens in erennial aller gic (P AC)is a less intense but continuous conjunctival reaction related to expo-sure to perennial allergens such as house dust mites.Vernal conjuncti vitis (VKC ) is a severe bilateral eye condition in children, with frequent involvement of thecornea (vernal keratoconjunctivitis). lids andskin. conjuncti vitis (CLC ) is a giant-papillary conjunctivitis observed in hard and soft contact lenswearers. From surveys on a large number of patients with \"aller- gic conjunctivitis\" (1285), the prevalence of the associa-tion between rhinitis and \"conjunctivitis\" appears to bedifferent depending on the type of allergic conjunctivitis.In 239 pollinosis patients studied in Italy, eye symptomswere almost always (95.2% of cases) associated withrhinitis or with asthma (28.7% of cases). Only 1.2% ofpatients had conjunctivitis and asthma but not rhinitis.The allergen responsible for sensitisation and symptomswas in these cases a perennial pollen ( Parietaria) . The prevalence of rhinitis in patients with atopic and contact lens conjunctivitis is similar in allergic and non-allergic patients (1285). It seems therefore that the association between rhinitis and conjunctivitis is a typical feature of patients with sea-sonal pollen allergy. More interestingly, it can also bespeculated that the pathophysiology of the allergic patientis heterogeneous and that the type of disease associationin a patient with rhinitis might help in better defininghis/her clinical and pathophysiological phenotype.TABLE 7: Symptoms and signs of allergic eye diseases Symptoms Signs Seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis Tearing Mild hyperaemiaBurning Mild edemaMild itching Mild lens conjunctivitisItching Giant papillaePain Excessive mucus foreign ARIA Workshop Group S203 6-2-2- Mechanisms Two major mechanisms can be invoked for explaining the association between rhinitis and conjunctivitis: Naso-conjunctival reflexes, certainly possible from an anatomical point of view, seem to influence conjuncti-val symptoms in patients with rhinitis (and vice-versa).In fact, it is well appreciated that specific and non-specific challenge to the nose or to the eye is followed,respectively, by eye and nose symptoms associated withthose at the level of the challenged organ. It is also wellappreciated that in many forms of rhinoconjunctivitis,treatment of the nose also improves eye symptoms. A common pathophysiological background with con- temporary involvement of the nose and the eye wassuggested after the first description of hay fever. It wasclearly documented for seasonal allergic rhinoconjunc-tivitis with the description of Type I hypersensitivityreactions. In IgE-mediated seasonal and perennial aller-gic conjunctivitis, mechanisms similar to those involvedin seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis do explain thepathophysiology of the disease and symptoms (1289-1291). Late-phase inflammatory events also occur inthe eye after allergen challenge (1292). However, innormal conditions, they seem to play an important roleonly in subjects with a high degree of sensitisationand/or in those exposed to high allergen loads. In vernal keratoconjunctivitis and allergic keratocon- junctivitis, there are elevated levels of total IgE in serumand a massive mast cell (1293) and eosinophil infiltration(1294-1296) of the conjunctiva. This is not necessarilyassociated with the detection of specific IgE antibodies.Accordingly, it has been suggested that a Th2-type aller-gic inflammation may be the major pathophysiologicalabnormality underlying symptoms and poor response toconventional anti-allergic treatments (1297). Non-specific the eye after histamine (1298) and hyper-osmolar challenge (1299). non-specific hyperre-activity represents a dependent on undefined tissue and neural mech-anisms. This could possibly explain conjunctival symp-toms in the absence of IgE antibodies and allergicinflammation, as in the case of some forms of acute andcontact lens conjunctivitis. 6-2-3- Clinical aspects Eye examination should be part of the clinical assess- ment of allergic rhinitis. Conjunctival allergen provocation does not add relevant information to detect sensitisation or eye involvement inrhinitis patients (1300). However, it may be interesting tomonitor interventions during clinical trials (1300-1308). Measurement of IgE and mediators in tears is mainly confined to research purposes. Conjunctival cytology may be important in categoris- ing eye diseases. On the other hand, in vivo and in vitro tests for allergy diagnosis overlap between rhinitis and conjunctivitis.Interestingly enough, markers of eosinophilic inflam-mation\u2014such as ECP or peripheral eosinophil cyto-fluorimetric profile\u2014can be even more abnormal insome cases of allergic conjunctivitis than in cases ofallergic rhinitis, in spite of the more limited extensionof the involved mucosa (1309). Therefore, they shouldbe considered as a marker of atopic status rather thanas an index of the localisation and severity of targettissue involvement. Although some indirect benefits may result from topi- cal treatment of rhinitis and conjunctivitis on the asso-ciated symptoms of the eye and nose respectively, theassociation between rhinitis and conjunctivitis shouldsuggest the advantage of oral treatment which canbenefit both diseases. In view of the severity of inflam-mation and corneal involvement, vernal keratocon-junctivitis or atopic conjunctivitis anterior ethmoidal and frontal sinuses drain via the ostium of the maxillary sinuses collectively known as ostiomeatal ethmoid drains in the upper meatus in the spheno-ethmoidal recess. Swelling of themucous membranes, whether due to allergy, infection orother causes, may obstruct the drainage and aeration ofthe sinuses and one might therefore expect allergy toincrease the risk of developing acute and chronic sinusi-tis (1310, 1311). Some studies suggested that rhinosinusitis is a common complication of allergic rhinitis (1312-1314). In one study,43% of the cases of acute rhinosinusitis were seasonal, ofwhich 25% were allergic (1315). Allergy was considered tobe the cause of acute maxillary rhinosinusitis in 25% ofyoung adults compared with 16.5% of healthy controls(1316). However, there is no evidence of change in ostialpatency or of increase in the incidence of purulent rhinosi-nusitis during the pollen season (1317). This is present insimilar proportions in patients with or without allergicrhinitis (1318). Forty per cent of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis suffer from allergy, whereas in patients with bilateralmaxillary rhinosinusitis, this increases to 80% (1317).Two studies (1319, 1320) however could find no signifi-cant difference on CT scans between allergic and non-allergic adults with chronic rhinosinusitis. S204 Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL NOVEMBER 2001 It has been suggested that allergens may enter the sinuses resulting in a similar allergic inflammation as inthe nasal using radio-labelled pol-lens, there is no evidence that allergens deposited in thenose can reach the sinus cavities (1322). Alternatively, itwas proposed that allergens could reach the sinus mucosathrough circulation after absorption through the skin, inthe case of fungal allergens, or after absorption from food. The pathology of sinusitis has been studied in recent years. Activated eosinophils are commonly found inbiopsies taken from the sinuses of allergic and non-aller-gic patients (1323-1326). Other cells including mastcells, lymphocytes, macrophages and, to a lesser extent,neutrophils are increased, releasing pro-inflammatorymediators as well as cytokines and growth factors (1325,1327). On the other hand, surprisingly, it was found thatin patients suffering from perennial allergic rhinitis,ICAM-1 expression was low in the sinus mucosa whencompared to the nasal mucosa (1187). The analysis of the lavage fluid from patients with chronic rhinosinusitis reveals high concentrations of hista-mine, CysLT and PGD 2in concentrations similar to those obtained after challenge with antigen in allergic rhinitispatients (1328). These high concentrations may indicatemast cell/basophil stimulation and contribute to the persis-tence of inflammation in chronic rhinosinusitis (1187). In conclusion, although allergy may be expected to result in inflammation and swelling of the nasal mucosa,leading to obstruction of the sinuses and acting as a pre-cursor for both acute and chronic rhinosinusitis, evidenceis at present still inconclusive. 6-3-1-2- Relationship between asthma and sinusitisFor more than 70 years, the coexistence of asthma and paranasal rhinosinusitis has been noted in medical litera-ture (1329-1331). In patients with chronic asthma, theassociations of chronic rhinosinusitis with asthma andallergy appear to be restricted to the group with extensivedisease (1332). Mucosal thickening in the sinuses, but not themaxillary sinuses, is more common in patients with acuteasthma than in control subjects (1333). Sinusitis may con-tribute to the severity of the bronchial symptoms (1334). 6-3-2- Nasal polyps Polyps are smooth, grape-like structures, which from the inflamed mucosa lining the paranasal sinuses.These prolapse down into and may obstruct the nasalcavity. There are apparently two types of nasal polypsdepending on the cells infiltrating the tissues. Nasalpolyps occurring in association with cystic fibrosis maybe neutrophilic in nature. However, in many otherinstances, such as polyps associated with asthma and par-ticularly aspirin sensitive asthma (1335), infiltrating cellsare eosinophils (1336-1338). Whilst the degree of cellu-lar infiltration may vary, some patients with cystic fibro-sis may also have allergic rhinitis and the and eosinophilia may not be soclear-cut (1339, 1340). Differences in cell infiltration arerelated to the expression of adhesion molecules (845,1341-1343) and reduced apoptosis (740). 6-3-2-1- Relationship between allergy and polyposisFor many years, an allergic aetiology has been pre- sumed (1344) but never firmly demonstrated in nasalpolyposis. The prevalence of nasal polyposis in allergicpatients is rather low and usually under 5% (1345-1347).Wong and Dolovich (1348), in a series nasal polypectomy, found that 66% had atleast one positive allergy skin prick test when tested with14 inhalants and 5 food allergens. However, 74% had apositive skin test in a control group of patients undergo-ing non-polyp nasal surgery. It may be argued that: Skin tests may not identify all the allergens that could possibly play a role in nasal polyposis (1349). There may be a local production of IgE (1350, 1351). Perkins et al. however found no positive allergen-spe- cific IgE by RAST in polyp fluid to any allergen notdetected in serum, though in a smaller study with only12 polyp patients, six had negative skin tests (1352). Drake-Lee (1353) found no correlation between posi- tive skin prick tests and the number of repeat polypec-tomies. Wong and Dolovich (1348), in a prospectivestudy of 249 patients undergoing polypectomy, found noassociation between the number of polypectomies inpatients with at least one positive allergy skin test. Therewas however an increased number of polypectomies inthose with asthma and there was a positive associationbetween the blood eosinophil count and the number ofprevious polypectomies. 6-3-2-2- Relationship between aspirin intolerance and polyposis Aspirin intolerance is often observed in nasal polypo- sis (1354). Out of 500 patients registered at the EuropeanNetwork on Aspirin-Induced Asthma (AIANE), almost80% suffered from the rhinosinusitis andcomplained of nasal blockage accompanied by rhinor-rhea (148). Loss of smell was present in 69% of thesepatients. Significant abnormalities in almost all paranasalsinuses were detected in 75% of the patients. Any com-bination of air-fluid levels, mucosal thickening or opaci-fication were characteristic findings in one or moreparanasal sinuses. Nasal polyps were diagnosed in 62%of AIANE patients, on average at the age of 33 years. Thepolyps had a tendency to recur and multiple polypec-tomies were common among AIANE patients (148). 6-3-2-3- Relationship between asthma and polyposisNasal polyposis is commonly found in association with lower tract respiratory disorders, such as asthma andnon-specific bronchial hyperreactivity (1355). Patientswith that observed in asthmatic patientswith nasal polyposis. On the other hand, the Workshop Group S205 show eosinophilic airways inflammation (1358). significance of asymptomatic bronchial hyperreactiv-ity associated with nasal polyposis is unknown but it maytherefore represent an indication of potential asthma. Theclinical relevance of these results requires careful follow-up to determine whether eosinophilic inflammation inthese patients precedes and is responsible for the develop-ment of obvious asthma. The treatment of nasal polyposis and sinusitis may be involved in the control of asthma. It consists of medicaland/or surgical management (1359-1361). Topical steroidtherapy has a well established role in the management ofnasal polyps, since it has proven efficacy on the symp-toms and size of polyps and may help prevent the recur-rence of nasal polyposis after surgery (1362-1367). A study of 205 patients attempted to determine whether or not nasal and sinus surgery had a beneficial or deleteri-ous effect upon the asthma of patients with nasal polypsand aspirin intolerance (1368). A classification system wasdevised to provide a means of determining the severity ofasthma before and after surgery. These data indicate thatsurgery does improve the patient's asthma for relativelylong periods of time. However, conflicting opinions existconcerning the evolution of asthma and asymptomaticbronchial hyperreactivity in patients with nasal polyposis(1368-1380). Some studies have even indicated thatpolypectomy and sinus surgery may induce a worsening ofasthma severity (1381). In fact, few authors have evaluat-ed the consequences of sinus surgery in nasal polyposis,relying on objective criteria such as lung volume measure-ments and the evaluation of non-specific bronchial hyper-reactivity. There are no prospective studies published. The initial response of nasal polyposis to glucocorti- costeroids may be of importance in asthma and nasal polyposis. an enhancement of non-specific bronchial hyperreactivityand a significant, but modest, decrease of FEV 1over 12 months. No change was observed in 21 intranasal gluco-corticosteroid responders. However, no change in pul-monary symptoms and asthma severity was observed. Ina further study, the same group examined, over a 4-yearperiod, the long-term changes of pulmonary function andbronchial hyperreactivity in 46 patients with nasal poly-posis (1382). All patients were first of all treated withintranasal glucocorticosteroids for 6 weeks (beclometha-sone 600 \u00b5g/day). Eighteen patients successfully treated with intranasal glucocorticosteroids (intranasalglucocorticosteroid responders). Intranasal ethmoidecto-my was performed in glucocorticosteroids alone (intranasal glu-cocorticosteroid change over the 4-year follow-up period in the two groups.

The aetiology and pathogenesis of this dis-ease are multifactorial and the exact mechanism is notfully understood. It is actually a spectrum of related dis-orders, such as Eustachian tube dysfunction, infectionand mucosal inflammation induced by antigen-specificimmune reactions. Over the last decades, the aetiological relationship between rhinitis and otitis media, especially the role ofallergy in otitis media with effusion (OME), has been thesubject of much controversy. Uncontrolled studiesreported the incidence of respiratory allergy in childrenwith OME to range from 4% to over 90% (1383). Thishas resulted in confusion and misunderstanding of therelationship between these two diseases. The nose and middle ears are situated in a system of contiguous organs. Both cavities are covered by respira-tory mucosa and there is an anatomic continuationbetween these two cavities through the Eustachian tube.It is, however, not fully understood whether inflamma-tion, infection or obstruction in the nose influence or pro-mote otitis media. Many important questions still need tobe firmly answered: whether the presence of allergic rhinitis predisposes an individual to the development of otitis, whether nasal dysfunction causes otitis to worsen, whether OME can be cured by treating the underlying nasal or sinus infection, whether the middle ear mucosa can be targeted direct- ly by allergens. To understand these entities better, it is important to know the pathophysiological mechanism by whichallergy or other nasal pathologies influence middle eardisease. On the other hand, there is a need to performlongitudinal studies on these diseases with a compara-ble or standardised methodology. In this way, a moreaccurate assessment of the aetiological and pathophysi-ological relationship can be achieved between these twocommon diseases. 6-4-2- Definition and classification of otitis media Otitis media is an inflammation of the middle ear without reference to aetiology or pathogenesis (1384).The various types of otitis media have been classified as: otitis media without effusion, e.g. present in the early stages of acute otitis media but may also be found inthe stage of resolution of acute otitis media or mayeven be chronic, acute otitis media (AOM), e.g. acute suppurative or purulent otitis media, media the tympanic J NOVEMBER 2001 6-4-3- Epidemiological relation between rhinitis and otitis media Nasal and middle ear diseases are both common health problems and they may often occur at the same time.Allergic and non-allergic rhinitis is the most commonchronic illness affecting children but peak prevalence isobserved in adolescents and young adults. Infectiousrhinitis, when compared to allergic rhinitis, is more com-mon in infants and pre-school children and less commonin school children and pre-adolescence (40). Otitis media is the most common illness diagnosed during early childhood and accounts for 20-35% of pae-diatric office visits in the first 2 years of life (1385). Thisdisease is uncommon but not rare in adults. In NorthAmerica and Europe, patients over the age of 15 yearsconstitute 10 to 15% of the AOM patients seen by pri-mary care practitioners. 6-4-3-1 Infectious rhinitis and otitis mediaComplications of infectious rhinitis are more com- monly seen in children. Acute otitis media (AOM) is themost common complication. Most of the cases in chil-dren under 3 years are preceded or accompanied by viralrhinitis. In older children, viral infections are also com-mon (1386, 1387). Respiratory syncytial virus is the prin-cipal virus which invades the middle ear during AOM(1388). In adults, acute sinusitis is a more frequent com-plication of the common cold than AOM. The common cold is also a frequent cause of OME in children (1389, 1390). The highest prevalence of OME isseen 5 to 8 weeks after the last episode of a commoncold. After this period, there is a progressive improve-ment of the middle ear status. The correlation betweentympanometric findings and the annual frequency of acommon cold is not as strong as that between the annualepisodes of AOM and a common cold. This indicates thatOME probably involves more factors in its pathophysiol-ogy than AOM and that the influence of a common coldon OME is indirect. 6-4-3-2- Allergy and otitis media with effusionThe role of allergy as an aetiological factor in the pathophysiology of OME is still controversial. In 1973,Miglets, reviewing 19 published papers, suggested thatallergy was strongly associated with OME (1391). Onthe other hand, not everybody supported this concept(1392). The reasons for this controversy are probably thebias in the study design, especially in the selection of thestudy population. Up until 1975, there were no clinicalstudies available in which an unselected group of chil-dren was screened for both allergy and OME. In 1975, Reisman and Bernstein (1393) published the first report on the relationship between allergy and OMEusing an unselected group of children from an otologypractice. 23% of the children who were tested for OMEhad an atopic disease. This figure was only slightly high-er than could be expected from a random examination ofunselected children. These findings were confirmed byRuokonen et al. (1394), while Kjellman et al. (1395) found that the incidence of atopic disease in OME wassignificantly higher than in an unselected control group.It is obvious that the incidence of allergy in children withOME is, at most, slightly greater than might be expectedin the general population (1396). It is possible that chil-dren with atopic dermatitis present a higher prevalence ofOME than non-atopic children (1397). In this large study,asthma and rhinitis were not predisposing factors for thedevelopment of OME. However, the number of OMEepisodes may be greater in atopic children than in non-atopic children (1398). 6-4-4- Potential interactions between rhinitis and otitis media 6-4-4-1- Eustachian tube dysfunction The middle ear is naturally protected by the Eusta- chian tube from exogenous antigenic stimulation. Aproperly functioning Eustachian tube (ventilation, pro-tection, drainage and clearance) is important in maintain-ing a normal middle ear. On the other hand, abnormalfunctioning of the Eustachian tube appears to be the mostimportant aetiological factor in the pathogenesis of mid-dle ear disease (1384). In addition to congenital oranatomical abnormalities of the Eustachian tube, muco-sal inflammation caused by infection or by antigen-specific reaction is believed to be a common contributingfactor to Eustachian tube dysfunction. Nasal obstructionmay result in an initial positive nasopharyngeal air pres-sure followed by a negative phase of middle ear cavity.Under these conditions, viral and bacterial pathogens orpossibly allergens may enter the middle ear via theEustachian tube by aspiration, reflex 97% of patients with AOM, withorganisms corresponding to those isolated from middleear effusion in 69% (1399). The nasopharyngeal micro-organisms may enter the middle ear through the Eustachi-an tube. This may be facilitated by nose-blowing, closed-nose swallowing (Toynbee manoeuvre) or by aspirationinto the middle ear as a result of negative middle ear pres-sure. Anaerobic organisms may be present in otitis media. It is still a controversial issue as to whether the indis- criminate use of antibiotics contributes to the problem byweakening children's immune systems or whether amore extensive use of antibiotics could help childrenavoid unnecessary surgery. In many cases, especially in older children, chronic effu- sion may appear without any evidence of preceding AOM.It has been shown, however, that middle ear effusions arenot sterile and that they contain the same spectrum ofmicro-organisms as found in acute effusions (1400). Inthese cases, the fluid is produced by the middle ear mucosain response to sub-clinical antigenic stimulation rather thanby an overt acute infectious process (1400). 6-4-4-3- Allergy and allergic inflammationThe relationship between allergy and otitis media, if any, is not fully understood. A question that has beenunder discussion for several decades is whether the mid-J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 108, NUMBER 5Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group S207 dle ear can be considered as an allergic \"shock organ\". In mice, the middle ear is an immunologically potentialorgan, since it contains cells which can react to animmune stimulus (1401). Histologically, the nasal andmiddle ear cavities are covered by a similar respiratorymucosa, but there are fewer immunocompetent cells inthe normal ear mucosa. Several cytokines, chemokinesand growth factors are released in the exudate of otitismedia in animals and in man (1402, 1403). In some studies, it was found that many lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages, leukocytes and other inflam-matory cells accumulated in inflamed middle earmucosa, but that only a few mast cells are found in thenormal middle ear mucosa (1404). In guinea pigs, in thetubotympanum, mast cells are mainly located in areascovered by ciliated and secretory epithelium. Small num-bers of mast were in foetal tubotympani thathad received no antigenic stimuli (1405). Mast cells and tryptase are present in a majority of chronic ear effusions (1406). This study suggests that mid-dle ear mucosa may be able to mount an allergic response.However, the mechanism by which this allergen-specificimmune reaction takes place remains to be clarified. Intranasal allergen challenge in animals resulted in equivocal results. Miglets induced an acellular middleear effusion by inoculating ragweed pollen theEustachian tube of sensitised monkeys whereas Doyle et al.failed to confirm this finding (1391, 1407). Nasal anti- gen challenge in guinea pigs induced an important infil-tration of eosinophils, mast cells and edema in themucous membrane lining the nose, nasopharynx andEustachian tube near the pharyngeal orifice, but not inthe rest of the Eustachian tube (1405). In humans, the concept that the middle ear mucosa can act as an allergic \"shock organ\" is not generally acceptedbecause in natural circumstances, the middle ear mucosa isnot directly exposed to aeroallergens. However, some stud-ies found that tubal dysfunction occured with allergen (1408-1410) and histamine (1411).During the ragweed pollen season, it was found that 60% ofthe 15 children followed developed Eustachian tubeobstruction (1412). This was found to correlate with dailypatient symptom-medication scores during pollen exposure. A localised inflammatory process within the middle ear itself has been suggested to occur in man (1413,1414). Hurst and Venge (1414) found abnormally elevat-ed levels of ECP in the middle ear fluid in 87% ofpatients with OME. In addition to IgE mediated mechanism, IgG was found to dominate acute otitis media with effusion, whereas IgAtends to be present in chronic but not in acute OME(1406). Bikhazi and Ryan (1415) have demonstrated, inboth patients and experimental animals, that in chronicOME, IL-2+ and IL-4+ cells were less prevalent, but thatIL-5+ cells were numerous. These findings support amodel by which locally produced IL-2 and IL-4 augmentIgG production in acute OME, whereas IL-5 contributesto increased IgA production in chronic OME. 6-4-4-4- The relationship between food allergy and OME The relationship between food allergy and OME is not yet fully understood. It has been suggested that the foodimmune complexes, particularly with dairy products,may be an important factor, especially in the otitis-pronechild less than 2 years of age (1396). Nsouli et al. (1416) suggested that food allergy should be considered in allpaediatric patients with recurrent serous otitis media.However, it appears that food allergy is rarely associatedwith OME. 6-4-5- Conclusion Rhinitis and otitis media are both common health problems and they may appear together in a patient. Thepathogenic mechanisms of these diseases involve a spec-trum of multifactorial elements such as bacteria, virusesand allergens. Acute bacterial or viral rhinitis is oftenassociated with middle ear disease, particularly in youngchildren. Eustachian tube dysfunction, however, is themost common aetiology of otitis media. IgE-mediated allergic reactions are a very common cause of rhinitis, but represent only one aetiological fac-tor for otitis media. Although there is a relationshipbetween nasal allergic inflammation and otitis mediacaused by a dysfunction of the Eustachian tube, weshould take into consideration the fact that there exists adifference in peak prevalence between these two diseaseswith respect to age distribution. The middle ear mucosa itself is rarely a target tissue for allergic processes, although the biochemical media-tors released during nasal allergic reactions most likelyproduce Eustachian tube edema and inflammation. Overa long period, this chronic inflammatory response, alongwith viral or bacterial infection, may produce middle eareffusion. On the other hand, in some patients with OME,atopy may be responsible for the recurrence and mainte-nance of middle ear disease. S2087- Diagnosis and assessment of severity The tests and procedures listed below represent the spectrum of investigations, which may be used in thediagnosis of allergic rhinitis. However, only a number ofthese are routinely available or applicable to each indi-vidual patient (Table 8). 7-1- HISTORY Interviewing the patient with rhinitis is of importance in the diagnosis of rhinitis, co-morbidities and allergy.The interview begins with a thorough general medicalhistory and should be followed by questions more specif-ic to allergy including environmental and occupationalinformation. It is also common to gather information onpersonal and familial history of patients with allergic dis-ease. Nasal and pharyngeal pruritus, sneezing and associ-ated conjunctivitis are more common in withallergic rhinitis than in those with non-allergic rhinitis. 7-1-1- Symptoms of rhinitis and complications Clinical history is essential for an accurate diagnosis of rhinitis, assessment of severity and response to treatment.The patient should be allowed to give his/her account ofthe symptoms, followed by structured prompts/questions. Although this sub-division may be too simple, patients with rhinitis are usually divided into \"sneezers and run-ners\" and \"blockers \"(Table 9). Those with allergic rhini- tis are more commonly found in the \"sneezer and runner\"group (1). Rhinorrhea appears to be more common in sea-sonal allergic rhinitis whereas nasal obstruction is morecommon in perennial (1417). Always ask thepatient: \"what is your main symptom?\" This will oftenhighlight the key problem and necessary treatment. Sneezing and a blocked or runny nose, secondary to allergic rhinitis, are more intense during the morning inapproximately 70% of sufferers (1418, 1419). History should take into account some associated symptoms common in patients with rhinitis. They include: loss of smell (hyposmia or anosmia) (1420-1422), snoring, sleep problems (1423-1426), post nasal drip or chronic cough (1427, 1428), in par- ticular if sinusitis is present, sedation, which may be caused by rhinitis (1429), questions on asthma and conjunctivitis (see chapter 7-3). 7-1-2- Other historical background The history includes a full-length questionnaire: The frequency, severity, duration, persistence or inter- mittence and seasonality of symptoms should bedetermined. It is important to assess their impact on the patients' quality of life in terms of impairment of school/workperformance, interference with leisure activities andany sleep disturbances. Potential allergic triggers should be documented including exposure in the home, workplace andschool. Any hobbies which may provoke symptomsshould also be noted. Patients with inhalant allergiesmay exhibit cross-reactivity with certain foods (seechapter 3-1-5). Patients rhinitis, whatever the cause, may devel- \"nasal hyperreactivity\" with symptoms followingexposure to irritants (strong tobacco smoke, perfumes, deodorants, etc.) (seechapters and 4-7). The typical features of allergicversus non-allergic (irritant) induced triggers may dif-fer. However, these are frequently not clear-cut sincein persistent rhinitis, chronic symptoms may be pres-ent without a clear relation to allergen exposure beingapparent.TABLE 8: Diagnostic tests for allergic rhinitis Routine tests HistoryGeneral ENT examinationAllergy tests - skin ciliary and the ARIA Workshop Group S209 An occupational history should be obtained (see chap- ter 3-1-6). Symptoms may occur at work or in theevening following work, with improvement during theweekends and holidays. The effects of previous allergen avoidance measures should be noted, bearing in mind that up to 3-6 monthsof vigorous cleaning may be needed to eradicatemites, cat dander and other relevant allergens from thehome (see chapter 8-1). Similarly, the response to pharmacological treatment and previous immunotherapy should be recorded interms of improvement and side effects. Compliance with treatment and patients' fears about treatment should be explored, particularly if theresponse to treatment has been below that expected. A diagnostic approach is summarised as follows. In the majority of patients, a careful study of history, anexamination and a limited number of skin tests is all thatis required to confirm/exclude an allergic aetiology andthe relevant allergen exposure. When there is discordancebetween history and skin prick tests, further tests includ-ing provocation tests or a therapeutic trial of allergenavoidance may be indicated. 7-2- EXAMINATION OF THE NOSE 7-2-1- Methods In patients with mild intermittent allergic rhinitis, a nasal examination is optimal. All patients with persistentallergic rhinitis need to undergo a nasal examination. Nasal examination should describe: the anatomical situation in the nose (e.g. the septum, the size of the inferior turbinate and if possible thestructures in the middle meatus), the colour of the mucosa, the amount and aspect of the mucus. Anterior rhinoscopy, using a speculum and mirror, gives information which is sometimes limited, but itremains an appropriate method for studying the majormodifications observed in most cases of allergic rhinitis. Nasal endoscopy can find nasal and sinus pathology that might easily be missed with routine speculum andnasopharyngeal examination (1430). ENT examination inthe clinic is now considerably facilitated by the use of rigidHopkins rods or flexible fibre-optic endoscopes (1431).The administration of intranasal anaesthesia is recom-mended at initial assessment. Specific attention is paid toabnormality within the middle meatus and nasopharynx. 7-2-2- Findings In allergic rhinitis, there does not appear to be an increase in the number or severity of anatomic abnor-malities in comparison to normal subjects. In allergic rhinitis, during allergen exposure: Bilateral but not always symmetrical swelling can be observed. This is usually localised to the inferiorturbinate which appears oedematous, swollen and cov-ered with watery secretions. Eventually, the mucosa of the middle meatus may be seen and, more rarely, micropolyps or edema may beobserved in this area. Sometimes, these abnormalities are only localised in the posterior part of the inferior turbinate and requireexamination with an endoscope (1432). On the other hand, a major edema of the nasal mucosa (inferior turbinate) may make it impossible to studythe nose. With regard to colour, changes are frequently reported from the purplish mucosa to a more common palemucosa. An increase in vascularity is commonly seen. If there is no allergen exposure, the nasal mucosa may be totally normal. However, chronic edema and/or vis-cous secretions may occur in patients who have sufferedseveral years of rhinitis. 7-3- ALLERGY DIAGNOSIS 7-3-1- Methods The diagnosis of allergic rhinitis is based on the coor- dination between a typical history of allergic symptomsand diagnostic tests. IgE is the major isotype of anaphy-lactic antibodies, and although theoretically IgG 4can also be a reagin, its clinical importance is not significant.Thus in vivo and in vitro tests used in the diagnosis of allergic diseases are directed towards the detection offree or cell-bound IgE (figure 17). The diagnosis of aller-gy has been improved by allergen standardisation pro-viding satisfactory extracts for both in vivo and in vitro tests for most inhalant allergens.TABLE 9: Clinical differences between rhinitis patients \"sneezers and runners\" \"blockers\" - sneezing - little or no sneezing- watery mucus (running nose) - thick nasal mucus (+ posterior) rhinorrhea - nasal blockage often severe- diurnal rhythm (worse during day and improving during night) - constant day and night but may be worse at night- often associated conjunctivitisS210 Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL NOVEMBER 2001 FIGURE 17: Diagnosis of IgE-mediated allergy. 7-3-1-2- Skin tests Immediate hypersensitivity skin tests are widely used to demonstrate an IgE-mediated allergic reaction of theskin and represent a major diagnostic tool in the field ofallergy. If properly performed, they yield useful confir-matory evidence for a diagnosis of specific allergy. Asthere are many complexities for their performance andinterpretation, it is recommended that they should be car-ried out by trained health professionals (1433). Delayedhypersensitivity tests provide little information. 7-3-1-2-1- Methods - Skin testing methods Several methods of skin testing are available.Scr atch tests should not be used any longer because of poor reproducibility and possible systemic reactions. Prick and punctur e tests (SPT) are usually recommended for the diagnosis of imme- diate type allergy. There is a high degree of correlation between symp- toms and provocative challenges. The modified skin prick test introduced by Pepys (1434) is the current reference method although thevariability of this test has been shown to be greaterthan that of the intradermal test. Puncture tests with various devices (1435-1444) were introduced to decrease the variability of skin pricktests. Opinions concerning these so-called standard-ised methods vary according to the skill, experienceand preference of the investigator as well as the aimsof using skin tests. With a trained investigator, they arehighly reproducible (1442, 1445). Skin prick tests should be 2 cm apart. In some instances (e.g. weak allergen solution), intr a- dermal skin tests may be employed for allergy diagno- sis. Although they are more sensitive than prick tests, they may induce some false positive reactions, they correlate less well with symptoms (1446) and they are somewhat less safe to perform since sys- temic reactions can rarely occur (1447). Particularcare should be taken in patients treated with \u00df-block-ing agents which may increase the risk of systemicreactions. As a general rule, the starting dose of intracutaneous extract solutions in patients with a preceding negativeprick test should range between 100 and 1,000 folddilutions of the concentrated extract used for prick-puncture tests (1449). It does not seem that intradermal skin tests are required for the diagnosis of inhalant allergy whenstandardised extracts are available (1433, 1450, 1451). The European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology (1452) and the US Joint Council AllergyAsthma and Immunology (1449, 1453) therefore recom-mend skin prick-puncture tests as a major test for thediagnosis of IgE-mediated allergic diseases and forresearch purposes. - Negative and positi ve contr ol solutions Because of interpatient variability in cutaneous reactiv- ity, it is necessary to include negative and positive controlsin every skin test study. The negative control solutions arethe diluents used to preserve the allergen vaccines. Therare dermographic patient will give wheal-and-erythemareactions to the negative control. The negative control willalso detect traumatic reactivity induced by the skin testdevice (with a wheal which may approach a diameter of 3mm with some devices) and/or the technique of the tester(1449). Any reaction at the negative control test sites willhinder interpretation of the allergen sites (1449). Positive control solutions are used to: detect suppression by medications or disease, detect the exceptional patients who are poorly reactive to histamine, determine variations in technician performance. The usual positive control for prick-puncture testing is histamine dihydrochloride, used at a concentration of5.43 mmol/L (or equivalent to 1 mg/mL ofhistamine base) (1454). Wheal diameters with this prepa-ration range from 2 to 7 mm. However, a l0-fold greaterconcentration is more appropriate (1455), with a meanwheal size ranging between 5 and 8 mm. For the intra-dermal test, the concentration routinely used is 0.0543mmol/L. The mean wheal size elicited ranges from 10 to12 mm. Mast cell secretagogues such as codeine phos-phate 2.5% or 9% may also be used (1456). - Grading of skin tests and cr iteria of positi vity Skin tests should be read at the peak of their reaction by measuring (in mm) the wheal and the flare approxi-mately 15 minutes after the performance of the tests.Late-phase reactions are not recorded because their exactsignificance is not known (1449, 1452). Some scoringsystems have been proposed and may be used in dailypractice. In the US, for example, for skin prick tests: reaction, positive reaction) = 3-5 mm wheal abovesaline control plus an accompanying flare; 4+>5 mmwheal above saline control, plus an accompanying flare. For prick tests, when the control site is completely J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 108, NUMBER 5Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group S211 negative, small wheals of a mean diameter greater than or equal to 3 mm of the negative control represent a positiveimmunological response (1434, 1457), but these reac-tions do not imply the presence of a clinically relevantallergy (1433). 7-3-1-2-2- Factors affecting skin testingSkin reaction is dependent on a number of variables that may alter the performance of skin tests (Table 10). The quality of the aller gen extract(vaccine) is of importance. When possible, allergens that are stan-dardised by using biological methods and that arelabelled in biological units should be used (1449,1452) (see chapter 8-3-3). Recombinant allergens canalso be used accurately (1458). A g eis known to affect the size of skin tests (1459) but positive skin prick tests can be found early in infancy(1460, 1461). In old age, the size of skin tests isdecreased (1462). Seasonal v ariations related to specific IgE antibody synthesis have been demonstrated in pollen allergy(1463). The skin sensitivity increases after the pollenseason and then declines until the next season. Thiseffect has some importance in patients with a low sen-sitivity (1464) and/or in patients sensitised to allergenssuch as cypress pollen (403). D r ugsaffect skin tests and it is always necessary to ask patients about the drugs they have taken. Some drugs suchas astemizole (no longer available in many countries) candepress or abolish responses to skin tests for a period ofup to 6 weeks (Table 10) (for review see 1433, 1465).Patients with skin disease may not be tested because ofdermographism (urticaria) or widespread skin lesions. 7-3-1-2-3- Interpretation of skin tests Carefully performed and correctly interpreted, skin tests with high quality allergen vaccines and a batterythat includes all relevant allergens of the patient's geo-graphic area are a simple, painless and highly efficientmethod. Therefore, skin testing represents one of the pri-mary tools for allergy diagnosis by the trained physician. Both false-positive and false-negative skin tests may occur because of improper technique or material. False-positive skin tests may result from dermographism ormay be caused by \"irritant\" reactions or a non-specificenhancement from a nearby strong reaction (1466). False-negative skin tests can be caused by: extracts of poor initial potency or subsequent loss of potency (1446), drugs modulating the allergic reaction, diseases attenuating the skin response, a decreased reactivity of the skin in infants and elder- ly patients, improper technique (no or weak puncture). The use of positive control solutions may overcome some of the false-negative results because reactions willbe either decreased or abolished in patients with slightlyreactive skin. The occurrence of positive responses to skin tests does not necessarily imply that the patient's symptoms are dueto an IgE mediated allergy, since skin prick tests are pos-itive in 15-35% of symptom free individuals dependingon the allergen and the area (for review see 1433). Thepresence of positive skin tests in asymptomatic subjectsmay predict the onset of allergic symptoms (273, 1467),especially if the allergen load is high. The optimal cut-offvalues for clinically relevant skin prick test results havebeen reported for Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (1468, 1469) but more data are needed. 7-3-1-2-4- Clinical value of skin testsEven after false-positive and false-negative tests have been eliminated, the proper interpretation of resultsrequires a thorough knowledge of the history and physi-cal findings. A positive skin test alone does not confirma definite clinical reactivity to an allergen. W ith inhalant aller gens, skin test responses represent one of the first-line diagnostic methods and when theycorrelate with the clinical history, in vitro tests may not be required (1449, 1452). It has recently beenshown that, in general practice, common nasal aller-TABLE 10: Inhibitory effects of treatments on IgE- mediated allergic reactions Suppression Clinical Drugs Degree Duration significance H1-antihistamines astemizole* long term possible unlikelyintranasal 0 nointra-bronchial 0 notopical skin 0 to ++ yes theophylline 0 to + nochromones 0\u00df2-agonists inhaled 0 to + nosystemic 0 to ++ no dopamine + noclonidine ++specific 0 to ++ no immunotherapyS212 Bousquet and the Workshop Group J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL NOVEMBER 2001 gies can be diagnosed efficiently with the aid of sim- ple diagnostic criteria using either skin prick tests orserum specific IgE (RAST) (1470). F or foods , particular caution should be taken since very few extracts are standardised and results of skintests may be negative in truly allergic patients.Extracts made from fruits and vegetables are usuallyof poor quality since the allergens are rapidlydestroyed. Skin tests with fresh foods are more accu-rate (80, 1471). F or occupa tional rhinitis , skin tests are often unreli- able in detection except in the case of high molecularweight compounds such as latex or grain dust. 7-3-1-3- IgE The discovery of IgE in 1967 was a major advance in the understanding and diagnosis of allergic diseases(1472, 1473). 7-3-1-3-1- Serum total IgESerum or enzyme- immuno assays (1474-1478). In normal subjects, levels of IgE increase from birth (0-1 KU/l) to adolescence and then decrease slowly andreach a plateau after the age of 20-30 years. In adults,levels of over 100-150 KU/l are considered to be abovenormal. Allergic and parasitic diseases as well as manyother conditions (including racial factors) increase thelevels of total IgE in serum. Thus, the measurement oftotal serum IgE is barely predictive for allergy screeningin rhinitis and should no longer be used as a diagnostictool (2). 7-3-1-3-2- Serum specific IgEIn contrast to the low predictive value of total serum IgE measurements in the diagnosis of immediate typeallergy, the measurement of allergen-specific IgE inserum is of importance. - Methods The first technique used to accurately measure serum specific IgE was the RAST (radioallergosorbent test)(1479-1481). New (1482-1493).The different reagents are critical an appropriateassay (1494). Another technology is based upon sticksused as a matrix (1495). Results are expressed in terms oftotal radioactive counts bound (cpm), arbitrary units(RAST class, PRU/ml) or units of IgE (IU/ml, KU/l). - Factor s affecting the measur ement of ser um specif ic IgE Many factors can affect the measurement of IgE. The quality of reagents used (allergens, anti-IgE antibodies)is of importance. IgE antibody assays need to be sensitive and specific to make quantitative measurements over as wide arange as possible (1496). A high capacity solid phase provides a large excess of allergen that maximises the binding of IgE antibody(1494). The anti-IgE preparations applied must be Fc -specif- ic and are preferably combinations of monoclonalantibodies with specificities against more than oneepitope on the Fc fragment and with complementarydose-response characteristics (1494). Calibrators should be traceable to the WHO Interna- tional Reference Preparation for human IgE, 75/502(1494). As for skin tests, the quality of allergens is of critical importance and, when possible, only standardisedextracts should be used . Standardisation of the aller- gen source material in combination with adequatereagent design provides precise and reproducible dataincreasing the accuracy and efficiency of allergy diag-nostic testing (1485). However, using molecular biol-ogy, it is possible to obtain large quantities of majorallergens for many species. Recombinant Bet v I pro-duced in bacterial expression systems allows accuratein vitro diagnosis of birch pollen allergy in over 95% of birch pollen allergic patients (534). Other studieshave found similar values for recombinant allergens(1497). Thus, single recombinant allergen or a combi-nation of a few major recombinant allergens can sub-stitute the crude extract for in vitro diagnostic purpos- es (1498). Another possibility is to add some relevantrecombinant allergens to an allergen extract. It also seems that in vitro diagnostics for pollen aller- gy can be simplified using cross-reactivities. Currentdiagnostic extracts for grass pollen allergy are usuallycomposed of mixtures of pollen from different grassspecies. Their complex composition hampers accuratestandardisation. It was recently shown that the use ofone grass species is sufficient for the in vitro diagnosis of grass pollen allergy. Purified natural Lol p 1 and Lolp 5 detect over 90% of grass-positive patients. Around80% of the IgE response to grass pollen is directed tothese major allergens (1499). Reliable in vitro diagno- sis is possible with a single Betulaceae tree pollenextract (birch or alder). The same is true for purifiednatural Bet v 1, Bet v 2 (1500) and profilin. Specific IgE measurements are not influenced by drugs or skin diseases. - Signif icance of measur ement of ser um aller gen specif ic IgE Several studies have shown that with the use of standard- ised allergen vaccines, serum specific IgE results corre-late closely to those of skin tests and nasal challenges. As in skin tests, the presence or absence of specific IgE in the serum does not preclude symptoms, andsome symptom-free subjects have serum specific IgE. Although a low specific IgE titre may not be clinically relevant, the titre of serum specific IgE is usually unre-lated with symptoms. This is because the severity ofsymptoms depends not only on IgE antibodies but alsoon the releasability of mediators, the response of the tar-get organ to mediators and non-specific hypersensitivity. When using single allergen tests, the cost of serum specific IgE measurement is high and only a selectedlist of allergens can usually be tested.7-3-1-3-3- Screening tests using serum specific IgESome methods use either a mixture of several aller- gens in a single assay (1501-1504) or CLIN IMMUNOL 5Bousquet and the Workshop Group S213 ent allergens during a single assay. These tests can there- fore be used by specialised doctors and non-allergists asscreening tests for the diagnosis of allergic diseases. The clinical relevance of these tests has been extensive- ly studied and it has been shown that their efficiency(specificity and sensitivity) in allergy diagnosis is oftenover 85% (1501). However, using these tests ,the patient is defined only as allergic or non-allergic and more extensiveinvestigations for rhinitis are needed if the test is positive. 7-3-1-4- Other tests7-3-1-4-1- IgG and IgG 4 The measurement of allergen-specific IgG or IgG4 antibodies in serum has no value in the diagnosis of aller-gic rhinitis. 7-3-1-4-2- Peripheral blood activation markersBlood basophils of degranulate and release mediators and CysLT) mediators (e.g.histamine release or CysLT release) the microscopicexamination of cells (e.g. basophil degranulation test) canbe performed. In the early 1980s, the basophil degranula-tion test was proposed but never fully validated (1505,1506). New basophil activation tests are based In thistest, CD63 or CD45 are measured using cytofluorimetry.These tests may be of interest in some difficult cases suchas cypress pollen allergy (1510) but they require sophisti-cated equipment (cytofluorimetry) and further evaluation. New tests based on CysLT release after allergen chal- lenge may be interesting if they correlate closely with theclinical sensitivity of the patients, but further studies arerequired (1511-1513). 7-3-1-4-3- Nasal specific IgEIt has been proposed that some patients may have a local IgE immune response without any systemic releaseof IgE (1514), e.g. negative skin tests and serum specificIgE. Based on current data, the concept of local allergicreaction in the nose without systemic IgE release is notsupported (1515) and the measurement of IgE in nasalsecretions cannot be routinely proposed (1516, 1517). 7-3-1-4-4- Mediators released during allergic reactions The measurement of mediators released in peripheral blood, nasal secretions or urine during allergic reactionwas made possible by the development of highly specif-ic and sensitive immunoassays for the titration of hista-mine, PGD 2, CysLTs, kinins and ECP. Mediators can be measured at baseline or after allergen challenge and pro-vide important research tools, but do not apply to the rou-tine diagnosis of allergy. Nasal microsuction has beenused by several investigators (1172, 1518, 1519). Themajor advantage of this technique is that it permits aquantitative measurement of the mediators in nasal secre-tions. It is possible to obtain nasal with pre-cise and minimally diluted volume. 7-3-1-4-5- Cytology and histologyTechniques for obtaining specimens include blown secretions, scraping, lavage and biopsy. Proper assess-ment of these specimens by trained personnel is required.The use of nasal cytology to evaluate the cell pattern maybe attempted but clinical interest is usually weak (1520).However, nasal cytology to evaluate mucosal cellularpatterns can be valuable in (1521): distinguishing inflammatory from non-inflammatory rhinopathies, distinguishing between allergic, non-allergic and infectious rhinitis, distinguishing between viral and bacterial infections, following the course of rhinitis and following the response to treatment. Morphological changes in the nasal mucosa may reflect reactions that are also occurring in other areasof the airway. 7-3-1-4-6- Measurement of nitric oxide in exhaled air Measures of the concentration of NO in nasal air usual- ly reveal higher mean levels in patients with allergic rhini-tis as compared to those without rhinitis and also possiblyto those with non-allergic rhinitis. However, substantialoverlap exists between groups (1522) and the measure-ment of NO cannot be used as a diagnostic measure forallergic rhinitis (see chapter 4-3-2). Nitric oxide levels arelow where there is severe nasal obstruction such as polyps. In primary ciliary dyskinesia, very low levels of NO are seen - this may prove to be of diagnostic help. 7-3-1-5- Nasal challengeNasal challenge tests are used in research and to a less- er extent in clinical practice. They are however importantin the diagnosis of occupational rhinitis. Recommendation on and critical analysis of nasal provocations and methods to measure the effects of suchtests have already been published (1523, 1524) (Table11). Recently, a subcommittee of the \"InternationalCommittee on Objective Assessment of the Nasal Air-ways\" has put forward guidelines for nasal provocationtests concerning indications, techniques and evaluationof the tests (1525). 7-3-1-5-1- Nasal challenge with allergenDifferent methods for the provocation and measure- ment of nasal responses have been used in recent years.Each technique has its own advantages and restrictions.For clinical purposes, techniques for qualitative measure-ments may be appropriate, but for experimental research,quantitative measurements with high reproducibility areessential (1526) (Table 12) . Provoking agent Allergens are usually given as an aqueous solution, but although the solution is easy to administer into nos-trils, this form of challenge has many defects: Allergen extracts (vaccines) are not always standard- ised. Only standardised allergen vaccines should beused when available. Allergen vaccines may not represent the native aller- gen and the amount of allergen insufflated is fargreater than that entering the nose during natural aller-gen exposure.S214 Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL NOVEMBER 2001 The potency of an aqueous extract often decreases rapidly and it is advised, at least for research projects,to use standardised and lyophilised extracts of thesame batch freshly reconstituted on the day of the test. Preservatives such as glycerol, benzalkonium chloride or phenol can induce non-specific nasal reactions. Temperature, pH and osmolarity of the solution should be checked carefully. Allergens can also be administered in the form of a powder (1527), as a solution adsorbed on a paper disk orin the form of pollen grains mixed with lactose in cap-sules (642, 711). 7-3-1-5-1-2- Deposition in the nose Aqueous allergen vaccines can be delivered from atomisers and an exact dose can be applied. Other inves-tigators use a pipette and allergens are deposited underrhinoscopy. When using any of these methods, careshould be taken to avoid non-specific responses, and forall experiments, the diluent of the allergen extract mustbe administered before the allergen, to test for the non-specific response. Small paper disks can be directlyapplied to the nostrils and allergen powders or pollengrains can be insufflated easily with Spinhalers orderived devices. Other methods are of interest. In the Vienna Challenge Chamber (1528, 1529) or the environmental exposure unit(1530-1533), patients are challenged under controlled con-ditions with purified airborne grass pollen. However, theseconditions are only used for large clinical trials and haveno value in the diagnosis of allergic rhinitis. 7-3-1-5-1-3- Assessment of the response Different methods have been used to assess the response to allergen. None of these are fully acceptedby all investigators. Symptoms produced after a challenge can be recorded. Sneezing, rhinorrhea and nasal blockage are easy toassess and yield valuable information. However,patients can react with different symptoms on differenttest days and it is preferable to use a combination ofsymptoms (711). The importance of nasal obstruction is one of the car- dinal symptoms in allergic rhinitis and the majorsymptom of the late-phase reaction following allergenchallenge. The objective measurement of this symp-tom is therefore of the greatest importance (1534).However, physiological fluctuations in nasal resis-tance may interfere with nasal monitoring in the nasalprovocation test (1535). Several committees were formed for the objective assessment of the nasal airway and of advocated rhino-manometry as a reliable method measuring nasalobstruction (1523, 1536, now, rhinomanometr yis the best evaluated and standardised technique. Active anterior rhinomanome-try was recommended by an international committeein 1984 (1523). With active anterior rhinomanometry,unilateral measurements can be done, this in contrastto active posterior rhinomanometry. Passive anteriorrhinomanometry was introduced by Clement et al. in 1981 (1538) as a suitable technique for measuringnasal resistance after nasal challenge, but it is moredifficult to use than anterior rhinomanometry. Acoustic rhinometr y(1539-1541), characterised challenge tests 1- Allergen provocations: When discrepancies between history of allergic rhinitis and tests or between tests are present (e.g. in cases ofdiagnostic doubt). For diagnosis of occupational allergic rhinitis. Before immunotherapy for allergic rhinitis. Although it is still not very common to use nasal provocation beforestarting immunotherapy, it has been considered that alaborious long-lasting therapy is justified by a properdiagnosis. This holds true particularly in the case ofperennial allergic rhinitis. For research. 2- Lysine-aspirin: Nasal provocation is recommended as a substitute for oral provocation in aspirin intolerance.Whenever such a nasal provocation is negative, an oraltest is still required. 3- To test non-specific hyperreactivity: Nasal provocation with non-specific stimuli (histamine,methacholine, cold dry air, etc.) is not relevant for daily clinical practice and diagnosis but can be used in research. Data from (1525) TABLE 12: Recommendations for the performance of nasal challenge tests 1- Provoking agent use solutions at room temperature standardised extracts isotonic solutions buffered to a pH of about 7 use control solutions 2- Deposition into the nose meter-dose pump spray paper disks 3- Assessment of the nasal response: symptom scores are combined with objective measures counting sneezes or attacks of sneezes measuring volume or weight of nasal secretion changes of nasal patency, airflow plethysmography oscillometry Data 5Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group S215 low coefficient of variation, has been used in nasal challenge tests with bradykinin, histamine and aller-gen. However, acoustic rhinometry does have limita-tions and pitfalls. The value of acoustic rhinometry toevaluate nasal responses after provocation in routineclinical work is not yet established. Rhinoster eometr y(1542) can be used to record changes in the thickness of the nasal mucosa. With amicroscope, 0.2 mm changes in the thickness of thenasal mucosa can be recorded in test subjects fixed tothe apparatus using an individually made plastic splintadapted to the teeth. Rhinostereometry is however atime-consuming method. It seems useful for compar-isons between well-defined groups of subjects andpatients and between the same subjects or patients atdifferent occasions. It may be combined with laserDoppler flowmetry (1543). Nasal peak f peak expiratory (rate),especially the former, may be recommended for thelong-term control of pharmacological or immunologi-cal treatment of different types of rhinitis. Other methods such as rhinoster eometr y and w hole body pleth ysmo graphyhave been proposed (1549) but they are not yet fully assessed. Comparisons between methods are also available. In order to find the most sensitive method, assessments weremade by means of symptom score, acoustic rhinometry,nasal peak expiratory inspiratory flow (NPEF andNPIF) and rhinomanometry There was no difference in the mucosal reactivitybetween patients and controls regardless of the methodused, but NPIF and NPEF were more sensitive to mucos-al changes than the other methods studied (1551). Com-pared to rhinomanometry by body plethysmography(1552), acoustic rhinometry is less complicated, morequickly performed and more comfortable for subjects. 7-3-1-5-1-4- Measurement of mediators and cells during challenge Allergen-specific nasal challenge is a valid and reli- able tool for studying the pathophysiological mecha-nisms involved in allergic inflammation. Nasal challengeinduces an immediate and late clinical response in aller-gic subjects with the release of pro-inflammatory media-tors which may be studied (see chapters 4-5-1 and 4-5-2). Nasal biopsies may also be obtained (see chapters 4-5-1 and 4-5-2). They have been used in many drug trials (1553). 7-3-1-5-1-5- Factors affecting nasal challenge As in other in vivo tests, the major factors affecting nasal challenges are the quality of the allergens used aswell as the drugs taken by the patient. Moreover, otherfactors are more specific to nasal challenge, includingtechnical problems already discussed and inflammationof the nasal mucosa. Sodium cromoglycate and usual anti-H1-histamines should be withdrawn 48 hours before the test, nasalbeclomethasone 3 to 6 days before, ketotifen andimipramines 2 weeks before and astemizole at least 1month before. Nasal vasoconstrictors may not modifynasal challenges. Specific immunotherapy thesensitivity of the nose to allergens. The nasal mucosa may be altered by several factors and the response to allergen may be largely affected. It has been shown that an allergic reaction significant- ly increases the reactivity of the nose because of thepriming effect initially described by Connell (1150). Viral infections induce the release of histamine, mediators and cytokines in nasal secre-tions (1220). Nasal challenges should thus be performedat least 2 to 4 weeks after any allergic or infectiousepisode. Finally, the nasal cycle (647) should be taken into con- sideration when rhinomanometry is used. 7-3-1-5-2- Nasal challenge with non-specific agents Non-specific nasal hyperreactivity is commonly observed in patients with allergic rhinitis (869, 1198)(see chapter 4-7). Challenges with methacholine or hist-amine have been widely carried out. Methacholine andhistamine both induce a dose-dependent increase insecretion weights on the challenge site, whereas hista-mine alone induced a contra lateral reflex. Repeatedstimulation with histamine, but not methacholine, result-ed in tachyphylaxis (1554). 7-3-1-5-3- Challenge with occupational agentsThe diagnosis of occupational rhinitis is often com- plex and requires nasal provocation tests with the rele-vant occupational agent (1555-1557). The challenge canbe carried out in the form of natural exposure, especiallyif the relevant allergen is unavailable. As an example, thishas been done for laboratory animal allergy in a vivariumduring cage cleaning (high-allergen challenge), quiet sit-ting (low-allergen rhinitis and asthmaWhile might raise suspicion of aspirin-induced rhinitis and asthma, the diagnosis canbe established with certainty only by aspirin challenge.There are three types of provocation tests, depending onthe route of administration:O r al challeng e (1247, 1559). Oral challenge tests are most commonly performed. They consist of theadministration of increasing doses of aspirin (the start-ing dose is 1-20 mg) and placebo, according to a sin-gle-blind procedure. Careful monitoring of clinicalsymptoms, pulmonary function tests and parametersreflecting nasal patency for 6 hours after administra-tion of the drug. The reaction is considered positive ifa decrease in FEV 1>15-20% of baseline occurs (PD15FEV 1,P D 20FEV 1), accompanied by symp- toms of asthma, rhinitis and/or conjunctivitis. In mostpatients, the threshold dose evoking positive reactionsvaries between 40 and 100 mg of aspirin. Adversesymptoms are relieved by inhalation of a \u00df2-agonist. Ifnecessary, a glucocorticosteroid can be administered.Since severe reactions may occur, oral aspirin chal-S216 Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL NOVEMBER 2001 lenge should be performed in a setting where emer- gency medical treatment is readily accessible. Inhaled c halleng e(1560). In inhalation challenge tests, nebulised aspirin (1561) or aspirin(1560, 1562) have been used. The increase in L-lysineaspirin dosage is achieved every 30-45 minutes andthe test can be completed in one morning. It is there-fore faster than oral challenge which often takes 2-3days, but the symptoms provoked are usually restrict-ed to the bronchopulmonary tract, and not all patientswith aspirin-induced react to L-lysine aspirin. Nasal c halleng e(1563). Nasal provocation testing is an attractive research model and may also be used as a diag-nostic procedure on an out-patient basis in patients withunstable asthma. A simple, safe and quick test for thediagnosis of aspirin-induced asthma has been described(1563). It may be a method of choice to confirm intoler-ance to aspirin manifested only by symptoms from theupper respiratory tract. Negative results do not excludepossible intolerance to aspirin. Patients suspected of theintolerance, with negative nasal tests, should undergobronchial or oral challenge tests with aspirin. Aspirin intolerance is usually long-lasting and although the threshold dose inducing a positive challengemay vary with time in individual patients, there is usual-ly no need to perform serial aspirin challenges when thediagnosis is made. 7-3-2- Interpretation of tests and recommendations 7-3-2-1- Correlation between tests Skin tests represent the primary diagnostic tools used for immediate-type hypersensitivity. Comparisons between themeasurement of specific IgE and skin tests depend on thequality and standardisation of the allergens used in bothtypes of tests and, to a lesser extent, on the method of skintesting used. The worst correlations have been obtainedwith house dust, mould, food extracts and unstandardiseddander extracts. There are good correlations between astrongly positive response to a skin test and the detection ofserum specific IgE and between a negative response to aprick test and the lack of detection of serum specific IgE,whereas small wheals induced by prick tests and positiveresults of intradermal tests with concentrated extracts areless frequently associated with the detection of serum spe-cific IgE (113). Positive responses to skin tests and serum-specific IgE can be found in totally symptom-free subjectswith a similar prevalence. Correlations between responses to skin tests and serum specific IgE with nasal challenges are less consis-tent because of the non-specific hyperreactivity. Poorcorrelations are observed with unstandardised extracts,weak positive responses to skin tests and serum specificIgE results or when there is a discrepancy between theclinical history and skin tests. There is usually a lack of correlation between titres of serum allergen-specific IgE and symptoms in untreatedpatients with seasonal allergic rhinitis (1564).7-3-2-2- Diagnosis of inhalant allergyThe diagnosis of allergy is based on the correlation between the clinical history and diagnostic tests for allergy.It is not possible to diagnose allergy based solely onresponses to skin tests, in vitro tests or even challenges. For these reasons, patients may benefit more from skin testingby specially trained health professionals. In some countries,general practitioners perform skin prick tests. Studies inHolland and the UK found that common nasal allergies canbe diagnosed with a very high certainty using simple diag-nostic criteria (1470, 1565). Factors affecting tests shouldalways be checked before investigations since drug therapymay modify results of in vivo tests for days or even weeks. 7-3-2-3- Diagnosis of food allergyFood allergy is rarely the cause of isolated rhinitis symptoms. While allergic reactions to foods are usuallydue to IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reactions, a numberof immune mechanisms may contribute to adverse reac-tions to foods that have an immunological basis. Tests forIgE antibodies include both skin prick tests and the mea-surement of serum allergen-specific IgE antibodies. Thediagnosis of food allergy is compounded, however,because allergen vaccines and test reagents currently avail-able are not standardised and their stability is poorly deter-mined (1566). The presence of food-specific IgE in serumor a positive skin test to a foodstuff does not always corre-late with a food allergy since many patients outgrow theirallergy with age (1567, 1568) and not all patients withfood-specific IgE have a clinical sensitivity. In manyinstances, the diagnosis has to be confirmed by a double-blind food challenge that should be carried out under pre-cisely specified conditions (1569, 1570) and by trainedstaff who have the competence to manage anaphylacticreactions. As for other forms of allergy, unproven and con-troversial techniques such as cytotoxic tests, VEGA testingor sublingual provocation tests have no proven value. 7-3-2-4- Diagnosis of occupational allergyOccupational rhinitis must be more precisely con- firmed than allergic rhinitis of other aetiology. In practice(1571), interviews concerning the causal relation, fre-quency, latent period and atopic disposition often providesuggestions but sometimes give unreliable evidence forthe basis by which to diagnose occupational nasal aller-gy. Therefore, examinations such as skin tests, nasalprovocation tests (1555-1557) and determination of theIgE antibody level are necessary to confirm the causalitybetween the disease and the work exposure (1572). 7-4- OTHER ENT DIAGNOSIS 7-4-1- Bacteriology Routine swabs taken blindly from the nose and nostril are not diagnostically helpful. This may not be the case ifthe swabs are taken endoscopically. 7-4-2- Imaging 7-4-2-1- Plain sinus radiographs Plain sinus radiographs are not indicated in the diag- nosis of allergic rhinitis or sinusitis. J (CT) CT has become the principal radiological investigation for major sino-nasal disorder but is of limited use in thediagnosis of allergic rhinitis (1320, 1573). CT scans canbe carried out after receiving specialist advice: to eliminate other conditions (1574, 1575), to exclude chronic sinusitis, to eliminate complications from rhinitis, in patients who do not respond to treatment, in patients with unilateral rhinitis. 7-4-2-3- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) Magnetic resonance imaging (1576) is rarely indicat- ed as a diagnostic tool. However, there are circumstanceswhere MRI is useful, in particular in fungal sinusitis. 7-4-3- Mucociliary function Tests for mucociliary clearance (1577) or ciliary beat frequency (1578) have little relevance in the diagnosis ofallergic rhinitis, but are relevant in the differential diag-nosis of chronic rhinorrhea in children. 7-4-4- Nasal peak (seechapter 7-1-1-5-1-3). Olfaction Although olfaction is often impaired in allergic rhini- tis and methods for assessing olfaction are available(1579), these are not generally used for the diagnosis ofallergic rhinitis. 7-5- DIAGNOSIS OF ASTHMA The diagnosis of asthma may be difficult due to the tran- sient nature of the disease and the reversibility of the airflowobstruction spontaneously or after treatment. Key indicatorsfor diagnosing asthma are presented in Table 13 (36). 7-5-1- History and measurement of symptoms The diagnosis of asthma is largely made on the basis of a history of paroxysmal attacks of breathlessness com-monly associated with a tightness of the chest and wheez-ing. These are worse particularly at night and in the earlyhours of the morning. However, in themselves, these com-mon symptoms are not diagnostic. Table 14 highlightsquestions for considering a diagnosis of asthma. What is important is a history of recurrent exacerba- tions (or attacks) often provoked by factors such as aller-gens, irritants, exercise and virus infections. Under somecircumstances, especially in patients with very respon-sive airways, asthma triggers may produce profoundbronchoconstriction that rapidly gives rise to a life-threatening exacerbation. Other useful clinical markers of asthma are the relief of symptoms either spontaneously or more specifically bymeans of a bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory treatment. The seasonal variability of symptoms and a positive family history of asthma and atopic disease are also help-ful diagnostic guides. Symptom measures have been used for epidemiologi- cal studies or clinical trials and are reviewed by O'Con-nor and Weiss (1580).TABLE 13: Key Indicators for Diagnosing Asthma* Consider asthma if any of the indicators are present: Wheezing - high-pitched whistling sounds when breathing out - especially in children. (A normal chest examinationdoes not exclude asthma.) History of any of the following: - Cough, worse particularly at night - Recurrent wheezing - Recurrent difficult breathing - Recurrent chest tightness. Note:Eczema, hay fever or a family history of asthma or atopicdiseases are often associated with asthma, but they are notkey indicators. Symptoms occur or worsen at night, awakening the patient. Symptoms occur or worsen in the presence of: - Exercise - Viral infection (common cold)- Animals with fur - Domestic dust mites (in mattresses, pillows, upholsteredfurniture, carpets) - Smoke (tobacco, wood) - Pollen - Changes in temperature - Strong emotional expression (laughing or crying hard) - Aerosol chemicals - Drugs (aspirin, beta blockers). Reversible and variable airflow limitation as measured by using a peak expiratory flow (PEF) meter or FEV 1in any of ways:- PEF or FEV 1increases more than 12% 15 to 20 minutes after inhalation of a short-acting \u00df2-agonist, or - PEF or FEV 1varies more than 20% from morning mea- surement upon arising to measurement 12 hours later inpatients taking a bronchodilator (more than 10% in patientswho are not taking a bronchodilator), or - PEF or FEV1 decreases more than 15 % after 6 minutes of running or exercise. * Pocket guide for asthma management and prevention, based on data from (36) TABLE 14: Questions to Consider in the Diagnosis of Asthma Has the patient had an attack or recurrent attacks of wheez- ing? Does the patient have a troublesome cough at night? Does the patient cough or wheeze after exercise? Does the patient cough, wheeze or experience chest tightness after exposure to airborne allergens or pollutants? From (36)S218 Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL NOVEMBER 2001 7-5-2- Physical examination Because asthma symptoms are variable throughout the day, the physical examination of the respiratory systemmay appear normal. Clinical signs of dyspnea, airflow limitation (wheezing which is an important symptom but is not pathognomon-ic of asthma) and hyperinflation are likely to be presentwhen patients are examined during symptomatic periods. Some patients may have a normal chest auscultation but a significant airflow obstruction when measuredobjectively. Conversely, wheezing may be absent in verysevere asthma exacerbations. 7-5-3- Measurement of lung function Patients with asthma frequently have difficulty in recognising their symptoms and a poor perception of theseverity (1581), especially if their condition is severe andlong-standing (1582). Assessment by physicians of symp-toms such as dyspnea and wheezing may also be inaccu-rate. The reversibility of airflow obstruction after inhala-tion of bronchodilators should therefore be measuredusing lung function tests (36). 7-5-3-1- Recording airflow obstruction A wide range of different methods to assess the level of airflow limitation exists, but two methodshave found widespread acceptance for patients over 5years of age (36): forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) (and its accompanying forced vital capacity - FVC) (1583, 1584), peak expiratory flow (PEF) (1585) which can be mea- sured serially (at home) over a period of several days(1586).Table 15 gives the advantages and drawbacks of these two methods. These two methods (FEV 1and PEF) involve a forced expiration from total lung capacity but they are not strictlyequivalent when expressed as a percentage of predicted val-ues (1587-1590). Moreover, FEV 1is more reproducible and is a more accurate estimate of airflow limitation. However,PEF is the only method which can be used for bi-daily mea-surements of lung function. Because diseases other thanthose causing airflow limitation may result in a reducedFEV 1, a useful assessment of airflow limitation can be obtained as the ratio of FEV1to FVC. In healthy adults, this ratio is usually over 75% and in healthy children over 85%. 7-5-3-2- Assessing the reversibility of airflow obstruction The reversible airflow obstruction of asthma needs to be distinguished from the irreversible obstruction ofchronic bronchitis and emphysema (1591). It is usuallycarried out using inhaled \u00df2-agonists, and responses tobronchodilators are easy to assess (1592). An improve-ment of the FEV 1of over 12% from baseline and 200 ml of absolute value after inhalation of a short acting bron-chodilator is considered to be significant (1593). How-ever, in some asthmatics, vigorous treatment (includinga trial of oral glucocorticosteroids) may be needed toappreciate the reversibility of airflow obstruction(1594). It should be remembered that some patients withCOPD may have reversible airflow obstruction duringglucocorticosteroid treatment (1595). 7-5-3-3- Assessing the diurnal variation of airflow obstruction A characteristic feature of asthma is a cyclical variation in the degree of airflow obstruction throughout the day. Thelowest PEF occurs in the morning. Many asthmatics usual-ly show a difference of at least 15% between morning andevening PEF (diurnal variability). that diurnal variability of the PEFR(1596) should be calculated when diagnosing asthma andassessing its severity (36, 1597). A diurnal variability inPEF of more than 20% is diagnostic of asthma (36, 1597).Diurnal variability of PEF has been used as a marker of air-TABLE 15: Advantages, disadvantages and applicable setting for pulmonary function tests to measure asthma out- comes Table available in print onlyJ ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 108, NUMBER 5Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group S219 way responsiveness, particularly in studies (1598-1600), and as an outcome measure in clinical asthma trials (1601).However, there are problems associated with its use (1602). 7-5-3-4- Non-specific challenge testingAirway responsiveness to methacholine, other non- sensitising stimuli or exercise may be used clinically toaid in the initial diagnosis of asthma, especially if base-line spirometry is normal and no reversibility can bedemonstrated (1584). The methods for performing thesetests are standardised but differences exist between coun-tries (1603). However, asthma is not the only diseasewith non-specific bronchial hyperreactivity, and patientswith allergic an increased non-specific bronchial chapter or methacholine have been suggested (1604). 7-5-4- Special considerations in difficult groups Young children whose primary symptom is a cough or who wheeze with respiratory infections are often mis-diagnosed as having bronchitis or pneumonia (includ-ing acute respiratory infection) and thus ineffectivelytreated with antibiotics or cough suppressants. Treat-ment with asthma medication can be beneficial anddiagnostic. Many infants and young children who wheeze with viral respiratory infections may not develop asthmathat persists through childhood (1605). However, theymay benefit from asthma medication for their wheez-ing episodes. There is no certain way to predict whichchildren will have persistent asthma, but allergy, afamily history of allergy or asthma and perinatal expo-sure to passive smoke and allergens are more stronglyassociated with continuing asthma. Asthma should be considered if the patient's colds repeatedly \"go to the chest\" or take more than 10 daysto clear up, or if the patient improves when asthmamedication is given. Tobacco smokers and elderly patients who suffer from COPD frequently have symptoms similar to asthma.Yet they may also have concurrent asthma and thusbenefit from treatment. Improvement in PEF afterasthma treatment is of importance for the diagnosis ofasthma. Subjects who are exposed to inhalant chemicals or allergens in the workplace can develop asthma andmay be misdiagnosed as having chronic bronchitis orchronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Early recogni-tion (PEF measurements at work and home), strictavoidance of further exposure and early treatment areessential. Asthma attacks may be difficult to diagnose. For exam-ple, acute shortness of breath, chest tightness andwheezing can also be caused by croup, bronchitis, heartfailure and vocal chord dysfunction. Using spirometry,establishing the reversibility of symptoms with a bron-chodilator and assessing the history of the attack (e.g.whether it was related to exposures that commonlymake asthma worse) aid the diagnosis. A chest x-raycan help rule out infection, large airway lesions, con-gestive heart failure or aspiration of a foreign object. 7-6- ASSESSMENT OF SEVERITY OF RHINITIS For asthma, there are objective measures of severity such as pulmonary function tests and well-defined crite-ria for symptom severity (36). For atopic dermatitis,there are clinical scores of severity such as SCORAD(1606). However, for rhinitis, there is no accepted mea-sure of nasal obstruction. The nasal inspiratory peak flow(NIPF) has been extensively studied but results are notconsistent among the different studies (1544-1548).Moreover, the correlation between the objective mea-surement of nasal resistance and subjective reports ofnasal airflow sensation is usually poor. Visual analogue scales are often used to assess the severity of diseases with a subjective involvement such aspain (1607, 1608). They have been used to establish aneffective treatment in patients with rhinitis (1609-1611).Over the past few decades, there has been some contro-versy over the relationship between subjective assessmentand objective measurement of nasal airway obstruction.V AS measurements generally followed trends in nasal air-way resistance either after challenge with histamine(1612) or capasaicin (1613) or during treatment with anasal vasoconstrictor (1610, 1611). However, the studiesdiffer in some respect. V AS results and rhinomanometrycorrelated better when unilateral nasal obstruction wasevaluated compared to total nasal evaluation. When rhino-manometric data were divided into four clinically relevantgrades of obstruction (very patent, normal, obstructed andvery obstructed) and the quartiles of the V AS results werecompared to these, the agreement was good or fairly goodin 75-85% of the cases (1614). In another study (1615), thepatient's own overall rating registered on a visual analoguescale was compared with a summed symptom score calcu-lated from ratings of sneezing, rhinorrhea and congestion.A significant correlation, but not complete correspon-dence, was found in patients with untreated rhinitis duringthe birch pollen season and after challenges with birchpollen or histamine. Comparisons between the overall rat-ing and scores for individual symptoms gave lowerdegrees of correlation or non-significant correlations. Inchildren, V AS with anterior nasal (1616).S2208- Management The management of allergic rhinitis includes allergen avoidance, medication (pharmacological treatment),immunotherapy and education. Surgery may be used asan adjunctive intervention. It is recommended to propose a strategy combining the treatment of both the upper and lower airway diseasein terms of efficacy and safety. 8-1- ALLERGEN AVOIDANCE A wide range of allergens have been associated with allergic rhinitis, of which house dust mite is clearly themost important and most investigated (1617, 1618). Moststudies have however dealt with asthma symptoms andvery few have studied rhinitis symptoms. The effectivenessof allergen avoidance in the treatment of asthma was firstsuggested by studies in which patients were removed fromtheir homes into the low house dust mite level of high dryaltitude (1619, 1620). However, the real challenge is to cre-ate a low allergen environment in patients' homes and,unfortunately, the majority of single interventions havefailed to achieve a sufficient reduction in allergen load tolead to a clinical improvement. Indeed, a meta-analysis ofappropriately controlled house mite avoidance trialssuggested that this approach was doomed to failure in thetreatment of asthma (1621), suggesting that a single inter-vention may be insufficient. However, this attempt at meta-analysis raised several problems (1622, 1623) and groupedany attempts at house dust mite avoidance together as ifthey were one treatment. As it is clear that some approach-es are far more efficacious than others, this was probablyan inappropriate methodology. If assessment was madeonly on trials which demonstrated a decrease in allergenload, then a different outcome may have become apparent.Certainly, virtually all asthma and rhinitis guidelines (1,36) now suggest that allergen avoidance, including housemites, should be an integral part of a management strategy. 8-1-1- House dust mites There have been several reviews on the effects of house mite avoidance in asthma (335, 1617). The single most effective strategy for mite reduction and control of the disease has involved bed-coveringsystems, which separate the mite and its allergen fromthe allergic individual. Provided the mattress, pillowand duvet are sealed in a mite allergen impermeableencasing, a reduction in allergen exposure can beachieved (1624) and this can be associated with animprovement in the condition (1625). However, thesemeasures achieve only modest improvements com-pared with those achieved by transporting sensitivesubjects to high altitudes allergen exposure isvirtually non-existent (1619, 1620). Mite allergen canaccumulate on blankets, and bed linen and blanketsshould be washed regularly (once a week) in hot water(over 55\u00b0C) to ensure the destruction of the mites(1626). The same effect may be obtained by dryinglaundry in the sun, but no data are available to supportthis assumption. Washing laundry in cold waterreduces allergen levels, but most mites survive (1627). Carpets are an important microhabitat for mite coloni- sation and a possible source of allergen from whichthe bed can be re-infested (1628). Ideally, the carpetshould be removed and replaced by vinyl or polishedwooden floor boards. If it is impossible to remove thecarpet, it can be completely covered by polyethylenesheeting, taped to the skirting board or replaced regu-larly, since mites grow better on old carpets (1629).Steam cleaning (1630), liquid nitrogen or acaricides(1631) may help to reduce mite numbers in carpets. Curtains should be washable at 55\u00b0C. Children's soft toys can be a potent source of domestic mite allergenand should either be removed, washed in hot water orfrozen once a week. Attempts to develop acaricide sprays which will both kill and denature allergens have demonstrated someeffect in reducing mite numbers and allergen levels(1632). The clinical efficacy has been equivocal inasthma and many studies showed no effect (1625). High efficiency particulate air (HEPA) vacuum clean- ers can reduce allergen load but again no trials havedemonstrated that this will improve symptoms (1633,1634). However, vacuum cleaners with inadequateexhaust filtration may increase airborne allergen lev-els during use (1635). High levels of humidity in the home are essential for mite population growth, and reducing humidity may bean effective control method. However, effective venti-lation systems have achieved clinical efficacy in coun-tries where the number of mites is usually low (1636),while no benefits were demonstrated in places with anelevated mite infestation (1637, 1638). Moreover, ithas been shown that ventilation systems can apprecia-bly reduce the allergen load but not sufficiently toreduce the symptoms of asthmatic children (1639). On the other hand, very few studies have been report- ed on allergen avoidance in rhinitis. Three studies haveevaluated the effect of acaricidal treatment with benzylbenzoate in perennial allergic rhinitis (1640-1642). Allreported symptomatic improvement. Two were uncon-trolled open studies while one was a double-blind, place-bo-controlled parallel design involving 20 patients andlasting 12 months. Treatment was applied for six monthsto mattresses, upholstery, soft toys and carpeting in allrooms and accompanied by a programme of intensivevacuuming. Rhinitis symptom scores were significantlyreduced in the active group compared to the control.However, when considering the physicians' evaluation oftreatment efficacy and the changes in medication, thereJ ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 108, NUMBER 5Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group S221 was no significant difference between the two groups over the study period (1641, 1643). There is one report ofbenefit in house dust mite sensitive perennial rhinitispatients with the introduction of house dust mite imper-meable, water-vapour permeable bedding covers for mat-tresses, duvets and pillows. This was assessed in a dou-ble-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial design,but is only available as an abstract. Avoidance measures ideally include (Table 16): It is likely that no single intervention will achieve suf- ficient benefits to be cost-effective. However, combinedstrategies in large groups of patients are urgentlyrequired (1644). 8-1-2- Cats and dogs Cat and dog allergy is also of major importance in many countries. The allergens are not the dander itselfbut are contained in the saliva and in sebaceous secre-tions, which can flake off in small particles and remainairborne for considerable periods of time. This results inan ubiquitous allergen that can be found in many envi-ronments outside the home (443), even in cat-free build-ings (1645) and schools (441, 442). It makes avoidancemuch more difficult, though there is little doubt in mostpeople's minds that avoidance in the home can achieveimprovement. The difficulty is that there are little pub-lished controlled study data to substantiate this assertionin the management of asthma. The only effective mea-sure for avoiding animal dander allergens in the home isto remove the pet (cat, dog) and to carefully vacuumclean all carpets, mattresses and upholstered furniture.Although frequent washing of cats reduces allergen(1646), clinical studies have not shown clear benefit fromthis procedure when carried out once a week (1647).There is only one trial of domestic pet removal/allergenavoidance in rhinitis. A placebo-controlled trial of aHEPA air cleaner in the treatment of cat allergy did notfind a significant effect on rhinitis (1648).Clearly there are a number of other domestic pets that have the potential to produce allergic reactions. However,probably because of their relatively restricted locationwithin homes, the effect of avoidance measures has notbeen tested. 8-1-3- Cockroaches Cockroach infestation is an important cause of allergic sensitisation, particularly in inner city sub-standard apart-ment complexes (504). Approaches to the elimination ofcockroaches are based on (i) eliminating suitable environ-ments (by restricting havens through caulking and sealingcracks in the plaster work and flooring, controlling dampand availability of food), (ii) restricting access (by sealingentry sources such as around paperwork and doors) and(iii) using chemical control (abamectin) and traps. Twostudies lasting between 8 and 12 months have shown thatcockroach extermination by professionals is feasible ininner-city homes but that standard house-cleaning proce-dures are only partially effective in removing residualallergen (1649, 1650). In apartment blocks, however, itmay be difficult to prevent re-infestation from neighbour-ing apartments. Moreover, there have been no studies to evaluate the effect of cockroach eradication on rhinitis. 8-1-4- Outdoor allergens Outdoor allergens, such as pollens and fungal spores, are difficult to avoid. Sometimes they will accumulateinside homes and it would seem prudent for suffererswith pollen allergy to seal their houses by day and toopen windows only at night when the pollen count is low.The avoidance of pollen is often impossible due to theirubiquitous nature. Ventilation systems can be equippedwith appropriate filters to avoid drawing pollen allergensinto the house and the car. Protective face masks and eyeglasses may be helpful. 8-1-5- Indoor moulds Indoor moulds are frequently involved in inducing nasal and bronchial symptoms, and reducing these aller-gens appears to be prudent. The fight against mouldsinside the home calls for hygiene measures and thosesubjects allergic to these spores must regularly inspectthe humid areas of their house, as well as the aeration andheating ducts. However, although anecdotal reports havebeen presented, there are no controlled studies showingthat these measures are effective in benefiting allergicpatients. 8-1-6- Occupational agents A large number of substances have been identified as occupational allergens and as risk factors that can causerhinitis and asthma. Levels above which the sensitisationoccurs frequently have been proposed for many chemi-cals (for review see 1252). However, once a patient hasbeen sensitised, the level of sensitivity necessary toinduce symptoms may be extremely low and the symp-toms may become increasingly severe. Attempts toTABLE 16: Measures for reducing house dust mite allergen exposure Essential Encase mattress, pillow and quilt in impermeable coversWash all bedding weekly in a hot cycle (55-60 \u00baC) Optimal Replace carpets with linoleum or wooden flooringIf carpets cannot be removed, treat with acaricides and/or tannic acid * Minimise upholstered furniture/replace with leather furnitureKeep dust accumulating objects in closed cupboardsUse a vacuum cleaner with integral HEPA filter and double thickness bags Replace curtains with blinds or easily washable (hot cycle) curtains Hot wash/freeze soft toys * Acaricides may induce adverse reactions in asthmatics.S222 Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL NOVEMBER 2001 reduce occupational exposure have been successful, especially in industrial settings. Some potent sensitisers,such as soya castor beans or some proteolytic enzymesused for detergents (511), have been replaced by lessallergenic or sensitising substances. Moreover, the levelsof sensitivity have been reduced in the workplace toavoid sensitisation (577). It is also important to considereco-morbidities since rhinitis often appears before occu-pational asthma. The early identification of occupationalsensitisers and the removal of sensitised patients fromany further exposure are important aspects of the man-agement of occupational rhinitis. Prevention of latex allergy is essential. Symptoms and presence of latex-specific IgE antibodies in subjects aresignificantly associated with measurable levels of latexaeroallergens. A latex aeroallergen level of 0.6 ng/m 3is a critical threshold for workers who are sensitised to natur-al rubber latex (1651). A reduction in latex allergen con-tent can be achieved using powder-free gloves and sever-al methods can also reduce the allergenicity of latex itself(1652-1654). When airborne latex allergen is unde-tectable, asthma symptoms improve and asthma medica-tions are reduced (549, 1655), but the impact on nasalsymptoms still has to be demonstrated. The use of powder-free gloves may enable sensitised patients to continueworking in their trained profession and may prevent mea-surable airborne latex exposure, but affected patients stillneed to avoid direct latex contact (1656) . A glove selec- tion programme utilising only powder-free and hypoal-lergenic gloves should be attempted in hospitals (1657,1658) and dental schools (1659). 8-1-7- Food allergens There is some dispute about the relative importance of food allergy in relation to allergic rhinitis. However, it cer-tainly can occur (1660). Milk allergy is the most common-ly described association with allergic rhinitis. Nevertheless,many other foods are likely to be involved. To what extentdietary avoidance achieves improvement has, again, notbeen adequately tested in controlled trials (1661). 8-1-8- Conclusion Total allergen avoidance appears to be effective (patients are symptom-free out of the pollen season oraway from occupational exposure). However, patients areoften sensitised to many allergens and the degree ofexposure varies within indoor and outdoor environments.Moreover, the magnitude of the reduction of allergenload needed to reduce symptoms is still unclear. On theother hand, allergen exposure leads to symptoms. Thus,avoidance measures are still recommended but moreresearch is strongly needed. 8-2- MEDICATION Medication has no long-lasting effect when stopped. Therefore, in persistent disease, whether administeredtopically or orally, maintenance treatment is required. Notachyphylaxis usually occurs during long-term treatment.8-2-1- Routes of administration Medications used for rhinitis are most commonly administered intranasally or orally. In exceptional cir-cumstances, they may be administered intramuscularly.Rhinitis is confined to the nose, which is a small organ.The surface area of the nasal mucous membrane is only300 cm 2. With an average thickness of the nasal mucosa of 3 mm, the volume of the diseased tissue in rhinitis is100 cm 3and the weight 100 gr. This is about 0.1% of the total body mass. 8-2-1-1- Advantages of intranasal administrationThe major advantages of delivering drugs directly to the nose are: high concentrations can be delivered directly into the target organ so that systemic effects are avoided orminimised, some of the drugs (e.g. cromones) used for the treat- ment of rhinitis can be administered only via intra-nasal route because they are not adequately absorbedwhen given orally, some drugs have systemic effects when administered orally (e.g. glucocorticosteroids and atropine deriva-tives), the onset of action of an intranasal drug is usually faster than that of an oral one (e.g. vasoconstrictorsand possibly H1-antihistamines). 8-2-1-2- Problems of intranasal administration However, there are some problems related to intranasal medication: Many patients with allergic rhinitis present also with conjunctivitis and/or asthma. Thus, there is a need formultiple administrations in target organs. The rationalefor an effective oral drug without side effects is that oneadministration should reach all the target organs. Studies have shown that the intranasal distribution of intranasal medication is not optimal. Only 20% of apressurised aerosol and 50% of a watery spray/powderinhaler will reach the target, e.g. the ciliated mucousmembrane. In addition, there is no reason to believethat intranasal medication will reach the ostiomeatalcomplex, which is of decisive importance for thedevelopment of pathology in the paranasal sinuses andnasal polyps. Furthermore, intranasal medication willnot the paranasal sinuses. An irritant or cilia toxic effect from added preserva- tives may be observed with intranasal drugs. It is nec-essary to add a preservative to an aqueous nasal spray,which may cause immediate nasal irritation. Thissymptom is, in part, a sign of rhinitis-induced hyper-responsiveness, and it will diminish with time when anintranasal is used. However, thecommonly used anti-microbial preservative, benzalko-nium chloride, is cytotoxic and in vitro studies have shown that it damages ciliary motility and may exac-erbate symptoms of rhinitis (1662-1664). The clinicalsignificance of this adverse effect, however, is unlike-ly since it is not seen in studies performed in vivo .J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 108, NUMBER 5Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop S223 Other local side effects are medication-dependent. Intranasal glucocorticosteroids may cause nose bleed-ing and, in rare cases, the development of a septal per-foration. The prolonged use of an intranasal vasocon-strictor involves a risk of the development of rhinitismedicamentosa, not seen with oral treatment. The useof intranasal ipratropium bromide can cause and produce bloodtinged mucus. Intranasal medication cannot be given when the nose or nostril is completely blocked. The effect of partialnasal blockage has not been investigated. However,one study has shown that pre-treatment with systemicglucocorticosteroids, which will open a blocked nosein perennial rhinitis, can significantly increase the sub-sequent responsiveness to an intranasal glucocortico-steroid. Patients' compliance may be greater with oral than topical drugs, especially if multiple target organs areto be treated. Probably, the education of the advan-tages of topical treatment may improve compliance. 8-2-2- Oral H1-antihistamines Antihistamines, or H1-blockers or H1-antihistamines, were discovered Bovet and Staub at the Institut Pasteurin 1937 (1665). Although the compound was too weak andtoo toxic for clinical use, its discovery induced an enor-mous amount of research and led to the development ofphenbenzamine (antegan \u00ae) in 1942 which was the first H1-antihistamine used in the treatment of allergic diseases(1666). Within a few years, other H1-antihistamines weremade available and are still show poor selectivity and remarkablesedative and anticholinergic effects. Therefore, where pos-sible, these drugs are no longer prescribed for the treat-ment of allergic rhinitis (1, 3). Over the last 15 years, pharmacological research has produced several compounds with higher potency, alonger duration of action and minimal sedative effects.These are the so-called new or second-generation H1-antihistamines, as opposed to the older or classic H1-antihistamines. This class of drugs has recently been the focus of con- siderable medical scientific interest, both for their multi-ple anti-allergic properties and because of reports con-cerning rare but possible severe cardiotoxic effects withtwo molecules (astemizole and terfenadine). However, agroup of molecules with favourable efficacy and safety isnow available. 8-2-2-1- Mechanisms of action and rationale8-2-2-1-1- H1-blocking effectAlthough a number of mediators are involved in the pathophysiology of allergic symptoms, histamine stillremains the main one. The pathogenic role of histaminehas been experimentally demonstrated in vivo either afterspecific nasal challenge or under natural allergen expo- sure (642, 660, 1670). Histamine acts in the nose pre-dominantly via H1-receptors, whereas the role of H2-receptors has not been fully clarified (1671-1673). The human histamine H1-receptor gene, an intron- lacking gene, was isolated with bovine H1-receptorcDNA (1674) used as a probe (1675). H1-histaminestimulation reproduces any of the classical symptoms ofrhinitis e.g. sneezing, itching and rhinorrhea and there-fore these symptoms can be well controlled by adminis-tering H1-antihistamines (for review on clinical efficacysee 1676-1681). On the other hand, nasal blockage,which usually predominates in persistent allergic rhinitis,is sustained by a chronic inflammatory process and bynumerous mediators, thus it responds only partially toH1-antihistamines. H1-antihistamines act by binding to H1-histamine receptors. However, unlike histamine, the binding of theantagonists to the receptors does not elicit a tissue response. The molecular study of the H1-receptor will make it possible to better identify new molecules. With cloning ofthe genes encoding the histamine H1-receptor, a new areaof histamine research has become reality. Finally, itseems feasible to study the target of the therapeuticallyimportant classes of H1-antihistamines. Expression of thegenes in mammalian cells allows detailed investigationsof the various signal transduction routes of the histamineH1-receptor (1682). Moreover, using molecular biologi-cal techniques, it is now possible to investigate ligandreceptor interaction at the molecular level (1683, 1684).These methods can be combined with a three-dimension-al model of the histamine H1-receptor (1685, 1686).Studies with mutant H1-receptors have shown that H1-antihistamines bind to specific amino acid residues in thetrans-membrane domains 3 and 5 and on Lys(200), andthat they act as a specific anchor point for these \"second-generation\" H(1) antagonists. It is expected that thesenew developments will provide much fundamentalknowledge on the ligand interaction with the H1-receptor. 8-2-2-1-2- Anti-allergic effects Histamine is not the only mediator released during allergic reactions. The rank order of relative H1 antago-nism by H1-antihistamines was studied by Simons et al. using skin tests with histamine and single doses of H1-antihistamines. The order from the most effective to theleast effective was found to be: chlorpheniramine, mg and placebo(1687). Other studies confirmed such ranking order(1688). However, when these drugs are compared inplacebo-controlled clinical trials, it is usually impossibleto differentiate their clinical efficacy in the treatment ofnasal, ocular or skin symptoms (1689-1697). Skin testreactivity does not correlate with symptoms during nasalchallenge (1698) or during the pollen season (1699). Thissuggests that these drugs are clinically active by possess-ing other properties besides H1 blocking activity, oralternatively that an incomplete H1 blockage is sufficientfor clinical efficacy. Moreover, the blockage of theS224 Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL NOVEMBER 2001 release of histamine by a synthesis inhibitor was unable to significantly suppress symptoms during nasal chal-lenge (1700). Thus, it appears that drugs reducing the symptoms of the allergic reaction may have additive properties to H1blockage. Over the past 15 years, it has become clearthat most classical and new-generation H1-antihista-mines had such anti-allergic properties besides H1blockage (1701). These properties differ depending onthe molecule and the cells used (1702-1706). In vitro, high concentrations of H1-antihistamines are able toblock mediator release from basophils and human mastcells (1707-1711) by mechanisms which are not yetcompletely understood (1712). These anti-allergic effects can also be seen in vivo in skin, nasal, lung and ocular challenge studies. Using nasalchallenge with allergen, it has been observed that azata-dine, loratadine and terfenadine reduce histamine, PGD 2 and kinin during challenge (1713-1716). Ceti-rizine the other hand, the effects ofketotifen were rather disappointing in this particularmodel since mediator release was not blocked as expect-ed (1719). Ebastine reduced cytokine production (1702).Cetirizine, at least in some studies in the skin, reducedeosinophil chemotaxis after allergen challenge (1720-1724) but no allergen (1027,1028, 1730-1732) or mites (1733). The extent of these anti-allergic effects are not com- pletely understood, yet these studies have led to the con-cept of anti-allergic drugs with H1-blocking properties(1701, 1734). However, it would be premature to attemptto reclassify the H1-antihistamines according to their anti-allergic properties because these properties have not beenfully investigated and their relative contribution to theoverall therapeutic effectiveness of each H1-antihistamineis unknown (1735). Due to their variable H1-blocking activity, their anti- allergic effects and, possibly, their differences in lipophilic-ity and tissue deposition, the various H1-antihistamines arenot equally effective on skin, nose, eye or lung symptoms.Moreover, it appears that not all H1-antihistamines havesimilar effects in patients and thus non-responders with onedrug may respond favourably to another drug (1736). 8-2-2-2- Clinical and pharmacological effectsThe newer H1-antihistamines are generally less likely to cause sedation, and most of them, due to their pharmaco-dynamic properties, can be administered OD (1465, 1737). The new H1-antihistamines are highly selective to the H1-receptors and are therefore effective in reducing itch-ing, sneezing and watery rhinorrhea (for review on clinicalefficacy see 1676-1681). However, they are less effectiveon nasal obstruction (1738). It is important to note thatwhen administered orally, an H1-antihistamine exerts itseffects also on non-nasal symptoms such as conjunctivitis,which is often present in rhinitics. It has been shown thatlong-term continuous treatment with H1-antihistamines ismore advantageous and effective than an \"on demand\"regimen (1739). Moreover, long-term treatment may alsoimprove lower respiratory symptoms in children (1740). Ininfants with house dust mite or grass pollen sensitisation,but not in those with cat sensitisation, long-term treatmentmay exert a prophylactic effect (1741) on asthma onset. Most of the new H1-antihistamines have a fast onset of action (1-2 hours) and their effects last for up to 24 hoursexcept in the case of acrivastine, which needs multipledaily doses. All the newer H1-antihistamines (except for cetirizine and fexofenadine) undergo hepatic metabolism via thecytochrome P450 system them are transformedinto active metabolites. Cytochrome P4503A (CYP3A) hasan important involvement in the metabolism of manychemically diverse drugs administered to humans (1742,1743). Moreover, its localisation in high amounts both inthe small intestinal epithelium and liver makes it a majorcontributor to pre-systemic elimination following oral drugadministration. Drug interactions involving enzyme inhibi-tion or induction are common following the co-administra-tion of two or more CYP3A substrates (1744). Cetirizine,which is the active metabolite of which is the active metabolite of terfenadine, are inturn poorly metabolised. Mizolastine is active se partly metabolised by cytochrome P450 and predominant-ly glucuronidated in the liver. 8-2-2-3- Side effects of H1-antihistamines8-2-2-3-1- Central nervous system side effectsThe most troublesome side effect of older H1- antihistamines is sedation. This can be defined as a glob-al impairment of psychomotor performance and, subjec-tively, as a proclivity to fall asleep. Sedation, however, isoften an important consequence of rhinitis itself (17). Histamine is considered to be both a local hormone and a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS)(1745). It is synthesised by neurons and mast cells. Thethree types of receptors are present in the CNS but differin their localisation, biochemical H1-receptors byautoradiography and are widespread throughout CNS.The physiological roles of H1-receptors in the CNS needbetter understanding, but it is well known that H1-antihistamines induce several effects. The most common side effect of classical H1- antihistamines is sedation. Sedation, ranging frommild drowsiness to deep sleep, can occur frequently,even at the usual therapeutic doses. CNS depression. Symptoms of CNS depression are disturbed coordination, dizziness, lassitude and inabil-ity to concentrate (1746, 1747). CNS stimulation. Many factors have been involved in the CNS side effects of H1-antihistamines and can be attributed: to the poor selectivity to H1-receptors,J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL 108, NUMBER 5Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group S225 to the capacity of crossing the blood-brain barrier (1748). This latter concept involves a number of dif-ferent factors including lipophophilicity (1749, 1750),ionisation, proteins and presence ofactive transportation. Non-sedative H1-antihistaminesdo not cross this barrier because of their decreasedlipophilicity. Moreover, there is a highly significant correlation between the sedation caused by H1-antihistamines andthe level of their binding on brain receptors (1751).Non-sedative H1-antihistamines may have a reducedaffinity for CNS histamine receptors (1752, 1753). The new generation compounds are mostly devoid of CNS side effects (1754). The absence of a sedating effectat therapeutic doses has been demonstrated for most ofthe new compounds (1755) by means of specific psy-chomotor tests (for review see 1756-1760). CNS sideeffects are potentiated by alcohol but not in new-generation com-pounds (1762-1764). Elderly patients present a greater risk for central ner- vous system side effects and old-generation antihista-mines should not be used (1765). 8-2-2-3-2- Cardiac side effectsOver the last ten years, arrhythmogenic action and fatalities have been described for terfenadine and astem-izole (1755, 1766, 1767). However, this is not a classeffect and is only associated with terfenadine and astem-izole, which have been withdrawn in several countriesdue to these side effects. This effect is a quinidine-likeaction that involves an abnormal prolongation of the QTinterval (1768), possibly leading to torsade de pointes,ventricular tachycardia, atrioventricular block and car-diac arrest (1769-1802). The cardiac action potential is generated by the transmembrane movement of several ion currentsincluding Na +,C a2+and K+0. Disturbances in any of these ionic movements, in particular the potassiumions, may cause dysrhythmias (1803). The molecularmechanism sustaining the cardiotoxic action of H1-antihistamines appears to be the blockage of somepotassium channels on ventricular myocytes, namelyIKr and IK1, which are responsible for the inward rec-tifier current (1804-1806). The proclivity to block ionchannels depends upon the molecular structure of thedrug and it is maximal for terfenadine and astemizole.The blockage of these channels may occur and becomeclinically significant in the case of an abnormal plasmaconcentration of the drug due to an overdose or animpaired metabolism. The risks of non-sedating H1-antihistamines were reviewed in the WHO adverse drug reaction database.It was suggested that cardiac side effects might beseen with many of these H1-antihistamines (1807).However, this report was based on crude adverse eventreporting that contained inherent flaws and biases(1808). Therefore, concerns raised by this report can-not be confirmed.There is a dose-dependent effect on cardiac toxicity. This is relevant for drugs metabolised by the P450cytochrome since the concomitant administration of com-pounds which compete with the enzyme (macrolides,azolic antifungals) may reduce the metabolism of the H1-antihistamine and increase its plasma concentration.Loratadine (1809-1811) and ebastine (1812, 1813),although metabolised in the liver, do not appear to possessthe intrinsic capacity to block ion channels. Strong experi-mental support is still missing for ebastine. Moreover, inhealthy volunteers, there is no evidence of an effect ofmizolastine (up to 40 mg - four times the therapeutic dose)on ventricular re-polarisation (1818). 8-2-2-3-3- Carcinogenic effectsOver the past 60 years, there has been no clinical evi- dence of suspected or actual carcinogenicity of commer-cial H1-antihistamines. A carcinogenic potential ofloratadine hydroxyzine and astemizole was reported in asingle study on mice (1819), but these results were notconfirmed. Moreover, the results obtained in rodents arenot immediately transferable to humans because of thedifferent experimental conditions and the different cellu-lar metabolic systems (1820, 1821). Cetirizine was foundto aneugenic and FISH assays (1822), but these effects wereshown at high doses and do not appear to be clinicallyrelevant. Therefore, to date, there is no evidence of car-cinogenicity or tumour promotion in humans taking H1-antihistamines (1823). 8-2-2-3-4- Other side effectsMost, if not all, classical H1-antihistamines possess phar- macological effects that are not related to H1-blockage. Many H1-antihistamines block cholinergic muscarinic receptors in a dose-dependent (1824). Due tothe anticholinergic effect, the older compounds oftencause a dry mouth, tachycardia and urine voiding. Cyproheptadine and ketotifen may cause appetite stimulation and consequent weight gain. This sideeffect does not appear to be a clinical problem withother newer compounds (1825, 1826). Weight gain canbe observed (1827). prometh- -adrenergic receptor proper- ties. Others increase adrenergic effects by a cocaine-like effect, which decreases the re-uptake of thetransmitter. anti-serotonine (1828) (phenothi-azines) (1829). Several but not all H1-antihistamines are analgesic agents and some are also analgesic adjuvants. is diarrhoea, loss of appetite and epigastric distressand are observed more frequently with some membersof the ethylenediamine class.S226 Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group IMMUNOL NOVEMBER 2001 8-2-2-4- Molecules used histamine H1-receptor antagonist. Its effects usually last for about 4 to 6 hours. Double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial results have shown acrivastine (usually 8 mg, three timesdaily) to be an effective H1-antihistamine in the treat-ment of seasonal allergic rhinitis (1834, 1835). was found to cause less (1836), but it has some sedative effects(1757, Double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial results have shown that astemizole 10 mg OD is effective inthe treatment of seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis (1843-1850). Astemizole is effective in allergic conjunctivitis. In comparison to other H1-antihistamines, astemizole may not be as effective for the treatment of acute aller-gic symptoms because of its delayed onset of action(1532, 1851, 1852). Astemizole is non-sedating. Increased appetite and weight gain may occur (1827). Astemizole is metabolised by the liver cytochrome P450 and drug interactions with other compounds ofthe same metabolism have been observed. Cardiac side effects in the form of torsade-de-pointes are unusual dosage of astemizole should not be increasedabove the stipulated level. Drug interactions (e.g.macrolide antibiotics and azolic antifungals) should becarefully avoided. Also, patients with underlying hepat-ic or cardiac disease should not take this agent. Due to its cardiac side effects, astemizole has been withdrawn from the market in most countries. Wherepossible, H1-antihistamines with the least potential forcardiac side effects should be used. 8-2-2-4-3- Azelastine Azelastine has H1-antihistamine activity. In vitro, it inhibits mediator release from mast cells and from cells relevant to the allergic inflammationfollowing antigen and non-antigen stimuli (1863-1870). In vivo , in humans, some studies have con- firmed anti-allergic effects (1718). Double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial results have shown that orally administered azelastine indoses of up to 4 mg/day significantly relieved symp-toms in patients with seasonal (1871) or perennial allergic rhinitis (1872). In addition, azelastine, administered as an intranasal or intra-ocular formulation, was effective in alleviat-ing symptoms of seasonal and perennial allergic rhini-tis and conjunctivitis (see chapter 8-2-3). Azelastine was also tested as an anti asthmatic agent (1873-1877) but its indications need further studies inorder to be fully appreciated. The drug is is notapproved for asthma. Azelastine is often well tolerated but, when adminis- tered orally, the most common adverse effects are analtered taste perception and drowsiness (1867).Administered intranasally, azelastine does not inducesedation at doses used in Europe (0.56 mg). However,it has a reported incidence of sedation (slightly greaterthan placebo) at doses used in the US (1.12 mg).Some patients present taste perversion. 8-2-2-4-4- Cetirizine Cetirizine is a piperazine derivative cetirizine was found tobe the most potent drug. However, most of thesestudies were carried out using single doses ofH1-antihistamine and the differential effect betweencetirizine and other H1-antihistamines was reducedusing multiple doses (1887). The clinical relevance ofskin tests or nasal challenge is not fully understood. There is no anti-cholinergic effect (1888). Some anti-allergic properties have been observed in vivo in man (see chapter 8-2-2-2). Double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial results indicate that cetirizine 10 mg OD is an effective treat-ment for seasonal allergic rhinitis, or perennial allergic rhinitis (1889-1899). Cetrizine is also effective in the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis (1900, 1901). TABLE 17: Properties of H1-antihistamines Several properties should be met phar additive anti-allergic activities,- no interference of activity by side ef fects: - no sedation,- no anticholinergic effect,- no weight gain,- knowledge and prevention of cardiac side effects, - phar macokinetics: - rapid onset of action, - long duration of action, at least 24 hr,- administration once a day,- no development of Workshop Group S227 In perennial allergic rhinitis patients, cetrizine was found to significantly improve quality of life (1899). Cetirizine was found to be effective in children in dou- ble-blind, placebo-controlled studies (1893, 1896,1897, 1902, 1903). Continuous treatment reduces clinical and inflamma- tory variables more than symptomatic treatment givenprn (1739). In asthma, cetirizine may improve symptoms during the pollen season (1904-1906) but more data are need-ed. Studies during allergen bronchial challenge are notall positive (1907). Cetirizine can induce a bronchodi-latation (1908, 1909). However, there is no indicationfor cetirizine in asthma (1910-1912). In the ETAC \u00ae(Early (1741), a double-blind, randomised,placebo-controlled trial, 817 were cetirizine (0.25 mg/kg BID) orplacebo. Cetirizine halved the number of patients devel-oping asthma in the subgroups sensitised to grass pollenor to house dust mite (20% of the study population). Using the subjective assessment of CNS function reported during drug trials, cetirizine is associated witha significantly lower incidence of sedation than hydrox-yzine (1913, 1914). In these trials, cetirizine did notappear to be more sedating than placebo or other H1-antihistamines. However, in three double-blind, place-bo-controlled studies (1889, 1892, hada greater than placebo.For driving performance, cetirizine did not differentiatefrom placebo and there were no significant additiveeffects of alcohol in most (1764, 1915, 1916) but not allstudies (1917). Divergent results were obtained for vig-ilance (1918, 1919). When assessed objectively in phar-macodynamic comparisons, cetirizine 1758, 1913, 1920-1926). The long-term safety of cetirizine in infants has been largely demonstrated (1927). Cetirizine is not metabolised in the liver. No cardiac side effects have been reported (1814). 8-2-2-4-5- Ebastine Ebastine is a piperidine Ebastine and its active metabolite carebastine are highly potent selective H1-receptor antagonists (1688,1930-1932). Ebastine is devoid of any other noticeable receptor binding and has no anti-cholinergic effects. Some anti-allergic properties have been observed in vivo in man (see chapter 8-2-2-2). Double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial results have shown that, administered at doses of 10 mg OD,ebastine was found to be effective in seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis (1933-1937). However, a dose of 20 mg OD was found to be more effective and a dual dosage has been suggested: 10 mgOD for mild rhinitis and 20 mg OD for severe season-al (1938) and perennial rhinitis (1937, 1939). Ebastine is effective in allergic conjunctivitis. Ebastine is effective and safe in children. Ebastine has not been tested in asthma using double- blind, placebo-controlled studies. Ebastine does not induce sedation in clinical trials. The results suggest that ebastine in doses of up to 30 mg maybe relatively safe for use by those who drive motor vehi-cles while receiving this medication (1940). Ebastinehas no interaction with alcohol (1941). Objective mea-sures of sedation did not show alterations in psychomo-tor performance and autonomic (1942, 1943). Ebastine interacts with cytochrome P450 (1744). Ebastine does not appear to possess cardiovascular side effects at recommended doses of 10 or 20 mg(1812, 1813, 1944-1946). 8-2-2-4-6- Emedastine Emedastine is an H1-antihistamine (1947, 1948) for intra-ocular use (1949, 1950). It has been tested usingconjunctival challenge (1951). There is, however, no con-trolled clinical study available on Medline. 8-2-2-4-7- Epinastine Epinastine is an H1-antihistamine widely studied in vitro and in animals (1688, 1952-1962). There is, however, no controlled clinical study on Medline. Epinastine seems to be non-sedating (1959). It is very poorly metabolised compared to terfenadine in humanliver microsomes and does not inhibit CYP3A4 activityin vitro (1963). Cardiotoxic activity has been tested in vitro and in vivo in animals only and epinastine was not shown to have adverse effects (1964-1966). 8-2-2-4-8- FexofenadineFexofenadine is the pharmacologically active metabo- lite of terfenadine (1967). It is a potent H1-antihistamine in skin test models (1677, 1968, 1969). It does not have anti-cholinergic properties. Its pharmacokinetics have been studied in adults and children (1970) and support OD dosing. Some anti-allergic properties have been observed in vivo in man (see chapter 8-2-2-2). Fexofenadine was found to reduce symptoms from nasal challenge with allergen (1971). Double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial results have shown that fexofenadine 120 or 180 mg OD con-trolled symptoms in patients with seasonal allergicrhinitis as effectively as cetirizine. Other double-blindclinical trials showed that fexofenadine 40 to 240 mgBID was significantly more effective than placebo(1816, 1894, 1972, 1973). Fexofenadine is also effective in allergic conjunctivitis. Compared with placebo, once-daily fexofenadine (120 or 180 mg) significantly improved patient-reportedquality of life and reduced performance impairment inwork and daily activities due to seasonal allergic rhini-tis symptoms (1974). Fexofenadine is non-sedating (1816, 1894, 1972, 1973) and does not impair driving performance. Itdoes not potentiate alcohol sedative effects (1975). Fexofenadine is not metabolised by the liver. S228 Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL NOVEMBER 2001 Relative to placebo, fexofenadine did not affect mean QTc in patients who were given dosages of up to 480mg/day for 2 weeks or in volunteers who received upto 800 mg/day for 6 days or 240 mg/day for 12months. Although a letter reported some prolongationof QTc in one patient (1976), further assessment inthis patient did not support fexofenadine as a cause(1977) and it appears that fexofenadine is not car-diotoxic (1815, 1978). Thus, this report did not lead toany change in the labelling of the drug. 8-2-2-4-9- Levocabastine Levocabastine is a cyclohexylpiperidine derivative shown to possess long-lasting H1 antagonism and anti-allergicproperties in animals (1979). It has only been developed fornasal and ocular administration due to its sedative effects. In controlled trials, levocabastine was effective and well tolerated in the treatment of allergic rhinitis andallergic conjunctivitis (see H1-antihistamine (1753, 1980, 1981). No tachyphylaxis was observed over a 12-week treat- ment period (1831). No anti-cholinergic effect has been reported. Some anti-allergic properties have been observed in vivo in man (see chapter 8-2-2-2). Double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial results have shown that loratadine (10 mg OD) is an effectiveH1-antihistamine in seasonal or perennial allergic rhinitis (1690, 1986). Loratadine was also shown to be effective in the treat- ment of allergic conjunctivitis (1691, 1692, 1986). Loratadine significantly reduces skin tests to hista- mine, but its clinical efficacy was not reactivity to histamine (1699, 1887). Prophylactic loratadine therapy was studied and was shown to be effective in suppressing symptoms of sea-sonal allergic rhinitis and in providing patients withsymptom-free days throughout the pollen season (1987). Loratadine was also found to have an adjunct effect in the treatment of acute sinusitis (1988). No sedative effect or impairment of cognitive function or psychomotor performance have been observed withloratadine at the recommended 10 mg dose (1989-1994). Loratadine was found to be safe in children as young as 2 years of age. Loratadine is metabolised in the liver by cytochrome P450. No cardiac side effects have been reported in clinical studies with loratadine (1744, 1767, 1806, 1827, 1854,1995, 1996). A report on one clinical case described acardiac arrhythmia in a patient receiving loratadine(1997) but the causal relationship with the drug wasunclear (1998). Thus, this report did not lead to anychange in the labelling of the drug.8-2-2-4-11- MequitazineMequitazine is an oral H1-antihistamine with mild anti-cholinergic properties. It was found to be effective inseasonal (1691, 1999) and perennial allergic rhinitis(2000). Some sedative effects have been observedalthough psychomotor tests have not provided objectiveconfirmation (2001, 2002). Mequitazine has also been used as an intra-ocular drug in the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis and has beenfound effective in a challenge model (2003). 8-2-2-4-12- Mizolastine Mizolastine is a long-acting H1-antihistamine (1818, 2004) without anti-cholinergic effects (2005, 2006). Mizolastine has demonstrated anti-allergic effects in animals (2007-2009) and healthy volunteers and anti-inflammatory activity in animal models. No tachyphylaxis occurred throughout a prolonged treatment with mizolastine (2010). Double-blind trials have shown mizolastine to be sig- nificantly more effective than placebo and effectiveas other second-generation antihistamine agents, suchas loratadine or with seasonal allergic rhinitis (1679, 2011,2012) or perennial (2013, 2014) allergic rhinitis. It has some effect on nasal blockage (2014). In conjunctivitis, mizolastine was found to be effective (1679, 2011, 2012). Available data also suggest that the prophylactic administration of mizolastine is significantly moreeffective than placebo and as effective as prophylacticterfenadine in delaying the onset of symptoms of sea-sonal allergic rhinitis (2011). Mizolastine 10 mg/day is generally well tolerated, with common adverse events. Sedation has beenreported to be similar to the effect induced by placebo.Tests of psychomotor function in volunteers (2015) oranimals (1916, 2016, 2017) revealed no impairment. Mizolastine is partly metabolised by cytochrome P450. In volunteers and patients, the incidence of prolonged QTc interval was similar in mizolastine and placebotreated subjects (1818, 1996). Nonetheless, mizolastine is contraindicated in those with cardiac disease or hepatic impairment or in thosereceiving erythromycin, ketoconazole or class I is a selective histamine is devoid of CNS and anticholinergic activity (1681, 2019). Some anti-allergic properties have been observed in vivo in man (see chapter 8-2-2-2). Double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial results have shown that terfenadine at a dose of 60 mg admin-istered BID is effective in patients with seasonal aller-gic rhinitis 1692, 1892, 5Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group S229 Terfenadine 60 mg BID is effective in perennial rhini- tis (1690). The drug has been approved at an OD dose of 120 mg on the basis of equivalence in comparative (not placebo-controlled) trials (2023). Terfenadine was also found to be effective in allergic conjunctivitis (1689, 1692, 1984, 1985, 2021) and in children with allergic rhinitis in autumn (2024). Terfenadine, when administered at the onset and dur- ing the season, is more effective than when adminis-tered during the season (2025). Terfenadine is non-sedating (2021) and neither impairs psychomotor performance nor adverselyaffects subjective feelings, nor enhances the depres-sant effects of concomitantly administered alcohol orbenzodiazepines (1681, 1763). Terfenadine is metabolised in and interactions with ketoconazole, itrocona-zole or erythromycin have been identified (1789). Cardiac side effects including torsade de pointes are that dosageof terfenadine should not be increased and that druginteractions should be carefully avoided. Due to its cardiac side effects, terfenadine has been withdrawn from most countries (2035). Where possi-ble, H1-antihistamines with the least potential for car-diac side effects should be used. 8-2-2-4-14- Ketotifen Ketotifen is an H1-antihistamine with in vitro anti- allergic properties. In vivo , in humans, such properties have not been confirmed (1719). Ketotifen has shown efficacy in patients with allergic rhinitis (2036, 2037). Sedation can be troublesome in older children and adults, usually for the initial 2 weeks of treatment.Weight gain is another notable side effect (2038). In Japan, ketotifen is also used topically.8-2-2-4-15- OxatomideOxatomide is an orally active H1-histamine receptor antagonist which also inhibits mediator release (2039).Oxatomide has been found to be more effective thanplacebo in the treatment of allergic rhinitis (2040, 2041).Sedation is a common side effect, reviewed this document since the risk/benefitratio is not as favourable as for the newer molecules.There are several other molecules which have not beenfully tested in clinical trials by use of double-blind,placebo-controlled designs, which have yet to bereviewed (1529, 2044). 8-2-2-5- The future of H1-antihistaminesWith the cloning of the gene encoding the histamine H1-receptor, a new area of histamine research hasbecome reality. Finally, it seems feasible to study the tar-get of the therapeutically important classes of H1-antihistamine. Expression of the genes in mammaliancells allows detailed investigations of the various signaltransduction routes of the histamine H1-receptor (1682).Moreover, using molecular biological techniques, it isnow possible to investigate ligand receptor interaction atthe molecular level. It is expected that these new devel-opments will provide much fundamental knowledge onthe ligand 2046, 2047) and may be the only moleculesavailable in some developing countries. But because oftheir more favourable new be afirst-choice treatment for allergic rhinitis when they areavailable and affordable. However, in some countries, notall molecules are available and the choice may berestricted. The anti-allergic activities exerted by somedrugs would suggest that long-term use is preferable toan \"on demand\" regimen, especially in persistent dis-ease. In perennial allergic rhinitis, when obstruction isthe predominant symptom, intranasal glucocortico-steroids should either be added to a H1-antihistamine orused as a first choice drug. 8-2-3- T opical H1-antihistamines 8-2-3-1- RationaleThe major advantage of delivering drugs directly into the nose is that high concentrations can be deliveredmore effectively into the target organ and systemic sideeffects are avoided or minimised. 8-2-3-2- intranasal H1-antihistamines the treatment of allergic rhinitis:azelastine (1867, 2048) and levocabastine (1979, 2049).These two drugs are and highly specific H1-receptor antagonists. Azelastine and levocabastine nasal sprays offer prompt relief for itching and sneezing (2050) and,when used BID regularly, they can also prevent theonset of symptoms. These drugs are effective during nasal challenge with allergen or and in 2057-2066) , or perennial allergic rhinitis (2067-2069). Azelastine found to be effective in children (2055, 2058, 2070). It was found in one study that long-term continuous treatment with azelastine was more effective than an\"on demand\" treatment regimen. Intranasal azelastine is more rapidly effective than beclomethasone dipropionate but in the long term, itsS230 Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL NOVEMBER 2001 effects are less potent (2059). It was observed in some studies that azelastine was effective on nasal obstruc-tion but, apparently, to a lesser extent than intranasalglucocorticosteroids (2071). Intranasal fluticasonewas found to be significantly more effective than levo-cabastine in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis(2072, 2073). The therapeutic benefits of intranasalfluticasone were also reflected by the decrease in nasalinflammatory cells (2072). 8-2-3-2-1- Ocular administration Azelastine and levocabastine have both been devel- oped as eye drops for the intra-ocular treatment ofallergic conjunctivitis. In double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, these drugs were found to be effective in seasonal symptoms(2074-2083) and during ocular provocation tests(2084). They demonstrate a similar efficacy profile to oral H1- antihistamines with the advantage of a significantlyfaster onset of action on both nasal and ocular symp-toms. Topical treatment is, however, specific to the site of administration. Usually, intra-ocular levocabastine was found to be superior to cromoglycate in the treatment of allergicconjunctivitis (2079, 2085). Naphazoline/antazoline eye drops are also available for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis but appar-ently no double-blind, placebo-controlled study neither azelastine nor levocabastine, when topically administered effect (2079, 2081, 2086, 2087)(see chapter 8-2-2-4-3). One specific side effect, a short lasting perversion of taste, has been described for azelastine. 8-2-3-4- RecommendationsTopical H1-antihistamines have a rapid onset of action (less than 15 minutes) at low drug dosage, but they act onlyon the treated organ. Topical H1-antihistamines usuallyrequire bi-daily (BID) administrations to maintain a satis-factory clinical effect. Their use may therefore be recom-mended for mild organ-limited disease, as an \"on demand\"medication in with a continuous one (2088). 8-2-4- glucocorticosteroids cortisone or dexamethasone topically in the airways failedbecause they were either ineffective or had substantial sys-temic effects. The situation changed when beclometha-sone dipropionate was introduced as an aerosol in 1972(2089). Beclomethasone dipropionate separates anti-inflammatory and unwanted systemic activities by its highaffinity for the glucocorticoid receptor. Moreover, the por-tion swallowed after inhalation/intranasal use (80-90% ofthe inhaled dose) is subjected to first-pass deactivation inthe liver before reaching the systemic circulation. In 1973,beclomethasone dipropionate was introduced as a nasalspray for seasonal (2090). Subsequently,other of these productsdepends upon the country). Glucocorticosteroids are currently the most potent medication available for the treatment of allergic andnon-allergic rhinitis. The effect of intranasal glucocorti-costeroids is based on local activity. Oral administrationof the equivalent amount of drug produces no benefit(2091-2093). The introduction of intranasal glucocorti-costeroids is one of the best examples of how the thera-peutic index of a medication can be dramaticallyimproved when it is administered topically. Initiallyreserved as a second-line agent, the role of intranasal glu-cocorticosteroids is now changing. In three internationalreports on the management of rhinitis, intranasal gluco-corticosteroids were considered as a first-line therapy foradults in moderate to severe cases of seasonal and peren-nial allergic rhinitis (1-3). 8-2-4-1- Mechanisms of action and rationaleThe symptomatology of allergic rhinitis is currently considered to be caused mainly by the accumulation andactivation of infiltrating cells, which release mediatorsand cytokines and result in allergic inflammation. Gluco-corticosteroids can suppress many stages of the allergicinflammatory process. This may explain their potenteffect on allergic symptomatology. Symptomatology ofallergic inflammation is the consequence mechanismsof priming to allergen and hyperreactivity. For this rea-son, it may be preferable to begin local glucocortico-steroid treatment before the onset of symptoms (2094).Also, the treatment appears to be more effective whengiven continuously (2095). The rationale for using intranasal glucocorticosteroids in the treatment of allergic rhinitis is that high drug con-centrations can be achieved at receptor sites in the nasalmucosa, with a minimal risk of systemic adverse effects. 8-2-4-1-1- Molecular effectsThe effect of glucocorticosteroids is caused by binding to a single glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which is pre-dominantly localised to the cytoplasm of target cells.After the binding of the glucocorticoid, the complexmoves to the nuclear compartment. The GR is expressedin high density in airway epithelium (2096). Glucocorti-costeroids produce their effect on inflammatory cells byactivating GR to increase or inhibit gene transcriptionthrough a process known as transactivation and transre-pression respectively (2097). Transactivation is mediated by the binding of the hor- mone-activated GR to a DNA sequence called glucocor-ticoid response element (GRE) (2098). Genes involved inthe control of neoglucogenesis, arterial pressure andintraocular tension contain GRE Thus,transactivation reten-tion, hypokaliaemia, glaucoma). On the other hand,transactivation may also result in a therapeutic benefit inJ ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 108, NUMBER 5Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group S231 asthma since GC induces gene expression of the 2- adrenergic receptor (2102). Transrepression is mediated by inhibitory protein- protein interactions between the hormone-activated GRand transcription factors like AP-1 and NF- B (2103). AP-1 is a dimer made of peptides belonging to the c-Fosand c-Jun families (2104) whereas NF- B is a dimer composed of proteins related to p65 (2105). FunctionalNF-B response elements (NF- BRE) and TRE are novel palin-dromic response element, the NurRE, and may beinvolved in HPA axis regulation (2106). The convergenceof positive signals mediated by Nur77 (and also probablyby related family members) and of negative signalsexerted by GR appears to be a general mechanism for thecontrol of transcription, since it is active in bothendocrine and lymphoid cells (2107). Expression of thesignal transducer and activator of transcription factor the nasal mucosa of Anti-inflammatory effects on cellsGlucocorticosteroids can suppress many stages of the inflammatory process. This may explain their strongeffect on allergic symptomatology. Many cells andcytokines playing an active role in allergic inflammationin the nose are influenced by intranasal glucocortico-steroid treatment. However, the extent to which cells andcytokines are reduced differs (760). Antigen-presenting (Langerhans) cells are highly sen- sitive to treatment with intranasal glucocorticosteroids(809, 2109). Moreover, glucocorticosteroids alsoinhibit the uptake and/or processing but not the pre-sentation of antigen by airway Langerhans cells(2110). The significant reduction of Langerhans cellsby local glucocorticosteroid therapy could be anexplanation for the subsequent reduction of secondaryinflammatory response and symptomatology in aller-gic disease. Eosinophils and 2111-2117). stim-ulus is as in allergen provocation studies, orwhen the local glucocorticosteroid dose is relativelylow, the decrease in cells is substantial (760). Thereduction in eosinophil numbers tends to be more pro-nounced in the epithelium than in the lamina propria . It has been suggested that intranasal glucocortico-steroids may not only diminish airway eosinophilicinfiltration but also decrease eosinophil survival(2112, 2118). The influx of basophils and mast cells in the epithelial layers of the nasal mucosa is reduced by intranasalglucocorticosteroids (1142, 2119-2121). Mast cells inthe lamina propria are only reduced when differences are pronounced either by using a large allergen stimu-lus or high dose treatment (758, 2111). Intranasal glucocorticosteroids reduce T-cells and their subclasses in in perennialallergic rhinitis (809). In the lamina propria ,a decrease in T-cells is found only after a large stimulus(2111) or a high-dose treatment (758). T-cell functionis also influenced by intranasal glucocorticosteroids(see chapter 8-2-4-1-3). Some cells, such as macrophages (791) and neutrophils, do not seem to be influenced. This may explain whyintranasal glucocorticosteroids have no adverse effecton the immune response to bacterial infections. 8-2-4-1-3- Anti-inflammatory effects on cytokines The effects of intranasal glucocorticosteroids on cytokines from the Th2 subgroup have been thoroughlydescribed. Most of the studies have been done in allergenchallenge studies. Glucocorticosteroids reduce the levelsof mRNA and protein for IL-3, IL-4, IL-5 and receptors (760, 981, 984, 987, 1186, 2113, 2122).However, some degree of variability has been observedand controversies remain in the literature. The effect ofintranasal glucocorticosteroid treatment for othercytokines is not yet fully elucidated. Fluticasone dipropi-onate has been shown to inhibit the increase in germ- line gene transcripts (787, 1080), in CD3 +and in major basic protein (MBP+) cells expressing GM-CSF mRNA. However, increase is not clear have a specific effect on cytokines inthe Th2 group. The direct effect of glucocorticosteroidscould be explained by the presence or absence of Gluco-corticoid Response Element (GRE) in the promoterregion of cytokines (2124). 8-2-4-1-4- Other effects of intranasal glucocortico- steroids Glucocorticosteroids may also reduce the release of preformed and newly generated mediators, such as hista-mine (2125), tryptase, prostanoids (2126) and leukotrienes(2127). However, this action may be partly due to thereduction of inflammatory cells in the nasal mucosa. Fluticasone has long-term effects on the nasal response to histamine in perennial allergic rhinitis. Partof this effect is claimed to be vascular (2128). Intranasal glucocorticosteroids can also act on IgE production. During the pollen season, there is usually anincrease in serum and nasal allergen-specific pharmacological efficacy of intranasal glucocorticosteroids for treating allergic rhinitis is indisputable. A regular prophylactic use of intranasal glucocortico- steroids is effective in reducing nasal blockage, rhinor-rhea, sneezing and nasal itching in adults and children. In seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis, intranasal glucocorticosteroids control nasal symptoms in themajority of patients a meta-analysis has shown thatS232 Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL NOVEMBER 2001 in rhinitis, intranasal glucocorticosteroids are equally or more effective than oral H1-antihistamines (1738). Extensive reviews of the clinical studies efficacy of these com-pounds. Intranasal glucocorticosteroids are and their anti-inflammatoryproperties favours them to other treatments. This is thecase especially in persistent allergic rhinitis, whenobstruction is the main symptom and in long-lasting dis-ease (3). They have a slower onset of action than H1-antihistamines, usually less than 12 hours, and maximumefficacy develops over days and weeks (2143-2145).When the nose is extremely congested, intranasal gluco-corticosteroids may not be evenly distributed to themucosa and it may be advisable to administer anintranasal decongestant (e.g. xylomethazoline) or sys-temic glucocorticosteroids (for no more than a week) topermit improved penetration (3). Intranasal glucocorti-costeroids should be given regularly (2095) and in severecases probably commenced before the beginning of thepollen season for maximal effect (3). An OD medicationis usually sufficient in most cases and has good patientcompliance (2116, 2146, 2147). BID medication may benecessary in severe during exacerbations. Thedose response curve of intranasal glucocorticosteroids isvery shallow, and so reducing the dose as much as possi-ble is advisable (2148). Intranasal glucocorticosteroids were traditionally delivered However, since the pressurised aerosols con-taining CFCs are to be banished, many of the moleculesare nowadays administered by mechanical aqueous pumpsprays or as dry powder. Delivery systems are equallyeffective and safe, thus the patient can choose which for-mulation is personally preferred. 8-2-4-3- Side effects of intranasal glucocortico- steroids 8-2-4-3-1- Local side effectsThe current intranasal preparations are well tolerated and can be used on a long-term basis without atrophy ofthe mucosa (2145). crusting, dry-ness and minor epistaxis but these side effects are mildand often transient (2145, 2147, 2149-2151). Changingto another compound or delivery system sometimes elim-inates the side effects. Septal perforations due to a pro-longed use of intranasal glucocorticosteroids rare(2152, 2153). The risk of perforation is greatest duringthe first 12 months of treatment and the majority of casesinvolves young women (2153). The direction of the spray(towards the septum) could have an influence andpatients should always be advised to aim away from theseptum.8-2-4-3-2- Effects on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis Systemic absorption may occur following inhaled and intranasal administration of glucocorticosteroids, but thedose at which clinically relevant side effects occur is con-troversial (2154, 2155). Patients receiving only intranasalglucocorticosteroids appear to be at a very low risk of devel-oping hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppres-sion because of the limited systemic drug availability andthe low doses required (2156, 2157). Studies have shownthat have axis (2135, 2158-2160), except for dexamethasonespray and betamethasone drops, HPA axis (2134, 2166-2173). In one study, the addition of intranasal glucocortico- steroids to intra-bronchial ones did not appear to increaseHPA axis suppression (2174). However, more studies areneeded to fully appreciate the effect of combinedintranasal and intra-bronchial glucocorticosteroids.Moreover, HPA axis suppression does not take intoaccount all potential systemic effects of these drugs. 8-2-4-3-3- Other systemic side effectsOne study describes an effect on children's growth due to beclomethasone (2175). In view of recent concerns(FDA, MCA), more data are required on the safety ofintranasal glucocorticosteroids in young children (2155).The labelling of all intranasal glucocorticosteroids hastherefore been modified in the USA and growth concernshave been indicated. Other side effects such as skin thin-ning, increased cataract formation, glaucoma, metabolicchanges and behavioural abnormalities may be observedwith inhaled (bronchial route) glucocorticosteroids.However, they do not appear to be present in patientsreceiving only intranasal glucocorticosteroids (2154). 8-2-4-3-4- Other side effectsContact of the skin and mucosa to intranasal glucocorticosteroids are rare but have beendescribed (2176, 2177). In one study, central serouschorioretinopathy in 4 patients was apparently related tothe use of intranasal glucocorticosteroid nasal have not been incriminated as ter-atogens and are commonly used by pregnant women whohave asthma. Although the choice of agents should part-ly be based on evidence of foetal safety, the issue ofmaternal health also needs to be considered to provideoptimal management. 8-2-4-4- Molecules 5Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop S233 It is available as a metered-dose pressurised aerosol and as an aqueous spray. The recommended starting dose is 200 \u00b5g daily for adults and 100 \u00b5g daily for children. Double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have shown that it is an effective treatment for seasonal allergicrhinitis (2090, 2130, 2144, 2180, 2181), or perennial well as for non-allergic rhinitis (2185, 2186). It is also allergic rhinitis (2187, 2188). Beclomethasone dipropionate is equally as effective as flunisolide in seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis(2184, 2189-2192). It has been shown been shown, however, that adding loratadineto Intranasal beclomethasone was not found to have an effect on the HPA axis at a dose of 336 \u00b5g daily (2157)but reduced urinary cortisol at 800 \u00b5g daily (2199). An effect on one year's growth has been found in one study (2175). In this study, carried out over one year,it was found that intranasal beclomethasone reducedgrowth by 1 cm in 6-9 year old children receiving stan-dard therapy and these effects were apparent onemonth after starting the drugs. Other systemic adverse effects have not been reported. 8-2-4-4-2- Budesonide Intranasal budesonide is available as a an aqueous spray or as drypowder (2132). The recommended starting dose is 64 to 256 \u00b5g daily for adults and 64 to 128 \u00b5g daily for children over 6years of age. Double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have shown that it is an effective intranasal glucocorticosteroid inseasonal allergic rhinitis rhinitis (2148, 2212-2214). it is effective in seasonal allergic rhinitis (2215-2218) and in perennial rhinitis (2210). A prophylactic effect was also demonstrated when budesonide was given prior to the onset of the pollenseason (2219). Budesonide is effective in patients with nasal polyposis, improving global symptoms (2220-2222), reducing nasalobstruction (2221) and improving sense of smell (2222). In controlled clinical trials, budesonide has been shown to be more effective than beclomethasone inperennial non-allergic (2223) andmometasone than fluticasone (2225). Budesonide wasfound H1-antihistamines (2226). Intranasal budesonide was not found to have an effect on the HPA axis at a dose of 200 \u00b5g daily (2170, 2171)but reduced urinary cortisol in another study (2199). An effect on long-term growth has not been observed. Other systemic effects have not been reported. The long-term safety of budesonide was observed (2227). 8-2-4-4-3- Flunisolide Flunisolide is administered at a dose of 200 \u00b5g daily for adults. Double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have shown that is an effective inseasonal (1284, 2228, 2229) non-allergic rhinitis (2184, 2231-2233). was found to be effective in children (2234, 2235) over the age of 4 years. In controlled clinical trials, flunisolide has been shown to be equally as effective as beclomethasone dipropi-onate (1284, 2189, 2191, 2192) and (2237,2238) or cromoglycate (1284, 2235). Effect on the HPA axis has not been reported. Effect on growth has not been reported. Other systemic effects have not been reported. The excipients polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol can cause transient local irritation. 8-2-4-4-4- Triamcinolone acetonide Triamcinolone acetonide is available as an aerosol as an aqueous metered-dose pump spray with a rec-ommended starting dose of 220 \u00b5g. Double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have shown that it is an glucocorticosteroid inseasonal (2160, adults. Triamcinolone acetonide was found to be effective in children with allergic rhinitis (2247, 2248) within thefirst day of OD intranasal triamcinolone acetonide (220 \u00b5g per day) was equally (84 to 168 \u00b5g BID), loratadine,clemastine and astemizole (2250-2252) and wasequally as effective in reducing associated ocularsymptoms. Intranasal triamcinolone acetonide does not 2160, safety and the ARIA Workshop Group J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL NOVEMBER 2001 a recommended starting dose of 200 \u00b5g OD for adults and 100 \u00b5g OD for children. Double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have shown that it is an effective propionate is effective in children of 4 years and above with seasonal allergic rhinitis (2169,2262, 2263). Fluticasone propionate is effective in children of 5 years and above with perennial allergic rhinitis (2264,2265). In adults with non-allergic, non-infectious perennial rhinitis, fluticasone was clinically effective in onestudy (2258) but not in another one (89). In controlled clinical trials, fluticasone propionate has been shown to be of seasonal and peren-nial allergic rhinitis. Moreover, the use of fluticasonepropionate was more effective than cromoglycate inthe prevention of pollen rhinitis symptoms (2141). Intranasal fluticasone was not found to have an effect on the HPA axis at a dose of 200 \u00b5g daily (2092,2168), even in children (2169). Fluticasone propionate has been shown to be safe also after long-term use (one year) in perennial allergicrhinitis (2145, 2274). After one year of treatment, flu-ticasone was shown to reduce inflammatory cells andto have long-term clinical effects (2167). Fluticasonehas long-term effects on the nasal response to hista-mine in perennial allergic rhinitis and part of thiseffect is likely to be vascular (2128). Treatment with fluticasone propionate partially pre- vents the increase in bronchial pollen season (2275). is administered as an nasal spray with a recommended starting dose of 200\u00b5g daily for adults and for children over 12 years ofage. It is approved from the age of 3 years at a dose of100 \u00b5g daily (2134, 2135). Double-blind, placebo-controlled studies inseasonal (2150, 2276, 2277) and perennial allergic in adults. It is effective in children (2278). Although comparative studies with other intranasal glucocorticosteroids have to be made, one study hasshown that mometasone furoate has a rapid onset ofaction (2143). In controlled rhinitis (2134). Intranasal mometasone furoate was not found to have an effect on the HPA axis at a dose of 200 \u00b5g daily(2135, 2171). In a one year study in children, treatment with mometasone furoate 100 \u00b5g daily did not show growthretardation or suppression of the HPA axis (2279). Long-term administration of mometasone furoate is not associated with adverse tissue changes in the nasalmucosa of patients with perennial rhinitis (2280). 8-2-4-4-7- Other molecules The new intranasal steroid ciclesonide was recently found to be effective in the treatment of allergic rhinitis(2281). 8-2-4-5- The future of nasal glucocorticosteroid treatment Although modern intranasal glucocorticosteroids have all aimed at a high local anti-inflammatory effect com-bined with a low systemic bioavailability, it has not beenpossible to remove all metabolic effects and totally iso-late desired anti-inflammatory properties. Although thesystemic effects of intranasal glucocorticosteroids areprobably not clinically relevant for adult patients withrhinitis alone, children and patients also having asthma(and requiring inhaled glucocorticosteroids) should usethe lowest possible doses. They may need drugs with anequally or more potent local anti-inflammatory activityand with even less systemic activity. 8-2-4-6- RecommendationsA recent meta-analysis has demonstrated that intra- nasal glucocorticosteroids are more efficacious in reduc-ing the symptoms of allergic rhinitis than antihistamines.The advantage was most obvious for nasal blockage(1738). However, in clinical practice, compliance, drugpreference, drug availability and potential side effectsshould be considered. Because intranasal glucocorticosteroids are more effec- tive in moderate to severe rhinitis and can suppress manystages of the allergic inflammatory disease, the therapeuticrisk/benefit ratio has to be considered. Generally, thegroups of patients with persistent allergic rhinitis who usu-ally suffer from nasal blockage are better managed withintranasal glucocorticosteroids. When symptoms are mildor only intermittent, an H1-antihistamine is a good choice.The balance between intranasal glucocorticosteroids andH1-antihistamines has to be individualised. In conclusion, intranasal glucocorticosteroids should be regarded as a highly effective first-line treatment forpatients suffering from allergic and non-allergic rhinitiswith moderate to severe and/or persistent symptoms.Even though intranasal glucocorticosteroids may be lesseffective in 8-2-5- NUMBER 5Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group S235 or as an intramuscular depot preparation in clinical prac- tice. There are relatively little scientific data available tosupport this practice. There is a lack of comparative stud-ies on the preferred dose, the route of administration andthe dose response relationship. There are typical regimensof glucocorticosteroids given orally (e.g. prednisolone,starting and safetySystemic glucocorticosteroids exert their action on a broad spectrum of inflammatory phenomena and areeffective on most symptoms of rhinitis, especially onobstruction (2283, 2284) and loss of smell. No infor-mation is available on the efficacy and safety of therepeated administration of depot glucocorticosteroids.The only controlled comparison between oral andinjected glucocorticosteroids in rhinitis showed a thera-peutic index in favour of the depot-injection (2285).Nevertheless, there are arguments in favour of oraladministration (2284). Oral administration is cheap andthe dosage can be adjusted to the changing need fortreatment. Moreover, it must be remembered that aninjection of 80 mg of methylprednisolone correspondsto 100 mg of prednisolone and that continuous releaseduring the day will suppress the HPA axis moreso thana single oral dose given in the morning for a period ofthree weeks. Depot injections have also been shown tocause local tissue atrophy. The intranasal administration of depot injections into swollen nasal turbinates and polyps should be avoided,since serious adverse events (blindness) have been reported. Since the risk of adverse effects from systemic gluco- corticosteroids largely depends upon the duration oftreatment, only infrequent short-term courses should beprescribed psycholog-ical instability, and other chronic infections. 8-2-5-4- RecommendationsSystemic glucocorticosteroids are never the first line of treatment for allergic rhinitis. They can be used as alast resort of treatment when other treatments are inef-fective. Oral glucocorticosteroids have the advantageover depot injections that treatment adjustments can fol-low the pollen count. Systemic glucocorticosteroids, incontrast to intranasal treatment, reach all parts of thenose and the paranasal sinuses, therefore short courses inpatients with severe perennial rhinitis or nasal polyposiscan be helpful. Systemic glucocorticosteroids should be avoided in children, pregnant women and patients with known con-traindications. 8-2-6- Chromones 8-2-6-1- RationaleThe chromones used disodium cromoglycate (cromolyn, DSCG) andsodium nedocromil. have an unclear mode ofaction in vitro (2286): The action of these drugs is linked to the cell wall of the mast cell (2287, 2288) and/or to the intracellularevents that follow the IgE (2289). inhibits basophils and DSCG inhibitthe these cells (2291). A blockage of the Cl - channels on the mast cell brane, a phosphodiesterase inhibition or amechanism (2292-2294). Disodium cromoglycate was also shown to inhibit IL- 4 induced IgE synthesis (2295). Nedocromil sodium has been shown in vitro to inhibit the activation of neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes,macrophages and mast cells (2296-2301). A \"local has also been hypothe- effect on sensory neural stimula-tion (2302). In vivo human studies have been performed. Nasal challenge studies suggest an inhibition of seasonal rhinitis (2304). In regards to pharmacokinetics, DSCG or nedocromil are virtually not absorbed through mucosal surfaces. Fur-thermore, the swallowed portion is poorly absorbed fromthe gastrointestinal tract and is excreted in the safety8-2-6-2-1- Nasal administration In double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, DSCG 4 times daily has been shown to be effective in the treat-ment or prophylaxis of seasonal allergic rhinitis in not DSCG was effective in double-blind, placebo- in perennial allergic rhinitis in adultsin some (2314-2317) but not all studies (2318). The symptoms of sneezing, rhinorrhea and nasal itch- ing are usually better controlled than nasal obstruction(2304). cromoglycate is usually ineffective in non- allergic, non-infectious rhinitis (88). Although one study (not placebo-controlled) showed an equivalent efficacy of DSCG versus terfenadine(2304), DSCG is usually less effective than BID is more effec- tive than placebo in the treatment of seasonal allergicrhinitis (1366, 2319-2322). In children, the efficacy of nedocromil was also demonstrated (2323). The combined therapy of nedocromil and astemizole appeared more effective than the H1-antihistaminealone (2324). S236 Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL NOVEMBER 2001 It was interesting to note that the efficacy of nedocromil was rapid (2321). Both DSCG and sodium nedocromil are safe and almost totally devoid of side effects, but occasionalminor local side effects have been reported.8-2-6-2-2- Ocular administrationBoth DSCG and nedocromil are available in the form of ocular formulations. Disodium cromoglycate was found to be effective in most (2325-2330) but not all studies (2331). Disodium cromoglycate is usually 2081,2085, 2332). Disodium administered as sin- gle dose units (2333) and this formulation is very con-venient for patients with intermittent symptoms. Disodium cromoglycate eye drops are also effective in vernal keratoconjunctivitis but the efficacy is modest(2334). Ocular DSCG needs a four times daily administration. Regular administration appears to be more effective than a prn schedule (2335). Nedocromil sodium administered BID was found to be safe and effective in seasonal allergic conjunctivitis(2336-2341) and also in vernal keratoconjunctivitis (2342-2344). Efficacy was also found in the treatment of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis in children (2345). The comparison between intranasal levocabastine and nedocromil sodium was only carried out in a challengemodel (2346). No randomised controlled study duringthe pollen season has been carried out. Both DSCG and nedocromil sodium are safe. 8-2-6-3- Recommendations In placebo-controlled trials, DSCG 4 times daily has been shown to be effective in allergic rhinitis and con-junctivitis, although less effective than H1-antihistaminesor intranasal glucocorticosteroids. Nedocromil sodium has also been shown to be effec- tive in allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis and has theadvantage of a BID dosing regimen. In adults, chromones are not a major therapeutic option in the treatment of allergic rhinitis, althoughthey maintain a valued place for the treatment of aller-gic conjunctivitis. In children and pregnant women, chromones can be recommended in view of their excellent safety profile. 8-2-6-4- NAAGA A gel formulation of the anti-allergic compound N- acetyl-aspartyl glutamic acid (NAAGA), a C3 convertaseinhibitor, nasal reaction(2347). In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study,NAAGA was found to be effective in seasonal allergicrhinitis (2348). It was found to be slightly more effectivethan DSCG, but was less well tolerated. It may havesome efficacy on nasal obstruction (2349). 8-2-7- Decongestants striction by their action on receptors (2350). tricyclic antidepressants, phenylpropanolamine)(2359). These or orally. 8-2-7-2- Efficacy 8-2-7-2-1- Intranasal decongestants In the short term, they are very effective in the treat- ment of nasal obstruction for both allergic and non-allergic rhinitis patients (2351, 2352). However, they do not improve nasal itching, sneezing or rhinorrhea. They can also be used for prophylaxis before air trav- el to lessen the likelihood of nasal, middle ear or sinusproblems and to improve nasal patency prior to theadministration of other intranasal medications. Following intranasal administration, local vasocon- striction occurs within 10 minutes, irrespective of thedrug used. The effect lasts for less than 1 hour for epinephrine. The long-lasting effect of oxymetazoline (up to 8-12 hours) and xylometazoline may be explained by theirslow mucosal clearance due to a decreased mucosalblood flow commonly used oral nasal deconges-tants (2360-2362). They can be prescribed for both short and long-term use, although they are usually prescribed short-term togive fast acting relief. Generally, they have a weaker effect on obstruction than the intranasal decongestants, but they do notcause rebound vasodilatation. Vasoconstrictor agents do not improve other symp- toms of rhinitis. Following oral administration, nasal decongestion occurs within 30 minutes and persists for up to 6 hourswith liquid or regular tablet preparations. It persists forup to 8-24 hours with sustained release formulations. Phenylephrine is probably the least effective because of extensive first-pass metabolism (2363). Oral decongestants are used in the treatment of aller- gic rhinitis (2364) and viral upper respiratory tractinfections (2365-2367). They are also used to treatconditions such as sinusitis and otitis. J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL 8-2-7-3- Safety mucosal tions and perforations may occur after intranasal decongestants. Most of the studies with intranasal decongestants show that short-term courses of treatment do not leadto functional or morphological alterations. Decreasingresponsiveness (tolerance) and rebound congestioncharacterised by chronic swelling rarely occur whenthese agents are prescribed for less than 10 days or so. A prolonged use (>10 days) of intranasal vasocon- strictors may lead to risk of developing rhinitis medicamentosahas been considered to be small (2370). However,recent studies have shown that the over use of thesedrugs may result in rebound congestion, nasal hyper-reactivity, tolerance and histological changes of thenasal mucosa (66, 67). Controversy still exists aboutthe treatment of rhinitis medicamentosa and treatmenthas rarely been objectively evaluated. Fluticasone pro-pionate is more effective and has a faster onset ofaction than placebo in the treatment of rhinitismedicamentosa (2371). An adequate treatment ofthese patients consists of a combination of vasocon-strictor withdrawal and intranasal glucocorticosteroidto alleviate the withdrawal process. Moreover, benzlakonium chloride, which is often used as a preservative, induces intranasal side effects(1662). 8-2-7-3-2- Systemic side effects Systemic side effects are not uncommon with these oral drugs and include irritability, dizziness,headaches, tremor and insomnia. Tachycardia (2372), especially in susceptible subjects such as pregnant women (2373), and hypertension(2374, 2375) may occur, as well as some less commoneffects such as visual hallucinations (2376). Most of these side effects are dose-dependent. There- fore, care should be exercised when giving the drugsto patients with cardiovascular diseases such as hyper-tension and myocardial ischaemia due to the systemicvasoconstrictor effects. Patients with glaucoma or hyperthyroidism and elder- ly men with urinary retention due to prostate enlarge-ment are also at risk with oral sympathomimeticdecongestants. These agents should also be used with caution in preg- nant women, as the medication will be transferred tothe foetus via the systemic circulation. 8-2-7-4- Recommendations In general, because of the risk of rhinitis medicamen- tosa, the use of intranasal decongestants should belimited to a duration of less than 10 days (2377). Short courses of intranasal decongestants can be use- ful to promptly reduce severe nasal blockage while co-administering other drugs. Decongestants should be used with care in children under one year of age because of the narrow rangebetween therapeutic and toxic doses (40). Furthermore, it is advised not to prescribe pseu- doephedrine to patients over 60 years of age, to preg-nant women (2378) and, in general, to patients suffer-ing from hypertension, cardiopathy, hyperthyroidism,prostatic hypertrophy, glaucoma and psychiatric disor-ders taking -blockers or mono- oxidase amine (MAO) inhibitors. 8-2-7-5- Combinations of oral antihistamines and decongestants In many countries, combinations of oral antihista- mines and decongestants are commonly prescribed.The aims of these combinations are also to improvenasal obstruction which changes minimally whenusing H1-antihistamines alone. However, the pharmacokinetics of the two drugs in the combination are not similar and these drugs are oftenadministered BID. The combination bears all the side effects of H1- antihistamines and vasoconstrictors, and food limited number of double-blind, placebo-controlled studies document the clini-cally relevant superiority of the combination over H1antihistamines alone. There is, however, a study in asthma showing that the combination is more effective than antihistamines incontrolling bronchial symptoms (2393). There are many OTC drugs combining sedative oral antihistamines with vasoconstrictors. Even thoughsome studies have shown their effectiveness (2394),these should no longer be used since sedation is notusually reduced by stimulation from vasoconstric-tors, and the duration of action of antihistamines isusually T opical anti-cholinergics fibres originate in the superior saliva- tory nucleus of the brainstem and relay in thesphenopalatine ganglion before distributing to the nasalglands and blood vessels (2395, 2396). Parasympatheticstimulation causes a mediated by theclassical autonomic transmitter acetylcholine, and avasodilatation of blood vessels serving the glands. Themuscarinic receptors of the sero-mucinous glands can beblocked by the anticholinergic drug ipratropium bromide(2397, 2398), which is available spray (pressurised aerosol or aqueousS238 the ARIA Workshop Group J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL NOVEMBER 2001 pump spray). The recommended daily dose ranges between 120 and 320 \u00b5g given in 3 to 6 administrations(2399, 2400). 8-2-8-2- Efficacy Intranasally applied atropine was shown to rhi- in patients with is poorly absorbed by the nasalmucosa because of a low lipid solubility and it doesnot cross the blood-brain barrier (2398). ipra- tropium bromide is effective in controlling waterynasal discharge, but it does not affect sneezing or nasalobstruction in perennial allergic and non-allergic(vasomotor) rhinitis (2400, 2402-2410). It is also effective in the common cold (2411), in gus- tatory rhinitis and rhinitis in elderly people (2412). A single dose of 42 \u00b5g per nostril reduces the secretion for 3 hours due to methacholine stimulation. 168 \u00b5gdoubles the effect (48% reduction) and its duration inperennial non-allergic rhinitics (2408, 2413). The onset of action is fast (15 to 30 minutes), but max- imal improvement of symptoms is generally notedseveral hours after the first treatment. No tolerance develops in clinical effects (2414). Combination therapy has also been studied in patients with allergic or non-allergic perennial rhinitis. Thecombination of an agent for thetreatment of rhinorrhea (2416). 8-2-8-3- Safety Topical side effects, due to the anti-cholinergic action, are uncommon and usually dose-dependant in theirseverity. Nasal dryness, irritation and burning are themost prominent effects, followed by a stuffy nose, drymouth and headache (2399, 2407, 2414). Olfaction,ciliary beat frequency and the clinical appearance ofthe nasal mucosa are not affected, even with long-termuse. The systemic bioavailability of intranasal ipratropium is about 10% and systemic side effects are rare (2399,2407, 2417), but they can occur with doses higher than400 \u00b5g/day (2417). 8-2-8-4- Recommendations Studies performed in demonstrated that ipratropium bromide only improvesnasal hyper-secretion. No data are available for seasonal rhinitis. Since patients with perennial rhinitis usually suffer also from nasal congestion, itching and sneezing, otherdrugs are preferable as first-line agents to ipratropiumin the vast majority of cases of allergic rhinitis. However, the ipratropium bromide nasal spray alone should be considered in patients for whom rhinorrheais the primary symptom. Its use in combination with an intranasal glucocorti- costeroid or an H1-antihistamine may be considered inpatients where rhinorrhea is the predominant symp-tom, or in patients with rhinorrhea who are not fullyresponsive to other therapies. Moreover, ipratropium may be used in patients with or without allergic rhinitis who suffer from rhinorrheawhen in contact with cold air. In elderly patients, ipratropium may be of interest in the treatment of isolated rhinorrhea. 8-2-9- Anti-leukotrienes CysLTs appear to be important mediators of nasal aller- gic reactions, and their insufflation into the nose inducesnasal obstruction. Drugs acting against CysLT may there-fore be important in the treatment of allergic rhinitis eitheralone or combined with H1-antihistamines since these drugsare poorly effective in nasal obstruction (2418). However,the data available do not allow any firm conclusions. Zileuton, a 5-LO inhibitor, was found to reduce nasal obstruction (2419). The efficacy of single oral doses ofthe CysLT-receptor antagonist, zafirlukast, was tested insubjects with acute seasonal allergic rhinitis during atwo-day study in a park exposure (2420). Nasal conges-tion improved more than sneezing and rhinorrhea. Inanother study, 33 patients with seasonal allergic rhinitiswere enrolled in a randomised double-blind study totreatments with oral (20 beclomethasone dipropionate (200 \u00b5g twice aday) or placebo (2421). Patients receiving treatment withzafirlukast had degrees of nasal symptoms similar tothose in the placebo group, whereas the beclomethasonegroup had significantly less symptoms compared withboth treatments. The numbers of activated eosinophils inthe nasal tissue increased significantly during the pollenseason in both the zafirlukast and the placebo groups, butnot in the beclomethasone group. These results wereobtained with a limited number of patients and do notsupport the clinical efficacy of regular treatment with anoral antileukotriene in seasonal allergic rhinitis. Moredata are needed. In seasonal allergic rhinitis, the combination of a CysLT receptor antagonist, montelukast and loratadineshowed that symptoms of rhinitis and conjunctivitis weremore effectively treated with the combination of thesedrugs as opposed to any one of them alone or with theplacebo (2422). It is believed that anti-leukotriene drugs will adopt a prominent role in the treatment of aspirin-sensitive rhinitisand asthma. The evidence is still preliminary. In the firstcontrolled study published so far, the 5-LO inhibitor Zileu-ton notably diminished nasal dysfunction in these patients(2423). It also caused a remarkable return of sense ofsmell, less rhinorrhea and higher Workshop Group S239 8-2-10- Oral anti-allergic drugs In Japan and Eastern Asia, many so-called \"oral anti- allergic\" drugs such as pemirolast are used in the treat-ment of allergic rhinitis. These drugs display anti-allergicproperties in vitro and in animal models by blocking therelease of mediators. The efficacy of these drugs hasrarely been tested using double-blind, placebo-controlledstudies. One pilot study, carried out on a small number ofpatients, showed that pemirolast was effective in thetreatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis (2424). 8-2-11- T reatments with a lack of demonstra- ble efficacy The use of alternative medicine for the treatment of asthma in adults and children is common and increasing(2425). There is an urgent need for large, randomised andcontrolled clinical trials for alternative therapies of aller-gic disease and rhinitis. Scientific and clinical supportsof these therapies are lacking (2426). 8-2-11-1- HomeopathyThe preparation of homeopathic drugs is based on potentiation. In a controlled randomised double-blindtrial with 164 patients, the effectiveness of homeopathi-cally prepared Galphimia dilution 10 -6and a placebo was investigated for the therapy of pollinosis. The aver-age duration of treatment was about 5 weeks. No statisti-cal significant improvement was achieved with home-opathy (2427). In and sulfur a similar effect as intranasal DSCG (2428). However, inthis study, pollen counts were not recorded, making itdifficult to interpret the data. In two other studies, homeopathic dilutions of house dust mite or grass pollen extract were administered andthere was a significant improvement in placebo (2429,2430). However, the methodology of these studies raisessome concern and no firm conclusions regarding theresults can be reached. 8-2-11-2- AcupunctureAcupuncture has been proposed in some studies (2431-2434) but the only study attempting to validatethis method in asthma suggested that there was no bene-fit from the treatment (2435). 8-2-11-3- ChiropracticChiropractic medicine is used in certain countries for the treatment of rhinosinusitis (2436), but there is nostudy in Medline to support its use. 8-2-11-4- Traditional medicine and phytotherapyThe use of herbal medicine, often from Chinese ori- gin, is widespread and growing (2437). Many herbalmedicines have a significant pharmacological activityand thus potential adverse effects and drug interactions(2438-2440). Traditional medicine is used in manypatients to treat the symptoms of allergic and non-allergic rhinitis. Most of the studies are uncontrolled andno data are reported in the Medline from controlled stud-ies. Mao-bushi-saishin-to, a Chinese blended medicine,was examined in a controlled (but not-placebo) study andfound to reduce nasal obstruction in patients with Japan-ese cedar pollen allergy (2441). Ayurvedic medicine is used (2442) to treat asthma and rhinitis (2443, 2444). There is, however, no controlledclinical study reported in Medline to support its use inrhinitis. 8-2-11-5- Other alternative therapiesA large number of alternative therapies are offered including balneology, Kneipp therapy, microbiologicaltherapy, fasting, excretion therapy, therapy, environ-mental medicine, anthroposophy, neural therapy, elec-troaccupuncture according to V oll and similar therapies,nasal reflex therapy, reflex-zone massage, manual therapy,massage, lymph drainage, aromatherapy, thermotherapy,bioresonance, kinesiology, hopi candles and dietetics(2445). However, none of these therapies have been appro-priately scientifically and clinically tested and some mayeven be dangerous. The so-called bioresonance therapy or biophysical information therapy claims to improve the condition ofpatients with atopic disease. However, a conventional,double-blind, placebo-controlled study in hospitalisedchildren with atopic dermatitis did not find this treatmentto be effective (2446). No controlled studies have beencarried out in rhinitis. 8-2-11-6- YogaYoga may improve breathing but even in asthma, no clear efficacy was demonstrated (2447). In allergic rhini-tis, there is no controlled study supporting its use. 8-2-11-7- RecommendationsNone of the methods used in alternative medicine can be supported scientifically to be clinically effective. Thepublic should be warned against methods of diagnosisand treatment which may be costly and which have notbeen validated (2448). Properly designed randomisedclinical trials are required to assess the value of theseforms of treatment. 8-2-12- Antibiotics In non-complicated rhinitis, nasal douche or a sterile sea water spray was shown to improvesymptoms of rhinitis (2449). 8-2-14- Surgical treatment of rhinitis As surgery cannot contribute to the treatment of aller- gic disease itself, it should only be used in certain condi-tions such as turbinate hypertrophy, cartilaginous or bonyobstruction of the nasal airways or secondary and inde-pendent sinus disease. In patients who suffer from peren-nial allergic or non-allergic rhinitis for many years, asevere drug-resistant hypertrophy of the inferiorturbinates may develop, which leads to constant nasalS240 Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL NOVEMBER 2001 obstruction and watery secretion due to an increase in glandular structures. The surgical reduction of the inferi-or turbinate body and mucosal surface, which shouldalways be reduce nasal obstruction andsecretion (2450). Endoscopically controlled minimal-invasive techniques for the sinuses and the turbinateshave replaced former procedures in most countries, and arange of new tools and instruments has been created toallow for more precise and less traumatic surgery. Lasersurgery (2451) may also be used. Vidian neurectomy isnot indicated for rhinitis because of the side effects(2452) and the availability of medical treatment (954).The indication for nasal and sinus surgery should alwaysbe based on the insufficient effect of adequate drug treat-ment and the functional and clinical relevance of theanatomical variation or disease. Indications for surgical intervention are: drug-resistant inferior turbinate hypertrophy, anatomical variations of the septum with functional relevance, anatomical variations of the bony pyramid with func- tional/aesthetic relevance, secondary or independently developing chronic sinusi- tis 2454), different forms forms) other pathologies unrelated to allergy (cerebro-spinalfluid leak, inverted papilloma, benign and malignanttumours, Wegener's disease, etc.). 8-2-15- Aspirin intolerance 8-2-15-1- Avoidance of aspirin and other NSAIDIn order to prevent life-threatening reactions, patients with aspirin-intolerant rhinitis/asthma should avoidaspirin, all products containing aspirin and other anal-gesics that inhibit COX (938, 2456, 2457) (Table 6). Theeducation of physicians and patients regarding this mat-ter is extremely important. The patient should obtain alist of drugs that are contraindicated, preferably withboth the generic and trade names. If necessary, thesepatients can take acetaminophen or paracetamol; it issafer not to exceed a (2458). Sodiumsalicylate, benzydamine (2459), azapropazone (2460)and of nimesulide, a COX-2 inhibitor, was studied in patients with aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatorydrug intolerance and it was found that this COX-2inhibitor induced less reactions than aspirin itself (2461). In patients with aspirin-sensitive eosinophilic rhinitis, aspirin toleranceIn aspirin-intolerant patients suffering from rhinosi- nusitis and asthma, a state of aspirin tolerance can beinduced and maintained by aspirin desensitisation. Smallincremental oral doses of aspirin are ingested over thecourse of 2 to 3 days until 400 to 650 mg of aspirin is tol-erated. Aspirin can then be administered daily, with dosesof 80 to 325 mg used to maintain desensitisation. Aftereach dose of aspirin, there is a refractory period of 2 to 5days, during which aspirin and other COX inhibitors canbe taken with impunity. However, stopping the treatmentfor longer may be dangerous since new administrations ofaspirin or another NSAID can induce symptoms as severeas before tolerance. This is important for patients withaspirin intolerance who have degenerative joint diseases,rheumatic diseases and headaches, and as a preventivemeasure for the treatment of vascular diseases (2463). Bronchial and nasal routes have also been used in aspirin desensitisation (2464). The clinical benefits of aspirin tolerance on asthma and rhinitis are not clear. Most studies did not show along-term improvement. During the state of aspirindesensitisation, if the aspirin dose is increased to 650 mgBID and is taken continuously, some patients may expe-rience an improvement in their chronic respiratory symp-toms and signs, especially in the nose (148, 2463, 2464).The ideal candidate for this treatment may be a patientwith aspirin-induced asthma who has just completedsinus/polyp surgery. Aspirin desensitisation treatmentwas shown to delay the recurrence of nasal polyp forma-tion by an average of 6 years. The mechanism of aspirin desensitisation in patients with aspirin-induced asthma is only partially understood.It may lead to a reduction of airway responsiveness toLTE 4because of the down regulation of CysLT receptors, which reduces receptor responsiveness to the same bur-den of CysLT. At acute desensitisation, urinary LT levelsare the same as baseline levels and are therefore clearlyavailable for the stimulation of CysLT receptors. Patientsmaintained for months in a state of aspirin desensitisa-tion still respond to oral aspirin challenge with a rise inLTE 4urinary excretion, although the responses were blunted when compared with the original aspirin chal-lenges and the patients were all asymptomatic. 8-3- ALLERGEN SPECIFIC THERAPEUTIC VACCINES FOR ALLERGICDISEASES 8-3-1- Introduction Allergen specific immunotherapy is the practice of administering gradually increasing quantities of an allergenvaccine to an allergic subject in order to ameliorate symp-toms associated with subsequent exposure to the causativeallergen. Allergen immunotherapy was introduced in 1911by Noon and Freeman to treat \"pollinosis\" or allergic rhini-tis (1301). There is good evidence that immunotherapyusing inhalant allergens to treat seasonal or perennial aller-gic rhinitis and asthma is clinically effective. Guidelines and indications for specific immunotherapy with inhalant allergens have been published over the pastyears by WHO (2465, 2466), the European Academy ofAllergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) (2467-2469),the International Consensus Report on (35), theJ CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 108, NUMBER 5Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group S241 Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention (36), the International Consensus Report on Rhinitis (1),the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology(2470), the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma andImmunology (AAAAI) and the American College ofAllergy, Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI) (2471).These reports provide guidelines for a better understand-ing of the use of allergen specific immunotherapy. Vaccines are utilised in medicine as immune modifiers, as is allergen specific immunotherapy. Knowledge gainedfrom studies of allergic mechanisms, such as the impor-tance of Th1 and Th2 cells, cytokine regulation of theimmune responses and specific inhibition or ablation ofpathogenic immune responses by means of toleranceinduction, may be applicable to a variety of allergic andother immunological diseases. This is especially true forautoimmune diseases such as juvenile diabetes mellitus andmultiple sclerosis. Thus, the concepts utilised and the sci-entific data which support the use of allergen immunother-apy to treat allergic diseases are now being scientificallyapplied to other immunological diseases. The recent WHOposition paper has therefore been entitled \"AllergenImmunotherapy, Therapeutic Vaccines for Allergic Dis-eases\" to indicate that vaccines (allergen extracts) whichmodify or down regulate the immune response for allergicdiseases are part of this broad based category of therapiesdeveloped to treat other immunological diseases (2466). 8-3-2- T reatment strategy The treatment strategy of allergic rhinitis implies symptom reduction by drugs and attempts to interfere inthe inflammatory cascade by anti-inflammatory drugs orspecific immunotherapy. The relative advantage of thesetwo different interventions is unknown, but theoretically,combining interventions at different levels shouldimprove the clinical outcome. Allergen avoidance isalways the first-line treatment and, although not com-pletely effective (1621), it may reduce the need for furtherintervention. Drug treatment is often the next logical stepfor reducing disease severity. However, in patients with aconstant need for pharmacotherapy, the advantages ofinstituting specific immunotherapy early in the evolutionof the disease (e.g. while the severity of the disease is stillmodest and at a time when the possibility to prevent dete-rioration into asthma is at its highest) should be seriouslyconsidered (2466, 2469, 2472). Immunotherapy can sig-nificantly reduce the severity of allergic disease and theneed for anti-allergic drugs, consequently improving thequality of life for allergic patients (2473). A significant proportion of rhinitis patients have min- imal persistent inflammation during allergen exposure inthe lower airways (9). This inflammation is often under-diagnosed and therefore inadequately treated. Specificimmunotherapy might, as the only treatment, improveinflammation independently of the shock organ. Allergeninduced IgE-mediated inflammation should therefore beseen as a multi-organ disease and specific immunothera-py should be based on the allergen sensitisation ratherthan on the specific disease (2466). In many patients, drug treatment insufficiently con- trols symptoms, and patient satisfaction is poor (2474).Moreover, some patients experience side effects fromdrugs. Specific immunotherapy was shown to improvesymptoms and decrease the medication needs of patientswith severe rhinoconjunctivitis (2475). The advantages of combining allergen drug treatment Allergen standardisation The quality of the allergen vaccine is critical for both diagnosis and treatment. Where possible, standardisedvaccines of known potency and shelf-life should be used(2476). The most common vaccines used in clinical aller-gy practice are now available as standardised products orare pending standardisation. However, there are manyvaccines currently being marketed (many of which areonly used occasionally) and it is neither feasible nor eco-nomically possible to standardise all of them. The mea-surement of major allergens for standardisation is now arealistic and desirable goal (2466, 2477). Several aller-gen units are used. Among them are the following: IU (international unit), AU (allergy unit), BAU (biological allergy unit), BU (biological unit), IR (index of reactivity), TU (therapeutic unit). In the European Pharmacopeia, allergen preparations for specific immunotherapy include (2476): unmodified vaccines, vaccines modified chemically (e.g. formaldehyde allergoids), vaccines modified by adsorption onto different carri- ers (so-called depot-vaccines). Modified and depot vaccines have been developed to make specific immunotherapy more effective and toreduce the risk of side effects. Allergen vaccines should be marketed only if their potency, composition and stability have been document-ed as: vaccines from a single source material, mixtures of related, cross-reacting allergen vaccines such as grass pollen vaccines, deciduous tree pollenvaccines, related ragweed pollen vaccines and relatedmite vaccines mixtures of other allergen vaccines provided that sta- bility data (2478) and data on clinical efficacy areavailable. Where mixtures are marketed, the relativeamounts of each component of the mixture should beindicated on the label. 8-3-4- Mechanisms Specific immunotherapy is specific to the antigen administered (2479). The mechanisms of specificimmunotherapy are complex (2480, 2481) and may dif-S242 Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL NOVEMBER 2001 fer depending on the allergen (venoms or inhalant aller- gens) and the route of immunisation. Early studies immunoglobulin levels (IgE, IgG and It seemshowever that clinical benefit is not associated withimmunoglobulin levels (2485). It is however possiblethat the binding capacity of immunoglobulins is mod-ified during specific immunotherapy. Data are lackingto confirm this hypothesis. Newer studies suggest that specific immunotherapy acts by modifying T-cell responses either by immunedeviation (increase in Th0/Th1), by T-cell anergy(decrease in Th2/Th0) or, more likely, by both (2486-2489). The role of IL-10 may be of importance (2490). Systemic and local increases in CD8 +cells have also been observed (2491). Specific immunotherapy also reduces inflammatory cell recruitment and activation as well as mediatorsecretion (2492-2495). The mechanisms of local immunotherapy are still unclear, but a systemic effect is likely since serumimmunoglobulin changes can be seen. The role of thisform of treatment on the Th1/Th2 cytokine immunotherapyImmunotherapy dosing raises contrasting efficacy and safety issues. Low dose specific immunotherapy is ineffec-tive (2497, 2498) and high doses of allergen vaccine mayinduce a high and unacceptable rate of systemic reactions(2499). It has been proposed that optimal doses of vaccinesbe provided either in biological units or in the weight ofmajor allergens present (2466). The optimal dose is definedas the dose of allergen vaccine, which induces a clinicallyrelevant effect in the majority of patients without causingunacceptable side effects (2500). Doses of 5 to 20 \u00b5g of themajor allergen are optimal for most allergen vaccines (forreview see 2466). The majority of patients with allergic dis-ease can tolerate this target dose without difficulty. Howev-er, in selected individuals who have experienced reactionsduring their build up treatment phase, a lower maintenancedose may be necessary. As with any therapeutic approach,the risk-benefit ratio must be carefully considered to deter-mine whether specific immunotherapy should be continued. The efficacy of subcutaneous specific immunotherapy has been documented in most double-blind, placebo-controlled studies published in allergic rhinitis (and usu-ally induced (2528, 2529), house dust-mite (2530-2535), cat. Many studies found that bronchial symptoms improve during cat specific immunotherapy (2536-2541), but nasal symptoms were not monitored.Because cat specific immunotherapy is effective forasthma, it is likely that it is also effective for rhinitis. The mould Alternaria (1609). There is no study for Specific immunotherapy with house dust, , bacterial vaccines (2542) or other undefined allergens is ineffective and not recommended (forreview see 2466). In 43 placebo-controlled, double-blind studies, immunotherapy was compared with place-bo treatment. Immunotherapy resulted in a mean reductionin symptoms of 45%, compared with placebo. This isequivalent to, or even better than, the efficacy obtainedwith most drugs (2543). A recent meta-analysis using theCochrane collaboration method showed that specificimmunotherapy is effective in treating asthma (2544). 8-3-5-2- Nasal immunotherapy The efficacy of high allergen dose specific immunotherapy has been documented in most double-blind, placebo-controlled studies carried out in allergicrhinitis (and often also when induced by: pollen (2557-2560) house dust Lower doses are not effective. 8-3-5-3- Sublingual-swallow immunotherapy Efficacy of high allergen dose sublingual-swallow specific immunotherapy (at least 50 to 100 times thecumulative dose of subcutaneous immunotherapy) hasbeen documented in double-blind, out grass pollen 2567-2569), house dust mite (2473, 2570-2572). Lower doses are not effective. In one study, sublingual-swallow specific immuno-ther- apy was found to be slightly less effective than subcuta-neous specific immunotherapy, but still showed a clinicallyrelevant efficacy (2570). However, new data are pendingand no firm conclusion concerning the relative efficacy ofboth forms can be drawn before the results of these studies. 8-3-5-4- Oral immunotherapyThe efficacy of oral specific immunotherapy in rhini- tis has been documented in some (2573) but not all dou-ble-blind, placebo-controlled can sys- temic allergic reactions. The risk of serious anaphylacticreactions is lower in rhinitis patients than in asthmapatients and the ARIA Workshop Group S243 In a recent review (2543), approximately 20% of the studies on immunotherapy efficacy did not provideinformation about side effects. In about 20% of the stud-ies, no systemic side effects were reported. In all thestudies, the mean frequency of systemic side effects was14%, with the majority being rather mild with few life-threatening reactions. However, systemic reactions represent a general lim- itation in the use of specific immunotherapy. There-fore, such strategies have to be carried out by a spe-cialist who is aware of the risks. Injections should beperformed or supervised by physicians who are able toeffectively treat systemic reactions (2466, 2468).Major side effects include severe asthma and anaphy-laxis (2581, 2582). It is therefore important to min-imise risks (Table 18). 8-3-6-2- Local immunotherapyWith intranasal specific immunotherapy, the only reported systemic side effect is asthma (probably causedby an incorrect administration of allergen vaccine). In one study with sublingual specific immunotherapy, some serious systemic side effects (asthma, urticaria andgastrointestinal complaints) were observed in children(2572). However, in all other studies, only mild reactionswere observed, even in children with asthma (2473,2562-2571, 2583). A post-marketing surveillance of sub-lingual-swallow specific immunotherapy showed thatthis procedure appeared to be well tolerated in children(2584). Since local specific immunotherapy is self-administered at home, patients should be informed of the potentialrisks of a systemic reaction and how to treat such a reac-tion should it occur (2466). 8-3-7- Immunotherapy alters the natural course of allergic disease and may preventasthma Although drugs are highly effective and usually well tolerated, they only represent symptomatic treatment.Specific immunotherapy is the only treatment that mayalter the natural course of the disease (2466). Long-term efficacy of specific immunotherapy after it has been stopped has been shown for sub-cutaneous spe-cific immunotherapy (2585-2589). In one of grass pollen immunotherapy remained effectivefor at least 3 years after the discontinuation of the injec-tions. In both the group that received maintenanceimmunotherapy and the group that discontinuedimmunotherapy, clinical improvement was accompaniedby a notable decrease in the late skin test response to aller-gen challenge. The results confirm prolonged clinical ben-efit and provide evidence of decreased immunologicalreactivity for at least 3 years after the discontinuation ofimmunotherapy for pollen-induced seasonal allergic rhini-tis. In the study concerning ragweed-sensitive patients byNaclerio et al. (2588), the discontinuation of immunother- apy was accompanied by a partial recrudescence of imme-diate allergen-induced responses, even though there was acontinued suppression of symptoms. In a retrospectivestudy of mite-sensitive children, immunotherapy, whencontinued for more than 3 years, was associated with amore prolonged remission of symptoms when comparedto patients who had received immunotherapy for less than3 years (2587). Long-term efficacy still has to be docu-mented for local specific immunotherapy (2590). Specific immunotherapy is used to improve the symp- toms of allergic diseases but it may have a preventive effi-cacy. Allergic sensitisation usually begins early in life andsymptoms often start within the first decade. It has beenshown that specific immunotherapy is less effective inolder patients than in children. In addition, inflammationand remodelling of the airways in asthma indicates a poorprognosis for effective treatment with specific immuno-therapy (2591). Moreover, if specific immunotherapy isused as preventive treatment, it should be started as soon asallergy has been diagnosed (2472). To determine whether specific immunotherapy with standardised allergen vaccines could prevent the develop-ment of new sensitisations over a 3 year follow-up survey,a prospective non-randomised study was carried out in apopulation of asthmatic children aged under 6 years whoseonly allergic sensitivity was to house dust mites (2592). Inthis study, 22 children who were monosensitised to housedust mites and who were receiving specific immunothera-py with standardised allergen vaccines were comparedwith 22 children of the same age who were monosensi-tised to house dust mites and who were taken as controls.Approximately 45% of the children receiving specificimmunotherapy did not develop new sensitivities com-pared to none in the control group. This study suggestedTABLE 18: Recommendations to minimise risk and improve efficacy of immunotherapy. From the Inter-national Consensus Report on Diagnosis and Man- agement of Asthma Specific immunotherapy needs to be prescribed by specialists and administered by physicians trained to manage systemicreactions if anaphylaxis occurs. Patients with multiple sensitivities may not benefit from specific immunotherapy as much as patients with a singlesensitivity. More data are necessary. Patients with non-allergic triggers will not benefit from specific immunotherapy. Specific immunotherapy is more effective in children and young adults than in later life. It is essential, for safety reasons, that patients should be asymptomatic at the time of the injections because lethaladverse reactions are more often found in asthma patientswith severe airways obstruction. FEV 1with pharmacological treatment should reach at least 70% of the predicted values, for both efficacy and safety reasons. From (35)S244 Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL NOVEMBER 2001 that specific immunotherapy in patients monosensitised to house dust mites alters the natural course of allergy in pre-venting the development of new sensitisations. When specific immunotherapy is introduced to patients with only allergic rhino-conjunctivitis, specificimmunotherapy may stop the development of asthma.The early study of Johnstone and Dutton (2593) asthma to stopthe development of asthma?\", the Preventive AllergyTreatment (PAT) study has been started in children agedfrom 7 to 13 (2594, 2595). This study is performed as amulti-centre study in Austria, Denmark, Finland, Ger-many and Sweden. After two years of specific immuno-therapy, a significantly greater number of children in thecontrol group developed asthma as compared to theactive specific immunotherapy group. It is therefore proposed that specific immunotherapy should be started early in the disease process in order tomodify the spontaneous long-term progress of the aller-gic inflammation and (1461, 2466, 2468). 8-3-8- Indications 8-3-8-1- General considerationsDouble-blind, placebo-controlled con- firmed the efficacy of immunotherapy. Clinical efficacydoes not necessarily mean clinical indication, especiallysince controlled trials of immunotherapy are optimallydesigned and may not always be applicable to daily med-ical practice. Safe and effective pharmacological treatmentis also available for the treatment of allergic diseases.Thus, before starting immunotherapy, it is essential toappreciate the value of allergen avoidance, pharmacother-apy and immunotherapy. Certain factors must be consid-ered before beginning immunotherapy (2466): demonstration that the disease is due to an IgE- mediated allergy (Table 19), determination of all the symptoms caused by the allergens, assessment of the allergen exposure and, before initi- ating immunotherapy, attempt at avoiding exposure tothe allergen(s) which are causing the symptoms of theIgE-mediated reaction. However, most commonaeroallergens cannot be completely avoided, and thisis particularly true for patients allergic to house dustmites or to multiple allergens, potential severity of the disease to be treated, efficacy of available treatment modalities, patient's attitude to available treatment modalities, quality of allergen vaccines used for treatment. When possible, standardised allergens should be utilised, cost and duration of each form of treatment, risk incurred from the allergic diseases and the various forms of treatment. finally, assessment of the patient's attitude to treating symptoms versus trying to interfere with the patho-physiology of the disease, and discussion with thepatient of treatment alternatives. The patient (and theparents in the case of children) should be carefullyinformed of the risk, duration and effectiveness of thetreatment. Their co-operation and compliance areabsolute requirements when considering specificimmunotherapy (40, 2466, 2468) . The indications for specific immunotherapy in asthma and rhinitis have been separated in some guidelines andthis artificial separation has led to unresolved questions(2596, 2597), possibly because the IgE-mediated reac-tion has not been considered as a multiple organ involve-ment. It is therefore important to consider specificimmunotherapy based on the allergen sensitisation ratherthan on a particular disease manifestation (2466). Young patients (children) respond better than adults, especially for asthma (2591). This is probably related tothe duration of the disease, implying that attempts tointerfere with the natural course of the disease should beintroduced at a time where the patient has the capacityto respond positively. In this way, specific immunother-apy does not take the position of being an ultimate treat-TABLE 19: Considerations for initiating immunother- apy.

Some paediatricians recommend injection specific immunotherapy in children at 1-2 years of age, but it isdesirable to evaluate more closely in controlled studiesthe benefits of specific immunotherapy in patients below5 years of age. At the moment, it is not known whetherspecific immunotherapy should be administered to veryyoung children. Usually it is started after the age (1461, carefully selected patients with rhinitis, conjunctivi- tis and/or asthma caused by pollen, house dust mite orcat allergy.

However, the dose of vaccine should be far higher than for subcutaneous immunotherapy and, at least for sublin-gual immunotherapy, the cumulative dose should be 100times greater, or more. In the WHO and EAACI position papers (2466, 2469), only four studies were available for sublingualimmunotherapy, and due to the side effects reported inone paper, sublingual specific immunotherapy was notrecommended in children. Several other papers havenow been published and pharmacosurveillance datahave shown that sublingual specific immunotherapydoes not induce severe side effects in children. In thisPosition Paper, it is proposed that sublingual specificimmunotherapy can be administered in children andadults. 8-3-9- contraindications for immunotherapy include (2468): serious immunopathological and immunodeficiency diseases, malignancy, severe psychological disorders, treatment with -blockers, even when administered topically, poor compliance, severe asthma uncontrolled by pharmacotherapy and/or patients with irreversible airways obstruction(FEV 1is consistently under 70% of predicted values after adequate pharmacological treatment) (35), significant cardiovascular diseases which increase the risk of side effects from epinephrine, children under 5 years of age unless there are specific indications (35, 1461, 2466). Pregnancy is not considered as a contraindication for the continuation of immunotherapy, but, in general, treat-ment should not be started during pregnancy. 8-3-10- Recommendations In order to make the patient as symptom-free as possi- ble, immunotherapy is indicated as a supplement toallergen avoidance and as a drug treatment in patientswith rhinitis predominantly induced by dominatingallergens. Immunotherapy should be initiated early in the disease process to reduce the risk of side effects and to preventthe further development of severe disease. Argumentsfor specific immunotherapy are: Insufficient response to conventional pharmacotherapy, side effects from drugs rejection of drug treatment. Injection (subcutaneous) specific immunotherapy may be used in severe or prolonged allergic rhinitis(eventually associated with asthma), Local (intranasal and sublingual-swallow) specific immunotherapy may be considered in selectedpatients with systemic side effects and with refusal toinjection treatment. 8-4- FUTURE POTENTIAL TREATMENT MODALITIES The management of allergic rhinitis can be divided into three basic approaches, namely allergen avoidance,pharmacotherapy (2598) and specific immunotherapy. Health economics is becoming an increasing fun- damental consideration for any novel approach. Thishas to take into account the disease burden, the cost,efficacy and side effect profile of current standardtherapies and the impact and potential advantages ofany development as well as the cost of its applica-tion. There are a variety of novel approaches cur-rently under evaluation for the modification of aller-gic inflammation at differing stages of development.These range from their evaluation in in vitro cell sys- tems and assessment in animal models to humanclinical trial evaluation. The potential use of theseS246 Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL NOVEMBER 2001 therapies would have to be considered against H1- antihistamines and intranasal glucocorticosteroids(the two main pharmacological therapies for allergicrhinitis), as well as on their profile against other co-existing allergic conditions such as asthma. Researchin this area has been driven by a search for diseasemodifying therapies for asthma, a disease conditionthat would bear a higher therapeutic cost on accountof its life-threatening nature and health care costs(indirect and direct). Thus, any future approaches torhinitis management would have to be considered asto whether they would be utilised both for rhinitisand asthma or for rhinitis alone. It is apparent from the review on allergen avoidance that little has been formally undertaken to assess the ben-efits of this in allergic rhinitis, particularly perennialallergic rhinitis associated with sensitisation to indoorallergens. The widespread benefit of such an approach isappealing and warrants the initial cost if proven to behelpful, whereas such an initiative purely for rhinitis maybe considered uneconomic. On the other hand, in patientswith rhinitis and asthma, such an approach is more eco-nomically sound. 8-4-1- Rhinitis with asthma A high percentage of asthmatics have coincidental rhinitis and so treatment for asthma that is also beneficialfor rhinitis would be applicable to many patients withasthma. Such approaches include humanised monoclo-nal antibodies against IgE. 8-4-1-1- Humanised monoclonal antibodies against Three companies, Genentech, Novartis Pharma AG and Tanox Biosystems, have focused their effortstowards the strategy of anti-IgE therapy, and monoclonalantibodies against human IgE have been raised (e.g. rhu-Mab-E25 and CGP 51901). However, only one of thesemAbs is currently developed for the treatment of rhinitisand asthma. A monoclonal antibody was raised against the C 3 domain of IgE molecules (MAE11). This region of theIgE molecule is involved in the binding of IgE to itsreceptors (Fc RI). The complexing of free IgE with MAE11 prior to the linking with FceRI prevents cross-linking of receptors (via antigen). It also prevents acti-vation of mast cells and basophils (2599). MAE11binds only to free IgE and not to Fc RI bound IgE. Thus, MAE11 does not activate cells bearing Fc RI. This characteristic is required in order to achieve a pro-longed pharmacological effect without inducing ana-phylaxis (2600). Hybridoma technology enables thecreation of rodent Humanised antibodieshave improved pharmacokinetics, reduced immuno-genicity and have already been used during clinical tri-als. MAE11 was therefore humanised and the best ofseveral humanised variants, version 25 (Rhu-MAb-E25), was selected (2599). Based on previous studies, itappeared likely that Fc RI expression on basophils andmast cells is regulated by levels of circulating IgE anti- bodies. Treatment with the anti-IgE MAb decreasedfree IgE levels to 1% of pre-treatment a marked down-regulation of Fc RI on basophils (2602). This effect is in vitro and in vivo (2603). Another chimeric anti-IgE antibody has been raised and was found to have similar properties in animals(2604, 2605). A study was carried out using rhu-Mab-E25 mAb in the treatment of ragweed pollen induced rhinitis. Theeffect of the rhu-Mab-E25 mAb was small, probablybecause the dose infused was insufficient (2606). Onlythe patients with a dose of 300 mg of rhu-Mab-E25every 4 weeks had a reduction of H1-antihistamine usewhich was over 60% greater than that of the placebo.Furthermore, symptoms were reduced by over 20%.Other data are therefore needed using the proper dose.The efficacy, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokineticsof CGP 51901 were evaluated for 153 patients with sea-sonal allergic rhinitis treated with placebo or with 15,30 or 60 mg of CGP 51901 in six bi-weekly doses(2607). Clinical efficacy was demonstrated in thisstudy, but the magnitude of the effect and the effective-ness of anti-IgE mAb in comparison to classical treat-ment have to be established. Rhu-Mab-E25 mAb has been tested in asthma and proof of concept was found since rhu-Mab-E25 inhibitedthe late-phase allergic reaction following allergenbronchial challenge (2608-2610). Moreover, in moderateto severe asthma, a recent study confirmed that rhu-Mab-E25 mAb was able to reduce oral and inhaled cortico-steroids and improve quality of life (2611). The safety of any novel therapy for asthma and aller- gic diseases is critical since these diseases are rarelylethal. Short-term safety was examined in three studies.CGP 51901 was well tolerated and only one subject hada weak antibody response against the mAb (2612). Rhu-MAb-E25 has been administered to over 3,000 patientsfor periods of up to one year and no serious adverse eventhas occurred. Moreover, there was no development ofantibodies against Rhu-MAb-E25. Another safety issueis the theoretical outcome of tissue damage resultingfrom increased serum concentrations of Rhu-MAb-E25/IgE immune complexes. This does not seem to occurin these studies. 8-4-1-2- Inhibition of eosinophilic inflammationMany novel treatments for asthma are based on an inhibition of eosinophil development or tissue recruit-ment. Such approaches include: antibodies against IL-5 (2613, 2614), IL-4 RANTES and eotax- in (2616, 2617), chemokine receptor inhibitors, in particular the CCR3 receptor, inhibitors of adhesion molecule activity,either as receptor antagonists or as soluble receptors, ligand inhibitors such as VLA-4 antagonists (2618). As VLA-4 is involved in IMMUNOL 108, NUMBER 5Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group S247 recruitment as well as in eosinophil recruitment, this may have a greater potential as oral therapy (2619). Although allergic rhinitis is associated with tissue eosinophil recruitment, there is little evidence to linkeosinophil recruitment and activation with clinical dis-ease expression. This will be clarified only when specif-ic inhibitors of eosinophil recruitment and activation areassessed, such as anti-IL-5. However, it is unlikely thatsuch treatments will have a widespread effect for rhinitis. 8-4-1-3- Inhibition of allergic inflammationThe major effector cells for clinical symptom expres- sion appear to be basophils and mast cells. The develop-ment of effective inhibitors of degranulation, such as ionchannel inhibitors (2620) and specific adenosine receptorantagonists (2621), are under evaluation. The recruitmentof these cells in addition to involving chemokines andleukocyte endothelial cell adhesion molecule upregula-tion involves cytokine release from mast cells and T-cells. Different approaches to the inhibition of T-cell activa- tion are under development. These include the modifica-tion of antigen presentation to inhibitors of the T-cellreceptor and the modification of accessory moleculeexpression, such as with the CTLA4 fusion protein(2622, 2623). These have yet to be evaluated in rhinitis. 8-4-1-4- Specific immunotherapyApproaches to immune modification by specific immunotherapy or developments from these approachesare also under consideration (2624). In addition (2627-2629), the use of IL-12 as an adjuvant with specific immunotherapy, bacterial or mycobacterial products to stimulate Th1 response (2630-2632) plasmid DNA encoding of antigen (2633-2635). 8-4-2- Allergic rhinitis alone Once evaluated in persistent disease and if found to be effective, any of these approaches may be extended toseasonal allergic disease. Any treatment for allergicrhinitis alone will have to measure up to intranasal glu-cocorticosteroids or H1-antihistamines. New H1-antihis-tamines may be produced since the H1-receptor hasrecently been cloned and 3D structures have beendeduced (1686). Glucocorticosteroids are the most effective anti- inflammatory treatment for asthma and rhinitis but moreeffective or safer products are needed (2636). Dissociatedglucocorticosteroids may be of interest (2637). There maywell be differences in systemic bioavailability betweendifferent intranasal glucocorticosteroid preparations. One area currently under evaluation is the role of leukotriene receptor antagonists, particularly in combi-nation with H1-antihistamines. Such a combinationwould modify two major mediators of allergic disease.Clinical trial evaluations of such a combination areunder way or planned. Kinin antagonists are now available (2638) but their effect in rhinitis requires further study (2639, 2640). A final area of unexplained potential that pharmaco- logical intervention will help clarify is that of the role ofneuropeptides such as substance P and CGRP (2641). Thedevelopment of tachykinin antagonists will provide clari-fication in this respect when evaluated in the clinical dis-ease situation. Intranasal capsaicin can stimulate sensorynerve fibres and may c-afferent (2642)or deplete neuropeptides (81). Intranasal capsaicin wasshown to be an effective treatment when used for up to 9months in patients with non-allergic rhinitis (954, 1613). Immunotherapy is of proven benefit in seasonal aller- gic disease. At present, this is moreso limited to moresevere disease but, on account of its potential to modifydisease expression, it is likely to be extended to the treat-ment of individuals with milder disease. 8-5- PRACTICAL GUIDELINES FOR THE TREATMENT OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS ANDCO-MORBIDITIES 8-5-1- Development of guidelines Clinicians can often find treatment recommendations in traditional narrative reviews or in the discussion sec-tions of articles and meta-analyses. In traditionalapproaches where the collection and assessment of evi-dence remains unsystematic, all relevant options and out-comes may not be considered, and values remain implic-it and provide recommendations of weak rigour (2643). Increasing attention should be being paid to the methodology of guideline development and the validity ofguideline recommendations. While an increasingly rigor-ous approach is taken to guideline development, it isimportant to re-emphasise the central role of guidelinesthemselves, which is to help clinicians make better deci-sions. These guidelines are based on the best availablepublished data and were proposed using the opinions ofexperts based on clinical trials or mechanistic approaches.However, it seems that \"evidence-based medicine\"(EBM) will be included in the analysis of new guidelines. \"Evidence-based medicine\" is an increasingly impor- tant concept which may become a new paradigm in med-icine (2644). It is the ability to track down, criticallyappraise (for its validity and usefulness) and incorporatethe information obtained from randomised trials in orderto establish the clinical bases for diagnosis, prognosisand therapeutics (41). The increasing influence of EBMis due partly to the work of the Cochrane Collaboration.The importance of this collaboration needs to be stressedeven though it has lead to some criticisms (2645-2648). Evidence-based medicine is attractive in its simplicity and few would argue with the philosophical concept. Thereality of its application in primary care may however berather different. It may be difficult to interpret evidencewhen it is available and to apply this evidence duringconsultation. Systematic reviews, which neither considerall relevant options and outcomes nor make the prefer-S248 Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL NOVEMBER 2001 ences underlying recommendations explicit, offer inter- mediate rigour recommendations (2643). Moreover, veryfew meta-analyses are available for the management ofrhinitis (1738). Despite wide promulgation, clinical practice guide- lines have had a limited effect on changing physicianbehaviour (2649-2651). Little is known about theprocess and factors involved in changing physician prac-tices in response to guidelines. Every effort should bemade to improve the implementation of guidelines at thegeneral care level. The first point of contact for many patients presenting with allergy symptoms is the primary care physician. Inthe managed care system, this initial primary care visit isessential. Guidelines for the primary care physician indiagnosing and treating rhinitis as well as in referringpatients to allergy specialists were described (2652). 8-5-2- Development of guidelines for rhinitis The 1994 guidelines (1) follow a stepwise approach in the treatment of allergic and non-allergic rhinitis. Thisseems to be the most practical approach for the generalpractitioner as well as for the specialist. In 1999, the EAACI proposed new guidelines (3) and, unlike the 1994 guidelines (1), not only mild and moder-ate cases are considered but also severe ones. Theseguidelines are consequently also aimed at the generalpractitioner and the specialist. There are general remarksabout \"how to interpret\" and \"how to follow\" the practi-cal guidelines for the treatment of rhinitis. In the present guidelines, the suggestions were made by a panel of experts and based on the literature dataavailable as from December 1999. A full consensus wasreached on all of the material presented in this positionpaper. The panel recognised that the suggestions it putsforward are valid for the majority of patients within aparticular classification but that individual patientresponses to a particular treatment may differ from thesuggested therapy. It is assumed that a correct diagnosis is achieved before treatment. The statement of evidence for the development of these guidelines has followed WHO rules (Table 20) andis based on Shekelle et al. (2653). The statements of evidence for the different treatment options of allergic rhinitis have been examined by thereport panel (Tables 21 and 22). However, a slight modi-fication has been proposed since: for most interventions, placebo-controlled studies are available, there is evidence that neither physician nor patient can easily distinguish between an effective and an ineffec-tive procedure for allergic disease without performinga proper trial (2654). Although these considerationswere issued for allergen specific immunotherapy, itseems that they also apply to other treatments of aller-gic rhinitis. Thus, for double-blind studies with a placebo group, the level of evidence was classified as A, and as A* fordouble-blind studies without a placebo group. For each intervention, the highest level of evidencewas set from Ia to IV depending on the available stud-ies published in papers indexed in Medline andEmbase according to the category of evidence pre-sented in Table 20. In Table 21, only the highest level of evidence for eachintervention was reported. Thus, many studies with alower level of evidence have not been listed in theTable. In Table 21, the level of evidence was: Ib DB-PC: level of evidence Ib using DB: level of evidence Ib using double-blindstudies. The strength of recommendation from A to D wasbased on Table 20 with a slight modification (Table22): A: for meta-analyses (Ia) and for double-blind Ib studies. 8-5-2-1- Definition terms It is necessary to define \"intermittent\", \"persistent\", \"mild\" and also \"moderate-severe\" (Table 1).TABLE 20: Classification schemes of statements of evidence Category of evidence: Ia: evidence for meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials Ib: evidence from at least one randomised controlled trialIIa: evidence from at least one controlled study without ran- domisation IIb: evidence from at least one other type of quasi- experimental study III: evidence from non-experimental descriptive studies, such as comparative studies, correlation studies and case-control studies IV: evidence from expert committee reports or opinions or clinical experience of respected authorities, or both Strength of recommendations:A: directly based on category I evidenceB: directly based on category II evidence or extrapolated recommendation from category I evidence C: directly based on category III evidence or extrapolated recommendation from category I or II evidence D: directly based on category IV evidence or extrapolated recommendation from category I, II or III evidence From BMJ 1999;318:593-6, with permission from the BMJ Publishing Group.J IMMUNOL VOLUME 108, the ARIA Workshop Group S249 TABLE 21: Level of evidence of different interventions in allergic rhinitis: Category of evidence level of seasonal perennial perennial intervention evidence seasonal adults children adults children Allergen avoidance house dust mites IV 1641, 1643,cats, J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL NOVEMBER 2001 8-5-2-2- Availability of treatment The guidelines are made on the presumption that the suggested treatments are available and affordable to thepatient. There is a list of essential drugs published byWHO. It is important that all the major drugs needed inthe treatment of rhinitis should be available worldwide. The guidelines do not take the cost of treatment into account. They are made on the presumption that all treat-ments are readily available and financially affordable tothe patient (on health insurance).8-5-3- The management of allergic rhinitis 8-5-3-1- Pharmacological management of rhinitis8-5-3-1-1- Mild intermittent disease (conjunctivitis not considered) Options (not in preferred order) are: oral or intranasal H1-antihistamines, intranasal decongestants (for less than 10 days and not to be repeated more than twice a month), oral decongestants (not usually recommended in children),TABLE 22: Level of evidence of different interventions in allergic rhinitis: Strength of recommendation intervention seasonal adults seasonal children perennial adults perennial children Allergen avoidance house dust mites DD cats, dogs DD cockroaches DD outdoor allergens D Dlatex D H1-antihistamines oral A A A Aintranasal A A A Aintra-ocular A A Glucocorticosteroid intranasal A A A Aoral AIM A Chromones intranasal Aintra-ocular A subcutaneous rhinitis + conjunctivitis A A A A intranasal (b) rhinitis + conjunctivitis A A A sublingual + conjunctivitis A A A 1b with double-blind studies.a: Based on a single study.

The efficacy of short and repetitive courses has not been demon-strated by published data. (chromones). The intramuscular injection of glucocorticosteroids is not usually recommended due to the possible occur-rence of systemic side effects. The intranasal injection of glucocorticosteroids is not usually recommended due to the possible occurrenceof severe side effects.8-5-3-1-3- Mild persistent disease (conjunctivitis not considered) Options (not in preferred order) are: oral intranasal injection of glucocorticosteroids is not usually recommended due to the possible occur-rence of systemic side effects. The intranasal injection of glucocorticosteroids is not usually recommended due to the possible occurrenceof severe side effects. A stepwise approach is proposed. The patient should be reassessed after 2 to 4 weeks: The patient is symptom-free or has less symptoms: it is advised to continue the treatment. However, forintranasal glucocorticosteroids, the dose may bereduced (e.g. by half). In the case of perennial aller-gy, symptoms may reoccur and a long-term treat-ment may be needed. In the case of seasonal allergy,a shorter course of treatment is required dependingon the pollen season. The patient has persistent mild symptoms and he (she) is under H1-antihistamines or chromones:change to intranasal glucocorticosteroids. The patient has moderate to severe symptoms: go to step up. 8-5-3-1-4- Moderate/severe persistent disease (con- junctivitis not considered) 1- A stepwise approach is proposed.2- It is advised to use intranasal glucocorticosteroids as a first-line treatment. 3- If the nose is very blocked: a short course (e.g. one to two weeks) of oral gluco- corticosteroids may be added alternatively, intranasal decongestants for less than 10 days. 4- The patient should be reassessed after 2 to 4 weeks: If the patient does not improve: consider reasons for failure to respond to intra- nasal glucocorticosteroids: inadequate compliance, patient (or doctor) misunderstanding the doseand frequency of administration of the intranasalglucocorticosteroids, nasal obstruction preventing drug delivery, additional nasal pathology (e.g. nasal polyps, sinusitis) or nasal septal deviation, heavy persistent allergen exposure (e.g. cat on the bed), wrong diagnosis (see classification of rhinitis), double the dose of intranasal glucocortico- steroids if the major symptom is blockage, add: H1-antihistamines if the major symptoms are sneezing, itching or rhinorrhea, ipratropium bromide if the major symptom is rhi- norrhea, oral H1-antihistamine and decongestant. If the patient does improve, a step down approach should be used (mild persistent disease). However,the treatment should last for at least three months orfor the duration of the pollen season. In the stepdown treatment, low dose intranasal glucocortico-steroids may be required as a maintenance treatmentto control symptoms. 5- Referral to a specialist may be considered: if the treatment is not fully effective, if the duration of the treatment is over 3 months and is unsuccessful. 8-5-3-2- The management of conjunctivitis 1- If the patient suffers from conjunctivitis, the options (not in preferred order) associated with serious short-term and long-term complications. Theiradministration is not recommended if an eye exami-nation has not been carried out. 8-5-3-3- Preventive treatment 8-5-3-3-1- Avoidance of allergen and trigger factors Although there is no definite demonstration that aller- gen avoidance measures are effective in the treatment ofrhinitis, it is indicated when possible. 8-5-3-3-2- Allergen specific immunotherapySpecific immunotherapy has a place in patients who have a demonstrable IgE mediated disease and whoeither have a long duration of symptoms or in whompharmacotherapy is not effective or induces side effects. 8-5-4- T reatment of rhinitis and asthma 8-5-4-1- Allergen avoidanceAllergen avoidance is always indicated in the treatment of allergic rhinitis (1) and asthma (36). It seems that thisform of treatment is effective for all allergic symptoms,but definite evidence in rhinitis is still lacking. In asthma,a controversial meta-analysis was published recently(1621) but allergen avoidance is still advocated (1622).S252 Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL NOVEMBER 2001 8-5-4-2- Specific immunotherapy The indications of specific immunotherapy in allergic asthma and rhinitis have been separated in some guide-lines (2466). This artificial separation has led to unre-solved issues (2596, 2597) possibly because the allergen-induced IgE-mediated reaction has not been consideredto be a multi-organ disease. It is therefore important toconsider specific immunotherapy based on allergen sen-sitisation rather than on the disease itself since mostpatients with allergic asthma also present rhinitis orrhino-conjunctivitis (see chapter 6-3). 8-5-4-3- Topically administered drugsMedications for and rhinitis can be administered via local (intranasal, intra-ocular or inhaled (intra-bronchial)), oral or parenteral routes. There are advantages(and some drawbacks) when the drug is administereddirectly into the target organ (see chapter 8-2-1) (1, 36).Moreover, some drugs like cromoglycate or nedocromilare not absorbed when given orally and are only effectivewhen administered locally. In patients suffering from asth-ma and rhinitis, the local administration of drugs should beboth nasal and bronchial. This may decrease complianceto treatment which is low in asthma and rhinitis. Glucocorticosteroids are the most effective drugs for the treatment of rhinitis and asthma when used topicallyin the nose and bronchi. At large doses of inhaled gluco-corticosteroids, side effects have been reported (2172)whereas it appears that intranasal administration is safer(2171). One of the problems of dual administration is thepossible addition of side effects. In one study, it wasfound that the addition of intranasal to inhaled formula-tions did not produce any further significant suppressionof mean values. However, there were more individualabnormal cortisol values associated with the dual therapy(2174). More data are urgently needed. The observation that the management of allergic rhini- tis also relieves symptoms of asthma has heightenedinterest in the link between these diseases. The intranasal treatment of rhinitis using glucocortico- steroids was found to improve asthma moderately in some,but not all, studies (2666). Symptoms (2275, 2667) andpulmonary function increase of bronchial respon-siveness in patients with allergic rhinitis and asthma(2670). This treatment modality may have advantages overthe ordinarily used intranasal and bronchial topical treat-ment in patients with both asthma and rhinitis, especiallywhen conventional inhaled therapy is associated with sideeffects. These data suggest that treating nasal inflamma-tion may help to control asthma. However, a number ofaspects, such as the extent to which the pathophysiology ofthe two diseases overlaps and whether treating one willaffect the other, still remain to be clarified. Less is known about the effects on nasal disease by inhaled (intra-bronchial) treatment with glucocortico-steroids. A study examined effects on nasal allergic dis-ease of inhaled budesonide (avoiding nasal deposition ofthe drug) in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis butwithout asthma (2093). During the birch pollen season,budesonide reduced the seasonal eosinophilia both in thecirculation and in the nose along with an attenuation ofseasonal nasal symptoms. Nasal and systemic anti-eosinophil actions are produced at commonly employeddose levels of orally inhaled budesonide. 8-5-4-4- Orally administered drugsOn the other hand, drugs administered by oral route may have an effect on both nasal and bronchial symptoms. Oral H1-antihistamines represent the first-line treat- ment of allergic rhinitis. However, although some studieshave found a modest effect on asthma symptoms (1904),in most studies showing an effect in asthma, drugs wereadministered at a higher dose than the recommended oneand, usually, pulmonary function tests and/or peak flowrates were unchanged (2671-2673). Thus, these drugsare not recommended for the treatment of asthma (forreview see 36, 2674, 2675). However, a recent study hasshown that loratadine plus pseudo-ephedrine improvednasal and asthma symptoms, pulmonary function andquality of life in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitisand concomitant mild asthma (2393). Azelastine 8 mg ismarketed in some countries for asthma. Leukotriene modifiers were shown to be effective in controlling the symptoms of mild to moderate asthma, andsome limited studies have suggested that, in associationwith oral H1-antihistamines, they may be effective in thetreatment of rhinitis. Anti-leukotrienes therefore have thepotential to treat asthma and possibly rhinitis but more dataare needed to fully evaluate their real effect. Moreover, thecombination of anti-leukotriene and H1-antihistamine pro-duces a airway asthmatics (2676).This suggests an effect of anti-leukotrienes inasthma when associated with H1-antihistamines. Theophylline was found to reduce nasal inflammation (2677). It has also been observed bronchial hyperresponsiveness in patients withallergic rhinitis (1273) but there are no controlled dataconcerning the therapeutic effect of this drug on nasalsymptoms. Oral glucocorticosteroids are highly effective in the treatment of rhinitis and asthma but side effects are com-mon after long-term use. 8-6- PAEDIATRIC ASPECTS Allergic rhinitis is part of the \"allergic march\" during childhood (2678). Positive skin prick tests and specificIgE antibodies to food allergens are most prevalent dur-ing the first and second years of life. However, specificIgE and positive skin prick tests to inhalant allergensdevelop after the second year of life as do the symptomsof allergic asthma and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis(2679). Although pollen sensitisation may occur early inlife (1618), seasonal allergic rhinitis is exceptionalbefore two years of age. Allergic rhinitis is most preva-lent during school age. In the worldwide ISAAC study,J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 108, NUMBER 5Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group S253 the prevalence of allergic rhinitis varied in different parts of the world from 0.8% to 14.9% in the 13-14 year-olds Thiscoincides with age variation in the prevalence of positiveskin prick tests to inhalant allergens (2679). 8-6-1- The development of sinus four paired paranasal sinuses (ethmoid, maxillary, sphenoid and frontal) begin to develop during late fetal lifeand continue to develop for two decades after birth. Theyform as outgrowths or diverticula on the walls of the nasalcavities and become air-filled extensions of the nasal cavi-ties in the adjacent bones. At birth, the ethmoid, maxillaryand sphenoid sinuses are present. The frontal the anterior ethmoid sinuses during early child-hood and are not clinically important in young children. 8-6-2- Pharmacological treatment The principles of the treatment are the same as in adults, but special care has to be taken to avoid the sideeffects which are typical in this age group (3, 40).Dosages have to be adapted and some special considera-tions have to be followed. On the one hand, caution isnecessary because of the young age of the patient, but onthe other hand, an early appropriate treatment may havenot only therapeutic but also prophylactic capacities, aswas shown recently (2680, 2681). Few drug treatmentshave been tested in children under the age of two years.Among the most important aspects to consider are thecognitive functions of pre-school and school children inrelation to the general malaise caused by rhinitis and inrelation to the antihistamine treatment (18). Oral glucocorticosteroids and depot-preparation should be avoided in the treatment of rhinitis in youngchildren. Intranasal glucocorticosteroids are the mosteffective treatment of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis but thefear of systemic side effects, albeit rare, should always beconsidered in children. Modern intranasal glucocortico-steroids are much less absorbed (bioavailability <30%)and the minimal dose needed to control symptomsshould be used. Intranasal glucocorticosteroids with highbioavailability such as betamethasone should not be usedin children (2163). One special concern is the effect upongrowth and growth velocity. A recent study found noshort-term effect from intranasal budesonide and mome-tasone furoate (2682). Treatment with inhaled glucocor-ticosteroids has been demonstrated to affect growth to amoderate degree in asthmatic children (2683-2685) andthis has been shown for some but not all intranasal glu-cocorticosteroids (2175). Recently, it was shown that theintranasal glucocorticosteroids mometasone (2279) andfluticasone did not affect growth in children with allergicrhinoconjunctivitis. On the other hand, oral and depotglucocorticosteroid preparations have a clear effect ongrowth and growth velocity (2686). The use of H1-antihistamines is important for the treatment of rhinitis in children. Classical oral H1-antihistamines have central side effects with sedation asthe most common (2687). The response to different anti-histamines may differ from patient to patient, but it hasbeen demonstrated that children not responding to oneantihistamine may respond to another (1736). Classicalfirst-generation H1-antihistamines used in toxic dosesaffect the life-threatening reactions in children (2688) andrequire treatment with physostigmine. These effects arenot generally seen with the new low-sedating antihista-mines, though they differ to some degree. Focus has beenput upon the cognitive effect of classical antihistamines.Seasonal allergic rhinitis per se may affect learning abil-ity and concentration (18). Treatment with classical anti-histamines often had a further reducing effect upon cog-nitive function (1825). However, use of the newer H1-antihistamines counteracts the feeling of malaise causedby allergic rhinitis and may improve learning ability inallergic rhinitis (18). Interactions with the cytochromeP450 may reduce the metabolism of the H1-antihista-mines metabolised in the liver. Macrolide antibiotics,commonly used in children, may have this effect. The use of intranasal antihistamines like levocaba- stine, azelastine and antazoline has the benefit of almostno side effects. However, although there is a beneficialeffect upon symptoms in the organ to which they areadministered, they usually have little effect elsewhere.These drugs are useful in children with symptoms limit-ed to the nose or the eyes (2061). Disodium cromoglycate has been one of the common drugs used for allergic rhinoconjunctivitis in children.Both DSCG and nedocromil sodium were found moreeffective than placebo, but DSCG was found to be lesseffective than intranasal glucocorticosteroids or H1-antihistamines. It is important to note that in children,these drugs are free from side effects (2689). However, adosage of 4-6 times a day is required for DSCG and com-pliance with treatment is often difficult. In randomiseddouble blind trials, DSCG has been demonstrated to both intranasal levocabastine andintranasal glucocorticosteroids. Nasal saline drops or spray can help to clear the nose before eating or sleeping. The treatment of allergic rhini-tis in small children under the age of 4 again depends onallergen avoidance, but DSCG and oral H1-antihistaminesare also available for this age group. Mometasone furoateis available for children of 3 years and over. Fluticasonepropionate is available for children of 4 years and overand other intranasal glucocorticosteroids may be used inchildren over the age of 5 years. 8-6-3- The relationship between rhinitis and asthma Allergic rhinoconjunctivitis is often a precursor of bronchial asthma in children. Often, allergic rhinocon-junctivitis and asthma occur simultaneously in children.The treatment of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis withinhaled glucocorticosteroids may also improve asthma(25, 2690). It is not known whether an early anti-inflammatory treatment in allergic rhinitis may influ-S254 Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL NOVEMBER 2001 ence later development of bronchial asthma. However, 200 children with pollen allergy were treated for aller-gic rhinitis in an open trial of three years of specificimmunotherapy or allergy vaccination. Preliminaryresults indicate that allergen vaccination with grass ortree pollen may reduce the development of asthma inchildren with allergic rhinitis (2595). Pharmacologicaltreatment in sensitised, high-risk infants may also pre-vent asthma (1741, 2691) but more data are needed tofully appreciate this effect. 8-6-4- Sport and rhinitis Children and adolescents are physically active and often participate in sporting events. Many elite athletesmay suffer from allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. For chil-dren and adolescents active in sport, it is important toobserve the doping rules set by the medical commissionof the International Olympic Committee. It may indeedbe a very serious event for an athlete to be suspected ofdoping, especially when the drug is taken withoutknowing the regulations. With particular relevance toallergic rhinitis, it is important to note that systemicnasal decongestants like pseudoephedrine or phenyl-propanolamine are considered to have a central stimu-lant effect and thus are not allowed for use in sport.These -adrenergic agonists are often combined with H1-antihistamines and should be carefully avoided byathletes. Physicians treating children and adolescentsshould be aware of these regulations and of any changesin the regulations. For intranasal glucocorticosteroids, acertificate should be issued. However, regulationsbetween countries are different. 8-7- PREGNANCY 8-7-1- General considerations Rhinitis is often a problem during pregnancy since nasal obstruction may be aggravated by pregnancy itself(70, 72, 2692). Caution must be taken when administer-ing medication to a pregnant woman, as most medica-tions cross the placenta. The risk of malformation of thefoetus represents a major fear. In studies concerning ter-atogenicity in animals, the apparent safety of medicationin healthy adults or the chemical structure of a drug donot formally eliminate toxicity in a ftus. Moreover,these limited studies have been done only on smallgroups without long-term analysis. Prescribing a drug toa pregnant woman, even a drug which has been on themarket for a number of years, enlists the responsibility ofthe doctor. It is worth considering, therefore, the bene-fit/risk ratio, as much for the mother as for the ftus.Generally, treatment does not cause any problem (74,2378, 2693-2695). Moreover, there are differences inregulations between countries. 8-7-2- Specific considerations With regard to anticholinergic agents, there is no exist- ing teratogenicity in animals. Atropine passes throughthe placenta and can be prescribed to pregnant women.The prescription of its derivatives also seems to be with-out danger, but it is advisable, due to lack of extensivestudies, to avoid these during the first trimester. With regard to glucocorticoids, even though in ani- mals they are all teratogenic (principally harelip butalso cardiovascular malformations), no abnormalityhas been found in humans. The increased risk ofgrowth retardation in utero , in the case of prolonged systemic corticotherapy, seems to be more related to asevere underlying maternal pathology than to the corti-cotherapy itself (2693). The risk described initially ofadrenal insufficiency in newborns in the perinatal peri-od has not been confirmed (2696). For example, in 36pregnant asthmatic women treated with prednisone,Snyder et al. (2697) did not notice any pathological pregnancy or medical problem in the children born andobserved during a two-year period. Inhaled glucocorti-coids have not been incriminated as teratogens and arecommonly used by pregnant asthmatic women (2378).Greenberger et al. (2698) did not find any materno- ftal side effects in 40 pregnant asthmatic women whowere treated with beclomethasone. With regard to the cromones, no teratogenic effect has been found in animals. To this day, no side effect hasbeen found in humans (2699), but there are no prospec-tive studies available. Schatz and Zeiger (2693) proposethe use of cromones as a first-line treatment for allergicrhinitis in pregnant women. Second-generation antihistamines do not appear to be teratogenic in animal experimentation. Once more how-ever, the absence of controlled trials in humans and thecrossing of the placental barrier make the avoidance oftheir prescription necessary during pregnancy. Somefirst-generation antihistamines (e.g. brompheniramine,promethazine, diphenhydramine Aprospective matched-case control study of hydroxyzineand cetirizine was carried out in pregnancy and no sideeffects were found (2702). Concerning specific immunotherapy, Metzger et al. (2703) have proved its safety by a study in 121 pregnantwomen each receiving specific immunotherapy for aller-gic rhinitis. It is advisable, however, not to increase thedosage during pregnancy in order to avoid any possibili-ty of an anaphylactic accident. It is also advisable not tobegin specific immunotherapy for allergic rhinitis duringpregnancy (2466). 8-8- THE ELDERLY With aging, multiple physiological changes occur in the connective tissue and vasculature of the nose whichmay predispose or contribute to chronic rhinitis (2704).The accurate differentiation between allergic and non-allergic causes of rhinitis requires skin testing or in vitro measures of specific IgE. Empirical treatment with OTCfirst-generation H1-antihistamines and oral deconges-J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL and tants frequently in CNS, anticholinergic and car- diovascular adverse effects (2705). Thus, as recom-mended in general, it is important to second-genera-tion antihis-tamines. Intranasal therapies includingDSCG, glucocorticosteroids and ipratropium with minimal effects.Patients with glaucoma or urinary retention should notuse anti-cholinergics. The avoidance of allergens and/orirritants is an important adjunct in treating patients withallergic and vasomotor rhinitis. On the other hand, spe-cific immunotherapy is not recommended in elderlypatients (2706).S2569 - Education The education of the patient and /or the patient's care giver regarding the management of rhinitis is essential.Such education maximises compliance and the possibil-ity of optimising treatment outcomes (37). After the initiation of therapy, an appropriate follow- up for patients with rhinitis optimises the chances that apatient will benefit from the broad array of therapeuticapproaches available, and that possible complicationsfrom rhinitis or its treatment are identified andaddressed. At these visits, education and compliance arecritical elements. Maximum therapeutic responses require patients who are compliant with recommendations. Patient compli-ance with physicians' recommendations for therapy ismore likely in patients who understand their disease, thevarious available treatment options and the likelihood ofsuccess of each possible treatment. This demands thatthe patient establishes a relationship of trust with, andconfidence in, the physician. It is important to educateboth the patient and relevant family members regardingthe nature of the disease and available treatments. Thisshould include general information regarding the symp-toms, causes and mechanisms of rhinitis. In addition,education about means of avoidance, immunotherapyand drug therapy must be provided. It is vital thatpatients understand the potential side effects of therapy,especially drug side effects, in order to ensure that theydo not abruptly discontinue beneficial therapy but rathercommunicate adverse events to their physician so theycan deal with them in a manner best for the patient. It isalso important to provide patients with education aboutthe complications of rhinitis including sinusitis and otitismedia, and about comorbid conditions such as nasalpolyps. They should be aware of how such complicationsare recognised and how they are treated. Patients need tobe aware of the potential negative impact of rhinitis onthe quality of life and potential benefits of complyingwith therapeutic recommendations. Patients must alsohave realistic expectations for the results of therapy andshould understand that complete cures do not usuallyoccur in the treatment of any chronic disease, includingrhinitis. Compliance is enhanced when: a fewer number of daily doses is required; the patient schedules when doses are to be taken and selects an appropriate reminder mechanism, such asmealtimes, daily rituals, etc; there is a good doctor-patient relationship with a high level of physician trust; the patient has written instructions to follow; rhinitis medication is taken with the same dosing fre- quency as other medications; there is a well designed reminder chart for times of dosing interval.S25710- Prevention of rhinitis There is a general misconception that the same factors involved in the induction of allergy are also likely to incitedisease once established. However, this is not necessarilythe case. Thus, strategies for primary prevention or pro-phylaxis may be very different to those required for themanagement of established disease. Using the analogy ofprophylaxis for tuberculosis, prevention can therefore bedivided into primary, secondary and tertiary intervention: Primary prophylaxis will be employed on populations at a high risk of becoming sensitised in situationswhere there is no evidence of allergic sensitisation(2707). Secondary prophylaxis will be in individuals who show evidence of sensitisation to allergens but not yetany evidence of disease in the upper respiratory tract. Tertiary prophylaxis will be preventive strategies for the management of established allergic rhinitis. Mostpublished work comes from tertiary prophylaxis. A more complete description of preventive measures is reported in the WHO initiative \"Prevention of allergyand asthma\". 10-1- PRIMARY PREVENTION It has been shown that the foetus is far from immuno- logically naive. Indeed, allergen specific cellularresponses can be identified as early as 20-22 weeks ofgestation. As pregnancy is a Th-2 (allergy biased) phe-nomenon modulating the mother's immune response tofoeto-paternal antigens (2708), it is perhaps not surpris-ing that a high percentage of newborns are not only sen-sitised to allergens to which their mothers have beenexposed, but also have a Th-2 biased response (2709). Towhat extent this persists and evolves into allergic diseaseis probably influenced by postnatal experience, but it hasraised the possibility of introducing primary prophylaxisduring pregnancy in high risk families. There is considerable concern that we do not have suf- ficient information on critical doses and on the timing ofexposure that might be associated either with the devel-opment of sensitisation or of tolerance. Indeed, there iseven limited evidence to suggest that high dose exposurewill induce IgG antibody production in the mother andthereby reduce the possibility of allergy developing inthe offspring. There is one remarkable study showingreduced allergy in the children of mothers who receivedspecific immunotherapy during pregnancy (2710). Giventhese observations, the recommendation of allergenavoidance in pregnancy could conceivably increaserather than decrease the frequency of sensitivity andthereby the subsequent development of disease. At thisstage, no recommendations should be made but furtherresearch is critically required. 10-2- SECONDARY PREVENTION Much of the early efforts of allergen avoidance have focused on infant feeding and, in particular, an earlyavoidance of cow's milk protein and sometimes egg, fishand nuts. Most studies have commenced avoidance in thepostnatal period and results have been variable with noclear-cut view emerging. The two studies that have hadthe longest follow-up have both identified a transienteffect reducing food allergy and atopic dermatitis. How-ever, continued follow-up has shown a diminishing effecton allergic manifestations in the respiratory tract, thiseffect eventually disappearing altogether (2711, 2712).The conclusion from one of these studies was that theeffort was not justified by the outcome (2712). Further-more, there is limited evidence that early dietary manipu-lation may be a risk for impaired growth. Therefore, greatcaution is required in employing such approaches (2713). Aero-allergen avoidance has been largely promoted in order to avoid sensitisation as it has been clearly shownthat there was a correlation between the level of allergenexposure in infants and sensitisation to allergens (366,1618). However, recent studies suggest that, in contradis-tinction to what had previously been published, the avoid-ance of early cat exposure does not prevent allergy (2714,2715) and that early contact with cats and dogs may pre-vent allergy more effectively than avoidance (217). These controversial results have led to suggest that, in the future, secondary prophylaxis will be to redirect thenew born infant's immune response into a Th-1 non-allergy immune response; this approach may be promising.This might be achieved by high exposure to relevant aller-gens as opposed to normal low dose exposure. It may befacilitated by the utilisation of fusion proteins combiningallergen and cytokines such as IL-12 which will induce aTh-1 response (205). This idea has gained considerablecredibility in relation to the so-called hygiene hypothesiswhich identified associations between early microbialexperience and subsequent reduced allergic disease (2716). 10-3- TERTIARY PROPHYLAXIS See chapter 8-1.S25811- Quality of life Quality of life (QOL) is a concept including a large set of physical and psychological characteristics assessingproblems in the social context of lifestyle. Nowadays, ithas been recognised that allergic rhinitis comprises morethan the classical symptoms of sneezing, rhinorrhea andnasal obstruction. In the last decade, an increasing efforthas been made to understand the socio-economic burdenof rhinitis in terms of effects on health-related quality oflife (HRQL) and health care costs. It has been acknowl-edged in several consensus reports that allergic rhinitis isassociated with impairments in how patients function inday to day life at home, at work and in school (1, 2).With the introduction of a questionnaire designed tomeasure rhinitis associated impairments of quality of life(2717), it became clear that patients may be bothered bysleep disorders, emotional problems, impairment inactivities and social functioning. Also, in general terms,patients with allergic rhinitis are impaired in physicaland mental functioning including vitality and the percep-tion of general health (16). 11-1- HEALTH RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE 11-1-1- Methods measuring HRQL In rhinitis research, two types of HRQL measures have been used: generic and specific. 11-1-1-1- Generic questionnaires Generic questionnaires measure physical, mental and psycho social functions in all health conditions irrespectiveof the underlying disease and can be used in the generalpopulation. These include the Sickness Impact Profile, theNottingham Health Profile and the Medical Outcomes Sur-vey Short Form 36 (SF 36). The SF36 has been used tocharacterise patients with perennial rhinitis (16, 109) and toevaluate the effects of a non-sedating H1-antihistamine onquality of life (1899). The advantage of generic instru-ments is that the burden of illness across different disordersand patient populations can be compared. The disadvan-tage however is that the instruments miss depth and maynot be responsive enough to detect changes in generalhealth states in spite of important changes in disease-related problems (2718). 11-1-1-2- Disease-specific questionnairesSpecific instruments have been designed by asking patients what kind of problems they experience fromtheir disease. Both frequency and importance of impair-ments find expression in the questionnaires. Theseinstruments have the advantage that they describe moreaccurately the disease-associated problems of thepatients. Moreover, they seem to be more responsive tochanges in HRQL than generic instruments. Specific instruments for different age groups of patients with rhinitis have also been developed. The Rhinocon-junctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) (2717)and the Rhinitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (2719) havebeen tested in adult patients with seasonal allergic rhinitisand perennial allergic rhinitis respectively. Taking into account that adolescents may experience different problems to adults, the Adolescent RQLQ ques-tionnaire has been developed covering patients aged 12-17 years (2720). This questionnaire is a slightly modifiedversion of the adult version, as problems in (school) workand the problem of generally not feeling well appeared tobe more important in adolescents than in adults. A Paediatric RQLQ Questionnaire has been devel- oped for children aged 6-12 years (2721). This ques-tionnaire differs from others, as children are less both-ered by emotional problems and rhinitis interferes lesswith day to day life. The RQLQ has been used in several trials focused on the effect of nasal glucocorticosteroids (2211, related QOL appears to be moderately cor- related to the more classical outcome variables used inclinical trials such as daily symptom scores and nasalhyperreactivity (2725). These observations are in linewith the results of studies comparing disease-specificHRQL in asthmatics with symptoms, peak flowand bronchial hyperresponsiveness 2727). It hasbeen suggested that the outcome variablesmay only partially characterise the disease of thepatient. From that point of view, it has been advocatedto measure HRQL along with the conventional clinicalindices of HRQL in a generic questionnaire (SF-36) (2729), QOL was found to be significantly impaired in patients withmoderate to severe perennial allergic rhinitis when com-pared to normal subjects (16). Using the same question-naire, QOL was impaired, but to a lesser extent, inpatients suffering from seasonal allergic rhinitis (2730),suggesting that a prolonged allergen exposure wasimpairing QOL more than a seasonal exposure. Howev-er, although QOL questionnaires are of great interest inassessing the overall effect of a disease on QOL in agroup of individuals, unfortunately they do not appear tobe sensitive enough to be used in individual patients. It appears that the impairment in functioning of patients with moderate to severe perennial rhinitis (16) iscomparable with the limitations perceived by asthmaticpatients with a moderate to severe disease (2731). How-ever, the extent to which asthma and rhinitis co-morbidi-ties are associated in QOL remains to be elucidated.J CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 5Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group S259 Sinusitis is a common feature of rhinitis and, using the SF-36 and a sinusitis-specific QOL measure (the CSS:Chronic Sinusitis Survey), it has been shown that sinussurgery may improve the quality of life of sinusitispatients (2732, 2733). Recognising that rhinosinusitis isa disabling disease, other specific instruments such as theRhinosinusitis Disability Index (RDI) (2734) and the 31-item Rhinosinusitis Outcome Measure (RSOM-31)(2735) have been introduced. The impact on social life of recurrent ENT infections in children during the first 4 years of life is not easilycaptured. Indirect information can be obtained using spe-cific questionnaires which measure parental quality oflife (2736). 11-1-4- Evolution of HRQL during interventions When using HRQL outcomes in clinical trials, the ques- tion arises as to whether a change in HRQL is clinicallyimportant. It has been shown that in QOL instrumentswhich use a 7-point scale, the minimal important differenceof quality of life score per item is very close to 0.5 (2737). Generally, the effect on HRQL runs parallel with the effect on conventional medical outcome measures. How-ever, in some studies, differences can be found. In a studyevaluating the combined effect of glucocorticosteroidsand H1-antihistamines, no differences were seen in termsof QOL between patients treated with H1-antihistamineand glucocorticosteroids versus glucocorticosteroidsalone. However, for some patient-rated symptoms, thecombination was found superior (2273). This mightindicate that patients perceive differences in efficacy, notcaptured by conventional symptom scores. Patients withchronic conditions may adapt themselves to their disease.As the perception of patients is clearly important in themanagement of disease and patient compliance, the mea-surement of this \"dimension\" by HRQL questionnairesin clinical trials may be justified. In the future, with more data available, it is possible that QOL measurements may represent a primary out-come measure for clinical trials. 11-2- LEARNING DISABILITY IN RHINITIS If nasal symptoms are not well controlled in patients with allergic rhinitis, they may contribute to learning prob-lems during school hours either by direct interference or bynocturnal sleep loss resulting in daytime fatigue (19, 1426).Seasonal allergic rhinitis may be associated with a reducedability to learn. Treatment with sedating H1-antihistamineswill aggravate these problems, whereas treatment with non-sedating H1-antihistamines will only partially reverse thelimitations in learning (18, 2738). Recently, in an open sin-gle-blind study carried out over 6 months in 113 childrenwith allergic perennial rhinitis and 33 children with non-allergic perennial rhinitis, it was shown that beclometha-sone or ipratropium bromide diminished the interference ofrhinorrhea in school attendance, in concentration on schoolwork and in sleep (2739).11-3- WORK IMPAIRMENT IN RHINITIS Allergic rhinitis is a disease inducing work absen- teeism and a reduction in work productivity. Moreover,using sedative H1-antihistamines, work productivity isreduced even further (20). In the U.S., allergic rhinitisresults in approximately 811,000 missed work days,824,000 missed school days and 4,230,000 reducedactivity days per year (21). These data indicate that allergic rhinitis may have an important impact on occupation and worker productivity.Patients are bothered by fatigue, poor performance andconcentration at work, headaches and malaise. Conjunc-tivitis may impair vision and vision-related activities.Not only disease but also medication may influence workproductivity. It has been estimated that 50% of the work-ers who treated their allergic rhinitis with first-generationsedating antihistamines functioned at only 75% of theirtotal capacity for 14 days per year (2740). Patients takingthese sedating antihistamines are more likely to sustainoccupational injuries (odds ratio 1.5). The type of occu-pational injuries include fractures, dislocations, openwounds, superficial injuries and burns (2741). With thenewer antihistamines, these problems have been signifi-cantly reduced (20). Very little is known about the impact of allergic rhini- tis on the career of patients. It is imaginable that patientswill not change or lose jobs except in the case of occu-pational allergy. A five year health surveillance inmilling, baking and other food manufacturing operationsshowed that 56% of the patients with a diagnosis of occu-pational rhinitis continued to do the same job, 13% weredoing a different job in the same area and 31% wereworking elsewhere in the factory (2742). 11-4- HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE AND HEALTH CARE COSTS The high prevalence of allergic rhinitis and the con- cern about health care costs justifies the increasing inter-est for cost-effectiveness studies. Not only the efficacy oftreatment has to be demonstrated but also the cost-effec-tiveness (see chapter 12). In these studies, HRLQ mea-sures have to be incorporated in order to make compar-isons across patient populations and different disorders.It is however difficult to incorporate the generic SF-36 ordisease specific HRQL scores into cost-effectivenessanalyses. To that purpose, utilities such as the StandardGamble, Feeling Thermometer have been developedmeasuring the value that patients themselves place ontheir own health status. Alternatively, some utilities mea-sure the value that society places on various health states.Examples are the EuroQol and Multiattribute HealthUtilities Index. An advantage of these utilities is theirability to produce quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).QALYs associated with different medical therapies caneasily be incorporated into cost-effectiveness studies. Utility instruments are mostly generic. A recent rhini- tis specific utility - the Multiattribute Rhinitis SymptomS260 Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL NOVEMBER 2001 Utility Index - has been developed as a patient outcome for clinical trials and for cost-effectiveness studies com-paring medical treatment for rhinitis (2743). Moreresearch is however needed to validate this instrument. 11-5- PERSPECTIVES FOR THE FUTURE:THE USE OF QUALITY OF LIFE INSTRUMENTS ININDIVIDUAL PATIENTS Rhinitis significantly impairs QOL when general or disease-specific questionnaires are used. The decrease inQOL seen in perennial rhinitis is comparable to thatobserved in patients with moderate to severe asthma andcan affect sleep, work, education and social life. Qualityof life measurements need to be taken into considerationin clinical trials and when treating patients. Although studies have shown an impairment of QOL in rhinitis, these questionnaires are not currently applicable foruse as a clinical tool in individual patients. Inclusion of theseoutcome measures in the evaluation and management of theindividual patient should be the next step. Moreover, there isa need for a specific instrument measuring QOL in patientswith both asthma and rhinitis and, if appropriate, this ques-tionnaire may be used as a primary outcome variable in clin-ical trials. However, HRQL questionnaires are still beingrefined (2744) and the number of outcome measures \u2014 alsoin the field of nasal disease \u2014 is increasing. Some criticismshave been raised against the proliferation of instruments andthe burgeoning theoretical literature devoted to the mea-surement of QOL (2745). Some methodological problemsare not yet resolved (2727). Therefore, further researchneeds to be focused on the selection and \"sharpening\" of alimited number of patient-friendly instruments in order tobetter interpret the results of clinical trials and to betterunderstand the patient with rhinitis.S26112- The social economic impact of asthma and rhinitis Asthma and rhinitis are chronic conditions with a sub- stantial economic impact on the affected persons, theirfamilies, the health care systems and society as a whole.This burden is composed of direct expenditures generat-ed within the health care system as well as indirect costsassociated with the loss of economic productivity. Per-sons with asthma or rhinitis must cope with both theimmediate and long-term impact of a condition that oftenaffects daily functioning. They are frequently requiredto make choices on how to re-allocate their personal andfamily resources\u2014originally dedicated to daily needssuch as food, clothing and housing\u2014to pay for medicalcare aimed at improving their condition. The economicburden of these conditions also affects the work placesince symptoms often adversely affect work productivi-ty. World literature on the economic burden of asthma and rhinitis has only recently emerged and to date has focusedprimarily on asthma. However, the few individual stud-ies examining the economic impact of rhinitis also pro-vide compelling evidence of its substantial impact. 12-1- THE IMPACT OF ASTHMA AND RHINITIS Asthma and allergic rhinitis are common health prob- lems that cause major illness and disability worldwide.Studies such as the ISAAC (154) and the ECRHS (107)have demonstrated that asthma is a prevalent condition inmost countries. These studies suggest that there are morethan 150 million persons worldwide who are affected byasthma. Rhinitis is similarly seen as a worldwide condi-tion with lifetime prevalence estimates of between 10and 20% of the population in the US, UK, Germany,Switzerland and Finland (11, 261, 912, 2746). The global burden of these conditions is reflected in the use of health care resources and loss of productivitydue to illness-related disability. Costs of illness studieshave begun to express these facts in economic terms. 12-2- UNDERSTANDING THE COSTS OF ILLNESS The cost of illness study is the tool for understanding the economic burden of illness (2747). The cost of illnessapproach separates costs into those associated with med-ical care treatment for the illness (direct costs) and thoseresulting from non-medical losses as a consequence of theillness (indirect costs). Standard methods exist for placingan incremental economic value on direct medical carecosts and indirect non-medical costs. Intangible costs,specifically those associated with the value of the psy-chosocial impacts of illness, have also been theorised.However, to date, the methods for valuing intangible costshave not been fully developed. Costs of illness can beviewed from the perspective of the society, the health caresystem (organisations within a community that provide orfinance care) and/or the individual. The literature containsstudies of the costs of illness for both asthma and rhinitis. 12-3- THE COSTS OF ILLNESS FOR ASTHMA There are at least seven recent international costs of ill- ness studies for asthma (36, 2748-2755). Total costs ofasthma vary notably, from a low of 433.5 million to ahigh of 6.4 billion annually in Canada and the UnitedStates respectively. The population would account formuch of this variation. However, the cost per affectedperson also varies from less than $400 to more than$1,000 annually. Also, there is no consistent relationshipbetween direct and indirect costs. An important finding inmost of these cost of illness studies is that emergency careand hospitalisation\u2014generally thought to be avoidableevents\u2014are a large cost component of care. However, ithas recently been calculated that a significant increase inasthma prescribing costs is likely to be needed if an opti-mal control of asthma is to be achieved (2754). The economic burden associated with asthma morbid- ity cannot be overstated. It is estimated that childhoodasthma accounts for over seven million days restricted tobed and ten million days missed from school each year(2756). In Australia, children lose approximately onemillion school days each year due to asthma (2757).Asthma also affects family activities. Families with chil-dren who have asthma report that this illness influencesa range of decisions concerning holidays, pets, furnish-ings, carpets, lifestyle and household spending (2758-2760). Also, these studies clearly indicate how morbidi-ty associated with work loss due to the care of a childwith asthma contributes to the economic burden of thiscondition. Work loss and decreased work productivity ofadults with asthma is an equally big problem (2761). Thus the many international studies of cost of illness for asthma have begun to depict a global picture of theeconomic burden of this disease. To date, information onthe costs of illness is missing from many countries withsizeable populations, such as India, Indonesia and China.The costs of illness for asthma in these countries may becharacteristically different than those of the US andEurope. One small study from the community ofTranskei in South Africa suggests that expenditures perperson affected with asthma may be as low as $10 USannually, which is far below that of other countries stud-ied to date (36). The results from this study suggest theimportance of understanding the costs of illness in non-industrialised countries.S262 Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL NOVEMBER 2001 12-4- THE COSTS OF ILLNESS FOR RHINITIS The literature characterising the economic impact of persons with rhinitis is much more modest than that ofasthma. There are currently three cost of illness studiesexamining the costs of allergic rhinitis (21, 2762, 2763).In 1994, there were an estimated 39 million persons in theUS suffering with allergic rhinitis, accounting for an esti-mated 1.2 billion $ in total costs (21). It is interesting tonote that only approximately five million of these personssought medical treatment for this condition, and directmedical expenditures were estimated to account for 93%of their total costs (21). Much of the costs associated withrhinitis may be underestimated due to the frequent use ofnon-prescribed medications and the tendency to associatethis condition with other conditions such as asthma (21). A study of the direct medical costs of illness for US children with and without asthma revealed that childrenwith asthma used substantially more medical care ser-vices (e.g. 3.1 times as many prescriptions, 1.9 times asmany ambulatory care visits, 2.2 times as many emer-gency department visits) than children who did not haveasthma. However, only 26 % of the difference in thesecosts was related to asthma-specific medical care. Alarge percentage of these additional costs was associatedwith other conditions, mainly upper airway illnesses suchas rhinitis (2753). All Japanese people belong to either government, union or community health insurances. Total medicalexpenditures can therefore be reported. In 1994, totalcosts for rhinitis were 1.15 Billion $ including direct andindirect costs as well as OTC costs. The average annualexpenditure was 118 $ per patient (2764). Rhinitis increases asthma costs. In one study, yearly medical care charges were on average 46% higher for thosewith asthma and concomitant allergic rhinitis than for thosewith asthma alone, accounting for age and sex (32). 12-5- SEARCHING FOR THE BEST ECONOMIC STRATEGIES FOR THE CARE OF PERSONSWITH ASTHMA AND RHINITIS Resource constraints directly and indirectly affect all medical treatment decisions. Yet, presently, there is notenough information available to inform patients, health careproviders and health care systems as to the relative impactof various alternative treatments on resources and costs ofcare. Costs of illness studies, such as those described above,provide information on the overall disease burden. Howev-er, other pharmacoeconomic methods can be used toimprove the quality of medical and financial decision mak-ing by providing more specific data on the relationshipbetween treatment decisions, health outcomes and costs. For both asthma and rhinitis, there are many medical treatment alternatives, such as pharmaceuticals, allergenavoidance, desensitisation regimens and educational pro-grams. Traditionally, medical decisions were primarilybased on the evidence of clinical efficacy. Yet continual-ly increasing cost constraints as well as increases in thenumber of similar alternative treatment options are mak-ing these decision processes more and more complex. Sometimes, decisions as to which medical treatment or product to use are based on evidence from controlled clin-ical trials that focus on efficacy and safety as their specificaim. Efficacy is measured under tightly controlled researchconditions. These studies often involve very select patientpopulations, making them efficient study designs but notvery generalisable. Studies of clinical effectiveness haveevolved in response to the need for more real world infor-mation about treatment alternatives and patient outcomes.Effectiveness refers to the impact of the intervention ortechnology under routine operating conditions adminis-tered to a more generalised patient population (2765,2766). Improvements to the early studies of effectivenesshave led to the \"cost-effectiveness\" study design. This typeof study design provides information on the effectivenessof various interventions in relation to the efficiency of theconsumption of economic resources (2767, 2768). Cost-effectiveness studies link resource use (such as health care utilisation) with patient outcomes (via effec-tiveness measures). Results from this type of studydesign fall into one of four major categories. First is theunwanted outcome, where the new treatment is both lesseffective and more costly. Second, is a common scenario,where the new treatment is more effective but also morecostly. Third, is an uncertain situation where the treat-ment is less effective but less costly. In the fourth, calledthe dominant or uncommon winning outcome, the newtreatment is more effective and less costly. The increasing worldwide sensitivity to costs of care in relation to improved health benefits has not goneunnoticed in the areas of asthma and rhinitis (36, 2769).While the cost-effectiveness literature has so far princi-pally targeted asthma, well-designed pharmacoeconomicstudies on the treatment of rhinitis are likely to be forth-coming. To date, there are no clear dominant cost-effective treatment strategies for either asthma or rhinitis.However, there are studies to suggest that the use ofinhaled glucocorticosteroids for persons with persistentasthma are reasonably cost-effective in comparison tousing only rescue beta-agonist therapy. Yet, even thesestudies reflect only Europe and the U.S. Health econom-ic studies of asthma and rhinitis treatment do not exist formany of the countries that bear much of the global bur-den of these conditions. 12-6- POLICY IMPLICATIONS OF THE ECONOMIC BURDEN OF ASTHMA ANDRHINITIS Health care decision makers, such as health care providers and health planners, are constantly faced withestablishing priorities for the allocation of limitedhealth care resources, especially in developing coun-tries. This prioritisation spans chronic conditions suchas asthma and rhinitis, as well as communicable dis-eases, and must also consider needs for health promo-tion and disease prevention.J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 108, NUMBER 5Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group S263 Therefore, in order to reduce the global burden of asthma and rhinitis, it will be necessary to first identifythe degree of community-specific disease burden, andthen establish credible justification for the re-allocationof health care resources. The costs and benefits of intro-ducing new asthma and rhinitis management programsmust be considered not only in regards to cultural appro-priateness but also in light of the existing resources ofeach community. Finally, these decisions must be exam-ined in relation to what the existing resources can pur-chase by way of other medical care and other non-medical goods (36). Also, while much of the focus on establishing new treatment strategies must rest on the community's will-ingness to provide resources, in most if not all communi-ties, some of the burden of care for both asthma andrhinitis falls upon the individuals and their families.Many persons with rhinitis in particular seek healing notfrom the health care practitioner but from other sourcesranging from non-prescription medications and herbalremedies to non-allopathic care providers. The individualand their family are likely to carry much of the econom-ic burden for this care. It is essential to further understandthe value of such non-traditional approaches in compari-son to allopathic care and its accompanying newer phar-macotherapeutic approaches. 12-7- CONCLUSIONS Millions of persons suffer physical impairments, reduc- tions in quality of life and economic consequences associ-ated with asthma and rhinitis. Health economic studieshave helped to characterise the costs of these diseases, butare limited to studying industrialised nations. There areeven fewer comparative studies by which one can judgethe most efficient ways of delivering health care for theseconditions. With health care costs increasing world wide,there is an increasing need for more advanced health eco-nomic studies if improvements are to be made to lessen thesocial and economic impact of these conditions.S26413- Unmet needs and research 13-1- EPIDEMIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE There are many studies, which have shown that rhini- tis and asthma often co-exist in the same patient. It seemsthat perennial rhinitis is more often associated with asth-ma than seasonal rhinitis. Resear ch needs: More epidemiological studies need to be carried out in order to better assess the prevalence of intermittentand persistent rhinitis as well as to better understandthe cause of rhinitis. More epidemiological evidence is needed to link rhinitis, asthma, conjunctivitis and other allergic dis-eases. In these studies, the epidemiological definition of rhinitis should be refined. Objective measures for assessing nasal obstruction should be developed and applied to epidemiological studies. In these studies, the categorisation of rhinitis, as it has been proposed in this document, should be used. 13-2- SEVERITY OF RHINITIS ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER RISK FOR ASTHMA Although this is a relevant question, no data are available. Thus, studies should be started to answer this question. 13-3- NATURAL HISTORY OF ASTHMA AND RHINITIS The chronology of rhinitis and asthma is still under dis- cussion. From the studies usually carried out, it appearsthat rhinitis often occurs before the onset of asthma andmay therefore be a predictor of asthma. Confounding fac-tors may be gender, allergen sensitisation or occupation. Resear needs: More epidemiological evidence is needed to better under- stand the natural history of allergic rhinitis and asthma. 13-4- WHY RHINITIS AND/OR ASTHMA AND/OR ATOPIC DERMATITIS In children with asthma, rhinitis is extremely com- mon. However, more studies are required in childrenwith rhinitis alone. It may be difficult to study childrenunder the age of 4 years. In patients with allergic rhinitisalone, intra-bronchial allergen challenge induces abronchial response. - Distinct clinical genotype Are there genes which differentiate rhinitis and asthma? There are genes which are important for bronchial hyper-reactivity but we do not know whether the susceptibilitygene polymorphism differs between patients with rhinitisalone and asthma. However, the characterisation of thephenotype should be very precise in these genetic studies.At present, response to anti-allergic/asthmatic treat- ment is very heterogeneous and may be due, at least part-ly, to genetic polymorphism. It should be checked whethergenetic polymorphism differs in rhinitis asthma.- Environmental exposure allergyand asthma\"). 13-5- COMMON AND DIFFERENTIAL PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS INUPPER AND LOWER AIRWAYS Although many studies showed that the same patholo- gy is present in the nose of rhinitis patients and thebronchi of asthmatics, more data are needed to confirmcommon mechanisms rather than causal association.Moreover, we should ask the following questions: Is there a common pathology ? What are the similarities and differences in patho- physiology? Are changes in the nose reflected by changes in the bronchi and vice-versa? 13-6- IS THERE REMODELLING OF THE NOSE? Research is needed. 13-7- INFLUENCE OF SINUSITIS ANDPOLYPOSIS ON ASTHMA Many papers have attempted to study the causal links between asthma, sinusitis and nasal polyposis. However,the methodology is extremely difficult and no firm con-clusion could be drawn from these studies except inaspirin sensitivity. Carefully designed prospective stud-ies are needed to better understand these important links. 13-8- INFLUENCE OF RHINITIS ON EXERCISE-INDUCED ASTHMA The impact of rhinitis on exercise-induced asthma is supported by the influence of airway temperature inbronchial symptoms (2770, 2771) and the function of thenose in protecting the lower airways from cold and dryair challenge. However, more data are needed to fullyappreciate the links. 13-9- CAN RHINITIS PREDICT ASTHMA EXACERBATIONS? It has been widely reported that a flare of rhinitis may be a prodrome of subsequent asthma. Viral infections orallergen exposure can lead to rhinitis followed by asth-ma. However, we need more data : to assess the links between these exacerbations,J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 108, NUMBER 5Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group S265 to explain how this association may have an impact upon the management of asthma, to show that treatment of nasal inflammation subse- quent to viral infection may prevent the developmentof bronchial symptoms. 13-10- TREATMENT OF AR INFLUENCES THE SEVERITY OF ESTABLISHED ASTHMA Since most asthmatics have nasal symptoms, treatment of the patient requires targeting both sites. However,although many studies have been performed: it is not known if the treatment of one site significant- ly improves treatment requirements of the other site. it is not known whether intranasal and inhaled corti- cotherapy have an impact on safety. it is not known whether the doses of inhaled cortico- steroids can be reduced if nasal corticosteroids areadded. Such studies should be carefully designed sincesteroid tapering is very difficult to assess. the optimal way of treating patients with two concur- rent diseases has not been studied. drugs administered by oral route can reach both sites and may be of interest. Studies are required. the impact of treating both sites on QOL should be tested. the impact of treating both sites on asthma exacerba- tions (or control) should be tested. 13-11- LONG-TERM VERSUS PRN TREATMENT In asthma, it has convincingly been shown that long- term controller therapy is required to maintain control ofthe disease and prevent exacerbations. However, in rhinitis, although a minimal persistent inflammation has been shown in the nasal mucosa ofsymptom-free patients allergic to house dust mites orpollens, the clinical relevance of these findings has tobe better established. Thus, although it is recommendedto continue the treatment of patients with controlledpersistent rhinitis for some time, guidelines for theduration and cessation of treatment have to be devel-oped and tested. The relevance of \"nasal minimal persistent inflam- mation\" to the lower airway inflammation has to beconsidered. 13-12- TREATMENT OF AR IN CHILDHOOD PREVENTS DEVELOPMENT OF ASTHMA See \"Prevention of allergy and asthma\" initiatives.S266Nadia A\u00eft-Khaled, Donald Enarson International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (IUATLD) In developing countries, health care planners are faced with establishing priorities for the allocation of limitedhealth care resources and infectious diseases, both ofwhich remain a public health priority. When deciding onpriorities for public health action, it is important toremember that, just as with clinical practice, publichealth practice needs to be evidence-based. Evidence forpublic health activities may differ somewhat from thatneeded for clinical practice and is required to be moreextensive. 14-1- DECIDING ON PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION The following components need to be addressed when considering public health action: 14-1-1- Efficacy When considering an action (in this case, the manage- ment of allergies and asthma), it is necessary to deter-mine whether or not the interventions being proposedhave a scientific basis. In most cases, when it comes totreatment, this necessitates evidence of efficacy derivedfrom clinical trials. The technical requirements of clini-cal trials are known\u2014they should preferably be ran-domised, double-blind and controlled. In addition, it isimportant to determine that the population in which theclinical trial has been carried out is similar to the one inwhich the intervention is proposed. In clinical trials, itwould be irresponsible to consider treatment interven-tions without a scientific base. When considering intervention in terms of diagnosis, it is essential that the test characteristics of the diagnos-tic intervention should be satisfactorily evaluated. Thisrefers to the sensitivity (the test's ability to identify a highproportion of those who have the disease) and the speci-ficity (the test's ability to correctly identify a high pro-portion of those without the disease) of the test. In addi-tion, the test must have a high degree of reliability (whenit is performed repeatedly in a given situation, it shouldproduce consistent results) and should be valid (a posi-tive test should reflect the presence of the disease). 14-1-2- Effectiveness Effectiveness, unlike efficacy, is the ability of the intervention to perform well in large populations. Forexample, it is necessary to demonstrate that when a largegroup of patients is treated (without the selection of 'eli-gible' subjects, as is often the case in clinical trials), thetreatment actually produces results similar to thoseobtained in clinical trials. If a treatment is efficacious butdifficult to take (for example, if it has associated adversereactions), it will not be effective in the communitybecause the patients will not take the medication. Likewise with diagnostic interventions, it is necessary to demonstrate that they can be applied to a populationand produce reasonable results. For this purpose, it isnecessary to evaluate the predictive value of patients rou-tinely presenting for diagnosis. The predictive value of apositive test is the probability that the individual with apositive test result actually has the disease. The predic-tive value of a negative test is the probability that an indi-vidual with a negative test does not have the disease. Thevalue of these two parameters varies with the prevalenceof the disease. Very frequently, tests with a high degreeof sensitivity and specificity do not have a satisfactorypredictive value when the disease is relatively rare. 14-1-3- Feasibility The next requirement for evidence supporting a public health intervention is feasibility. Can the interventionactually be delivered to a high proportion of the patientswho suffer from the disease? This is an issue frequently overlooked by clinicians. Even when an intervention has a high degree of efficacyand effectiveness, if it cannot be delivered to a high pro-portion of those with (or at risk of) the disease, it is not areasonable public health intervention. This is a majorproblem with many proposed activities. Feasibility maybe jeopardised by a number of factors: the treatment may not be available or may be too expensive, there may be logistic difficulties in providing a regular supply, perhaps those suffering from the condition live far away from the health service. Evaluating feasibility often necessitates a 'pilot pro- ject'. Interventions at the community level (public healthinterventions) should never be adopted as general poli-cies if they have not been demonstrated to be feasible. 14-1-4- Cost Benefit It is necessary that any intervention shown to be effica- cious, effective and feasible should be made available.However, it is often forgotten that the resource base isfinite and that there is always a competition for existingresources, necessitating setting priorities. Among thepieces of evidence necessary for setting priorities isdemonstration of cost benefit. This allows comparison ofyield of a variety of interventions. Those with the greatestyield for the amount invested will clearly have priority. In addition to this evidence base, one must consider the process by which public health interventions aredeveloped. There is a clear plan by which such actionsshould be initiated. When the problem is very large and14- Recommendations for developing countriesJ ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 5Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group S267 necessitates a response, there is often an insufficient evi- dence base. The following steps should therefore betaken to develop this base: given the existing knowledge, gain a consensus of experts on the best approach to take. Use this consensusto propose a standardised approach to the intervention. use this consensus to mount the process of creating evidence, namely clinical trials, followed by field tri-als, pilot projects and then economic evaluation. when a public health action is initiated, commence the activities in such a way that the necessary informationfor monitoring implementation and operations is builtinto the programme. This usually requires a standardiseddata collection procedure and a systematic evaluation. establish a period of operations after which a systematic and critical evaluation is carried out. The evaluationshould take account of the information routinely collect-ed in order to determine whether the established objec-tives are being met. revise the policy, based on the critical evaluation. repeat the whole procedure. By systematically defining, adopting, evaluating and revis- ing policy, it is possible to increase efficiency and cost bene-fit and to ensure that the application of the policy actuallydelivers the outcome it was designed to provide. Implemen-tation of public health policy without a systematic approachfrequently leads to failure and a waste of investment. 14-2- STANDARDISED MANAGEMENT FOR INDIVIDUAL PRACTICE Allergic rhinitis may be considered as a public health problem in some developing countries and is becoming apublic health problem in some low income countries.However, the prevalence of chronic rhinitis is alreadyhigh in some developing countries and is frequently asso-ciated with asthma (154). These patients are often treat-ed incorrectly by general practitioners prescribing antibi-otics, and a lot of money is spent on inadequate care. Forthese reasons, a standardised management plan for aller-gic rhinitis should be proposed to practitioners to pre-scribe the most effective treatment affordable for patientsliving in developing countries. 14-2-1- Diagnosis Diagnosis is easy when rhinitis is associated with other manifestations of the disease such as conjunctivitis,skin allergy and/or asthma. The diagnosis is more diffi-cult when rhinitis is the only manifestation of the disease.In view of the frequency of asthma and rhinitis co-mor-bidity even in developing countries, when patients con-sult for chronic nasal symptoms, evaluate asthma symp-toms and when they consult for asthma symptoms, itwould be useful to evaluate nasal symptoms. 14-2-1-1- QuestionnaireWhen a patient consults for chronic or recurrent nasal symptoms, a standardised questionnaire might be a verygood tool for the diagnosis of allergic rhinitis. This ques-tionnaire must assess the major symptoms of rhinitisincluding sneezing, a runny nose and/or a blocked nosewhen the patient does not have a cold. For the identification and evaluation of severity of the allergic rhinitis, a standardised questionnaire is proposedin Table 23. Some questions are from (or are adaptedfrom) the standardised questionnaires used in two impor-tant epidemiological studies: the International Study ofAsthma and Allergies in Childhood \"ISAAC\" (154) andthe European Community Respiratory Health Survey\"ECRHS\" (107). This standardised questionnaire, proposed as a tool for diagnosis, contains three parts: questions in the first part identify specific symptoms of allergic rhinitis, main trigger factors and familyhistory of allergic disease; questions in the second part are used to establish the severity of the disease; questions in the third part identify seasonal and occu- pational allergic rhinitis: -pollen sensitisation: symptoms occur each year during the same season and are accompanied by itchy andwatery eyes. -aspirin sensitisation: serious symptoms with nasal obstruction frequently associated with nasal polyps,also sensitisation to aspirin and/or non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs These patients gen-erally have allergic rhinitis associated with urticariaand severe asthma attacks after the ingestion ofaspirin or other NSAIDs. -occupational: symptoms occur only at the workplace or at night after work. At the beginning of the disease,symptoms may disappear totally during the weekendand holidays and reappear at work. In most of thesecases, allergic rhinitis is associated with asthma. Finally, in most cases, a concise questionnaire is suffi- cient to identify allergic rhinitis, to determine co-morbid-ity with other manifestations of the disease, to classify theseverity of symptoms and to suspect particular cases. If possible, and depending on the development of ser- vices in the country, these particular cases suspected bygeneral practitioners should be referred to specialists forconfirmation of diagnosis and specific management. A panel of specialists proposed a quantitative score (Annesi I, Didier A, Klosek M et al.). A diagnostic for allergic rhinitis (SFAR) was proposed: Develop-ment, hospital validation and population acceptability(submitted) for the diagnosis of allergic rhinitis. An evalu-ation of this score would be useful in clinical practice. 14-2-1-2- ExaminationIn severe cases, clinical examination may be per- formed by anterior rhinoscopy if a rhinoscope with aspeculum is available. In the absence of adequate equip-ment, direct observation of the nostrils may reveal theprincipal signs of allergic rhinitis: signs of inflammation localised to the inferior turbinate which appears oedematous, red, swollen andcovered with secretions. S268 and the ARIA Workshop Group J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL NOVEMBER 2001 polyps may be seen in some patients with partial obstruction of the nostrils, particularly for patientswith sensitisation to aspirin.14-2-1-3- ClassificationBased on the severity of symptoms:The classification of severity proposed for industri- alised countries, based only on the severity of the symp-toms, can easily be applied in developing countries(Table 23). The three questions from the second part of the stan- dardised questionnaire proposed in Table 23 are suffi-cient to establish the severity of allergic rhinitis and clas-sify the disease.Identification of seasonal and occupational rhinitis:Three questions proposed in Table 23 may be helpful in particular cases of allergic rhinitis with specific sensi-tisation to pollen, aspirin and other NSAIDs, or to anoccupational agent. 14-2-2- Management 14-2-2-1- Avoidance measuresAvoidance measures should be used for rhinitis when- ever relevant. These include removing cats and reducingmite allergen by encasing mattresses and pillows in imper-meable covers. However, some of these measures are dif-ficult or impossible in poor socio-economic conditions. TABLE 23: Standardised Questionnaire proposed for patients with chronic nasal symptoms. * Some questions are taken or adapted from the ISAAC and ECRHS standardised questionnaires.

If Yes: Which tablets? * When the patient has other chronic respiratory symptoms, another questionnaire to research asthma will be applied before. The IUATLD standardised questionnaire is proposed in the IUATLD Asthma Guide (6).J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 108, NUMBER 5Bousquet and the ARIA Workshop Group S269 In the case of occupational disease, it will be necessary to remove the patient from the exposure at work. But in manycases, the patient will not accept this decision because he willlose his job. The best solution when possible would be toremove the most dangerous agent, replacing it with anotherless potent one. This is possible in most cases and would pro-vide a collective preventive solution for healthy workers. Itwould also maintain patients in their trained work. 14-2-2-2- MedicationsAmong the medications proposed for treatment, two are available in developing countries for the effective manage-ment of the majority of allergic rhinitis oral H1-antihistamines) andnasal beclomethasone (intra-nasal corticosteroids). The rationale for this choice of drugs for developing countries is based upon 4 points:High level of efficacy : Intra-nasal corticosteroids for rhinitis are probably the most cost-effective drugs asdemonstrated for asthma, even in developing countries(2272). Low cost drugs affordable for the majority of patients: With chlorpheniramine which is sedating, it is possible to have monthly treatment for only 1 or 2US $ (0.25 US $ if bought through IDA) and for 5 US$ with intra-nasal corticosteroids (Table 24). Inclusion in the WHO essential list of drugs: These two drugs are on the WHO essential list of drugs. It isa very important step for countries to include drugs intheir national essential drugs list. However, non-sedative antihistamines should also be included. Decrease of cost might be expected : If demand increases, it may be possible to have these drugs at alower price in the near future with the production ofgenerics. The new oral H1-antihistamines are moreeffective with no sedative effect, but they are not rec-ommended as first-line drugs in developing countriesdue to their high cost (9-20 US $ for one month's treat-ment). They are currently more expensive than intra-nasal corticosteroids. However, they should be used asfirst-line drugs if they are more affordable in the future. 14-2-2-3- Immunotherapy Immunotherapy could be indicated in patients with allergic rhinitis according to the recommendations previ-ously given (8-3-5-1). However, indications could belimited in developing countries for the following reasons:TABLE 24: The price of principal drugs for Allergic Rhinitis.

Thepatient has to be aware of its sedative effects and shouldtake the medication only in the evening although thismay not prevent an antihistamine hangover. The new-generation oral H1-antihistamines without sedativeeffects will be better as a first line treatment, but only inthe future when they are affordable for the patient. Moderate/severe intermittent rhinitis: Intra-nasal beclomethasone (300-400\u00b5g daily) will be prescribed.If needed, after a week of treatment, oral H1-antihist-amines and/or oral corticosteroids will be added. Mild persistent rhinitis: Treatment with oral H1-anti- histamines or a low dose intra-nasal (equivalent to beclomethasone 300-400 \u00b5g) will be prescribed. If symptoms are severe,add chlorpheniramine and oral steroids at the begin-ning of the treatment. The treatment of persistent rhinitis will be daily if symptoms are perennial but will be needed only duringthe season if symptoms are seasonal. In the case of co-morbidity with asthma, asthma man- agement is the priority. Asthma management for devel-oping countries was proposed in the IUATLD AsthmaGuide (2273). The affordability of inhaled steroids isvery low in these countries (2274). If it is affordable forthe patient to treat the two manifestations of the disease,it should be recommended to add the treatment of aller-gic rhinitis to the asthma management plan. Management of particular cases: In addition to the standardised treatment, and depending on the level ofseverity, other dispositions are necessary: - Occupational rhinitis: flooring, wood and iso- cyanates are frequent causes of occupational rhini-tis and asthma, even in developing countries. Inmost cases, if the patient maintains exposure atwork, a severe aggravation of the disease willoccur, even with adequate treatment. If it is impos-sible to remove the agent from the workplace, itwill be recommended to remove the patient fromhis/her job. In cases where the patient refuses, indi-vidual preventive measures will be proposed. - If these patients are all referred to specialised ser- vices, it will be useful to have a register of occupa-tional allergic rhinitis and asthma. This register willserve as a very good tool for identifying specificexposed workplaces and for proposing collectivemeasures of prevention: replacing one agent byanother less toxic agent, using hoods over stoves, etc. Rhinitis with sensitisation to aspirin and other NSAIDs: - The majority of these cases suffer severe asthma and require rigorous treatment and strict follow-up.As a severe accident may occur if these patientstake aspirin or other NSAIDs, it is particularlyimportant to give them the list of drugs that shouldbe avoided. Paracetamol is well tolerated by themajority of patients. 14-3- CONCLUSION A standardised management plan for allergic rhinitis may be proposed for developing countries. In the major-ity of cases, the diagnosis of allergic rhinitis may be car-ried out using a simple standardised questionnaire. Itsmanagement might be possible with only one or twodrugs. In the case of co-morbidity with asthma, it is use-ful to add rhinitis treatment to asthma treatment. A research programme will be necessary to determine the future need for public health action.S271Appendix 1: Statements of evidence A.- De velopment Pr ocess (12 points): 1.- Have you clearly defined the purpose of the guideline?

(1 point) [X]Yes[ ]No J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL NOVEMBER 2001 6.- Have you included a specific description of the Iiterature review process and sources of evidence? (1 point) [ ]Yes [X]No [ ]Can't Tell In Medline, articles can be traced in two ways: by any word listed on the database, including words in the title, abstract, authors' names and the institution where the research was done; and by a restricted thesaurus of medicaltitles, known as medical subject heading (MeSH) terms (2775). Not all medical articles are indexed on Medlineand some have been misclassified. Searching by textword can therefore supplement a search by MeSH (2776). Inthe present document, we used the search by words and MeSH. In the present document, an extensive Medline search was carried out from 1966 to 31-12-1999 using PubMed \u00aeconcerning the following items: rhinitis all treatment options (see 8-1, 8-2, 8-3, 8-4) all diagnosis options (see 7) for medications, the generic name of all known medications (for rhinitis) was used with the key words \"placebo-controlled\". When no placebo-controlled studies were available, we used the key words \"con-trolled\". For treatment options, a search with EMBASE \u00ae(Excerpta Medica) was also carried out to find papers not referenced on Medline. A search of randomised rhinitis trials was done using the Cochrane Library database (12-1999). The search included the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) and the Database of Reviews of Effectiveness(DARE). The literature of each of the chapters was extensively reviewed by at least the chairmen and two members of the panel. 7.- Has the Iiterature review process of your guideline been systematic and not biased? (2 points) [X]Yes[ ]No [ ]Can't Tell 8- Have you considered economic information (cost-effectiveness, use of resources...) in the review process? (1 point) [X]Yes [ ]No [ ]Can't Tell In the guideline, a special section on cost-effectiveness has been included (chapter 12). However, in the rec- ommendations, such an item was not possible due to the variable costs for medications in different parts of theworld and the lack of some drugs in the essential drug list of WHO. 9.- Have you included the most updated and the highest quality available evidence? (3 points) [X]Yes[ ]No ecommenda tions (8 points): 10.- Have you developed valid recommendations (consistent with evidence findings)?

(3 points) [X]Yes[ ]No [ ]Can't Tell (see 8-5) 12.- Have you used an explicit and acceptable process to combine the relative value of different outcomes? (1 point) [X]Yes[ ]No [ ]Can't Tell All diagnostic and therapeutic interventions have been reviewed and referenced. Moreover, double-blind, placebo controlled studies and double-blind studies have been clearly mentioned (see 8-5). 13.- Have you used a rational and acceptable approach to integrate economic and clinical data? (1 point) [X]Yes[ ]No [ ]Can't Tell In the guideline, a special section on cost-effectiveness has been included (chapter 12). However, in the rec- ommendations, it was not possible to add such an item due to the variable costs for health care and medicationsin different parts of the world. C.- Implementa tion tion [X]Yes[ ]No [ ]Can't Tell 15.- Does your guideline include effective strategies for the dissemination and implementation to its target audience?
