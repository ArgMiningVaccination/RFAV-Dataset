He not only critiqued the technology of his day, but foretold new forms of technology that would inevitably arise, technologies that would be connected to the makers' very attitudes of soul, either the good or bad within them\u2014in other words, their deepest motivations. How we, as evolving human beings, approach technology and its development will be instrumental in determining how ultimately human evolution will turn out. Our future as human beings and the future of technology are intimately connected.\" \u2014Gary Lamb Illuminating, compelling, challenging, at times staggering in its breadth, A Road to Sacred Creation is above all the definitive text for gaining a hold on Rudolf Steiner's nuanced perspectives on technology. Charting both an inner and outer course\u2014part pilgrimage toward greater perception and knowledge, part dramatic, unfolding plot line of the future of humans and machines, the metaphoric \"road\" of the title is exactly where humanity finds itself today, though the exact route and destination are still to be determined. The map is not yet drawn, but here is a beginning. Taken together, the relevant concepts, ideas, and insights of Steiner\u2014deftly brought into sequence and dialogue as the editor has done in this book\u2014reveal how the work to arrive at a more spiritually imbued technological future not only involves all domains and fields of spiritual science and anthroposophic work, but has its origins in the very core of our being, fundamentally entwined with our moral progress toward freedom and selfless love. \"Gary Lamb's monumental research project to gather together what Rudolf Steiner had to say about technology is here crystal-lized into a profound, accessible, and digestible form that can be read and studied in part or in the whole. And this is just the first volume. Lamb's contextual notes are a helpful guide in under-standing one of the most morally complicated topics of our time\u2014what is at play in the intimate interrelationships of the human being, the reality of the spiritual world, and technology.\" \u2014John Bloom, General Secretary, Anthroposophical Society in America \"Gary Lamb's A Road to Sacred Creation is illuminating, compelling, challenging, at times staggering in its breadth, and above all highly useful in the quest to make known Steiner's vast and nuanced perspectives on technology. The road that begins to appear charts both an inner and outer course: part pilgrimage toward greater perception and knowledge, part dramatic, unfolding plot line of the future of humans and machines. Taken together, the relevant concepts, ideas, and insights of Steiner, deftly brought into sequence and dialogue in this book, reveal how the work to arrive at a more spiritually imbued technological future not only involves all domains and fields of spiritual science and anthroposophical work, but has its origins in the very core of our being, fundamentally entwined with our moral progress towards freedom and selfless love.\" \u2014Virginia Hermann, performing artist and teacher, Eurythmy Spring Valley \"In this work, Gary Lamb brings Steiner's insights to life in relation to the current situation in our technological world. With the help of commentary that supports and contextualizes the vast collection of quotes to form coherent pictures of different aspects of the question of technology, this work helps anyone who is interested in modern technology to get a comprehensive idea of what spiritual science has to say about it. By illuminating the whole landscape, from atoms to spiritual realities in society, this work forms an excellent reference and is a must-read especially for teachers, researchers, and social scientists.\" \u2014Gopi Krishna Vijaya, PhD, physicist \"Despite Rudolf Steiner's assertion that if people would really read his written works, they could give the lectures themselves, he gave some 6,000 lectures on a wide variety of topics. Thus, we can be grateful that Gary Lamb has once again culled a wide swath of quotations from these lectures and assembled them for us around a main theme focused on the possibility of a new form of technology and a new source of energy that could avert the immanent dangers associated with our present forms. Lamb shows us how these new forms, which can be derived from Steiner's spiritual science require us to reexamine our epistemological stance regarding the world and to extend our concepts of atom, electricity, magnetism, and light. But Lamb also shows us that all this calls for a concurrent reformation of education within a new social organization that can overcome the conflict between our current form of capitalism and the calls for social, environmental, and economic justice. Thus, Lamb's book will be of great service to both the newcomer to Steiner's work as well as those who have long been students but focused on particular aspects of Anthroposophy.\" \u2014Ronald Milito, DEd biophysics; human anatomist and former university and Waldorf school educator \"Since Rudolf Steiner was alive, technology has increased its influence exponentially and promises to continue to do so. Because his spiritual scientific research was able to explore the stream of time coming from the future, he had important insights to share about the direction of this field. However, there were no special lectures dedicated to the subject, so this Compendium is an invaluable aid. The things Steiner said about technology have been collected and ordered, and through Gary Lamb's clear and concise introductions to the chapters one can follow the thread of a train of thought that Steiner wove throughout his work.\" \u2014Sherry Wildfeuer, editor, Stella Natura biodynamic planting \"This is a deeply important volume for to take in and ponder. The challenges we will face in the coming decades surrounding all questions of technology will require a strong and refined sense of discernment. Each of us will need to make independent decisions that will not only remain in the realm of opinion and beliefs but will also influence our actions in daily life. This compendium collects Rudolf Steiner's esoteric perceptions on questions of tech-nology to help us on our way. The chapter on electricity is particularly revealing.\" \u2014Rachel Schneider, Institute for Mindful C O N T E N T S: Preface: How I Came to Edit this Compendium Editor's Note: Intention Introduction 1: The Evolution of Science: From Natural Science to Spiritual Science by Way of Goethe 2: Atoms and Atomic Theories 3: Electricity and the Challenge of Evil 4: Early Twentieth-Century Technology 5: Keely, Strader, and the Development of Etheric Technology 6: Transcending Private Capitalism and Socialism: The Necessity for a Threefold Social Organism 7: Child Development: Waldorf Education and Cultural Freedom in Relation to Technology 8: Ahriman's Pervasive Influence in the Age of Modern Technology: How to Meet Its Challenge 9: Thinking as a Spiritual Activity Appendix A: Earth Evolution Illustrations Appendix B: Publishers Referenced in this Volume Bibliography "}
