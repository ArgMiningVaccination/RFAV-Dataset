Testing Schedule: 8 days upon receipt at reference laboratory Reference Range: pathologist approval for orders during inpatient encounters. Mailouts staff will not process order without approval. The pathologist covering mailouts approval can be reached at pager #3724.

This assay measures serum IgG antibodies recognizing polysaccharide antigens from Neisseria serogroups included in the licensed meningococcal vaccine. The meningococcal vaccine response is best evaluated by testing pre-vaccination and post-vaccination samples in parallel. A two-fold or greater increase for at least two serogroups is expected when comparing post-vaccination to pre- vaccination results. N. meningitidis IgG levels peak approximately one month post-vaccination, but decline markedly by two years.
