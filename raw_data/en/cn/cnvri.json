The desire to stay healthy inside and out is rooted in the medicine, that led ancient acupuncturists and herbalists to master the art of cosmetology naturally without the use of plastic surgeries or other toxic medications and fillers. I have seen too many Botox and filler treatments go bad. Often times people end up with internal toxicity coupled with eye problems, neck and jaw pain and a whole lot of annoying symptoms when all they wanted is to look and feel better as well as gain more confidence. This is why I offer the treatment options below, I use holistic topicals and light therapy in addition to each modality. Look no further if you are looking for natural ways to help you look and feel your best :-) Treatments start as low as $375 Please scroll down for treatment descriptions and package options. Micro-Needling Aftercare sheet Micro-Needling Micro-Needling is the insertion of very fine short needles into the skin for the purpose of increasing elasticity and facial rejuvenation. Inserting these needles create a tiny wound that signals for the skin to respond by producing collagen production and creating new skin cells. An added benefit to Micro-needling is that it also enhances serum absorption to the clinical treatment of wrinkles, scars and general skin care. Benefits of micro-needling include the treatments of: Deep wrinkles. Hyperpigmentation. Stretch marks. Deep acne scars. Encourages serum topical absorption by 2000%. Naturally rejuvenate wrinkles without any painful surgery or toxic injections! Scalp Micro-needling combined with herbal medicine to stimulate the hair folicles to regrow hair again. Micro-needling is a treatment that is done either once or twice a month depending on your skin type, supplementing with Nano-needling in between sessions. $395 per session. Please refer to the aftercare sheet to the left to better schedule the timing of your sessions and for aftercare instructions. Nano-needling With Nano-needling, I use a similar type of oscillating motion as micro-needling to treat the skin but the device encompasses 81 silicone tips instead of tiny needles. These tiny microscopic cones separate the cells within the epidermis layer to allow active products to be pushed into the skin. Nano-Needling only affects the epidermis, treating within the upper .15 mm of the skin. This treatment can be done weekly to exfoliate the skin. Benefits of Serum Infusion treatment: Allows up to 97% product absorption. Pigmentation reduction. Increased cell turnover. Reduces fine lines and wrinkles. Reduces facial swelling. Tones sagging skin. Skin rejuvenation. Immediate glow with no downtime. Naturally rejuvenates your skin without toxic injections or surgeries. Resolves acne. This is a lovely treatment to receive as a stand alone treatment, between Nano needling sessions, or in conjunction with facial rejuvenation acupuncture series. I find that starting with weekly sessions is ideal for best results and then biweekly then maintenance treatments and so on is a good way to go. $395 per session. Cosmetic Acupuncture Cosmetic Acupuncture, also known as facial rejuvenation acupuncture, is a gentle non-surgical technique that is used to reduce the signs of aging from the face while improving the overall health and balance of the whole body. This ancient technique can erase 5-15 years from the face and brings out your innate beauty and radiance. Results are evident shortly after beginning treatment. Benefits may include: Eliminating fine lines and diminishing deeper wrinkles. Increasing muscle tones and tightening skin pores. Increasing collagen production. Diminishing acne by improving hormone balance. Lifting droopy eyelids. Reducing bags under the eyes. Eliminating puffiness around the eyes. Firming jowls and minimizing double chins. Increasing circulation to the face which eliminates skin dryness. Reducing the evidence of stress on your face. Improving facial color. Naturally rejuvenates your skin without toxic injections or surgeries. This is a series of 15 weekly sessions. Each session builds on the next one. People often tell me that they feel good and confident about themselves and that some unrelated long standing symptoms resolve with treatments. I explain this is due to the nature of treating the root cause of illness. You receive beauty inside and out. $375 per session. holistic Topicals I only use the highest quality ingredients in my topicals and do not use synthetic or harmful topicals. Hyaluronic Acid, this substance naturally occurs in the our skin. Think of it as the best hydrating substance as it has the ability to retain moisture so your skin stays hydrated. It also prevents dryness by keeping the moisture from evaporating from your skin. AcuMicro Topicals, I use several different recipes that contain natural bioavailable skin care ingredients like Apple Stem Cells Own TCM Herbal Topical from Hummingbird Potions, you know I love making potions! These are potions based on traditional herbal medicine that help nourish the blood, regenerate skin, and allows the Qi to circulate leaving your skin healthy inside and out! Vegetable Glycerin, a safe and eco-friendly oil that is hydrophilic and can be readily absorbed by the skin. I use this as a base for mixing my serums and potions. This oil helps your skin stay hydrated and facilitates the absorption of the other potions I use. Facial Elixirs and Misting Oils are available for purchase from Hummingbird Potions. Celluma Light Therapy I have been using Celluma light therapy in conjunction with the session above (as well as for wound healing). I find that the combination of acupuncture and light therapy compliment each other and enhance the treatments leaving your skin glowing and feeling fabulous. Below are excerpts from celluma.com website: In summary: Light Therapy = Enhanced Krebs (energy) Cycle = Greater ATP Availability = More Collagen When all of those important metabolic events are happening, it then results in greater outcomes beyond just collagen production. We see a cascade of benefits such as: Cell generation to replace old cells (mitosis) Reduction and prevention of cell death (apoptosis) Neurogenesis (new neurons) Development of new capillaries (angiogenesis) Increased blood flow Enhanced Nitric Oxide production The synergistic effect is that your body is optimized to heal itself. Patients who use Celluma LED light therapy devices begin seeing: Skin rejuvenation and the reduction of wrinkles and fine lines Accelerated healing of chronic wounds. * General pain reduction including muscle, joint and arthritic pains. You can also request Celluma Light Therapy as an add-on to your regular acupuncture treatments. Add On Options Sound Therapy Adding Sound Therapy to your facial treatment enhances the effects and harmonize with the whole body for an added overall pampering and wellness. I use therapeutic harmonic sound vibrations on different face and body acupuncture points to support your constitution. Higher frequencies above your body to harmonize your ethereal auric field and chakra systems.
