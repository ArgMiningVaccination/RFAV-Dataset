Award Information](#_Section_II._Award_1) Eligibility Information](#_Section_III._Eligibility) [Section and Submission Information](#_Section_IV._Application_1) [Section V. Application Review Information](#_Section_V._Application) [Section VII. Agency Contacts](#_Section_VII._Agency) VIII. Other Information](#_Section_VIII._Other) Rates of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes Acquired Immunodeficiency Disease Syndrome (AIDS), have not abated and another 2.8 million new infections are estimated to have occurred worldwide in 2009. The continuing human and economic toll of HIV/AIDS requires a redoubled effort to develop a preventive HIV vaccine. Encouragingly, several recent results have bolstered enthusiasm for achieving this goal. The RV144 trial in a low-risk heterosexual population in Thailand was reported to show that the vaccine actually prevented infection in 31% of vaccinees during the scheduled three-year follow-up period, and that the vaccine effect appeared even stronger in the first year after completion of the immunization regimen. Non-human primate (NHP) studies with repeat-exposure mucosal challenge that transmits one or two SIV variants, just as observed for HIV in human sexual transmission, have shown that some vaccines can likewise induce abortive infection or prevent acquisition of virus in this analog model. In addition, multiple potent and broad neutralizing antibodies defining new targets on HIV gp120 have been isolated from HIV-infected individuals. These recent results have opened new horizons and hypotheses that can be exploited for vaccine design and evaluation. The partially successful RV144 trial has introduced new ways to think about protection against HIV. Prior to RV144, because inducing broad neutralizing antibodies to produce \"sterilizing\" immunity was such an elusive goal, an interim goal had been to rely on T-cell immunity to suppress plasma viremia after exposure and infection. It now appears that vaccination can tip the balance against the virus in the early events after exposure, so the important time frame to focus on shifts from the weeks-long period it takes to establish and maintain setpoint plasma viremia to the first days after exposure, when the track and fate of the first penetrating virions are established. The case-control analysis of RV144 has implicated the level of IgG antibodies to a conformational V1V2 epitope(s) as affecting infection risk, though the function that may be performed by these antibodies to prevent infection is unclear at present. Since blocking the acquisition of infection is also observed in several NHP studies, these models can effectively investigate the generation, localization and mechanism of protective responses that operate early after transmission. Whether transmitted-founder viruses have properties that differentiate them in significant ways from the chronic viruses that have been used until now as sources of vaccine antigens is only beginning to be investigated. And the new epitopes described by recent antibody discoveries enlarge the options for focusing the generation of protective antibody responses. These developments provide fertile new avenues of research for improving vaccine design. The HIV Vaccine Research and Design (HIVRAD) program is designed to fund projects that further address hypotheses crucial to the design of an efficacious HIV/AIDS prophylactic vaccine. Applications for five years of support should include plans that have advanced past the exploratory stage and include preliminary data. Less fully developed applications can request less than 5 years of support to establish feasibility. Applications aimed at developing or optimizing a specific vaccine platform should lay out a research pathway with clear decision points. Extensive modeling of vaccine concepts in non-human primates may be included. Clinical studies involving human subjects or vaccine research focused solely on therapeutic applications are not considered appropriate and will not be funded under this FOA. For information on programs that support therapeutic vaccine development, please contact program staff. Applications may address, but need not be limited to: Grant: A support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved project or activity.

Important Update: See [NOT-OD-16-006](/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-16-006.html) and [NOT-OD-16-011](/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-16-011.html) for updated review language for applications for due dates on or after January 25, 2016. Only the review criteria described below will be considered in the review process. As part of the [NIH mission](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11149), all applications submitted to the NIH in support of biomedical and behavioral research are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the NIH peer review system. Reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed). Is the program as a whole scientifically compelling? Are there coordination and synergy of the individual research projects and cores towards the achievement of the central objectives of the program? Are the overall program goals significant and focused on studies that significantly address hypotheses crucial to the design of an efficacious HIV/AIDS prophylactic vaccine? Will the integration of the individual projects into a single program be more beneficial than pursuing each project independently? Do(es) the Program Director(s)/Principal Investigator(s) have the leadership and scientific ability to develop an integrated and focused research program? Will the PD(s)/PI(s) devote adequate time and effort to the program? Is there adequate evidence of sufficient institutional support for the PD(s)/PI(s)? For applications designating multiple PD(s)/PI(s), are there adequate and appropriate coordination and communication among the PD(s)/PI(s)? Reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit, and give a separate score for each. An application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. For example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field. Does the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? If the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice be improved? How will successful completion of the aims change the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field? Are the project lead, collaborators, and other researchers well suited to the project ? If Early Stage Investigators or New Investigators, or in the early stages of independent careers, do they have appropriate experience and training? If established, have they demonstrated an ongoing record of accomplishments that have advanced their field(s)? If the project is collaborative or multi project lead, do the investigators have complementary and integrated expertise; are their leadership approach, governance and organizational structure appropriate for the project? Do the project lead(s) possess demonstrated abilities to develop a program of integrated research projects with a well-defined central research focus? Do the investigators commit adequate time and effort to the program? Do the investigators possess the qualifications and experience necessary for the individual research projects? Does the application challenge and seek to shift current research or clinical practice paradigms by utilizing novel theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions? Are the concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions novel to one field of research or novel in a broad sense? Is a refinement, improvement, or new application of theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions proposed? Are the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific aims of the project ? Are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success presented? If the project is in the early stages of development, will the strategy establish feasibility and will particularly risky aspects be managed? If the project involves human subjects and/or NIH-defined clinical research, are the plans to address 1) the protection of human subjects from research risks, and 2) inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion or exclusion of children, justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed? Will the scientific environment in which the work will be done contribute to the probability of success? Are the institutional support, equipment and other physical resources available to the investigators adequate for the project proposed? Will the project benefit from unique features of the scientific environment, subject populations, or collaborative arrangements? Reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the Administrative Core to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the core proposed). Reviewers will consider each of the criteria below in the determination of scientific and technical merit. Is the administrative and organizational structure appropriate and adequate to the attainment of the objective(s) of the proposed program? Is the management plan for fiscal accountability and communication within the program appropriate? Are the plans for coordination, problem identification and resolution, and the establishment of a strong collaborative environment for the program appropriate? Are the experience, level of commitment, and availability of the Administrative Core Leader and administrative staff adequate to manage the program? Reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the Scientific Core to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the core proposed). Reviewers will consider each of the criteria below in the determination of scientific and technical merit: Is provision of resources and core services for the individual Research Projects critical and justified? Is the relationship of a scientific core to the central focus of the overall program strong? Is the quality of the relevant facilities or services provided and criteria for prioritization and usage appropriate? Are the qualifications, competence, and commitment of the Core Leader and key personnel appropriate? As applicable for the project proposed, reviewers will evaluate the following additional items while determining scientific and technical merit, and in providing an overall impact score, but will not give separate scores for these items. For research that involves human subjects but does not involve one of the six categories of research that are exempt under 45 CFR Part 46, the committee will evaluate the justification for involvement of human subjects and the proposed protections from research risk relating to their participation according to the following five review criteria: 1) risk to subjects, 2) adequacy of protection against risks, 3) potential benefits to the subjects and others, 4) importance of the knowledge to be gained, and 5) data and safety monitoring for clinical trials. For research that involves human subjects and meets the criteria for one or more of the six categories of research that are exempt under 45 CFR Part 46, the committee will evaluate: 1) the justification for the exemption, 2) human subjects involvement and characteristics, and 3) sources of materials. For additional information on review of the Human Subjects section, please refer to the [Guidelines for the Review of Human Subjects](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11175). When the proposed project involves human subjects and/or NIH-defined clinical research, the committee will evaluate the proposed plans for the inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion (or exclusion) of children to determine if it is justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed. For additional information on review of the Inclusion section, please refer to the [Guidelines for the Review of Inclusion in Clinical Research](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11174). The committee will evaluate the involvement of live vertebrate animals as part of the scientific assessment according to the following five points: 1) proposed use of the animals, and species, strains, ages, sex, and numbers to be used; 2) justifications for the use of animals and for the appropriateness of the species and numbers proposed; 3) adequacy of veterinary care; 4) procedures for limiting discomfort, distress, pain and injury to that which is unavoidable in the conduct of scientifically sound research including the use of analgesic, anesthetic, and tranquilizing drugs and/or comfortable restraining devices; and 5) methods of euthanasia and reason for selection if not consistent with the AVMA Guidelines on Euthanasia. For additional information on review of the Vertebrate Animals section, please refer to the [Worksheet for Review of the Vertebrate Animal Section](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11150). Reviewers will assess whether materials or procedures proposed are potentially hazardous to research personnel and/or the environment, and if needed, determine whether adequate protection is proposed. For Resubmissions, the committee will evaluate the application as now presented, taking into consideration the responses to comments from the previous scientific review group and changes made to the project. For Renewals, the committee will consider the progress made in the last funding period.
