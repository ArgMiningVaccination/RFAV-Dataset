{"title": "HPV Knowledge and Attitudes Among American Indian and Alaska Native Health and STEM Conference Attendees", "author": "Naomi Lee; Carolyn J Noonan; Jason G Umans; Lonnie Nelson", "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": "Background: American Indian and Alaska Native women had approximately twice the incidence of cervical cancer as white women. Preventive measures for cervical cancer rely on screening and HPV vaccination. However, vaccine series completion and catch-up vaccinations for eligible adults are low across all racial/ethnic groups. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify gaps in knowledge and evaluate the attitudes toward HPV and the vaccine among AIANs with various levels of training in the STEM and health-related fields. Methods: Survey data were collected from audience members at two national conferences geared towards American Indian and Alaska Natives in health and STEM fields in September 2017. A vignette study was administered via a live electronic poll to test knowledge (true/false questions), attitudes, and to collect demographic information. Results: Respondents self-identified as primarily American Indian and Alaska Native (74%), pursuing or completed a graduate degree (67%), and female (85%). Most respondents (86%) were aware of HPV-associated cancer in men. However, most (48-90%) answered incorrectly to detailed true/false statements about HPV and available vaccines. After educational information was provided, opinions collected via vignettes highlighted mainly positive attitudes toward vaccination; specifically, that vaccines are safe and all eligible community members should be vaccinated (75% and 84%, respectively). Conclusions: We observed that our respondents with higher educational attainment still lacked accurate knowledge pertaining to HPV and the vaccine. Overall, continued education about HPV and the vaccine is needed across all levels of education including American Indian and Alaska Native community members and health professionals.", "sitename": "International Journal of Indigenous Health", "date": "2019-08-13", "cleaned_text": "Abstract Background: American Indian and Alaska Native women had approximately twice the incidence of cervical cancer as white women.
