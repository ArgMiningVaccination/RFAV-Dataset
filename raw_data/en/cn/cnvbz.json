Trigger Point injections can be a safe and efficient way to support your recovery from pain and injury and are a great addition to the many integrative medicine services offered by the Rebel Med Northwest Team! Decrease Pain Naturally Trigger Point Injections with Rebel Med NW Trigger point injections are a unique way to manage myofascial pain using a variety of healing substances that are injected right into a tender point in the muscle, called a \"trigger point\". Trigger points are often described by patients as \"knots\" or tension in the muscle that can't seem to be relieved after typical bodywork applications such as massage or normal acupuncture methods. Trigger point injections can include sterile water or saline, homeopathic injectables including Traumeel or arnica, anesthetics like lidocaine procaine, or certain nutrients like magnesium or vitamin b12. With trigger point injections, you can treat pain, improve range of motion, and recover from injury faster than you would normally. You can even treat chronic stubborn areas or scarred adhesions. What to Expect An office visit is required to evaluate and treat by either a naturopathic physician or acupuncturist trained in bio-puncture techniques unless otherwise referred by your physician prior to receiving treatment. Not all patients may benefit from trigger point injections, and when a thorough history and physical exam takes place the provider will determine the necessity for treatment recommendations and if you can benefit from trigger point injection therapy. These medications help to block inflammation. Inflammatory substances in the muscle produce pain by sensitizing nerve endings and receptors. In addition, the physical force of the fluid helps to break muscle spasms and adhesions. Trigger point injections are very safe. Patients may feel some injection site tenderness following the injection as the local anesthetic wears off. Injection substances: Nutrients or local anesthetic medications, typically a 1% or 2% solution is used of lidocaine or procaine, while additionally being diluted by sterile water or saline. Used to help create a pain-relieving effect with trigger point injection and assist in therapeutic response. Procaine is preferred over lidocaine due to several reasons: Procaine is metabolized locally into dimethylaminoethanol (DEAE) and para-aminobenzoic (PABA); DEAE is thought to increase acetylcholine while PABA is part of the folic acid molecule. So in this sense, procaine serves as a nutritive to damaged muscles. Lidocaine is longer acting and metabolizes in the liver; the possibility for achieving lidocaine toxicity is much greater than that of procaine, especially in the event of multiple injections in a short time period. Having experienced previous adverse reactions to local anesthetics is a contraindication to using either one of these injectants. Local anesthetics also have the effect of blocking sodium channels, thereby preventing depolarization. This has the overall effect of decreasing muscle hyperirritability in the local area of injection. Other injectants include vitamins B1, B6, or B12, homeopathics, sterile water, or magnesium sulfate. Each one has its considerations; however, the clinical success of trigger point therapy is dependent on operator technique, patient metabolism, and physical response to treatment when combined with other treatment modalities to maximize efficacy. These medications help to block inflammation. Inflammatory substances in the muscle produce pain by sensitizing nerve endings and receptors. In addition, the physical force of the fluid helps to break muscle spasms and adhesions.
