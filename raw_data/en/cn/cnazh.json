Texas Children's Hospital has long been affiliated with Baylor College of Medicine. Ranked by U.S. News and World Report as one of the nation's top 25 medical schools for research, Baylor College of Medicine is known for advancing the health of women, children and families through scientific discovery. Funding awarded to Baylor College of Medicine by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), as reported by the Blue Ridge Institute for Medical Research, reflects the depth and breadth of the college's research enterprise and the progress being made. Our collaboration with this leading medical school in the areas of pediatrics, pediatric surgery and obstetrics and gynecology and our work with Baylor physicians and researchers across hundreds of projects, enable us to continually improve treatments and outcomes for children and women throughout our community and beyond. Background To fulfill the requirements of Section 501(r)(3) of the U.S. Tax Code, not-for-profit hospitals must conduct a community health needs assessment (CHNA) at least once every three years. Shortly after, they are required to adopt an Implementation Strategy to address the health needs identified in the CHNA.5 Texas Children's Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment Recap of 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment and 2020-2022 Implementation Strategy Texas Children's Hospital's last CHNA was approved by the hospital's board of directors and disseminated to the public in November of 2019. A 2020-2022 Implementation Strategy Plan was approved and disseminated shortly after. In collaboration with the Episcopal Health Foundation (hereafter \"the Foundation\") a series of key informant interviews, implemented by Health Resources in Action (HRiA), were held over a three-month period in 2018. Fifty- three respondents across 10 counties were represented in the interviews. These stakeholders are community leaders, providers and staff from a wide range of organizations, including public health, health care, education, housing, transportation, immigration services, the faith-based community, local government, early childhood education, social services and others. Through the extensive CHNA process, which included key informant interviews, focus groups and ongoing participation in community health efforts in the region, Texas Children's identified six key health needs that pertain to our patient population. On June 4, 2019, the Community Benefits team presented 2018 findings to the hospital's Community Benefits Workgroup (CBW) for guidance on prioritizing the health needs from the perspective of the Hospital's Network of Care. The 2020-2022 health needs, implementation strategies and outcomes of the strategy are included in this report on pages 6-12. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which began in March 2020, some strategies and programs did not reach fruition or were limited in scope.6 Texas Children's Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment Summary of 2020-2022 Key Health Needs, Implementation Plans and Outcomes: Mental and Behavioral Health 2020-2022 Implementation Plan Strategies Support school-based efforts aimed at prevention and early intervention in mental health. Explore the logistics of forming an on-site crisis response team based in the Texas Children's Behavioral and Developmental Health Department. Encourage collaborations between law enforcement agencies and mental health providers to decriminalize mental health crises. Evaluation of Implementation Strategies In February 2020 , Texas Children's executed a multiyear gift agreement with the Girl Scouts of San Jacinto Council to promote the Outreach Empower Me! program (formerly known as Girl Scouting in the School Day). Outreach Empower Me!\" is a free leadership development program held during the school day. It provides an authentic Girl Scout experience to middle school girls in underserved communities where a lack of volunteers, transportation and financial resources are often barriers to joining traditional Girl Scout troops. During the 2020-2021 academic year, over 12,000 girls were served through staff-led community outreach programs in seven Texas counties (Brazoria, Fort Bend, Galveston, Harris, Jefferson, Orange and Wharton). Results utilized a Likert-type scale on three outcomes with answer choices ranging from \"Exactly like me\" to \"Not at all like me.\" Develop Positive Values: Girls act ethically, honestly and responsibly and show concern for others. Targeted Goal: 65% Result: 78% Cooperative Learning: Girls work together in an atmosphere of respect and cooperation to complete projects and learn. Targeted Goal: 65% Result: 77% Civic Orientation: Girls desire to contribute to the world in purposeful and meaningful ways and learn how to identify problems in the community. Targeted Goal: 60% Result: 69% Under the leadership of Jennifer Evans, Bianca Murrell, Dr. Kirti Saxena and Rhonda Wolfe, the Behavioral Health Support Team hired 29 team members dedicated to caring for behavioral health patients in the inpatient setting. Recruitment began in January 2022. This multi-disciplinary, mobile care team is designed to holistically care for patients admitted to Texas Children's with behavioral health concerns. The team will help mitigate safety concerns among patients and staff and help to better manage patients without alternative near-term placement options. The team is composed of psychiatrists, advanced practice providers, a board-certified behavior analyst, registered behavior technicians, security officers, clinical nurse coordinators, care coordinators, psychology techs and social workers. The team supports partnerships with the community and care management to establish community connections for discharge planning, including: School partnerships Community providers for therapeutic and psychiatric needs Long-term care facilities when indicated7 Texas Children's Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment Texas Children's Government Relations continues to identify opportunities for Texas Children's physician experts and leaders to advocate to the Texas Legislature by participating in legislative committee hearings with a focus on pediatric mental health in Texas. In 2022, Dr. Karin Price, Chief of Psychology at Texas Children's Hospital, testified on the subject of youth mental health needs and services during a joint hearing before the House Select Committee on Youth Health & Safety and the House Committee on Homeland Security and Public Safety. In July 2022, Texas Children's leaders participated in \"Mental Health Fly-In,\" an event held in Washington DC through our partnership with the Children's Hospital Association. Our team met with members of the Texas Congressional Delegation to discuss pediatric mental health needs and issues, laying the groundwork for additional steps Congress can take to address the pediatric mental health crisis. In 2019, Texas Children's advocated alongside various stakeholders in support of the passage of Senate Bill 11, which created the Texas Child Mental Health Care Consortium. Summary of 2020-2022 Key Health Needs, Implementation Plans and Outcomes: Access to Care 2020-2022 Implementation Plan Strategies Partner with community-based organizations to improve health insurance coverage and health literacy in vulnerable communities. Continue to explore telehealth strategies to increase access to health care in vulnerable communities. Explore the use of rideshare services to help underserved communities access care. Evaluation of Implementation Strategies Texas Children's Health Plan (TCHP) identified geographic-specific partnerships with over 30 organizations, including nonprofit groups, community organizations, social services, school districts and police departments. Through these partnerships, we held onsite community outreach events to assist families with applications for the Children's Health Insurance Program and Medicaid program. Over 34,000 community members received health insurance information and application assistance at 27 community events in 2021. TCHP also partnered with several community-based organizations to host bilingual COVID-19 town halls where Texas Children's providers answered questions about the COVID-19 vaccine. Texas Children's Government Relations Department has actively worked to expand access to care by advocating for telemedicine expansion. During the 87th Legislative Session, Dr. Robert Ball, eHealth Medical Director at Texas Children's, provided testimony before the House Committee on Public Health in support of House Bill 4, a bill that expands telemedicine services to patients covered by Medicaid. In February 2021, Texas Children's representatives advocated for and provided recommendations on the future of telehealth and telemedicine policy to the U.S. House Energy and Commerce's Health Subcommittee. Our leaders highlighted the benefits of expanding telemedicine services, including the ability to mitigate delays in care, prevent higher emergency room utilization and lessen delays in patients seeking care because of COVID-19 safety concerns.8 Texas Children's Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment Summary of 2020-2022 Key Health Needs, Implementation Plans and Outcomes: Social Determinants of Health 2020-2022 Implementation Plan Strategies Advocate for evidence-based programs and policies that improve quality of life and health outcomes for children and families living in poverty. Support efforts to increase access to quality early childhood education programs in economically disadvantaged communities. Evaluation of Implementation Strategies In February 2020, Texas Children's executed a multiyear gift agreement with the Houston Food Bank to support Food for Change (FFC), an initiative encompassing several programs aimed at creating economic and health care partnerships to address root causes and downstream effects of food insecurity. FFC's health programs include Food Rx, FIRST Link and Core Connections Network. Food RX is a food prescription program in collaboration with healthcare partners. Clients receive a Food Prescription (Food Rx) when referred by a designated Health care Partner or when they commit to a Community Health Program that can improve their lives. Food Rx clients attend designated Food For Change Markets twice a month where they can select 30 pounds of free fruits and vegetables (including at least two fruits and at least two vegetables) plus four additional \"Food Rx friendly\" items. Clients can also attend educational events at the market, such as cooking classes, as their schedule allows. Nutrition education material will also be available to clients to provide new ideas for how to prepare their food. Between February 1, 2021 - December 31, 2021, 250 new clients enrolled in Food Rx through the partnership with Texas Children's, resulting in 279 client visits to FFC markets. Texas Children's and Baylor College of Medicine's Division of Public Health Pediatrics (\"the Division\") oversees several programs aimed at addressing social determinants of health. The Child Abuse Pediatrics team at Texas Children's provides advisory and medical services for The Children's Assessment Center, a local organization that provides comprehensive services to children who have been sexually abused. Doctors Greeley and Van Horne served on Mayor Turner's task force on Child Friendly Cities, a UNICEF- driven initiative to make Houston a better place for children to live. The Division served on the steering committee and as the Coalition Alignment Chair of the Greater Houston Social Determinants of Health Coalition. This coalition consists of hundreds of members in the Greater Houston area who are working to collectively address social determinants of health and health equity. The Division was responsible for identifying and surveying local coalitions addressing social determinants of health to identify opportunities to align efforts. The Division continued to expand the upWORDS program, a 15-week early language development program for low-resourced families with children aged 0-2 years. From 2020-2022, the program served 1,115 families. In response to community feedback, the Division launched upSTART Community Programs in 2022, a suite of community-based programs designed to strengthen families with young children. The upSTART Community Programs includes the upWORDS program, a group-based, early language development program for families with children from birth to 36 months of age; upLIFT, a home visitation program for women with signs of perinatal depression and anxiety; Bridges, a support program with individual and group sessions for families with a child who has a 6-month or longer language delay; and Family Connects, a home visitation program for families with infants. All upSTART participants are screened for basic needs and are given access to care coordination services to connect them with community resources to address basic needs and social determinants of health.9 Texas Children's Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment In collaboration with the Harris County Sheriff's Office and The University of Texas Medical Branch- Galveston, the Division conducted a needs assessment on children with incarcerated parents and released the report, The Forgotten Families: A Needs Assessment on Children with Incarcerated Parents. The Division collaborated with the Harris County Sheriff's Office to make the Harris County Jail and the Harris County criminal justice system more supportive of inmates' children and families. For example, the Division provided technical assistance and training to members of the Harris County Public Defender's Office. As a result of this partnership, that office now inquires whether their clients have children, assesses the needs of the children and family and connects the family with community resources. The Division also offered parenting classes to incarcerated mothers in the Harris County Jail and evaluated programs and provided capacity-building assistance to a local nonprofit, Santa Maria Hostel, which offers incarceration alternatives to pregnant women and women with young children. The Division undertook a capacity-building initiative in underserved East Harris County (EHC). The initiative sought to strengthen the community's civic infrastructure and increase the capacity of individuals to advocate for health equity. In 2021 and 2022, 30 EHC residents graduated from a six-month leadership development program, in which they developed their own community- based projects addressing needs they identified in their community. Projects addressed each social determinant of health through the built environment, mental health (such as bullying), social connections and mentorship, job opportunities and homelessness, among others. Participants continue to receive support as they implement their projects. In response to recommendations developed during a 2018 needs assessment on perinatal substance use, the Division led a multi-sector steering committee to develop, pilot test and disseminate a tool for pregnant women and families with young children who have substance use issues. The Family CARE Portfolio (formerly known as the Plan of Safe Care) is now widely disseminated and implemented across Texas. The tool is used with families with complex social needs and those working across multiple systems to help families communicate and advocate for their needs. Texas Children's Department of Community Benefits also leverages community collaborations that address community health needs such as injury prevention, obesity and chronic disease prevention, screenings for social determinants of health and others. Current and future community partnerships include: The YMCA of Greater Houston - This partnership with one of the largest charitable nonprofits in the region, supports several health-related programs, including the YMCA Summer Day Camp and Safety Around Water. The Children's Museum of Houston - Texas Children's co-sponsors the Power Science Lab, located in the museum's PowerPlay! section, where children play the role of scientist and participate in interactive experiments focused on biology, the human body and nutrition. Texas Children's Center for Childhood Injury Prevention - The Safe at Home Program focuses on infant-safe sleep, home safety and water safety education and teaches parents how to childproof their homes and identify potential drowning hazards that may cause injury to their children. The program also teaches parents of infants younger than one year how to reduce their child's risk for infant death. As funding and resources allow, the program distributes portable crib systems, safe storage devices for firearms and childproofing kits. Throughout the year, program staff participate in health fairs, community events and media outreach in targeted neighborhoods with diverse populations. By providing parents and caregivers with the knowledge and tools needed to reinforce safety practices in the home, many injuries and deaths to young children can be prevented.10 Texas Children's Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment Provided in October 2019 - June 2022: Home safety-focused educational materials: 8,712 Firearm trigger locks: 150 Burn prevention bath thermometers: 720 Cardiopulmonary resuscitation training: 40 parents Portable crib systems: 112 Childproofing products: 72 Project ADAM - Texas Children's works with area schools to become Project ADAM Heart Safe Schools, better equipping them to respond to a sudden cardiac arrest on campus. To become Heart Safe, schools must meet certain criteria, including having an adequate number of functional automated external defibrillators (AEDs), five to ten CPR-trained faculty or staff members and two AED drills per year. Children at Risk - Texas Children's is a charter member of CHILDREN AT RISK's Children's Resiliency Collaborative. Through this partnership, we co-authored \"Still at Risk: Children One Year After Hurricane Harvey,\" a 2018 report providing insight into the aftermath of Harvey with recommendations to aid in Houston and the Gulf Coast's continued recovery. Texas Children's Community Benefits also served on CHILDREN AT RISK's Smartparents.org Advisory Council. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, physicians from Texas Children's helped CHILDREN AT RISK launch the Texas Family Leadership Council, a collaborative that remains active and assists more than 100 Texas nonprofits in accessing information and coordinating support to effectively serve children and families during the COVID-19 crisis. Dr. Claire Bocchini, medical consultant for the council, provides valuable weekly guidance on COVID-19 response to members. Texas Children's is an ongoing sponsor of CHILDREN AT RISK, contributing to initiatives that improve the lives of youth in our communities. Summary of 2020-2022 Key Health Needs, Implementation Plans and Outcomes: Maternal Health 2020-2022 Implementation Plan Strategies Advocate for policies that increase access to health services during the year after pregnancy. Support community-based care models to improve maternal health outcomes and promote postpartum wellness among vulnerable populations. Evaluation of Implementation Strategies Texas Children's Government Relations Department advocates for maternal health and improved access to care. During the 87th Legislative Session, members of the Texas Children's Health Plan leadership team advocated for the passage of and testified in support of House Bill 133. The bill expands Medicaid coverage for pregnant women from 60 days to six months to increase access to comprehensive health services, facilitate continuity of care and provide coverage for a full array of postpartum services. Texas Children's continues to advocate and support extending post-partum Medicaid coverage in Texas. In 2022, we signed letters of support requesting the Center of Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) approve Texas' waiver amendment granting six months of post-partum Medicaid coverage. HB 133 required federal approval.11 Texas Children's Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment Texas Children's advocates and encourages CMS, Texas Health and Human Services and the Texas Legislature to work with state associations and children's hospitals to explore options to extend Medicaid coverage for new mothers to one year postpartum. In 2019 - 2020, the Division of Public Health Pediatrics' research faculty conducted a randomized control trial with 156 participants and found that mothers receiving home visits from social workers had significant decreases in postpartum depression (PPD) symptoms and that home visits were just as effective as the gold standard of psychiatric treatment in significantly reducing PPD symptoms. The home visitation program showed beneficial impacts by increasing maternal bonding and self-efficacy. Based on feedback collected during this trial, additional modules and enhancements were made to the program to meet the needs of more women and the upLIFT program was created. In January 2022, the Division launched the upLIFT program at no cost to pregnant and postpartum women experiencing elevated symptoms of depression or anxiety. Licensed social workers deliver an evidence-informed curriculum to women in homes or through video conferencing in up to eight, one- hour sessions. They work together to choose from 16 learning modules offering tools and strategies found to help mothers manage their emotions, adjust to the transitions during pregnancy and the postpartum period and improve interpersonal skills. Our care coordination team provides referrals to community resources and, if necessary, serves as a bridge to mental health services beyond what the upLIFT program can provide. Summary of 2020-2022 Key Health Needs, Implementation Plans and Outcomes: Environmental Health 2020-2022 Implementation Plan Strategies Support evidence-based strategies to reduce the effects of mobile and industrial sources of pollution on health in Greater Houston. Explore strategies to improve access to green space for children and families in underserved communities. Evaluation of Implementation Strategies Doctors for Change is a membership organization that champions health for all Houstonians and Texans through research, education, collaboration and advocacy. In 2020, Doctors for Change partnered with Physicians for Social Responsibility to offer a one-hour presentation about the effects of climate change on health. Excessive temperatures, air quality and chemical pollutants found in cells, all have a significant impact on community health. The presentation provided an overview of these challenges and a discussion about opportunities for providers to engage in climate action within the Texas Medical Center. This includes advocating to the Texas Legislature for more carbon-neutral spaces and engaging in climate-related disaster preparedness and planning. Texas Children's works with The Episcopal Health Foundation, City of Houston Parks Department and the Memorial Hermann Community Benefit Corporation to improve park space in the Alief area of Houston, an economically disadvantaged community that is part of the Mayor's Complete Communities initiative. They utilize community benefit resources and foundation support to enhance programming and equipment at a park in Alief and track utilization and health outcomes over time. 12 Texas Children's Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment Summary of 2020-2022 Key Health Needs, Implementation Plans and Outcomes: Obesity and Chronic Disease 2020-2022 Implementation Plan Strategies Support community-based interventions that focus on diet and physical activity in families. Advocate for programs and policies that improve the nutritional quality of school lunches and breakfasts. Evaluation of Implementation Strategies The Children's Nutrition Research Center (CNRC) is a unique cooperative venture between Texas Children's, Baylor College of Medicine and the U.S. Department of Agriculture/Agricultural Research Service. The CNRC has over 40 faculty members conducting nutrition-related research. Research goals center on establishing evidence- based guidelines promoting health, growth and development through optimal nutrition. These guidelines are for use by physicians, parents and others responsible for the care and feeding of children. Current collaborations on externally funded research to evaluate community-based programs include the Texas Children's Health Plan, Texas Children's Pediatrics, Harris Health, local Head Start districts, the YMCA of Greater Houston, Baker Ripley, Prairie View A&M University Cooperative Extension Program, Houston Food Bank and various food pantries across Houston. The Texas Children's Center for Childhood Obesity provides comprehensive help to the community and to providers caring for patients with weight management challenges, obesity and associated co-morbidities. Texas Children's supports an array of YMCA initiatives, including the construction of an adaptive sports complex for children with physical limitations and the YMCA's Safety Around Water program. 13 Texas Children's Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment Introduction The Community Health Needs Assessment is a foundational report that identifies and prioritizes the needs of the community and assists hospitals in their efforts to support the health of the communities they serve. The CHNA process invites community organizations, nonprofits, leaders, schools, public health, service providers and others to voice the health concerns seen in the populations they serve. This valuable insight shapes which community health priorities are identified, impacted and support the system's mission, values and vision. According to federal regulations (IRS.gov, 2022) hospital facilities must complete the following steps: Define the community it serves with consideration for the geographic area of the hospital service area, target populations and primary functions/specialties. Assess the health needs of that community, prioritize needs and indicate potential resources. In assessing the community's health needs, solicit and consider input received from persons who represent the broad interests of that community, including those with special knowledge of or expertise in public health. Document the CHNA in a written report (CHNA report) that is adopted for the hospital facility by an authorized body of the hospital facility. Make the CHNA report widely available to the public. This report is essential to not-for-profit hospitals and health care systems' community benefit and social accountability programming. By thoughtfully evaluating the areas of need and gaps in the community, implementation plans can be developed \u2014 additionally mandated by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) \u2014 that strategically respond to high priority needs. Consistent with the approach of previous Texas Children's CHNAs, collaboration of local organizations, and internal and external partnerships supported knowledge-sharing during the data collection process. The benefit of cross- sectional work is recognized among this group to facilitate authentic and valuable changes in the community. While the basic structure and format of the report are in alignment with the 2019 report, the key difference in the 2022 CHNA is the independent data collection by Texas Children's Community Benefits team in collaboration with University of Texas Health Science faculty and students under the guidance and advisory of the Texas Children's Community Benefits Work Group. Community Served Texas Children's Hospital defines the community it serves as the Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), also known as \"Greater Houston.\" An MSA \u2014 defined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and used by the Census Bureau and other federal government agencies for statistical purposes \u2014 is a geographical region with a high population density and close economic ties throughout the area. While the Texas Children's Hospital Network of Care treats patients from around the globe, most of our patients (90.9% in Fiscal Year 2018) come from Greater Houston. In terms of land area, Greater Houston is approximately 9,444 square miles, making it larger than the states of New Hampshire (9,350 sqm), New Jersey (8,721 sqm), (1,545 sqm).14 Texas Children's Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment Harris County About Harris County includes the majority of the City of Houston with only 1.21% of the population considered rural.

The CHNA team embarked on a year and a half-long effort to solicit and consider input from persons who represent the broad interests of Greater Houston, including those with special knowledge of or expertise in public health. This involved a host of qualitative data-gathering efforts, which included key informant interviews, focus groups and community meeting surveillance. The results of those analyses are summarized in this report. Key Informant Interviews The CHNA team engaged with more than 20 organizations in Greater Houston that represent the broad interests of the community Texas Children's serves. These organizations represented a variety of sectors that interface with vulnerable populations. After establishing rapport with representatives from each organization and describing the CHNA project, the team invited each partner to participate in a recorded virtual interview. Trained interviewers from the team used the Key Informant Interview Guide (Appendix A), developed from previous CHNAs, updated with time- relevant questions, to ensure consistency and validity and utilized probing questions to further detail as needed when conducting the interviews. These key informant interviews were conducted for approximately 30-60 minutes. Questions included background of the interviewees' organizations, community health status and concerns, healthy living, access to health care and social services, COVID-19's impact on access to health care and social services and community health issues, ways to improve community health and advice for Texas Children's team members as they develop their community health implementation strategy for 2023-2025 to address top health concerns. Qualitative data was coded using descriptive and in vivo codes to generate prominent themes that arose in the data (see Analysis). Each interview recording was run through Cisco WebEx's text to speech software, which produced a written transcript for each interview as well as word clouds of the most used words/phrases for key questions. Analysis For each interview, qualitative and quantitative data were entered into an ArcGIS form by utilizing interview transcripts. Content analysis was used to analyze qualitative data codes for the communities served by key informants' organizations, particularly about community health concerns, healthy living and physical activity, access to health care and social services, work populations most affected by COVID-19, positive aspects of hybrid or remote services as a result of COVID-19 and how community health can be improved. Participant quotes were also extracted to supplement the content analysis. Quantitative data was analyzed for interviewee roles, the sector their organizations represent, demographic data for their communities (i.e., race/ethnicity, income, age group), overall community health status, the effect of COVID-19 on community health issues and access to health care and the effectiveness of health care programs and social services. For all quantitative questions, we asked interviewees questions from the interview guide to obtain open-ended answers, which were then gathered from interview transcripts and entered into ArcGIS. For example, interviewees were asked about their primary roles within their organization. After the interview, transcripts were reviewed and coded roles of director, staff member, volunteer, health provider or other. Sectors were organized to represent community services, government, organizations/coalitions, business/industry, health care, education or other. The method was utilized to code four additional questions, including demographics of communities served by our key informants. For example, primary age groups were coded into five different categories: children, adults, elderly, all or others. Income was coded as underserved, moderate, wealthy, mix or other. Community gender was indicated as women, men, boys (children), girls (children), all or other. For race/ethnicity, multiple codes could be selected if necessary. Community race/ethnicity was coded as White, African American, Hispanic, international and/or other.43 Texas Children's Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment A 5-point Likert scale was utilized for community health issues. Key informants were asked to rate the overall health status of the community they serve on a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being poor health and 5 being good health. After entering the responses from the interview transcripts into ArcGIS, average scores were determined to indicate overall community health status. We also asked key informants to indicate how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected community health issues. After giving an open-ended response, key informants' responses were coded from very negatively (1) to very positively (5). Key informants were asked to indicate how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the community's access to care. Open-ended responses were correlated to a 5-point Likert scale, from very negatively (1) to very positively (5). Questions regarding effectiveness of their community's programs, services and policies concerning health care and social services were included as well. Open-ended responses were transferred to a 5-point scale, from completely ineffective (1) to very effective (5).

A team of graduate students from the UTHealth School of Public Health then utilized extant data sources and academic literature to investigate each of these health needs. The findings were brought before the hospital's Community Benefits Workgroup on July 15, 2022, for guidance on prioritizing them from the hospital's Network of Care perspective. The Community Benefits workgroup consists of physicians and administrative leaders across the Texas Children's Network of Care, who provide critical guidance to the Community Benefits Department regarding community health issues. Their guidance is shaped by the institution's mission to create a healthier future for children and women throughout our global community by leading in patient care, education and research. It is also shaped by the four core values of Texas Children's: to embrace freedom, lead tirelessly, live compassionately and amplify unity. The Community Benefits workgroup prioritized our region's key community health issues in the following order: 1. Mental and Behavioral Health 2. Social Determinants of Health a. Economic stability b. Food insecurity c. Access to care d. Health literacy 3. Maternal Health 4. Chronic Disease and Unhealthy Lifestyle 49 Texas Children's Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment 1. Mental and Behavioral Health The Community Benefits Workgroup identified Mental and Behavioral Health as Texas Children's number one community health priority need for the Greater Houston area. Locally and across the nation, there has been a dramatic increase in mental health needs for children and young adults. This need has only been accentuated by the pandemic. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), one in five U.S. children are diagnosed with a mental disorder, with only 20% of those diagnosed receiving care from a specialized care provider for mental health. The key informants who were interviewed described mental health as a major health need in their communities. Many relayed seeing increasing depression, anxiety and suicidal behavior in the communities they served. In a 2021 report by 2021 Mental Health America, Texas scored second-to-last nationally in access to mental health care for both kids and adults. Social distancing guidelines, school closures and quarantining significantly decreased peer interaction and heightened stress levels (Zhou et al., 2022, Xie et al., 2020). Anxiety, depression, stress over the loss of family members and the virtual nature of education affected children across all age groups. Amongst the adolescent age group, an increase in suicidal thoughts was observed by school counselors (Zhai & Du, 2020; Liu et al., 2020). \"But as a counselor, what I see from our families is that [COVID 19] has significantly impacted families that have lost loved ones. They are struggling. They've lost their jobs...some normalcy has gone. Children's anxiety levels are through the roof. We have so many children who are really having trouble going back to school because of the fear of what that means and being in crowded spaces and being in these high schools and schools that have thousands of kids in them and there's no mass mandates and things like that. And we'll have kids who say that to us...Anxiety and suicide it's the highest we have ever seen with kids the youngest we have ever seen...\" [Representative from Yes to Youth (Montgomery County)] A study by the University of Texas Medical Branch that included 1,188 adolescents found that pandemic-induced isolation, loneliness, stress and economic challenges were linked to poor mental health outcomes and substance misuse (Temple et al., 2022). The study demonstrated that the pandemic worsened mental health and substance usage changes on individual and family levels. Depression and anxiety rates increased among teenagers when their regular support systems at school or in the community were unavailable. \"We see a lot of trauma in our communities and trauma has been exacerbated by COVID. We've seen folks who were at a normal functioning level that are really not at that level anymore and we've seen a lot of kids really retreat and get worse.\" [Representative from Tri-County Behavioral Health] Another study found that the number of mental health claims for high school-aged kids doubled in March and April of 2020 compared to March and April 2019 (FAIR Health, 2021). Stressors that disproportionately impacted teens were remote learning, school closures and isolation from friends. Lack of access to quality mental health care is a barrier, as there are insufficient pediatric therapists, psychiatrists, or school counselors to meet the demand for mental health services. \"Our waiting list for behavioral health right now is 19,898 people and that's because we have 132 providers that do behavioral health, both adult and pediatric and we have 34 school based clinics where we have a behavioral health therapist in the school. And so I really do see the need. We grew by 9,000.\" [A representative of Legacy Community Health]50 Texas Children's Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment Mental health emergency crises also rose. From March 2020 to October 2020, cognitive health-related emergency department visits increased by 24% for children ages 5 to 11 and 31% for those ages 12 to 17 compared with 2019 emergency department visits, according to CDC data (Leeb et al., 2020). Added to the mental health crisis were the exacerbating factors of being from low-income communities, loss of livelihood in families due to the pandemic and being from culturally diverse backgrounds leading to racially induced violence (Rahman et al., 2021). Respondents to key informant interviews and focus groups reported a decrease in retention rates of program activities. The community members communicated a lack of motivation to attend program events and appointments with the stakeholders. This was in part attributed to the negative impact of COVID 19 and the social issues it brought on mental health. The served communities' subpopulations, such as the elderly, are especially vulnerable to COVID and are also unable to participate in program activities in group settings. Another concern expressed by several key informants was the cultural barrier of seeking mental health assistance. From their observations, minority communities have a stigma surrounding seeking mental health help and resources and therefore have additional barriers. \"I definitely think that we need to have more programming around mental health and what that looks like and educating some of our black and brown communities about why you should not be afraid of speaking.\" [Representative from Houston Independent School District (HISD) Student Support Services] Figure 7: Geospatial Distribution of Self-Reported Depression Among Adults Aged >=18 in Greater Houston 51 Texas Children's Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment Potential Resources to Address Mental and Behavioral Health in the Community Local Spotlight: The Harris Center for Mental Health and IDD The Harris Center is the state-designated local mental health and intellectual and developmental disability (IDD) authority serving Harris County, Texas.

Social Determinants of Health Addressing key social determinants of Health is Texas Children's second most important priority. Social determinants of health (SDOH) impact many aspects of Texas residents' lives. SDOH are \" ...the conditions in the environments where people are born, live, learn, work, play, worship and age that affect a wide range of health, functioning and quality-of-life outcomes and risks.\" (U.S. Department of Health 2020). Examples of the domains of the social determinants of health include: economic stability, education access and quality, health care access and quality, neighborhood and built environment and social and community context. The critical social determinants of health identified in the CHNA are economic stability, food insecurity, access to care and health literacy. Economic Stability The relationship between a person's financial resources \u2014 such as income, cost of living and socioeconomic status \u2014 and their health is known as economic stability. Americans of lower socioeconomic status are often faced with unpredictable employment and work schedules, varying public benefits, changes in relationships and household composition, undesired housing and unstable housing and neighborhood conditions. Combined, these factors lead to increased income variability among low-income families compared to their high-income counterparts. In recent years, the difference in income variability between low-income and high-income families has widened. \"99% of our patient population is at or below 200% of the poverty line.\" [Representative from Legacy Community Health] The Houston region has a wealth of data that sheds light on its residents' economic instability. In 2022, the top 20% of earners in the Houston area received between 48% and 53% of the total income, while the bottom 20% only received between 3% and 4%. Those who are deemed to be in poverty are the ones who suffer the most from financial troubles. In the Houston area, 853,156 persons, or 14.4% of the total population live below the federal poverty line, according to official federal poverty rules, which is one percentage point greater than the national average. Figure 8: Word cloud of key words and phrases said during the key informant interview with Brazoria Alliance for Children 53 Texas Children's Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment Rice University's Kinder Institute for Urban Research releases a Houston area survey every year to determine changes in the way residents perceive and understand ongoing issues and challenges within Houston. In 2022, the local economy is once more Houston's most reported concern, with 28% of respondents naming the cost of living, particularly in relation to gasoline and housing prices. The pandemic has undoubtedly disrupted the financial stability of residents in ways that have worsened the escalating disparities. For example, 23% percent of respondents admitted that there had been a time when they had trouble paying their rent or mortgage. The survey also showed that housing instability is once again far more severe among Blacks and Hispanics, of whom 39 and 28%, respectively, reported that they were unable to make at least one of their rent or mortgage payments in the past year. \"Inflation [is]going up, it's been difficult to eat on food stamps. We have tried to advise people for a long time about how to [eat] fresh vegetables, fresh fruit, all the things that people tell you to eat to be healthy. These folks can't afford that stuff.\" [Tri County Behavioral Health care] A representative from Tony's Place observed a lack of housing stability for students during the pandemic. Due to school closures and stay-at-home orders, many students found themselves in a compromised situation when it came to housing and internet access. \"But during the pandemic, when schools shut down or [when] housing was eliminated, some of those individuals found themselves homeless and then they needed laptops that they didn't have. And then Wi-Fi that they didn't have because that was being offered at the school. So many individuals were coming, just to plug their laptops in to log into school. We were still open. So that's why I wanted to talk about the range of homelessness because you have families that just came from another state they couldn't go home. [Students reported] 'I came from California here, I'm in Texas. I can't go home, so I don't have anywhere to stay because my dorm closed' and then they find themselves still trying to stay in school. So there's a range of what that looks like. [Representative from Tony's Place] The potential of Houstonians to grow and prosper within our community rises when fewer people live in poverty, increasing economic stability among its residents. A standard for future growth and prosperity is set by lower rates of poverty, which also lead to lower crime, better community health, higher academic accomplishment and even improvements in infrastructure.54 Texas Children's Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment Figure 9: Geospatial Distribution of Social Vulnerability in Greater Houston The Centers for Disease Control and Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry's Social Vulnerability Index (CDC/ATSDR SVI) uses U.S. Census data to determine the social vulnerability of every census tract. Census tracts are subdivisions of counties for which the Census collects statistical data. The CDC/ATSDR SVI ranks each tract on 16 social factors, including poverty, lack of vehicle access and crowded housing and groups them into four related themes. (CDC/ATSDR) 55 Texas Children's Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment Food Insecurity Feeding America (2020) notes 14.8% of U.S. households with children under 18 experienced food insecurity in 2020. Food insecurity has several negative health implications. High-quality nutritious foods are necessary for leading a healthy life. Food insecure individuals have limited access to these foods and they often must make significant financial tradeoffs in order to make ends meet. The 2022 Medical Access Report found 52% of their respondents sacrificed basic needs, such as food and bills, to afford their medications (CoverMyMeds, 2022). When household budgets are slim, cost-efficient, calorically dense foods often become a main source of energy. As time passes, the combined effects of stress, insufficient medical care and poor dietary intake can lead to the development or exacerbation of chronic conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity. This also leads to inferior performance in school and other extracurricular activities (Ranjit et al., 2021). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and rising unemployment levels, the number of families experiencing food insecurity has increased. Food insecurity due to disasters and pandemics may seem temporary, but the impact of a consistent lack of access to nutritious food is long term. Children are the most vulnerable to its effect. \"Because even in emergencies, hunger doesn't stop. We still have a mission to feed the people, even in the midst of a pandemic, hunger doesn't stop.\" [A representative from Target Hunger] In Texas, the average prevalence of food insecurity is higher among Black (35.9%) and Hispanic (33.5%) Texans compared to non-Hispanic White (22.1%) Texans and higher among Texas households with children (32.8%) compared to all Texas households (28.8%) (Schanzenbach & Tomeh, 2020). This disparity among people of color reflects both long-standing inequities across society and the disproportionate impact of the current crisis on those households. Children of color face higher rates of food hardship. Over one-fifth of children in Black and Latino households did not eat enough in the last seven days, three times the rate for White children (Keith-Jennings et al., 2021). This level of food hardship observed in these data among children is unprecedented in recent decades. Organizations such as the Houston Food Bank and House of Help in Waller County have been providing kitchen utensils and tools such as Tupperware\u00ae, pans, plates and recipes to support accessibility to healthy cooking. \"Just because we have some food in our pantry is no sign that we have everything that they need, nor does it mean when they access it that they know what to do with it, how to cook it, availability or being able to cook it.... Different issues with different families and different groups\" \"The first question we ask when someone comes in is 'do you have a freezer? Do you have somewhere to cook?\" ...the answer is not always yes.\" [Representative from House of Help] \"The entire concept of access to food, healthy food, how to eat healthy food, how to cook healthy food, how to have the time and money and wherewithal to cook healthy food... When you are in the midst of a mental health crisis and suffering some substance abuse and unhealthy relationships, the last thing you're going to do is worry about a complicated and time-consuming meal that would be considered healthy.\" [Representative from New Hope Housing]56 Texas Children's Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment Figure 10: Geospatial Distribution of SNAP GAP (% Households That Are Eligible for the SNAP Program, but not Enrolled, by Census Tract) Ramphul, R., Sharma, S., Revere, F. L., & Highfield, L. (2022). Mapping the \"SNAP Gap\"-Identifying Neighborhood-level Hot Spots and Cold Spots of SNAP Under-participation in Texas. Journal of Hunger & Environmental Nutrition, 1-14. 57 Texas Children's Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment Access to Care While Houston is well known for having an extensive health care infrastructure, there are still Houstonians who struggle to access high-quality health care. High-quality, affordable and accessible health care is essential to maintaining physical and mental health. Disparities in access to care can lead to an increase in health disparities and can disproportionately affect marginalized groups. \"You can't just walk into a clinic and see a doctor. It doesn't work that way. There is so much red tape you have to go through...When people need health care, they need it now, not two months from now, not three months from now.\" [Representative from House of Help] Several factors can act as barriers to accessing health care, such as lack of health insurance, a shortage of health care providers, struggles navigating the health care system and distrust of the medical community. Other barriers to accessing care include cost and lack of transportation. Health insurance is vital for people to receive needed preventative and medical care. Insurance coverage rates in the U.S. have increased since the enactment of the ACA in 2010 (Greater Houston, n.d.). However, as of 2021, Texas was still ranked last out of all 50 states in health care coverage, according to the United Health Foundation's Health Care Rankings (United Health, 2021). The percentage of Texas adults lacking public or private health insurance is 18.4% (United Health, 2021). \"It's just the fact that people that are uninsured are not really thinking preventative care and ... So that's really a huge barrier to care.\" Representative from Legacy Community Health Texas has the highest number and rate of uninsured children in the U.S. (CCF, 2022). In 2019, 995,000 (12.7%) Texas children were uninsured (CCF, 2022). Additionally, there were disparities across races relating to uninsured children. In Texas, Hispanic/Latino children had an uninsured rate of 17.5%, which is almost 1.5 times higher than for children overall (CCF, 2022). Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, mainstream services such as health care were not accessed by immigrants due to fears of deportation. Vargas and Ybarra (2017) note the effect immigration status has on parental reporting of child health status. When comparing families of varying documentation status, those families with undocumented parents were not as likely to indicate optimal health for their child who held citizenship compared to others in the study (Vargas and Ybarra, 2017). Insured children in Texas were primarily covered through their parent's employer-sponsored health insurance (44%) (CCF, 2022). The second highest coverage method was through Medicaid/ CHIP at 36.4%, followed by 4.7% who were covered through Direct Purchase and 2.2% through another Public Insurance (CCF, 2022). Medicaid/CHIP provides no-cost or low-cost health care coverage for children. However, only 84.5% of eligible Texas kids were enrolled in Medicaid/CHIP in 2019 (CCF, 2022). One critical factor that impacts access to health care is the availability of primary care physicians. Better availability of primary care physicians can improve patient outcomes, allow doctors to identify health conditions earlier and reduce overall health care costs. While the number of primary care physicians has increased since 2010, Texas still has fewer primary care physicians per capita than the national average (DSHS, 2020). Additionally, the distribution of primary care physicians is higher in metropolitan areas than in non-metropolitan areas (DSHS, 2020). Texas has an estimated 199.6 primary care providers per 100,000 in population (United Health, 2021). In the Greater Houston area, 6 of 9 counties have a shortage of primary care physicians (Miller & Miller, 2021). 58 Texas Children's Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment Another barrier to accessing health care is cost and in 2021, 15.2% of Texas adults reported avoiding care due to cost (United Health, 2021). In 2019, 22% of Harris County adults reported being unable to see a doctor due to cost (Houston Health Department, 2019). This number is much higher than the Texas rates (15.2%) and the U.S. rates (12%), further underscoring the importance of keeping health care costs down for residents in the Greater Houston area (Houston Health Department, 2019). Keeping health care costs down for both parents and children is important to ensure the health of families in the Greater Houston area. Many experts argue that health insurance coverage and access to health care are inextricably linked. The geospatial patterns of insurance in Greater Houston are stark. Figure 11: Geospatial Distribution of Uninsured in Greater Houston 59 Texas Children's Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment Health Literacy Health literacy is important to understanding one's health. According to Healthy People 2030, there are two categories of health literacy. The first category is personal health literacy, which is defined as \"an individual's ability to find, understand and use information and services to inform health-related decisions and actions for themselves and others\" (Health Literacy, 2020). The second category of health literacy is organizational health literacy. Healthy People 2030 states that organizational health literacy is the \" ...degree to which organizations equitably enable individuals to find, understand and use information and services to inform health-related decisions and actions for themselves and others\" (Health Literacy, 2020). Currently, 12% of the U.S. adult population has high proficiency in health literacy, 50% has intermediate health literacy, 21% has a basic level of health literacy and 14% has no health literacy and are unable to perform any health tasks (Miron-Shatz, 2022). This ongoing crisis has been dubbed \"the silent pandemic\" by Dr. Talya Miron-Shatz, PhD. Physicians have also reported that people with high literacy ask more questions and search for added information, which leads to longer visits and active participation in their care than those with low literacy (Miron-Shatz, 2021). The vast amount of misinformation available online related to health highlights the importance of health literacy (Schulz & Nakamoto, 2022). Health literacy is important because it helps patients correctly identify academically supported articles and make educated decisions about their health.60 Texas Children's Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment Potential Resources to Address Social Determinants of Health in the Community Local Spotlight: San Jose Clinic (Harris County) San Jos\u00e9 Clinic is a safety-net clinic in Houston and a leading provider of quality health care services for individuals and families in Greater Houston who struggle with accessing care.

Maternal Health Maternal health was identified as the third priority community health concern for the Greater Houston area. At a national level, the maternal mortality rate in 2020 was 23.8 deaths per 100,000 live births, compared to 20.1 in 2019 (Hoyert, 2022). The most recent report published in September 2020 and revised in February 2022 by the Texas Maternal Mortality and Morbidity Review Committee (MMMRC) and the Department of State Health Services, states that cardiovascular and coronary conditions, mental disorders, obstetric hemorrhage, preeclampsia and eclampsia, infection, embolism, cardiomyopathy and pulmonary diseases accounted for 82% of maternal deaths in Texas. \"I have a lot of moms who have hypertension. Diabetes don't know how to manage any of that. Don't even aren't even, you know, on medication. So that's a huge thing is more of those chronic illnesses.\" [Representative from Fort Bend County Women's Center] In December 2018, the MMMRC formed a new subcommittee, Maternal Health Disparities, to investigate further factors that contributed to disparities in maternal mortality (Texas Maternal Mortality, 2020). The subcommittee looked at the role of obesity, mental disorders and substance use in pregnancy related deaths. The subcommittee identified that mental health disorders contributed to 16% of pregnancy deaths, substance use disorders contributed to 7% of pregnancy deaths and violence contributed to 13% of pregnancy related deaths (Texas Maternal Mortality, 2020). On the national and local level there are racial disparities in maternal mortality, with Black women experiencing a three times higher rate compared to non-Hispanic White women (Hoyert, 2022). When asked about health concerns in relation to pregnant woman, key informants have observed that pregnant women have multiple barriers affecting healthy living. According to staff in the organizations that were interviewed, barriers to healthy food, a safe household, mental health and access to care have impacted their ability to have a healthy pregnancy. \"Healthy food is very expensive. I just believe that the cost of food is going through the roof... we're feeling that right so my patients, especially if they have multiple children at home... I have 1 patient with 9 kids in 1 room and I'm sure they, just open a box of cereal on the floor.\" [Representative from Pregnancy Center of Galveston] \"...when she asked one of the moms \"hey, why didn't you make nutrition class?\" The mom said oh, I'm just up in my head today. I couldn't do it. And I think it's when we talk about motivation, when we talk about lack of outreach and lack of knowledge about the resources. A lot of it can be tied back to that mental health piece.\" [Representative from New Hope Housing]62 Texas Children's Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment Figure 12: Word Cloud of Key Words and Phrases Said During the Key Informant Interview With Pregnancy Center of Galveston Figure 13: Geospatial Distribution of Single Parent Households in Greater Houston 63 Texas Children's Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment Potential Resources to Address Maternal Health in the Community Local Spotlight: El Centro de Corazon Health Center Serving Houston's East End community since 1994, El Centro de Coraz\u00f3n (El Centro) is an accomplished Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) with three health centers and offers a comprehensive range of pediatric and adult health care services for the medically underserved and health care for uninsured women.

Chronic Disease and Unhealthy Lifestyle Approximately 27% of children in the United States suffer from a chronic condition, while approximately 6% have more than one chronic condition (Rezzae et al., 2015). Chronic diseases are defined as conditions that last one or more years and require ongoing medical attention or limit activities of daily living. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the prevalence of chronic diseases and unhealthy lifestyles, including increases in food intake, sedentary behavior, weight gain and decreases in physical activity (Bukart, 2021). These unhealthy behaviors increase the risk of heart disease, diabetes and other chronic illnesses in the pediatric population. \"I think again families do the best they can, but without access to resources, it's really hard to prioritize healthy lifestyle. When you are really just trying to do basic needs.\" [Representative from YMCA] Adolescents and children with chronic illnesses are at increased risk for anxiety, depression, attention difficulties and learning problems. This risk to mental health is often due to a combination of factors comprising the disease's severity, progression and treatment. Also, they have experienced increased anxiety due to the morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19 infection (Logan, 2022). Food insecurity is a risk factor for chronic diseases, and food insecurity and lack of healthy food availability were exacerbated by the pandemic due to increases in unemployment, financial hardships and disruptions in supply chain. Furthermore, school closures made it more difficult for children to access the free or reduced-price breakfasts and lunches that are available for low-income families (Parekh, 2021). The pandemic also contributed to chronic illnesses going undetected due families delaying or avoiding visits to health care providers to reduce the risk of exposure to COVID-19. \"I don't think there's a lot of information on what does a healthy lifestyle looks like and how you can do that for your family, regardless of how much money you have\" [Representative from YMCA] \"So you do have some park spaces, but it's not maintained. It's not well kept the grass is high. It's not safe for people, or keep people from all the loose dogs that are out in the neighborhood, you have a huge problem with that. It's sort of like a dumping ground, a lot of people. Whether it's tires, the trash, those people don't stay in this neighborhood, they come to dump here because no one's going to come stop them. So it's not safe and that leads to no physical activities. We don't have the nice pristine Memorial Park, you know. Here we don't have things like bike trails, in this neighborhood, you see that huge difference\" [Representative from Target Hunger]65 Texas Children's Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment Figure 14: Geospatial Distribution of Diagnosed Diabetes Among Adults Aged >=18 years in Greater Houston Potential Resources to Address Chronic Disease and Unhealthy Lifestyle in the Community Local Spotlight: The YMCA of Greater Houston The YMCA of Greater Houston is a cause-driven organization that promotes youth development, healthy living and social responsibility.
