Conflicting, apparentlyreasonable codes, which were created with the best of intentions, hadbrought to a standstill the implementation of federal regulationsregarding the testing of handicapped applicants to. schools and foremployment. On the one hand, such applicants deserved to beprotected from being labeled, that is, from having to reveal possiblyprejudicial information about the existence of a handicap, on theother hand, the integrity of standardized testing procedures v)as alsoin need of protection so that scores obtained under nonstandard.conditions could be \"flagged\" Because of their uncertain validity. Yetflagged scores, when reported to admissions officers and potentialemployers, suggested the existence of a handicap and thereby labeledthe applitant.ecognizing this dilemma, the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) in1979 sought thehelp of the National Research Council's Committeeon Ability Testing. That committee established the panel to stud) thepsychometric, social, legal, economic, and ethical issues surroundingtfie use of standardized tests in making decisions about handicappedpeople, with special reference to postsecondary education admissions.The panel's explicit mandate was to reconcile the testing requirementsof the, federal regulatidps implementing Section 504 of the Rehabil-itation Act of 1973 with available testing technology and practice.Our report addresses that task.vii4, , viii.\" PrefaceThe report appears, ironically , at a time of cuts in many researchbudgets, of a decrease in emphasis on the enforcement of federalregulations, and indeed of deregulation of many practices forrnerlythought to require such regulation. The fate of the Department ofEducation is uncertain, Yet the report calls for making the regulationsunder Section 504 woikable 1)% strengthening them and for a cr6ntin-rung research endeasor to make more useful ,And meaningful theresults of tests given to handicapped people.Althoogh the recommendations request a new dedication of lie-sources to a relatisely small population of examinees, the extent ofthe populAon w ho might potentially yrofit from the modification oftesting procedures is largely unknown. Just as the elimination ofarchitectural barriers has Os en acLess to large numbers of handi-' capped people pre% musly excluded from the mainstream, access toprocedural modifications may encourage others with \"hidden\" hand-icaps to iequest- assistance and more of thosepith obsious handicapsto venture forth.The panel, appointed by the National Academy of Sciences, con-sisted of 13 members with expertise in areas bearing on the questions, at hand.(Biographical sketches of members and staff appear idAppendix C.) Ten were uniiersity faculty members, two were prac-ticing attorneys, and one had worked in test de% elopment and researchfor handicapped people.for nonprofit se% eral _areas of psychology, lass,sociology,economics, statistics, and medicine. Three members were themsels eshandicapped. No member had a sested interest in the issues to beresolsed nor was any of us, in his or her dailly work, engaged in thekinds of actis ities affected by the regulations implementing Section504.Between July 1979 and April 1981, the rianel met on five occa--sions.

The report deats,in depth with the.legal and pschometricissues relating to theilksting,of peoplewith icapping'conditionsand to testing Of the reguLkions implementingSection.504 of the Rehabilitation.Act of 1973.The report concludes that current psychometric theory and practice' do not allow full compliance with the regulations as currently drafted.The testihg requirements -of the regulation; are based on the as-sumption that people with handicapping conditions can be tested ina way tfiat will not reflect the effects of these condiiions and that theresulting test scores will be comparable to those of nonhandicappedpeople. Nevertheless, the report concludes that the technical problemsof developing and validating tests that accorrimodate specific handi-.caps, vvhile very difficult, are not insurmountable.The report recdmmends that the Office for 'Civil Rights refiluirethat postsecondary educational institutions subject to Section 504, intheir iole as members of the corporations* that sponsor the large 12. 2 ABILITY TESTING OF HANDICAPPED PEOPLE..,testing prop arns, insti tat the testing Companies to develop modifiedtests to meet the needs of people with sensory and motor handicapsand to perform predictive v alidation studies on these tests.

When themodified tests have been brought to a condition* of equivalentpredictive power with the test for the general population, the scorescan be translated to a common scale before reporting. At this point,all reasons for flagging will have been elimated.In addition to these major policy recommendations, the reportrecommends other actions to improve the administration and use oftests for people with handicapOng conditions, such as modificationof tests, dissemination of information regarding the availability of\u00b0Modified forms of tests, and finding solutions to known problemswith specific tests or types of tests.In the long run, much more information is required to ensureadequate measurement of the abilities of people with handicappingconditions.

It is a theme that runs,3 '; o4 ABILITY TESTING OF HANDICAPPED PEOPLEthrough federal legislation, such asthe Education for All HandicappedChildren Act (P.L. 94-142), which talks of placing handicappedchildren in the least restrictive educational envirOnment possible.This concept has become known as \"mainstreaming\" or placingchildren with special educational needs in regular classes as often aspossible. The theme reappears, in the regulations implementingSection 504 of the Rehibilitation Att of 1973..As stated in thesupplementary information accompanying the (FederalRegister, May 4r, 19,71.22676), \"[Section 504] establishes a mandateto end discrimination and to bring handicapped persons into themainstream of American life.\"Explic* recoAnitio.n .of t.hriets, thelehabilitatioriAct'a 1973 (P.L. 1 12y Regulationsimplementing Section 504 of that act, promulgated by the U.S.Department Of Health, Education, and Welfare in 1977, discussedtesting asitis used in admissions to postsecondary educationalInstitutions, 'in job selection, and in placement in elementary andsecondary education programs.

Hence there has been uncertainty asto how to fully comply with the Section 504 regulations.This report focuses on the testing requirements of the regulationsimplementing Section 504. In order to place those requirements inproper perspective, the report surveys current testing Practices ineducational and employment settings (ChapteR 2 and 3).

THE FUNCTIONS OF TESTSA \"test\" is a sample of performance; more specifically, a test is asystematic observation of a person's performance on a speciallydesigned task or set of tasks. The same task is ordinarily used withmany people under the same or similar conditions so that comparisonsamong people can be made.Tests seri, e several different' functions; two important ones areselection and diagnosis. The selective function of tests, their use\" indeterminingho should be allowed (or denied) certain educationaland occupational opportunities, is the main focus of this report, thediagnostic function of tests, though important for many handicappedindividuals, is considered only briefly. To the extent thal diagnosticevaluation shapes a person's educational experiences and vocationalgoals, it affects such opportunitiesbut less directly The more directeffect Occurs when tests act as barriers to college, to professional ortechnical educations, or to jobs, in short, to participation in themainstream of American society. This report, therefore, is concernedprimarily with tests of abilitychiefly cognitke abilities and specialskillssince these kinds of tests are generally used for selectionpurposes.Many colleges, and most professional and technical schyols, requiretests as parr of their admissions procedure. Some 2 million college-'bound high school students take one of two widely used collegeadmissions tests each year. Scores on these tests are weighed, alongwith high school grades and other criteria, in deciding who will ,beadmitted. Law schools and medical schools,require their own spegradmission tests as do many graduate school departments. Programsthat train for most professionsdentistry, nursing, pharmacology,accOunting, business administration, to name but a fewrequirespecific tests for admission. If a test score reflects a person's disability,it does not provide an unbiased estimate of a person's potential. Tothe extent that a test score is not an accurate measure of the abilitiesthat will be required in the program, it fails to measure a person'spotential for successfully completing the program.A similar situation inay exist when tests are used to select for jobs, 1 g 6476 ABILITY TESTING OF HANDICAPPED PEOPLEto decide on plat ement or promotion, to permit entrance into tradeunions, or to obtainlicense or credential. If a test reflects a person'sdisabilitY rather than the skills actually needed on the job. it does notagurately reflect the person's potential on the job. In some instances,of course, a test may accul-ately reflect how well a pergon wouldperform on the job. the disability that pi oduc es a low test score wouldalso Interfere with successf ul job performance. In still other instances.the abilmes tested maY have little relation to the necessary job skills,and the person w ho did poorly on the test might still be able to dothe job well. In such cases the tests serye as a barrier. theY do not -predict successful job performance.While tests may somenes be barriers, their use in selection mayoffer some achantages for handicapped people. Tests proyide objec-tive inforMation that may help oyercome negatbe biases againstdisabled people, they can show a person's strengths as well asvy gaknesses. And they allow the handicapped person to compete withothers for jobs and educanonal opportunities. Indeed, ability testswere developed originalb in 'order to proY ide a more objeclive andrelevant basis for-selection than social class or physical appearance.A good objectbe measure of merit may be especialb important forhandicapped people, who may hate had fewer opportunities thannOnhandicapped people to demonsteate their abilities. THE MEANING OF TESTS-The psychometric concept of validity, which pros ides an estimate ofhow well a test measures what it purports to measure, is importantin considering the approliriateness of any use of a test and is Lentralto the Sectidn 504 regulations and to the panel's work. There areseYeral different ways to measure the le alidit, of a test. but Only one,calibration against the per form-ance to be predicted, is of directrelevance to this repar\"Fhis type of Yalklity is called predictive orcritenon-related Nalidity and is ty pically expressed as a correlationcoefficient, with values ranging f rom 0 to 1.0. The predictiye Midityof a college admissions test is typically indicated by the strength ofthe relationship between scores on the test and first-year,collegegrades, but a s.riterion other than first-year grades may be used. TheOredktne yalidity of An employment test relates scores on the test to13erformance on the job.A 4emnd characteristic of tests, their reliability, is generally impor-tant in interpreting test scores but is far less critical than yalidity inthe current study. Viability is an index of the stability or consiStency Ability Testing and Handicapped People 7of test scores, that is, of the sinuIarit uf swres obtained by, the samepeople ss hen telted more than once with the identical test or withequisalent forms of the same test. TYPES OF DISABILITIES AND THE DISABLED POPULATIONVarious dhumnons are of ten made among the terms \"Impairment,\"\"thsabilits,\" and \"handicap.\" One of the most wmmon distinctions isbetween disabilits and handicap, a disabilits is a phssical, sensors,mental. or emotional impairment that interferes with the major tasksof dails lisingt handicap is the result of an iriteraction between aetisabilits and rn ens ironment that creates obstacles or barriers fordisabled people. Acwrding to this distinction, a person in a wheelchairis handicapped if narrow aisles in a store present entry. If the aislesare widened to perniit wheelchair access, the person is still disabledbut no longer handicapped.A second consention distinguishes the terms impairmerZ\\limitationof functionorhandicap, and disability, as follows (Nagi 1979:6-7): [Impairment is] a phYsiologu al, anatomical been tested ditninated,nonpathologual congenital deformities and \u00abinditions resulting from thedisuse of environment. Although short-termsukness ma% be disAling fur a brief period. We tel m dhability is usualkapplied to viabilities of king or \u00abintinued duration.4The legislation with which this report is concerned is written in termsof the \"handicapped person,\" and we usethe a interchangeably.Wabilities are so %dried m both type and seserity that it is oftenmisleading to talk about \"handicapped people\" as if they were ahomogeneous group. The panel's focus on testing, however, doesnarrow somewhat the population with which this report is concerned. 8 ABILITY TESTING OF HANDICAPPED PEOPLEwe consider those disabilities that directly affect test performance.After much debate, the panel decided to focus.on the following broadcategoriest visual impairments, hearing impairments, motor impair-ments, including speech, learning disabilities, and mild mental retar-dation. Expressive speech disorders (e.g., stuttering or articulationdefects) are 'included under motor impairments, although suchdisorders probably would not affect performance on a written test,they would interfere with performance on an oral test. Adults withreceptive communication problems, such as difficulty in understand-ing spoken language, if not diagnosed as aphas4 would usually bediagnosed as either learning disabled or hearing impaired.Several types of disabilities covered by the legislation receivelittleattention in this report. One of these is the category of merital illnessor psychological disorders. During the acute stages, schizophrenia orsevere depression undoubtedly would affect a person's performanceon a test. Chronic mental illness, however, would affect job or schoolperformance as well as test scores, and it also presents a situation ofenormous individual variability. We also do not focus on health-related impairments, such as heart disease and diabetes. Theseconditions a're likely to affect testing far less than they will affectother situations,.primarily employment. Alcoholism and drug addic-tion were also not considered separately in our work. The interactionof such conditions with test performance is assuined to be minimalexcept When the person is under the influence of drugs or alcoholor when long-term consumption has produced brain damage. Finally,test anxiety is-not included as a separate category because most peopleexperience some anxiety when confronted by a test or examination,and it would be difficulr to specify the point at which test anxietybecomes a handicaRas defined by the Section 504 regulations.This report focuses on teststhe ways in which they are modifiedand validated and their effects on people's livesand not on specificdisabilities. We use examples from specific disabilities and cite datawhere they are available, and, although we do not discuss all disabil-ities, we believe the report has relevance for many disabilities. Ourfocus on test modifications results from our task: itis the testmodificationsnot the handicapping conditionsthat are flagged bytesters and that are problematic with respect to both psychometricconvention and the federal regulations. Some handicapped peopleare able to take tests in their standard form,.and for them testfng isno more (or different) a problem than it is for nonhandicappedpeople. 1 9 Ability Testing and Handicapped People 9People with Visual ImpairmentsMost people legally classed as \"blind\" are not totally -without sight.In order to be considered legall% blind in the States, a personmust haYe \"central yisual acuity of 20/200 or less in better es.ewith correcting glasses, or central v isual acuity of morethan 20/200if there is axfield defect in which the peripheral visual field hascontracted lo such an extent that the widest diameter of the Nisualfield subtends an angular distance no greater than 20 degrees\"(Lowenfeld 1973:29-30). Only about 10 percent of all legally blindindividuals are totally blind. Approximately 11 percent have lightperception only, and 7 percent haw a restricted visual field. Thus,about 75 to 80 percent of the legally -blind population hav,e someuseful vision (Hatfield 1975. 1) The term \"low yision\" is often used todescribe the condition that lies between blindness and normal Yision(Colenbrander 1977r.The National Center for Health Statistics uses a functional definitionof blindness in its annual Health Interview Survey. To be \"severelyvisually impaired\" a person must be unable to read ordinary news-paper print, even with the aid of correctiye lenses; or, if under 6years of age, be blind infboth eyes or have no useful vision in eithereye. According to thisdefinition, in household interyiews for the year1977, 1,396,000 people were classified as severely yisually impaired.Of these, 990,000 (approximately 70 percent) were 65 years old orolder and hence unlikely to be candidates for education or employ-ment (see KirChner and Peterson 1979a)Between 30,000 and 40,00ifchildren in the primary and secondarygrades are severdy tisually impaired.' About 70 percent of thesestudents attend neighborhood schools, the remaining 30 percent arein residential Vhools (Koestler 1976). The past 15 years have seen amarked trend-toward educating blind children in nonresidentialschools. between 1963 and 1978 the figure rose from 55 to 76 percsykit.This shift to nonrsidential schools began even before enactment ofthe Edu,c4tion for All Handicapped Children Act of 'Estimates for sc hool-age blind children sarv the American Printing House for theBlind (APH) reported 29,400 blind students for 1978, the Bureau of Education forthe Handicapped reported 12,455 sisually unpaired students for the 1 978-79 schoolyear. students, the 1977 Health Interview Sursev reported36,800 e-s 20 A 10 ABILITY TESTING OF HANDICAPPED PEOPLEOf the school children registered with the American Printing Housefor the Blind in 1978, 6,221 could read braille; readlarge both; and 11,797 could read neither.The percentage of, blind people who can read braille is reported tobe decreasing.2Blind people and people with lolv ision are employed at everyoccupational level. The Survey oIncome and Education (SIE), shichwas conducted by the Bureau of the Census, rev edled that a littleover 80 percent of the blind .people in the labor force were employedin 1976. (To be considered as being in the labor force, a person mustbe either employed or actk el), seeking employment.) But less thanone-third of all blind people were in the labor foree at that timecompared with three-fourthS of the general population. Thus, itappears that h1ind, people experience a serious employ ment problenk.(see Kirchne-r. and Peterson 1979b). People witIcHearing IMpairmentsHearing impairment, rariging from mild to profound, is quantifiedas loss of sensitiv ity retatAe to a normal absolute threshold for pure,tones at different frequencies whose loudness is measured in decibels(dB). The differences between a person's threshold and a normalthreshold is referred to as hearing-threshold level or hearing level indecibels. The audiogram describes hearing level as a function offrequency (pitch), but hearing loss is often characterized by a singlenumber that is the av erage hearipg level at the frequencies of 500,1,000, and 2,000 Hz (cycles,per second). Roughly speaking, the \"hardk of hearing,\" who can understand speech with a hearing aid, havehearing levels between 26 and 70 dB. When people speak of the\"deaf,\" they usually refer to two different categories of hearing loss,severe hearing impairment, which is hearing levels ranging from 70to 90 dB, and profound hearing impairment (sometimes called \"totallydeaf\"), which is hearing levels about 90 dB. Table 1-1 indicates howthe ability to understand speech is related to different degrees ofhearing loss.It is estimated that about 14 million Americans have some hearingImpairment. Of these, about 7.5 million have significant heat ing lossin both ears, and about 1.8 million are deaf.(i.e.., have profound orsevere hearing impairments): Approximately 600,000 uonmunitatum.

About half of thesewere in special residential or day schools for the deaf,, the other halfattended neighborhood schools, either in special 'classes (10,017) orin integrated programs that combined special and regular classes(12,386). As would be expected, profoundly deaf children are morelikely to attend residential or day schools; only about 18 p'ercent ofthose in integrated programs hat e profound hearing losses (Karchmerand Try bus 1974). Those children who are in integrated (mainstream)pmgrams also arkmore likely* to hate learned to speak beforebecoming deaf.Several surveys gite some indication of the number of hearing-impaired people,;tt ho participate in higher education. A 1972 studyby the Bureau orthe Census indicated that 2.7 percent of deaf peopleaged 25 to 64 had completed .1 years of college. Althougha directcomparison with the general population is not possible, an indicationof the disparity is given by coinparison with the figure of I6A percent 'Figures from the Bureau of Education for the Handicapped show 41,603 hard-ofhearing and 44.439 deaf children aged 3 to 421 for the 1978-79 school year. 2 12 ABILITY TESTING OF HANDICAPPED PEOPLEof the population aged 25 to 29 with 4 or more years of college in1970 (U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare 1975). Infall 1978 there were an estimated 11,256 hearing-impaired studentsenrolled in colleges and universities, comprising 0.10 percent of thetotal enrollment at that time (National Center for Education Statistics1978). According to Bolton (19766:145):... morethan 3,000 youths aged Hi to 19 leave schools and classes for thedeaf annually. . Roughly 15 percent enter Gallaudet College, the NationalTechnical Institute for the Deaf, or other college-level programs. Severalhundred enroll in technical-yocational schools and community colleges whichprovide special arrangements tot. deaf students. An unknown number beginapprenticeships or on-the-job training programs. Many enter the job marketat the clerical, semi-skilled, and unskilled levels. Others become unemplOyedor enter intensive rehabilitation,programs.Tshe principal barriers to educational achievement and optimalvocational placement appear to be related to language development-deficits in direct communication and in linguistic skills. The averagedeaf 16-year-old has attained a reading skill of an average hearingfourth-grader, and fewer than 10 percent read at or beyond theseventh-grade level (Trybus and Karchtner 1.977). ,With respect to employment,a 1972 survey b the U.S. Departmentof Labor found that the unemployment rate for deaf males was closeto that for the general population (2-.9 compared with 4.9 percent).Unemployment for deaf females, however, was somewhat higherthan that of hearing females, 10.2 compared with 6.6 percent (Scheinand Delk 1974). Compared with the population as a whole, deafpeople are underrepresented in the professions and in technical,managerial, administrative, and service occupations (Schein and Delk1974). Deficiency in commuuication skills and the lower educationlevel of the deaf undoubtealy re contributing factors.Approximately one-third of e deaf students currently in schoolwere born deaf as a result of t e rubella epidemic of 1964. Sincethese students will be of college e in 1983, an increased need forvocational services and prograirts r the deaf in higher education islikely. Gallaudet College and the Na ional Technical histitute for theDeaf, for example, both expect ate1iporary 50 percent increase instudent enrollment at that time. These stuaents will all be prelinguallydeaf, and many will have other handi ps, including blindness.Although maternal vaccination has n w largely eliminated rubellaas a cause of deafness, thisdecrease mbe offset by the increasednumber of premature and co,ngenitally\\ deaf infants who survive. 23, r Ability Testing and Handicapped People ,13.With increased preention and enhanced treatment of illnesses thatproduce deafness during y outh and young adulthoo&e.g., meningitis,measles, other infections), the deaf population of the future may bealmost entirely, prelingually deafexcept, of course, for the aged.This prediction has significant implications for those concerned withthe education and training of deaf people. People with Learning Disabilities\"Learning disabilities\" is a ery heterogeneous and ill-de,fined categorythat coers a wide range of difficulties in speaking, understandingspeech, reading, and writing. The National Adyisory Committee onHandicapped Children deeloped the following definition, which isused in the Education for All Handicapped Children Act (Wepmanet al. 1976:301-302):.4.0, Children with special learning disabilities exhibit a disorder in one or moreof the basic psychological processes involved in understanding or usingspoken or written languages. These may be manifested in disorders oflistening, thinking, talking, reading, writing, spelling, or arithmetic Theyinclude conditions which have been referred to as perceptual handicaps,brain injury, minimal brain dysfunction, dyslexia, developmental aphasia,etc. They do not include learning problems which are due primarily to visual,hearing, or motor handicaps, to mental retardation, emotional disturbance,or to environmental disadvantages.There seems to be little consensus among physicians or educatorsabout how to identify and classify learning-disabled children. Themost commonly accepted indicator is a marked discrepanq betweengeneral learning ability, , or \"intelligence,\" as measured by standardizedtests, and educational achievement, as measured by tests or grades.A typical working definition refers to a child of average intelligencewho is about two grade levels behind in achievement. The difficulty,however, lies in determining that the achieement lag is not the resultof such factors as poor motiation, emotional disturbance, environ--mental deficiencies, or simply poor instruction.In view of the ambiguities and difficulties in defining learningdisabilities, it is not surprising that estimates of its prevalence varywidely. The Bureau of Education for the Handicapped estimatedthat in 1978-79 approximately 2.3 percent of the school-age popu-lation between 5 and 17 years of age exhibited a learning disability(a national total of more than 1.1 million children). Other estimatesrange from 7.5 to 41 percent of arious school populations (Minskoff 2 4_ , di 14 ABILITY TESTING OF HANDICAPPED PEOPLE1973). One study, usingmultiple criteria and specific decision rulesfor diagnosis, found that 11 to 20 percent of a control group (aged7 to 16) were learning disabled (Lambert and Sandokal 1980). Thelarger estimate cokers allunderachiekers, including students ofsuperior ability but akerage achiekement, the lower figure includesonly those who were below grade level in achievement.To keep \"learning disabilities\" from becoming a meaningless cat-egory that includes all kinds of learning problems, most expertsbelieke that It should be restricted to percepttel Ur perceptual-motorproblems (e.g., see Hobbs 1976). The term \"perceptual\" here refersto those \"mental (neurological) processes through w hich the childacquires the basic alphabets of sounds and forms\" et The, term used.in speech and the or4hographic formsused_in reading, retaining and recalling those dicriminated sounds and formsin both short- and long-term memory, ordering the sounds and formssequentially, both in sensory and motor acts, distinguishing figure-groundrelationships, recognizing spatial and temporal orientations, obtaining clo-sure, integrating intersensory information, and relating what Is perceiced tospecific functions.Those vv ho work with reportthat there are a number of 'otherwise able students whose maindifficulty is in the processing of written information. With, help inlearning how to use alternatike methods of processing information(e.g., listening to a recorded text while reading it), many of them cansucceed in college. Mentally Retarded PeopleDefinitions of mental retardation hake changed markedly in the pasttwo decades. The most widely accepted guidelines are those proposedby the American Association on Mental Retardation (AAMD), whichalso hate been incorporated in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual(DSM-111) of the American Psychiatric Association (1980). Accordingto AAMD,' \"mental ',retardation refers to significantly subaveragegeneral intellectual functioning existing concurrently with deficits inadaptike behakior, and manifested during the dekelopmental period\"(Grossman 1973.11).Significantly subaverage general intellectualfunctioning is defined as performance that is more than two standardI.25lit Ability Testing and HaddjcaPped People. 15deyiations below the mean on a 'major standardized 1.61, such as oneof the Wechsler Intelligence Scales or the Starifqq-Binet intelligencetest.

Under new ei comentions, if aperson can wpe c% ith the demands of nerydaride (demands at anordinal-% ley el for a person of his or her age), that person is notconsidered mentally retaided, iegardless of an intelligence test score.During -the school sears, low intelligence almost always causes aca-demk failure in regular (mainstream) classes.

Before presenting the data, howeer, we mustmention some factors that impair our ability to eYaluate the situation.First, the aailable data do not distinguish among degrees ofimpairment nor other factors of, functional significance. Among thehearing impaired, for example, are some s+, ho are totally unable tohear and others with rticf or moderate reduction of hearing acuity, ,sorne whose loss originated befort they began to acquire language(with se% ere deelopmental implications): and others with later losswhose language is relatiely unaffected. Second, the aailable dataseldom distinguish between people with one handicapping conditionand those with multiple handicaps, which impose additional burdens.Simply counting the number of people with a single one of theenumeiated conditions does not reeal the entire portrait ofThird, inclusion of mentally retarded people in the handicappedpopulation lower; its oerall occupational and educational attainment'because those people by definition are unable to succeed in copingindependently with the demands of mainstream society (Grossm'an1977). Fourth, because children born to parents of lower .,,ss2Lioeco-nomic status suffer a higher incidence of handicaps than th-rse bornto parents of higher status (Richardson and Higgins 1965);--familybackground must be taken into account in any analysis of theeducational and social status of handicapped indiiduals. Educational AchievementData on the educational attainment of handicapped people arepresented in Table 1-2.. (Note that the handicapped and nonhandi-capped samples are not strictly comparable because the sample ofhandicapped people includes people oer 17 years of age and thenonhandicapped sample includes those mer 25.) The most strikingdifference between the handicapped and the nonhandicapped pop-ulation isin the percentage of people in ihe lowest educationalcategory (less than 9 years of schooling), but.4here are markeddifferences at all levels.The large difference in educational attainment, was one of themajor factors prompting federal legislation, namely the RehabilitationAct of 1973 and the Education for All Handicapped Children Act.Many of the handicapped people who are counted in' Table 1-2attended school when mainstreaming was not emphasized, specialneeds presumably were not met, and special education classes were28 A '118 ABILITY TESTING OF HANDIC3PPED PEOPLEdead ends. Many o'f those people probably encountered attitudinahas well as physical and program barriers. These factors haye createdsubstantial-disachantages in both the ability to compete for employ-ment and satisfaction to be gained through personal intellectualgrowth'.The oYerall effects of relatiy ely low educational achieyernent maybe particularly sey ere for handicapped indiy.iduals, ho might beable td compensate for phOcal limitations br acquiring new skills.Rehabilitation agencies, for example, often Offer education andtraining as a compensatory deme to improye the employability ofhandicapped people. IncomeTable...-1-3 presents comparatiy e family income figures reported byfour categories of handicapped indiyiduals, again compared with allU.S. families. According to the Bureau of the Census, median familyincome for the United States in 1977 was $16,009, considerably higherthan that for any of ttie seYen categories. We cannot determine fromthese data w hat proportion of income is clerked from wages, disabilityinsurance, or other sources, nor do we have an income breakdownby sex-. Nationally; 11.6 percent of the total poptgation were estimatedto haye incomes below the poy erty leyel (defined for a nonfarm familyof four 1977). Table 1-3 indicates=that the proportionof handicamd people with incomes below the poYerty level was 2to 3 times greater than for the population as a whole.The income of severely disabled people, defined as those whocannot work tit all or cannot work regularly, is of course even lowerthan the income of partially disabled' people, who are limited in thekind or amourn of work they can do but are able to work conlRetitiyelyto some degree. Oecupational StatusAs shown in Table 1-4, handicappe'd people Work much less often inwhite-collar jobs than do U.S. workers as a whole, and much moreoften they are unemployed or not in the labor force. There is littledoubt that, w hateYer the reasons, handicapped people have substan-,tially lower occupational status than other-workers.2 9 Ability Testing and Handicapped People 19Frequency of EmploymentParticiPation in the 'labor force is closely related to the degree ofdisabilitY Seyereh disabled peopk. by definition, are largely unableto ysork except in sheltered emploYment situations. Partially disabledpeople may be limited in the kind of %%ork they can do, and possiblyin the amount as %yell, but the% ,ne considered potentially capable ofcompetitive emploYment. 'Fabk 1-5 illustrates the degree to %hichpartially, disabled people are able to maintain employment of somekind (eyen though that employ ment may be of lo% status). The datadistinguish nondisabled men hay e a relathebsimilar employment profile, %ith only minor differences in the ratioof part- to full-time employment. Partially disabled %omen to hase rather than full-time employment or to be either unemployedor not in the labor force at all. From the aYailable data, %ye cannotdetermine and employment opportunities,or other factors. ConclusionsClearly, the place of handicapped people in the American socialstructure is restricted and disadyantaged. Although many people %ithlimited or partial disabilities are able to participate in essential actiyitiesand thereby adueye positions that are not strikingly different fromthe general population, those %ith more seyere handicaps are oftenlargel% excluded from the mainstream and are suboidinated in thestatus hierarchy. Women appeai to be generally less successful thanmen W ith the same degree ol impairment, particularly in employment.The marginal and inferior positions of sume handicapped'peoplein the social structure may haye adyerse implications for theirperformance on abilitytests. Handicapped people may not haveacquired adequate background kno% ledge and formal education forsuccessful performance in test situations. They may come to th,e placeand time of the test %ith less experience in taking tests and with afeeling of discomfort because their preyious experiences haye beenin segregated facilities.

Any or all of these conditions may lessen their chancesfor optimal performance in the testing situation. THE EFFECTS OF STEREOTYPES AND LABELSStereotypes and labels affect the.lives of handicapped people, partic-ularly ,in selection processes. \"Gatekeepers\" in the mainstream ofsociety, such as Jeachers, school counselors, rehabilitation workers,examiners and test assistants (readers, signers), and admissions andemployment officers, are likely (as are other people) to attach labelsand to apply stereotypes as they interact with and affect the lives ofhandicapped people.When a handicapped applicant and a gatekeeper interact, the lattermay ,assume one of several postures. The gatekeeper may take arealistic (objective) stance, based on an accurate evaluation oriheindividual applicant, or he or she may employ either a negativeor apositive stereoty pe. A negative stereotype emphasizes the lack ofability of handicapped people, characterizing them as weak, depend-ent, incompetent, and unsuccessful. Positive stereoty pes exaggeratethe competencies of handicapped applicants and describe them asnormal, independent, superior, successful, and so on. The researchliterature suggests that the negative stereotype response is the mostprevalent pattern, although positive stereoty ping also occurs. Un-realistic and biased expectations are of crucial importance whentesting information is used.33 Ability Testing and Handicapped PeopleThere are Yarious ways in which handicappedpeople can deal withnegatiYe expectations. They aay, for example, accept, internalii.e,and comply with the beliefs arid expectations. Alternatively, they mayavoid contacts with particular peOple or situations in w hich they arelikely to encounter bias (e.g., by residing in segregated communities),stress or claim that the disabilit is onk temporary , direct attentionto abihties and offset ,the stereotY pe, or oppose thestereoty pical constraints and reject the ascribed inferiority and dis-crimination.The portion of the regulations implementing Section 504 thatprohibits pre-selection inquiry is an ef fort to enable handicappedpeople to encounter, the gatekeeping situation without the hazardsof stereots ped responses. Yet the flagging of test scores as havingbeen administered in nonstandard fashion, as allowed by OCR'sinterim policy, is de facto labeling of examinees as handicapped.Indeed, sin\u00ab. the flagging of scores does not identify the precisemodifications of standardized procedure that haYe occurred, it islabeling at its yaguest and therefore potentially most damaging.Standardized testing is only one part of an assessment proceduie.Other information that sometimes is requested in applying foreducational or employ went positiorm includes wr itten questionnaires,essaY material, transcripts of educational recor ds, letter s of i efer cute,resumes or autobiographies of educational and wor k experience, and,frequently, face-to-face contaCts. (The personal ( intacts may beirneryiews, performance tests, or probationary placements.) Many ofthese sources of information hay e the potential tor reyealing the[Presence of a handicapping condition. This is particularly trure forschool reports fif the applicant atteruled a special class or s( hool),reports of extracurricular actiYines,.letters of reference, autobiogra-phies, and face-to-face contacts. Yet this identification need not takeplace. Indeed, some indiyiduals with health impair menus, readingdisabilities, or mental disorders may be able to \u00abm\u00ab.al the handicapeven during face-to-face interviewcs.Handicapped applicants may or may not desire to inform decisionmakers about their handicap. Some applicants, particularly those withachieements, may want to take adyantage of a .positiye stereoty pe,capitalizing on the tendency of an evaluator to oNerestimate anqualifications w hen he or she is y iew ed as hay ing ON cr comean obstacle in attaining a goal. A person who is temporarily ratherthan permanently handicapped may want to ensure that attention isdirected to the handicap in order that its transient nature be known(Lev inn 1975). Another person may believe that he or she will be 34 14 24 ABILITY TESTING OF HANDICAPPED PEOPLEmore accurately evaluated with the assistance of a repoh by arehabilitation counselor, physician, or therapist. Still another maywish to waive some requirements th'at pose particular problems.Other handicapped applicants however, may not wish to disclosethe fact that they are impaired. Thev may fear an cininformeddiscrimination against handicapped people, t.hey may want to avoid(Illegal) rejection because of the cost of accommodating their handi-caps (for example, through supplying readers or translators); or theymay w4nt the personal satisfaction of succeeding in open competition.The regulations Implementing Section 504 preserve the right of theapplicant to conceal the existence of a handicapping condition untila selection decision has been made.Because the research literature regarding the operation of labelsin decision making in college admissions, employ ment, and licensingwas of such direct relevance to the provisions of Section 504, thepanel reviewed the literature bearing on this issue (see Appendix A)Briefly summarized, the research literature on the effects ondecision making of knowing a person is handicapped shows variedresults. Knowing that an individual is handicapped may, in differentsituations, have negative, positive, or negligible effects. In short,research does not support the common assumption that knowledgeof a person's handicapping condition works to that person's disad-vantage. Opinions expressed in the panel's open meeting weresimilarly varied. THE SOCIAL AND INDIVIDUAL COSTS OF BIASED SELECTIONPROCEDURESTo the extent that selection procedures for admitting or hiringhandicapped people are biased, either because of tests that fail topredict future success or more subtle processes of labeling andstereotyping, both society and handicapped individuals suffer. Jtshould be pointed out that either a negative or a positive bias maycreate serious costs to the individual concerned, as well as to others.A negative bias, is likely to exclude a handicapped person fromactivities and opportunities he or she is competent to haridle, withconsequences such as unrealized assets, nonproductivity, boredom,truncated educational and career progression, and so on. A positivebias may also have serious costs if the individual is placed in a situationthat exceeds his or her capabilities. The inevitable f'ailure may bedamaging in both the long and short lerm and may affect others aswellprofessors and friends who give extra help to a floundering35 Ability Testing and Handicapped People 25college student, employ el s who lose money, the public unprotectedfrom an incompetent professional, and so on. In other words,inaccurate labels, stereotypes. expectations, and actions, whethernegative or positne, are expensive to all concerned.It is difficult to quantify the costs, howeyer. StrictlY speaking,.theeconomic cost of biased selectum procedures to souety stems fromthe misallocation of I esources that could be better used in an altern,atefashion. The two nst imitortant misallocations are the inef ficientuse of people in 1A-oducing commodities and the inef ficient use ofeducation and training in preparing f untie workers. Consersely, thereducton or elinunation of biasin selection procedures createssociety benefits since it irnpro% es the allocation ofresources. Let us look at these two potential benefits of improy mgtests for handicapped people in greater detail.e first type of benefit is the more efficient use of workers in thewokforce. Employment tests proside a proxy for the expectedproducti% ity of the workers and, thereby, , anindicator of the maximuniwage that an employer could pay Zyithout reducing profits. A firm,in order to maximue profits, will not knowingly pay a %%age that isgreater than a winker's \u00abmtribution to the firm's reYenue A firmwill reject, therefore, all applicants whose expected contribution toresenue is less than the wage to be of f cued, which in this examplecan be assumed to be the same for all workers. To the extent thatthe impairments of handicapped applicants reduce then test stolesbelow those of nonhandkapped applk ants, the handicapped appli-cants are disaayantaged in the selection process. If the true produc-tkity of the !ejected handkapped applicants is greater than that ofthose (presurnabl nonhandk apped) who are fin ed, the cost societyis the dif ference between the productkity of ttie and the productivity of those 1144,are hired.The secoml type of benefits emanates rm the elimination of biasin educational tests. Such benefits are more Aficult to enumeratethan those related to employment, becarise thc`benefits of educationca'n be % iewed as likely incr in employabiiity and income followingschool and as nonpec uniary benefits to the indkidual, such asincreased social status, heightened appreciation of the arts, and apet solidi enjoyment of-school hfe. Although the nonpecuniary benefitsmay be to handicapped people, particularly those whokalue h ighlpii tkipation in the mainstream, one can argue that theemployment benefits of educational attainments are ey en moreunpoilant to handu apped people. As mentioned ear lier, acquit ingskills is one unpin tant way per hap's the most important waythat 36 26 ABILITY TESTINGOF HANDICAPPED PEOPLEhanaicapped people 'can corn pen / litefor their impaired physicalabilities as they compete for places in the labor force.If, because of impairments, test scores are biased measures of thetrue probability of success in an educational program for handicappedpeople, then some handicapped applicants who are more likely tosucceed than some nonhandicapped applicants IA qi be rejected. Thus,some less promising applicants IA ill receive the benefits of an education,and the return on the investment in the postschooling years w ill beless than that that could have been produced by the handicappedapplicants. The difference between the returns for the handicappedand the nonhandicapped students is the measure of the social costof the rejection of the handicapped students. In addition, if one takesthe position that education is the difference between employ mentand unemployment for handicapped people, then die return dn theinvestment in education for handicapped people is marginally muchhigher than that for nonhandicapped people, and one could evenargue that handicapped people who had a lower probability of successshould be admitted to school in favor of nonhandicapped people..The aggregate benefit to society resulting from improved resourceallocation due to improv ed testing of the handicapped might berather small, on the order of less than 1 percent of the GNP. (Forexample, the economic costs of racial and ethnic discrimination havebeen estimated at rio 3 percent of the GNP.) Nevertheless, thebenefit of improved procedures may loom rather large, making thedifference between employ ment and unemploy ment or betweenpoverty and modetate income levels. And the nonmonetary benefits,such as the psychological satisfaction that a handicapped person mightobtain from working in a job that is considered in the mainstream,may be very great, though essentially nonquantifiable. Moreover,society may place a positiv e value on the creation of equal opportunityfor all and on achieving a greater degree of equity between thehandicapped and nonhandicapped, abov e and beyond the value ofthe more efficient use of resources or the improved economic statusof individual handicapped people.It is with all of these considerations in mindthe low social andeconomic status of handicapped people, the barriers that poor testscan place in their way, , the opportunities that appropriate tests cancreate, the benefits to society and to handicapped people of increasededucation and employ ment opAtunitiesthat 14 e proceed with ourdiscussipn of testinu of people with handicapping conditions. 3 7 \\ 2.,Admissions Testing forPostsecondary Education ,. ..Although the primary focus of this chapter is on tests that are usedto make admissions decisions for postsecondary education, we firstdescribe the exposure of handicapped students in elementary andsecondary schools to standardized tests. The reason for beginningwith this discussion is that some people hae suspected that handi-capped students may have very limited or, at least, very differentexposure to standardized tests in the elementary and secondarygrades and, therefore, may he at a disadvantage relathe to theirnonhandicapped peers when they encounter college admission tests.Then we moNe to a discussion of college admission tests. We look athow those admissions tests are modified (described in detail in Chapter5), the numbers of handicapped people who take the tests, how thescores are reported by the testing companies, and how the scores areused in making admissions decisions. We next discuss tests that areused for admission to graduate and professional schools. Finally, wepresent what little eidence there is on the validity of all these testsfor handicappete applicants and consider that eNidence in the context.of the validity of tests for nonhandicapped applicants. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS \\.1 esting has long been an integral part of schooling, but the use ofstandardized tests to measure ability or achiekement has been increas-.ing since the early 1900s. Public school children today are given27\"* 28 ABILITY TESTING OF HANDICAPPED PEOPLEstandardized tests for inAny reasons: to diagnose the strengths axidweaknesses of an indiv idual student in order to design an appropriate.educational program, to help the teacher decide.when a' student haslearned a particular skill and is ready to progress to other instruction;to place children in the type of program that will best meet their ..Sneeds; to give guidance and counseling for future education andcareer plans, to certify minimum competencies; and to evaluate themerits of 'particular educational programs (such as bilingual orcompensatory educatiort programs). The extent to w hich handicappedchildren experience this testing is a matter of interest because, ifhandicapped children are tested less frequently than nonhandicappedchildren, they are apt to lack test-taking skills and, consequently, tobe at a disgdvantage when required to take college admission,employment, or certification tests.Handicapped children who are able to participate in the regularschool program, for. most of the day generally share in the testingexperiences of their nonhandicapped classmates. The testing proce-dures for those children who spend most of their time in specialclasses vary, according to the school cfistria and the nature of thehandicap. In some large, urban schools (e.g., in New York City andDetroit) handicapped children are tes,ted tin the same schedule asthose. who are not handicapped, with mo.difications made accordingto each child's individualizededucation program. In others (e.g.,Baltimore) all special .education children are ex,cluded from theregular testing program. Testing for PlacementFor a handicapped child, tests play an important role in determiningan appropriate educational program and in deciging whether main-streaming or a special classroom will be most bene(icial) The regu-lations implementing the Education for All Handicapped Children.A412(P.L. 94-142) require that a full and individual evaluatiot of achird's educational needs be conducted-before a handicapped childis assigned to a special education program. Although the proceduresvary from school to school, the evaluation of a student usually is ' [his is one of the issues being investigated M, the National Research Conncifs Panelon S.election and Pla.ATTErritStudents in Programs for the Merlyn, Retarded (Heller,et al W82) 3 9 Os.

'1 Testing for CompetencyA relatively new ar.ea of test ng that is creating problems for handi-capped sendents and raising gal issues in rcgard to P.L. 94-1 ndthe Section 504 regulations i minimum competency tcsting ( 1CT).Reports_ of declining test sco es,and of higli graduates whocan barelc i cad and write have kenerated concern that today's student'.are not receiving an adequate education. In response to this concern,an increasing number of school districts and states are developingprograms to assess a set of basic academic skills that each student isexpected to master-. Approately 32 states have mandited someform of mimmuni competency testing for pupils in the primary and , o 30 ABILITY TESTING OF HANDICAPPED PEOPLEsecondary grades) In 'addition, 156 local school districts have insti-tuted minimum competency testingsome prior to, or is a supple-ment to, state legislation and some in stares that have no mandatedstate program (Gorth and Perkins 1979):The purposes of the MCT programs vary. Some states use the testresults primarily to determine w hich pupils need remedials,work andtiro make decisions regarding the school curriculum. Others tie themastery of competencies to high school graduation or grade-to-gradepromotion. Most minimum competency testing programs are directedtoward regular education students and have been implementedsometimes hastily, under pressure from state legislatures or schoolboardswith little thought given to how the requirements wouldaffect handicapped students (National Association of State Directorsof Special Education 1979). Consequently, only a few MCT programssystematically address the needs of handicapped students.Policies regarding minimum competency testing of handicappedstudents vary among states and among local school districts. Themost common practke is to exempt some or all special educationstudents from the minimum competency tests: for example, Marylandexempts all special education students while North Carolina exemptsonly the trainable mentally retarded and those students with multiplehandicaps. A few states use the student's IEP to'cletermine whetheror not the student should take the tests. Minimum competency testsare modified for handicapped students as a state policy in about athird of the states. In New York, for example, special educationstudents are allowed extended time, braille+ or use of a calculator orreader, depending'on their handicap. Most states, however, leave thetsponsibility to the local school districts. The state usually preparesialist of accommodations that are appropriate for different handi-capping conditions, but it does not indicate criteria for determiningthe extent of accommodation or the severity of handicap that requiresccommodation (Rosewater 1979), Another option, devising tests Ivithdifferent.content for handkapped students, has been used onlyinfrequently. Florida has separate tests.for hearing- impaired studentsand for educable mentally retarded students. Several local programs 'Some sources (e.g., Pipho 1979) 'cite 36 Ntur programs. However, definMg MC I'programs as those that set desired performance standards and also Ipecifr conseiluencesthat affect students as a result of meeting, or not meeting,' the standards (e.g..remediation, the receipt of a high school diploma), a study conducted at NationalEvaluatum Systems.

Se%eral programs make nospecific pro%isions for handicapped students but treat each case-onan intik idual basis. Other pi ocecktres include allowing handicappedstudehts to delay testing or letting the student decide whether to takethe regular test or be exempted.Most of the states that link diplomas with MCI smres ha% e not %etspecified %. hether handicapped students are to be intluded oi ex-cluded from their programs. 1 he pracht es of st huo1 in as%ardingregular or special diplomas handl( apped students e ofMCT programs) ed b% the National Assix mumof State Directors of Special Education (1979).

The arbiteary nature ofthe setting of a cutoff score is particularly troublesome. Tht,thirddifficultyis the policy of using the score of one, test as the soledeterminant for awarding diplomas, a critical fatt in people's lives.The use of one test score without additional information is stronglydiscouraged by nearly all professionals who work with tests.It seems clear that careful planning and consideration of all theways in which MCT programs will affect special education studentsare essential if discrimination against handicapped people is to beavoided. COLLEGE ADMISSIONSPolicies of Test MakersIn the United States, there are sev eral types of postsecondary schools,each of w hich has different admissions policies and requirements.Almost all (9 of 10) four-year colleges and universities require eitherthe Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) or the American College TestingProgram (ACT) assessment as part of their undergraduate admissionprocedures (Skager 1982). These tests, administered nationwide, areusually taken by high school seniors either at their own school or attesting centers. The results are mailed from the central testing agencyto the student and to colleges that he or she specifies. The Scholastic Aptitude TestThe Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) is composed of a verbal section,which focuses on verbal reasoning, verbal relationships, and readingcomprehension, and a mathematical section, which tests for knowledgeof algebra and geometry and requires skill in computation, applicationof principles, and problem solving.The College-Board, which sponsors the SAT (as well as achievementtests in particular suiSjects, which are aiso required by many colleges),publishes a special booklet, Information for Students, that covers servicesfor handicapped students. The booklet informs the student that adisability should not automatically lead tp a request for special testingStudents whose disabilities do not affect reading or writing abilitiesand who would not require extended time are instructed to followregular procedures. There is also a separate information sheet forcounselorsuind admissions officers regarding services and proceduresto be followed. \"lhe information sheet for counselors and admissions 4 3 Admissions Testing for Postsecondary Education 33officers calls attention to the limited knowledge about, the impact ofaccommodations, that is, changes in standard conditions, on testscores and the resulting uncertainty in interpreting the scores. It alsonotes that all administrations that inYolye extended time, special testeditions, or the use of a reader, manual translator, or, an amanuensisare considered nonstandard and lead to the designation \"NON-STD\"on the student's score report. The college that receiy es the scorereport knows thaystandard administration procedures were notfollowed, but a does not knOw the nature of accommodation madeor the type of handicapping conditionA special \"Test Order FormrI est Rewrd\" fOr handicapped ex-aminees calls for information on (1) the nature of the disability, (2)hether the disbilt y is permanent or temporary , (3) the test editionand practke materiaesired, (4) a sign-off by the student (parentor guardian, if necessaryo indicate both acceptance of conditionsoutlined in Information for Students and understanding that \"NON-STD\" will appear on score reports to indicate that standard admin-istration procedures were not followed, and (5) a sign-off by a schoolofficial that affirms the existence of the handicap and tht the testingand reporting procedures haYe been explained to the gtudent.The College Board reports that the number of students requestingspecral administrutions of the SA1 has nearly oyer the pastfive yearsfrom i,554 people during the 1974-75 testing year to jitstoYer 3,000 for 1979-80 (see Table 2-1) Nearly all of this growth canbe attributed to large increases in .the number of nonstandardadministrations using regular editions of the test. Tegulai editionsare used primarily by students w ith learning disabilities who reqciestextended time. Requests for the braille edition of tbe test hay edecreased fairly steadily, from 179 administered in 1974-75 td 81 in1979-80, requests for largetype editions haYe remained relatiyelyconstant, slightly under 600 a year until 1979-80, when they increasedto nearly 7-00. The use of the cassette Yersion of the SAI has increasedsubstantially since it was introduced in 1978, primarily by studentswith learning disabilities. The American College Tesprig PrograMThe American College Testing Pro ram (ACT) assesses coinpetenciesin four subject areas. English, mathi atics, social studies, and naturalsciences. While the ACT subtests are intended to be tied more closelyto'acadernic curricula than are the SAT tests, scores on the ACT and44 34 ARIpTY TESTING OF 2,051 special administrations. 1,493 students reported aperceptual handicap (presumably most were specific learningdisabilities). 395 reported a phssical handicap.--and 163 reporteda sisual hatrilicap.',The data for 1980-81 ate DOI comparable to those for presioussears The bre-akdown for this year was done by the characteristicof the test taker, rather than the test Of the 888 = not asailable SAT are highly correlated; applicants who, score well on one test willtend to do about as well on the other.3The information booklet for students taking the ACT, entitled\"Taking the MA Assessment,\" notes that students in certain cate-gories should not complete the reg.ular registration folder. Studentsare informed that if they are ,handicapped or confined they mayrequest a special administration by writing to ACT and that allrequests are considered individually. ACT reports that almost allrequests are accepted. The booklet comments on th'e availability ofbraille, large-type, and cassette editions of the ACT assessment forvisually handicapped or dyslesic students. It notes that other arrange-ments may be made for students who are unable to write the test:orto, complete the test at a regular test center.A special brochure, \"The ACT Assessment Special Testing Guide,\" Ihe sum of the AC r English, natural sciences, and social studies subtests had acorrelation of 82 vt,ith the SAT verbal test in a sample of aboutil 5,000 applicants whotook both tests (Skager 1982).4 5 Admissions Testing for Postsecondary Education 35sets forth conditions and procedures under which special adminis-trations will be conducted. It informs the student that if a speCialtesting that involves extended time is elected, the word \"special\" willappear on report fornia. under \"Type of Test.\" On the SpecialRegistration Form for Handicapped Applicants, students are askedto provide a brief description of their flandicap or disability and toindicate which edition of ACT asses ment is desired. The person hosupervises the administration is as ed to cunfirm that the applicantis handicapped. The student is re uired to select as a supervisor ateacher or a c:ounselor who is able o read and write English.Practice material is available onl in regular form. ACT reportsthat teac hen often read the regu ar sample questions to v isuallsAmpaired students and that some schools for the blind have repro-duced the sample questions in braille Since most special administra-tions are untimed, AD does not fed that the lack of practice materialIS a pi oblem. However, in view of the evidence that icoaching\" ortither forms of practice can significantly improve test cores (FederalTrade Commission 1978, 1979, Messick 1980), this point is debatable.The Anwtican College Testing Program reports,that about 1,000handicapped people each year request and recene,special test admin-istrations in order to submit their applications to eollege. In addition,mans students take the ACT for placement purposes after they havebeen admitted and arrive on campus. Abotti Ipercent of all on-campus test administrations each y ear are special administrations.It is important to note that, in wntrast to the College Board's policy\"for marking \"NON-STD\" on all scores reported for special admin-istrationsNC I assessment scores are marked \"special\" only, if thetests are taken under untimed conditions. (About 60 percent of allspecial administrations are untuned.) The only other informationregarding handicaps that might appeal with a score report would bean affirmative reply to the statement, \"I have a physical handicap ordisabihts that may require special provisions or sen ices from thecollege I attend,\" which appeals-on-the student pi ofile section giv enon a voluntary basis to examinees. However, only about 10 percentof the 3,120 institutions that received score reports in 1978-79requested that apPlicants' responses to that item be printed on the1979-80 smre reports (Maxey and Lev itz 1980). In addition, somepeople vy ho ate not permanently disabled (e.g., someone in a hospitalor someone who temporatil) cannot write because of surgery or ana\u00ab i(lent) ate permitted to take the tests with extended time and thuswould be included in the \"special\" ategory.

Other Adnasston.s-Related TestsThree additional tests sponsored by the College Board have''somebearing on college admissions. The Preliminary Scholastic AptitudeTest/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test (PSAT/NMQT) istajcen by college-bound high school juniors who wish to compete forNational Merit Scholarships or to gain familiarity with the SAT. ThePSAT/NMQT is available in braille and large type; a reader, manualtranslator, or amanuensis is permitted. During the 1979-80 testingyear, 338 special editions were requested (73 braille and 265 large-type). Requests for these special versions have increased over the pastfive years, in contrast with the SAT, for which braille requests havedecreased and those for large type have remained fairly constant.This may be because the SAT is available on cassettes and the PSAT/NMQT is not.Advanced Placement Program (APP) examinations may be taken 4 7 Admissions Testing for Postsecondary Education 37by high school jumois and seniors who wish to get college credit forcolleg\u00ea-leel work completed in high school. There are no specialeditions of the 24 APP examinations, but special arrangements mayinclude extra time or the assistance of a reader or amanuensis. Insuch instances the following statement appears on all copies of thegrade report. \"Candidate handicapped. Exam administered underspecial conditions.\" Each year, approximately 25 handicapped stu-dents take the APP.The College-Leel Examination PrOgram (CLEP) enables nontra-ditional students entering wllege to get credit for college-leel skillsand knowledge acquired outside the classroom. Four of the fie CLEPgeneral examinations are aailable in cassette editions with accom-pansing line figures for test questions that requn e inter pretation ofgraphs, charts. and tabular material. All other tests, including the 17subject exammations, are pros ided only in regular editions, but theymay be administered with the assistance of an amanuensis or reader.The CLEP humanities test, which includes a number of pictures inthe questions on art history, is being prepared in a special editionfor isualls unpaired test takers, questions that do not require isualstimulus material are substituted for those that do. Up to twice theregular ume is permitted for handkapped students. Score reportsindicate that the examination was ;idrriThistered under no.nstandardconditions. ,;, pproximatelr 20 handicapped and 93,000 nonhandi-capped people take one or more CLEP examinations annually. Policies of Admissions OfficersWhile college admission is widely 1, iewed as a highly competitkeprocess, with scores on admissions tests playing i crucial role, seeralrecent sureys suggest this is not the case. In fact, most colleges andunn, ersities are not highly selectk.e. A surey based on the responsesfrom about 200,000 freshmen who entered 362 institutions of highereducation in the fall of 1979'found that more than 75 percent wereaccepted by either their first or second choice (Cooperatie Institu-tional Research Program of the Unhersity of California, Los Angelesand the American Council on Education 1980).A national sur ey of undergraduate admissions policies (sponsoredjointly by the American Association of Collegiate Registrars andAdmissions Officers (AACRAO) and the College Bwrd [AACRAO-College Board 1980]) found the median percentage of applicantsaccepted by both pmate and public four-year institutions for 1978to ,be more .than 80 percent. For (wo-year colleges the median 48 38 ABILITY TESTING 6F HANDICAPPED PEOPLEacceptance rate was more than 90 percent. Since there is good reasonto suspect that the schools that responded to the questionnaire (about63 percem of the public and 57 percent of the private schools) mayconstitute a sample biased in the direction of more selective institu-tions, the 80 percent acceptance rate for the four-year colleges anduniversities may well be an underestimate.On the basis of their replies to the survey, each institution wascategorized as nonselective (accepts all applicants who meet certainminimal requirements) or selecti.ve (accepts only a limited number ofapplicants.). Data for the 255 selective four-y ear public institutionsshow that 23'percent accepted more than 90 percent of their applicantsfor the 1978-7$) school-year, 24 percent accepted 81 to 90 percent,and 25 percent accepted 71 to 80 percent, only 11 percent acceptedfewer than 50 percent (AACRAO-College Board 1980).These,figures give a misleading picture, in one sense, because theydo not consider self-selection by applicants. That is, a distinguishedinstitution play accept a large percentage of its applicants becauseonly outstanding students choose to apply. A study by Venti andWise (1980) supports this interpretation.J'hey conclude that, whileSAT scores may greatly affect admissions decisions, particularly inhighly selective schools, their effect on the decisions of applicants ismuch stronger. NeNertheless, the overall impression is one of increas-ing accessibility. It is estimated that about a third of U.S. institutionsof higher education have essentially an \"open door\" policy (Skager1982). ____The majority of public- and\\priv ate institutions in the AACRAO-College Board study (1980) report that high school grades areconsidered more important -as admissions criteria than test scores,although test,swres rank a close second. Other ty pes of credentialscommonly required for some or all applicants include personalinterviews (required by 42 percent of' the public and 54 percent ofthe private fourey ear institutions) and letters of recommendation(required by 33 percent of the public and 82 percent of the privatefour-year institutions). Judgments about such personal qualities asmotivation and Moral character were considered important, as was,evidence of special skills, work experience, community involvement,aml leadership qualities. Venti and Wise (1980) also, conclude thattest scores do not appear to be the major constraint on the collegeopportunities of high school graduates.Most schools apparently weigh admission test scores in reaching at]overall Judgment regarding admissibility but do not set a cutoff score.Fewer than .half of the four-year institutions 'participating in the 4 9 Admissions Testing for Postsecondary Education 39AACRAO-College Board study had minimum SAT or ACT scoresbelow which \"an applicant is generally not considered for admission\".38 percent of public and 42 percent bf pri%ate institutions using theSAT, 29 percent and 30 percent, respectively, for those using theACT. When .a cutoff score is used, it is surprisingly low. Averagecutoff scores for the total SAT %%ere about 750 (of a possible 1,600)for public and pi-Rate institutions. For schools using the ACT, themean minimum composite scores were 16.2 and 16.4 (of a possible36) for public and pris ate institutions, respectively.The oerall picture for admissions at the undergraduate leel is,one of consideiable flexibilit% in the use of test scores along withothei informatwn (Skager 1982). Most institutions admit the majvrityof their alfrtlic ants, and most applicants are admitted to the -collegeor uniyersit% of their choice. With the anticipated detline in thecollege-age population and increased concerns for affirrname action,undeigiaduate admissions seem likely to become nen more openand less selective in the future. Handicapped Students in CollegeCompared with theil numbeis in the college-age population, handi-capped people are underrepresented in college. A 1976 suney bythe National Center for Education Statistics (U.S. Department ofEducation 1980.38) found that among the college-age population (18to 25 years'of age) only 29 percent of handicapped people wereenrolled in school compared with 36 percent for the college-agepopulation as a whole. In addition, a muCh higher percentage ofhandicapped than nonhandicapped students attend two-year (asoppose(1 to four-%ear) institutions. s hile 36 percent of all studentsenrolled in mlleges and unRersities ))n 1978 attended two-yearinstitutions, 50 per(ent of the mobility -Impaired and almost 57 percentof the acoustically impaired students attended two-year institutionsU.S. Department of. Education 1980:38).lu what extent is the imiderrepreseion of handicapped peoplein college a result of selectie admissions? Unfortunately, there islittle mttiun about admissions question on the AACRAO-College Board to tbe formal admissions by..selectise institutions: 39 percent of the public four-year, 30percent of the pm ate four-year, and 25 percent of the private two-year instItutions said that exceptions could be made for' \"physicallyhandicapped students.\" 40 ABILITY TESTING OF HANDICAPPED PEOPLEAccording to James Dunning, director of admissions at the Uni-ersity of California, In ine, admissions officers in most colleges makee%ery effort not to discriminate against handicapped applicants.' Hebelieves that scores resulting from a nonstandard administration aretreated as if they were regular scores, unless they are to the student'sobvious detriment. When those scores are low, applicants' recordsare reviewed further in an attempt to assess accurately their abilities;if special test administrations are not flagged,- Dunning Suggested,low-scoring handicapped applicants may be unwittingly denied ad-mission. . ADMISSION TO PROFESSIONAL AND GRADUATE SCHOOLSPolicies of Test MakersThe Graduate Record ExaminationThe test most frequently required for admission to graduate schoolprograms, the Graduate Record Examination (GRE), is published bythe Graduate Record Examinations Board and administered by theEducational Testing Service. It includes an aptitude test composedof three subtests (verbal, quantjtative, and analytical reasoning), andadvanced tests in 20 fields.An asterisk next to the test date on a handicapped applicant's scorereport directs attention to a footnote saying \"special testing condition,see enclosed memo.\" The memorandum describes the special con-ditions under which the test was taken, urges cautious use of thescores, and recommends that other indicators of achievement beemphasized. The Educational Testing Service notes in its informationbulletin for applicants that \"our intent is to remind the graduateschools that each handicapped student should be considered individ-ually, in light of the particular disability involved and the student'sacademic record.\"Overall figures for the administration of the GRE aptitude testshow a downward trend over the past 5 years, from 300,000 tests in1975-76 to 275,000 in 1978-79. About 400 handicapped applicantstake the GRE aptitude test each year under special conditions; anadditional 100 take one of the advanced tests only. Of the 409 special 'Dunning spoke at the upen meeting of the panel (see Appendix4), representing theAmerican Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions dtficers 51 Admissions Testing for Postsecondary Education \\11administrations of the aptitude test in 1978-79, 215 were regyartype, 113 large type, 39 braille, and 42 cassette. Of the 2 f5 handi-capped applicants w ho used the regular-ty pe edition, about 55 percentwere repotted by test supervisors have \"ph5sical disabililies\" and45 to. have \"visual problems.\" Some applicants included undervisual problems\" may hav e had learning disabilities, but this was nota category used in the superv isor's report form. The most frequentaccommodation was extra time, readers and amanuenses were seldomused. People with visual problems often used special aids, such as theOpticon. The Miller Analogies TestThe Miller Analogies Test (MAT), published by the PsychologicalCorporation, is also used for graduate admissions on a national scalesometimes along with the GRE and sometimes in its place. The testconsists of a series of problems stated in the form of analogies, mostlyverbal. Each analogy has four parts, or terms, three of which aregiven with the remaining term to be selected from four choices. Manyof the terms are quite esoteric, so the test requires an extensivevocabulary.About 80,000 people take the MAT each year; some 20 to 30 ofthese use braille editions, vs hile 35 to 45 -use large-type editions.Presumably almost all of these special administrations Wok extra time,but the Psychological Corporation does not record that inforniAtion.It also does not keep Lount of the number of handicapped individualswho take the test with a reader or amanuensis or under standardconditions. The Psychological Corporation indicates a nonstandardadministration when reporting scores for all accommodations, andthey enclose a cautionary statement concerning interpretation. The Methcal College Admission TestApplicants to all but two of the 126 U.S. medical schools are requiredto take the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT), which isdeveloped by the American Institute for Research under the spon-sorship of the Association of American Medical Colleges and isadministered by the American College Testing Program. The test,which replaced an olderversion in 1977, assesses (a) science knowledgein biology, chemistry, , and physics, (b) the ability to lolve problemsin these three scienc e fields, (c) reading skills, and (d) quantitatheskills. 42 ABILITY TESTING OF HANDICAPPED PEOPLEHandicapped applicants are informed, in the AtCAT Announcement,that they must submit a letter from a physkian documenting theirhandicapping condition and the need for special arrangements. Thereare no modified editions of the MCAT, but the assistance of a readeror an amanuensis is allow ed. as is extended time if requestedup toawo days compared w ith the regular one day (61/2 hours actual testtime). If any of these arrangements is used, the test report is markedby an asterisk. The asterisk could signify temporary disability , suchas a broken arm,- but since applicaks are almost always intervir<edbefore being accepted, w h\u00e9ther 01 .not score reports reveal one'shandicap is usually irrelevapt.Approximately 54,000, administrations of, the MCAT are givenyearly , about a third of them are repeat testings. The av erage applicanttakes the test twice, and many take it three to five times. Of the26,000 applicants who took.the MCAT in the fall of 1979, only about10 requested special accommodations. According to ACT, whichadministers the MCAT, about half of those requesting special accom-a-iodations are dy skxic indiv iduals ho ask for extended time. Therest typically have loision or a temporary disability.\"' The Law School Admission TestAll of the 168 law schools approved by the American Bar Associationrequire the Law School Admission Test (LSAT), which is developed,administere), and scored by the Educational Testing ei-v ice underthe authority of tRe Law School Admission Council.

Appioximatek 190,000 tests 5 4 44 ABILITY TESTING OF HANDICAPPED PEOPLEwere administered in 1978-79 (about 207,000 is the estimate for 1979-80). Use of the GMAT has increased steadily in the past 5 years asapplicants uho might earlier have selected other types of_ graduateor professional training have shifted to business and managementfields.Editions of the GMAT in braille, large type, and on cassette firstbecame available in 1979-80. The assistance of an amanuensis or areader is permitted, as is up to six hours of extra time. The scoreresults for handicapped examinees include a i emorandum describingthe nature.of the test conditions and the i t that norms are notavailable for Interpreting the scores.'During the 1979-80 testing year, 74 special administrations of theGMAT were given: 33 were large-ty pe, 7 were cassette, and 3 Werebraille yersions, 26 applicants took the regular test with extra time,and 5 took the regular test within the standard time limits but requireda sep-arate room or special seating. Policies of Admissions OfficersIt is difficult to determine the proportion of graduate school applicantsyyho are required to take the GRE, because requirements for graduateadmission often vary from department to department, eyen withinthe same university. A large graduate institution might incorporate30 different schools and departments, each With its own admissionsrequirements. Howeyer, among the largesj and most prestigious,, graduate institutions (members of the Association of Graduate SPols),the GRE is likely to be required for some or all applicants for amajority of programS (Skager 1982).Decisions about aLceptance to graduate school usually are made bya faculty committee of the department or program involved. Con-sequently. It is difficult to obtain a definitive picture of how importanttest scores are in the pt ocess. The only national stuOodrinense ofthe GRE in graduate admissions (Burns 1970) indicates that scoresare weighed along with other data, anid that cutoft.scoresbelowwhich applicants are automatically rejectedare selccom used.Admission to medical school is extremely competiti4. For example,most of the 48 priyate medical schools in this country 'admitted lessthan 10 percent of their applicants in 1977-78 (Gordon 1979). Andmedical school aliplicants are a highly self-selected group: for ex-ample, the mean undergraduate grade-point averagv of to medical school in 1978* was 3,3 (Thnin*-Forgues andErdmann 1980). 4 Admissions Testing for Postsecondary Education 45Almost all U.S. medical schools inteniew prospectRe students, soadmission is essenuallY a two-stage process. Undergraduate grades,MCAT scores, letters of recommendation, background information,and state residenc% (in the case of many public institutions) are\u00abmsidered in determining who will be inter Yiew ed. (Medical schooljtypically inter% iew about 2.5 times the number of applicants who w+?ile%entually receiye offers (ifadmission.) Final decisions regardingadmission presumably are based on impiessions gained during theinter% iew of the applicant's personal qualities as well as on furtherexploration of academic background and relesant experienceFhe Special Athisor% Panel on 'Fe( hnical Standards for MedicalSchool Admission appointed by the Association of American MedicalColleges prepared a set of guidelines for medical colleges specikingthe technical (nonacademic) standards for applicants seeking theDoctor of Medicine (M.D.) degree (Cooper 1979). These standards,hi h physicians should meet to ensure good patient care, includeadequate somatic sensation,S ision, hearing, speech, equilibrium,exterocepti%e sense sense(position, pressure, rn6Yeruent), and motor funuion. he ads isorypanel stressed that the M.D. degree is a broad, undif ferentiateddegree, and that medical students should be potentially capable ofperforming any of the tasks required o1, a physician. Thus, theyargued, it is not a\u00abeptable to admit a blind student, for example, onthe grounds that he or she plans to become a psychiatrist andtherefore will not be required to perform many of the physician'stasks that depend primarily on s ision.I he guidelines are onls iecommendations, and they are probablymore \u00abmserYanye than the policies of some medical schools. In y ley%of the fact that theie are sci many more qualified applicants thana%ailable places in medical schoolshoweYei, it seems unlikely thatan% but the most exceptional handic apped student would be admittedto medical sc hoofI he of American Medical Colleges hasno data on tc number of handicapped applicants admitted to medicalschool. theAmiable information relates to a_few handicappedindividuals,w ho have graduated from medical school.With guidelines as explicit as those from the special athisory paneland with the demand for admission to medical schools far exceedingthe number places aYailable, it is reasonable to conclude that whilethe MCXI is undoubtedly an obstacle for some handhapped people,it probably does not \u00abmstitute the major barrier to meical schooladmission.While law school admissions generally are not as competitive as ,11456 46 ABILITY TESTING OF HANDICAPPED PEOPLEmedical school admissions, there are 'till many more academicallyqualified law school applicants than can be admitted. Compared tograduate and medical schools, law schools haye a more mechanicaladmission process. Few lass schools interYiew applicants, and thequantitatiYe a scRuning de ice. There is some indication that test scoresare syeighted more heayily than grade-point Admission Countil recommends that lays seltolswane the LSAT for certain handicapped applicants, but there areno data showing how many do so, Because LSAT .scores are notflagged, those handicapped applicants who receie low scores couldbe rejected automatically unless the law school's attention is drawnto the other evidence of ability. PREDICTIVE VALIDITY OF POSTSECONDARY ADMISSIONSTESTSThe primary purpose of college admissions tests isto identifyapplicants who will succeed academically. It is presumed that appli-cants with high test scores will earn higher grades and be more likelyto graduate than those with low test scoi es: In this section we describethe aYailable-eNidence ori this issue, the Yalidity of admission tests forthe general population- and for handicapped applicants. College Admissions TestsIn a sample of 310 yalidity studies of the SAT, the median correlationbetween scores on the yerbal section of the test and freshman gradeswas about .38 and that for the mathematical section %yds about .34(analysis by Linn 1982 based on data from Schrader 1971). The AC1composite scores hay e a correlation of about .38 with freshmangrades, muldple correlations are about .50 ,(American CollegeTesting Program 1973).Correlations in this range allow for considerable error in prediction.For example, with a correlation of .50, under ideal circumstancesonly 41 percent of those in the top fiftly. of the distribution of testscores will be expected to be in the top fifth in terms of grade-pointayerage (Linn 1982). Fhus, people with the same scores on collegeadmissions tests are likely to Wye wide Yariability in their grade-point57 Admissions Testing for Postsecondary Education 47aYerages. These correlations, how es, er, to some extent underestimatethe degree of relationship between test scores and college gradesbecause the group in college is fairly homogenehoftCollege.studentsgenerally -are more able than the population at 17Fge. If the entirecollege-age population were tested and admitted to college, thecorrelations between test scores and f r eshman grades-would be higher.In addition. as Venn and Wise (1980) note, test scores affect anindisiduars decision ofyy hether to applY to college as well as thechoke of college This f urther attenuates the correlation betw'een and college grades.While ACT SA-I smres do pro% kle some basis for predictingfreshman grades, neither of these tests has been found to be a better,or ey en as good, a predictor of freshman grade-point aYerages ashigh school grades or high school rank in class (Schrader 1971,Amern an College Testing Program 1973). Nevertheless, a combina-tron of test scores and high school grade-point ayerage does predictcollege grades better than either of those two yariables alone. Forboth the ACT and the SAT, the multiple correlation for high schoolgrades plus test scores is about .59, compared with .50 for high schoolgrades alone. Furthermore, it can be argued that the scores pros idean adjustment fin the yariability in the quality of education and inthe meaning of grades f rom different high schools.Altfrough the ay ailable data are quite meager, they do gibe someindication of hoflell gratles and test scoreo predict the collegeachreYement of handicapped students. The aYailable data come froma study of handicapped and nonhandicapped students w ho haYetaken the AC1 assessment (Maxey and Leyitz 1980). (The handi-capped applicants are those cy ho took the regular AC F assessmenton a natiimal test date, not those \"Yy ho took modified editions oruntime(l tests )It should be noted, first, that data collected by ACTshim that handicapped students, on the ,iyerage, ha ye earned lowerhighhool grades and earn lower \u00abillege grades than nonhandi-Gipped students (Maxey and Ley itz 1980); see also 1 able 2-3.(Students are asked to report their high school grades w hen theyregister to take the ACT assessment.) The high school grades forthese handicapped students were, on aYerage, 0.21 grade points lowerthan the national norm. In their first year of college, the grades ofthese handicapped students were, on aYerage, 0.17 grade points Jowerthan for nonhandicapped students (Maxey and Levitz 1980).For handicapped students in this sample the correlation betweenhigh school grades and f reshman grade-point ayerage is .43; thecorrelation between AC-I composite scores and freshman grades is 58 48 ABILITY TESTING OF HANDICAPPED PEOPLETABLE 2-3Mean Self-Reported High School Grades for StudentsTaking the Regular Edition of the ACT, 949.11262,113'1976-772 802 96317'06.362'1978-792 74295535'73.3761979-802 752 percent sample of the identified populationsvirtu t\\LOW. and Les itz (198(1) and personal conununK anon. Nlyses (19811. .46. Thus,.for this sample of handicapped staTents, tek scores are aslightly better predictor of college performance than are high schoolgrades. For nonhandicapped students in this study', the reverse istrue. the correlation for high school grades with freshman grades isslightly higher (.46) than the correlation of the ACT composite scorewith freshman grades (.44). For both groups, a combination of theACT composite scores and high school grade-point average predictscollege grades equally well (.59) (Maxey and Levitz 1980).While the above data suggest that ACT scores are a valid predictorof college performance for this sample of handicapped students, theydo not provide any, information about the validity of the tests forstudents with different disabilities, or for those with more severedisabilities. (The reader should remember that the study includedonly those handicapped students who took the regular ACT assess-ment.) In one study conducted in the late 1960s, 41 deaf students atthe National Technical Institute for the Deaf (NTID, part of theRochester Technical Institute) were compared with 103 hearingstudents who enrolled in the program. The mean score on the verbalpart of the SAT for the deaf students was 291, with a range of 200to 416. This contrasted with a mean verbal score among their hearingpeers of 485, with a range of 301 to 727. Thus, the lowest score ofthe hearing students was close to the mean of the scores of the deafstudents. On the quantitative section of the SAT, the mean score was392 for the deaf students and 564 for the hearing students, withranges of 253 to 577 and 343 to 752, respectively. While themathematics scores of the deaf students were substantially higherthan their verbal scores, they were also low relative to the mathematicsscores of their hearing peers. The top quantitative score among the 59 Admissions Testing for Postsecondary gducation 49deaf students was not Imich lugher than the mean for the hearingstudents.

Graduate Admissions TestsThe correlations between admissions test scores and academic per-formance in graduate, medical, or law schools are generalk lowertkin those for undergraduate schools because the sever 9IN limitedNanabilits in test scores and grades attenuates the correlation coef fi-cients. In general, predictions based on academic per formance incollege (undergraduate grade-point aNerage) are about as, good aspredictions based on test s\u00ab,res, but the wmbination of test scoresand undergraduate grades is a better predictor than, either alone(Willingham 1974 CONCLUSIONSWhat can we conclude about the nature of the admissions processfor handuapped people?

Most college applicants are admittedby the school of their fast or second choice (although perhaps in partbecause students tend to appls to schools where they are likely to be-admitted). High school grades hase been shown to be the single bestpredictor of freshman college giades, with test scores improNing theprediction rather little. Based on these findings some may concludethat postse\u00abmdaR adnussions tests are of no consequence for mostcollege applicants. including those with handicapping conditions.Nes ertheless, the panel behnes it is unsafe to conclude that tests are,unimportant for handicapped college applicants for the followingreasons:Test scores are used in admissions deusions by many ,,chools.Tests may offer an opportunity for handicapped applicants todemonstrate their abilities.I ests may, in some situations, work to the detriment of somehandicapped applicants.The right to take appropriate tests has been accorded handi-capped people by .federal regulations. Testing forJob SeleCtion There are seYeral points at whic h testing could sene as a barrier tothe parlicipation of the handicapped in the yyorld of work. Forincreasing number of occupations, licensing oi certification proce-dures are required, and written tests haYe become a common %eludefor measuring competence. Federal, state, and local ciil senicesystems -rely heal, dy on screening through testing. Unions and man-2gement alike use tests to screen candidates for entry-leYel jobs oroccupations. Frequently, handicapped people also encounter tests inrehabilitation agencies when they prepare for jobs. In these situations,the use of tests may hinder handicapped people from joining thework force in a capacity for which their education and training haYeotherwise been adequate and appropriate, or it may facilitate theirmoving into productive roles in American society.Primarily because tests ha Ye tended .4,) screen out Nat ks, Flispanic.s,and members of other minor-shy group, employ went testing has beenunder close scrutiny since the mid-1960s. One focus of the concernhas been the job-relatedness or Yalidity of the tests. (See Chapter 4for a discussion of the relevant legal issues and Chapter 5 for adis( ussion of psychomen it \u00abffisiderations in Yalidation studies.) Onesignificant consequenCe of the closer scrutiny of employment testinghas been i tendency to merestimate the historical importance of testsin the total hiring process. A second consequence has been theunprececknted olunw ofociaI resources that haNe imn test deYelopment to litigation.5162 52 ABILITY TESTING OF HANDICAPPED PEOPLE,A third consequence has been a decline in test use, particularly amOngsmall employers, in the %sake of confusion about the precise inter-pretation of federal guidelines on employee selection procedures.The panel has obtained information from public and private sectoremployers, rehabilitation agencies, and licensing and certificationofficials regarding the degree to %%Erich handicapped indiy idualsencounter tests in employment settings. We have learned that thereis sparse information about employment testing in the private sector,ea,en for the general population. This lack of information is of concernbecause the private sector is a much larger, more amorphous part ofthe lyorld of I% ork than the public sector. In this chapter we presenta synthesis of the information %ye obtained, but %Ye caution againstovergeinerahlation based on these data, particularly those regardingthe private sector, in %%Erich the enormous number and diversity ofemployment settings limit inference from one case to another.WIrnever possible ue compare employment testing f3rocedures forhIndicapped people With those for the general population. Folloyyingthe descriptions of testing in the Nt arious employment settings, %ye,discuss issues that are common to those settings relating to hiring orpromotion practices that may tend' to limit the occupational oppor-tunines of handicapped people. Finally, we give a brief sketch of thepractices and policies of a few other nations trying to improve thestatus of people with handicapping conditions. THE PUBLIC SECTOREmployment Testing at the Federal LevelThe public sector, w, hich includes federal (including the military),state, and local government agencies, is the locus of the mostcomprehensive and systematic testing programs for selection andplacement in employ ment. At tb.efederal level, the Of fk e of PersonnelManagement (OPM, formerly the Civil Service Commission) 'has inrecent years administered hundreds of thousands of examinationsyearly for clerical and entry-level professional positions in the federalgovernment. Most of the exams are intended to predict how aandidate 1A, ithout much experience %%ill perform in a job that requiresno special training, Although OPM's Professional and AdministrativeCareer Examination (PACE) has been supported by ongoing testdevelopment and Nahdation, including considerable Work on modi-fications tot handicapped examinees, it is being phased out in favor 63 Testing for Job Selection 53of tests Or other selection devices deYeloped for each of the 118 jobsformerly covered by the PACE.'The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Vietnam Era Veterans'Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974 require eYery federal agency tofacilitate hiring, placement, and ad% ancectent of handicapped people.HoweYer, interest in the special pi oblems associated with the testingof handicapped candidates for civil serNice positions dates back tothe 1950s. Some of the most consouctiYe steps toward solying thepsychometric problems associated with the testing of handicappedpeople haY e been nndertaken k regearch diY isions of 9PM and itspredecessor.Recently the emphasis in the federal gmeinment has been onalternate routes (i.e., not tests) to careers with the federal gm ernment.Many mid-leY el and senior positions are open to all applicants throughwhat is termed the \"excepted service.\" No civil senice rating isrequired lot these openings, candidates are eYaluated on the basis ofeducatum, training, and experience. OPM's Office of SelectiYe Place-ment Programs ako administers two entry-leyel programs that areparticularly teloant to handicapped job seekers. Through the Sched-ule A appointments pi ogram, applicants may arrange for specialprocedures or accommodations in luring requirements, includingexemption from tests.Sc hedule B appointments pros ide people whohave received psychiatric to theariat tons on the traditional wmpetitke testingmethod of entry into the mil sery k e, the federal goYernment hasalso instituted tempo] ar01 tnal work periods.

The OPMreport also notes marked change in the distribution of handicappedemployees a( toss the government salary levels. Based on these figures,OPM's report concludes that attitudinal and procedural barriers toemployment and advancement of the handicapped in federal gov-ernment are diminishing. Unfoi tunately. , it is not possible determinefrom thisi eport the means bywhich disabled individuals enteredFederal service and whether tests were used in the selection process. Employment Testing at the State LevelState goverhments also rely heavily on tests to maintain their legis-latively mandated merit systems of hiring. A suney conducted jointly.by the Office of Personnel Management and the Council of StateGovernments (1979) indicated that more than three-fourths of thestates used written tests as part of the sekx tibn process for clerical,prof essionalind techm( al jobs, than one-half fm blue-wllar and management/administrative positions.State and local governments dif fel from the federal government,however, in that they typically do not maintain research departmentslot test development and validation but rather rely on research doneby others, usually in industrial or academic settings (see below).A 1971 survey of hiring practices for handicapped job applicantsin all SO states showed great variety (see Table 3-1).

Inorder for applicants to qualify for this program, they must be certifiedas meeting guidelines of theMichigan Bureau of Rehabilitation, thestate Commission for the Blind, or the Veterans Administration.Following certification, the applicant's name, with a \"handicapped\"designation,is placed at the top of the employment list that iscirculated to state agencies.

LICENSING AND CERTIFICATIONLicensing and certification requirements were designed to regulatethe competence of indkiduals allowed to practice a particular profes-sion. The two terms are often used interchangeably, but they tech-nically refer to two distinct processes. licenses are issued by gmernmentagencies to indiYiduals who are ihereby granted perthission to engagein a given occupation, certification is granted by nongoyernnientalagencies (e.g., professional associations) to indiyiduals who havefulfilled requirements established by the profession to regulate Itself:Today more than 2,000 occupations haYe licensing or certifiCationrequirements (Pottinger et al. 1980). Types of professions that aretvpically regulated by state gmernment agencies and that haw testsas pair of the licensing requirements include architecture, barbersand beauticians, certified public accountants, Job Selection 61determined that relausels few of the occupations that require Ikensingor Lertifkation include testing'as a component of the process for thegeneral population. Rather, there is usually an educational require-ment idwmbination with on-lhe-job experience or an internship orpractieum. Experience can soinetnnes be substituted for other re-quirements'.According to the Flismx and Nafziger surves, the validits orrehabifits of the tests that are used is of sen little concern to thelicensing ur Lernfsing bodies. Frequent Is, test administration proce-dures are not esen standardized.

Brailletests are generally not a'vailable.In Lases in whu h licensing or certification tests are produced,'normed, distributed, and swred by testing companies, the usualprocedure is for the accrediting board or association to pass on anyrequests for special testing arrangements to the testing company,which then arranges falthe appropriate modifications_to be availableat the designated time and place. 1 ypes of mOdifications appear to 62 ABILITY TESTING OF HANDICAPPED PEOPLEbe mote limited than in college admissions t,esting, with a reader oramanuensis and extended time the most common accommodations.Extra costs are absorbed by the professional association or boardrather than bY the candidate.Some licensing and certification agencies model their tests after theMulti-State Bar Examination, a two-part test for the licensing oflaw ers.

In anycase, it appears that because of other practices, the flagging of scoresthat identify a job applicant as having a handicapping condition isless an issue in testing fur employment than in testing for admissionto postsecondary education institutions.The third issue involves the need for- specialized training ofpsychologists, guidance and employment counselors, and otherprofessionals whose responsibility it is to evaluate and prov ide realisticadvice to handicapped job seekers. In some cases such personnel areschool-based, either in secondary or postsecondary institutions. Morefrequently, however, handicapped people will receive employmentinformation, evaluation, and counseling through rehabilitatiou ser-vices or state employ ment offices. Yet personnel employed by reha-bilitation serv ices are not necessarily specialists in er aluating theabilities of handicapped people. Vasbinder reported to the panel thatthe current practice in New York is to purchase testing services fromprivate licensed psychologists (see Appendix 11). According to Barron,many of these psychologists have neither training nor previousexperience in assessing the aptitudes of handicapped people (1980:342):rhere are many examples of clients whose testing experiences or contactwith helping professionals has increased rather than diminished their inse-curities, has lowered rather than improYed the chances that their assets andpotentials would be discuYered and capitalized on. because the psychologistsinvoked were cony inced by limited exposure and experience tHat handi-capped people were Incapable of leading any but marginal lk es Or, thepsychologists were certain the clients were deeply disturbed because they didnot understand the behavior in the context of the dishbilityA representative of the Alexander Graham Bell Association for theDeaf cited two sun,s that support this v iew McCrone and Chambers(1977) found that in 11 states, professionals who were used by statevocational rehabilitation agencies to perform psychological er aluationsof clients were 'not supervised by doctoral-level psychologists asrequired by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and recommended by theAmerican Psychological Association (APA). Spear and Schoepke(1979) surveyed the psychology training programs of all APA-approved schools and found (with 'an 87 percent response rate) that26 percent of all program directors had never heard of the Rehabil- 75 4'Testing for Job Selection 65nation Act of 1973. Another 28 percent had heard of it but were notfamiliar with its requirements. OnlY 10.5 percent of all clinical andcounseling doctoral candidates reported haY ing taken a course onthe psychological aspects of disability.New York has instituted a program for training psychologists hiredIco, the Office of Vocational Rehabilitation in the testing of specifieddisability groups. Another approach to the problem now underconsideration is the possibility of requiring that the academic pi ogramsof doctoral candidates in Cr?mcal psychology programs include coursework in the psyckology and testing of disabled peopleThe fourth ise is the concern that is unixersally refei red tothe greatest barrier to the employment of handicapped people.employers' attitudes, that is, their bias against handicapped people.Handicapped indiiduaIs, achocacy groups, placement personnel inrehabilitation agencies, the President's Committee on Employ mentof the Handicapped, and employers who haYe had successful expe-riences with handicapped employees all pointoto the need foi contin-uing efforts t6) break dow n stereoty pes, preconceptions, and fearsconcerning employment of handicapped people.

A BRIEF INTERNAT/ONAL PERSPECTIVEIn considering the problems associated with employment of handi-capped people and the role that testing plays in their employment,the panel briefly reYiewed the policies and practices of other nationsto see if they might suggest alternatives for this country.Most Western Eulopean nations attethpt to ensure employment ofhandicapped people through a system of quotas that obliges employersto hire a percentage of people in various categories, including theph; sically and mentally handicapped and older workers. In the UnitedKingdom, the Disabled Persons Employment Act of 1917 requiresthat, in companies employing more than 20 people, 3 percent ofthose hired must be disabled. Handicapped jirb seekers must registerwith the Department of Employment in order to be considered forpositions. Under this plan, the proportion of disabled people in thelabor force remained at 3 peicent or higher until 1961 but has sincebeen declining, to jess than 2 percent in 1979. The on Emplm went of the Del 77 Testing for Job Selection 67emplosers f ufiUuig then quota obhgations has ,dso steadik declinedoser the past If sears.I wo of the reasons cited for the failure ofthis SN stem are a sers small number of prosecutions fin failure tomeet the quota and the phictice bs the Department of Einplosmentof issuing large numbers of exemption permits to employers cosel itigblocks of time of Up to SIX rriuritl (Jam 1979).

In the case of a 78 68 ABILITY TESTING OF HANDICAPPED PEOPLEyoung, entry-level physicallyhandicapped worker, an employer re-ceives 90 percent of the employee's wages from the government forthe first year and 50 percent in succeeding years. Rehabilitatedworkers who have difficulty finding work through the open jobmarket also are eligible for this type of work, with employers receivingsupporting grants of.75 percent of their salaries for the first year, 50percent for the second year, and 25 percent in each year thereafter.About 200 state-subsidized shelteredworkshops arescatteredthroughout the country.fhe Swedish government maintains a clinic for occupational testingwhere oaluation of a severqy disabled client may take up to sixmonths. Considerable psychological testing of rehabilitation clientsalso takes place in spedalized institutes. Research into testing of thehandicapped is conducted, at these sites, but an Organikation forEconomic Cooperation and DeYelopment report on the Swedishrehabilitation system note,s that the tests and selection procedures arenot vitidated (Jain 1979).Carnes (1979) reported a significant degree of dissatisfaction withthe Swedish system. Work disinceNk,es, which undettnine the reha-bilitation system, are built into the disability payment structure.Attitudinal barriers also remain a problem. Advocacy groups com-posed principalh of militant disabled individuals are increasinglyvocal and influential in pressuring the government to institute changesin the laws and services that protect handicapped people.The panel's reviov of the policies of other nttions regardirig theemployment of handiedpped people has been neither thorough norextensive. It leads us to believe, nonetheles, that the policies of theWestern European nations that we roiewed do not offer particularlypromising solutions to problems in the United States. We believe thatthe direct application of their policies to the United States is neitherdesirable nor feasible. ?9 4The Legal Contextof Section 504 With the passage of Section 504-of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973,the federal government took a major step toward extending civilrights protection to people with handicapping conditions. The actmarked the first time that federal statutory law formally recognizedthe principle that people with disabilities are entitled to the sameprotection against djscrimination that other people have Section 504thus represented a fundamental shift in federal policy toward hand-icapped people. from the prov ision of financial entitlements to theprohibition of discrimination on the basis of handicap in any ,program a, or activity receiving federal financial assistance. lThis chapter discusses administrative and judicial interpretation ofSection 504. Although we focus particularly on testing practices, since .that is the nub of the panel's charge, it is useful to place our analysisof Section 504 within the larger context of civil rights law. THE HISTORICAL CONTEXT OF CIVIL RIGHTS LAWSThe Prohibition of DiscriminationContemporary conceptions of civil rights in the United States havebeen defined largely with reference to the experience of blackAmericans. Under slavery, blacks suffered what might be calledabsolute discrimination. they had no right to hold property, nofreedom of contract, no freedom of movement, none of the political69 80 70 ABILITY TESTING OF HANDICAPPED PEOPLErights of 'citizenship (to yote, f) hold office, to serve on juries), noright to sue or to testify in court, no right to marry or establish afamily . The Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution and the ChilRights Acts of 1866 and 1870 extendedio former slases equal legalstanding with other citizens of their gender, as well as remedies atlaw to protect those rights. But the efficacy of such constitutional andstatuton protections was undel mined In the following decades by aproliferation of state and local laws and customs that, by the end ofAie nineteenth-century, had produced a segregated society in whichblacks Occupied a distinctly Inferior statuslegally, politically, eco-nomically, and socially (Woodward 1957).Beginning S1 ith the Supreme Court's 1954 landmark decision inBrown.Board of Education, the fedel al go\\ er nment mu\\ ed to oYerturnthe legacy of separate treatment by asserting federal rights to equaltreatment under the law, to w Inch local laws and customs would ha\\ eto conform. lhe statutory centerpiece of this initiatiYe w as the omnibusCivil Rights Act of 1964 (P.L. 88-352). In keeping with the task ofdismantling discriminatory legal barriers, the thrust of the act wasprolnbitory in character. it made It Illegal to discriminate amongpeople on the basis of \"race, wloi, religion, sex, or mnional origin\"(although not all sections of the act included all categories).Hie CRII Rights Act addressed fie major areas in which black'shad. by law or by ( ustom, suffered unequal and exclusionary treat-tnent.

In each area,,the act pi ohilnted the use of unlawful considerations, such as race orethnic oligin, on the assumption that equal treatment woukl substan-tially ameliorate the dhadYantaged \u00abmdition of blacks addition defining piohibited ti% ities, CiYil the for example, Which enumerated unlawfulemploy merit actk es, established the Equal Employment Opportu-nit% Commhsion (EWC) as one of the means of implemcknting itsoYisionsI itle VI, which prohibits exclusion \u00abdot , oi alational program or actiYity receiYingfedeial financial assistanc e (the prototype, along with Title IX of the For a molt dctaikd ditaksis. sec S1 igdor nd (1982) Context of Section 504 71Education Amendment1ct of 1972 Yshich prohibits suCh exclusionon the basis of sex. for.Secuo \"04 of the Rehabilitation Act), directedeach agency that disburses federal f unds to promulgate implementingregulations <md authorized specific compliance actisities, tncludingprocedures for terminating grants.

The Griggs Decision: Employment TestingThe judicial stafidards for applying Title VII to employment testingwere defingd by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1971 in Griggs v. DukePower Co. (401 U.S. 424). The Court -focused its attention on theconsequences of a selection process rather than on intent or motive.if tests are shown to have an exclusionary impact, den the inferencFfollows that discrimination has taken place,The analytical framework spelled out in Griggs Frits provided thegro'und rules for Title VII litigation (and has influenced judicialthinking in other spheres of civil' righr,,litigation asorell).

SinceGnggs, a significant body of precedent has made it clear that somesort of formal alidation study is necessary to justify the use of a testwhen a iystem selects disproportionately, with resulting atherseimpact on specified groups. This requirement for a demonstrationof technicalalidity has recently been asserted in a number of casesinvolving educational testing, specifically the use of intelligence testsfor the_placement of pupils in classes for the educable mentallyretardea, and the use of a minimum competency test as a criterionfor high school graduation.' A basic assumption underlying Gnggswas that, in an entirek neutral marketplace, people will be selectedfor employment in roughly the same proportion as they are repre-sented in the population. In Teamsters v . Umted States in 1977, theSupreme Court stated itexplicitly: \". ..absent explanation, it isordinarily to be expected that nondiscriminatory hiring practices willin time result in a work force more or less representatke of the racialand ethnic composition of the population in the community fromwhich employees are hired.\"The problem with that assumption is that it does not face squarelythe present reality of disathantage.

But as a number ofcommentators hae pointed out (Engebretson 1979, Ray 1979-80),Title VI and Title IX were accompanied by detailed Instructionsdesignating the implementing authorities, instructing them to issueregulations, outlining the compfiance procedures they were author-ized to use, and clarifying Congress position on a number ofsubstanthe issues that were bound to arise in the regulatory process.Section 504 was enacted without specific guidance as to how the lawwas to be Implemented and w ithout articulation of the remediesarailable to handicapped people who beliee they are the subjects ofdiscrimination. MoreoNer, the legislathe history of Section 504 wasN ery brief, establishing simply that Section 504 is a ciil rights statute,the primary purpose of w hich is to eliminate discrimination againstqualified handicapped people and 'to increase their opportunities toparticipate in and benefit from federally funded programs. Thus,the ban on discrimination against handicapped people became lawwithout any extensie elaboration of congressional purpose and intent.The law's sponsors attempted to remedy this situation during thepassage of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1974 (P.L. 93-516)by the means of writing a post hoc legislathe history. A report of theSenate Labor and Public Welfare Committee declared that Section504 was not just hortatory but was mandatory in form and thatCongress intended that implementing regulations and enforcementprocedures be put in place.17 The report a6 indicated that becausethe U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) hadexperience in dealing with handicapped people as well as enforcementexperience under Title VI and Title I X, the secretary of HEW shouldassume responsibility for coordinating the enforcement efforts of\\ '42 USC s 2000(1.0976). the clause reads \"No person in the United States shall, onthe ground of race. color. or national (Jrigin. be excluded from participation in, bedenied the henehts of, or be subjected to discrimination under an) program or activityreceiving Federal financial assistance20 L SC 5I6/4I1976) The clause reads. \"No person in the United States shall, onthe basis of sex, be excluded from participaticni in, be denied the benefits of, or b'esubjected to discrimination under any program ur activity receiving Ad News 6373, 6391 The Legal Context of Section 504 77departments and agencies af fected by Section 504. The administrativeresponsibility for enforcement of the act was not formally assignedto HEW. however, until 1976. when President Ford issued ExecutiveOrder 11914.'\" By this time the agency was also under court orderto issiie regulations within a specified period of time.'\" The provisionexplicit remedial section in the statute was not enacted untilthe 1978 Amendments to the Act. Section 505 made the \"remets,procedures, and rights set forth in Title VI of the Civil Rights Actof 1964- available to any person aggrieved under Section 504 of theRehabilitation Act.'\" At this same time, an attorney's fees provision,Section 505(b), and a provision establishing an Interagency Coordi-nating Council to promote implementation and enforcement ofSection 504 and regulations thereunder, Section 507, were added tothe act. ADMINISTRATIVE INTERPRETATION OF SECTION 504The HEW secretary, Caspar,.Weinberger, assigned responsibility forimplementing Sectio'n 504 to the Office for Civil Rights (OCR),probably because of that office's existing network of field offices andcompliance resolution procedures for implementing the related non-discrimination provisions of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.2' The finalregulations promulgated guidelines for ending discrimination on thebasis of handicap in five areas. (I) employment practices, (2) acces-sibility to physical facilities, (3) preschool, elementary, and secondaryeducation, (4) postsecondary education, and (5) health, welfare, andsocial services. The specific rules for compliance in each area wereinfluenced by a number of basic policy decisions about the coverageand meaning of.the statute.First, OCR's enforcement authority is limited to recipients of federalfinancial assistance, these recipients typically include public schools,public and private universities, and Aate agencies. (The 1978 amend-\\Fed Reg 17871'46herry y Mathew,. 119 F Supp 922 (D D C 1976) In Cherry, HEW maintained thatit had authority to issue regulations. and the onls dispute was how soon the agent swould issue the final regtilations11 L 95-602, s120(a), 92 Stat 2982 (1978)Atcording to Engebretson (1979 67), based on an intemew (Feb. 15, 1978) withJohn Wmlatch. acting bran( h thief, Handicapped Discrimination Branch, Office forCivil Rights.

On the,basis of its interpretation ofSection 304 as a ciVil rights mandate, OCR decided to include specificrules prohting employment discrimination by reCipients of federalfinancial assistance. It was encouraged in this interpretation by the\u00abniter en\u00ab. report accompanying the 1974 Amendments.22 The cor-fectness of this reading of the statute undoubtedly will have to bedetermined by the U.S Supreme Court, however, as a number ofrecent der isions in the Second, Founh, and mostnotably bagese,!Able Rehalnlaatwn Center, Inc.,2i have held thatSection 501 does not generally coy er employ ment discriminationagainst handicapped indiv iduals. The wurts have ruled that Section301 protects the handicapped against employment discriminationonly when the principal purpose of the federal funds received by theemployer is td pros ide employ ment.,Despite these decisions, OCRhas decided to enforce its interpretation (except in states in theSemnd, Fourth, an(l Eighth Circuits) until there is more definitivejudicial ruling on the matter (CRC Education and Human Develop-ment, Inc1981:113-116).Semnd, the protections of tercel by Section 504 are limited to\"qualified handicapped persons.\" Unlike Title VI, which protects allpeople f nnn disc imuna ion on the basis of race, \u00abAor ,and nationalorigin, Se( non 301 pi\u00ab ts only qualified handl( apped individualsfrom discrimination op the basis of handicap. This limitation pointsup an impoitant dissimilarity between Section 504 and other civilrights legislation. \"ale premise of the 196-1 Civil Rights Act was thatequal treatment would end racial discrimination, that distinctions H k ( onl Rep No 93-1457. 93(1 6The Eegal Context of Section 504 79based on tat e ar C arburars and t correlated %kith essential thf fer-cm esihe language Sec 1, on the whtrars nripliesindthe regtrkifii7assert. that oni'stfic se handicapped mdisiduals ss hoe apable of 'feat rung or per f or ming the essential functions of-a Jobssith reasonable at wirmiodation to ace handicap are the1.11Th 1110111 rlminatuni ssas one of the most dif iR tilt faced bs thechafters of the regulations 2' Lai Is crs 11 rights legislation., 15,15 based(al the assumption that disc !minimum meant unequal that equaltr catment racial and judicial interim etanon has tended tonimbi% the equal t I eminent dot t title in the du O. tffill of equal outcome,as sse rioted ab(ise)I he equal ti eat merit standard seemed es en lessappr opt late to the special cur cunistara es of people huh handicapsWail to ilisads drudged rumor ines Yet d dif feting treatment to achiese the goal of e(lu.4.1 he first (hal t of the iegulatuiris terok the position that, because fthe real dif lettuces in the situation of handicapped and nonhandi-t apped people, equal tic atment ssould not I equal opportunitsfor preamble madeleai foithI itleI andI ule IX is that then. ate no mhetent(hike em es oiinequalities between the general p(it)ht and the pet sonsotetthoststatutes, and, diet Hole, there slibuld be no (Id ferentneatment m the minimise 'anon of f \u00abtrial ploglains I lir \u00abnit ept of sei nontji(itliti Eat mine \u00abmiplex.

Thus, forexample, the basic policy regarding public education is for main-streaming of handicapped pupils. Yet the regulations recognize thatin some cases a handicap can be a legitimate grounds for exclusionfrom the regular education program. By providing due processprocedures and requiring an individualized education program forsuch a pupil, the grounds of decision will be the characteristks andeducational needs of the particular handkapped child and not assumptions about \"the blind\" or \"the deaf.\"Employment TestiniSection 84.13(a) of the regulations prohibits employers from usingtests or other selection criteria that scree out, or tend to screen out,handicapped people, unless two conditio s are-met. (J) the employercan show that the tests or criteria are job related and (2) the directorof the Office for Civil Rights is unable to ify alternative tests orcriteria that do not have a tendency to screen out handicappedapplicants. Section 84.13(b) further refines the -prOhibition by re-quiring an employer to consider whether a given test is actuallymeasuring a handicapped individual's impediment rather than theperson's aptitude or ability to perform a job. Appendix A of theregulations cites the example of a job applicant with a speechimpediment who is given an oral test. Unless the job in questionspecifically required oral communication skills, an employer couldnot justify the use of an oral aamination for such a handicappedperson. The purpose cif the provisions encompassed by Section 84.13'of the regulations is to prevent employers from excluding handi-capped people from their work force by using tests and othei selectioncriteria that, while appearing to be neutral screen.ing devices, in facthave the effect of disqualifying a disproportionate number of hand-icapped people when there is no reasonable business juStification for-using the particular test or criterion;i6 \"Unless (abet wise noted attributions follomng cliOassion ofthe testing subset tums of the regulations are based on the exposinon Ai the OCRHandbook 91al The Legal Context of Sectiim 504 81Because OCR ly as \u00abmeet ned that the small numbers of handicappedpeople would make it Yerydifficultto establish differential ordisproportionate impact statisticalk, the agency adopted a moresubjectke standard for triggering Section 84.13(a) enforcement.

SUMMARYf ale V of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 is a civil rights law, akin tothe othei iiii iights statutes passed in the 1960s and 1970s. It is not,however, an af hrmativ e statement of the civil rights of handicappedpeople, ather ,t pr ohibits disci iminatton against the gov ernment, its instrumentalities,and grantees. The protections offered under Title V do not.reach tothe private sector but only to recipients of federal funas.The antidiscrimination provisions of Section 504 are f urther re-stricted in scope in that they extend only to qualified handicappedmdiv Kluals. This pi ov ision is different f rom those of all other civilrights statutes, which extend pr otection to all members of the coveredclass.1 he language of Section 50t, as well as Qongress\" failure in theperiod since 19,64 to enact legislation adding discrimination on thebasis i)f handicap to the categories protected against employmentdiscriminatum by 1 itle VII, suggests that Congress intended todistinguish between c haracteristics like race or ethnic origin andhav ing a-hand kappliag condition. Regulatory and judkial constructionof Section 504 have recognized that a handicapping condition can,unde,r some circumstances, be a legitimate grounds for exclusion ,Andthat distint tions drawn on the basis of handicap do not necessarilyreflect prejudiced altitudes. (In future litigation, this may hAeimplications for judicial interpretation of the ef fects test propoundedby the regulations.)'At the same time, Congi essaiid the courts recognize that distinctionsdrawn on the bagis of handicap f r equently are the product of prejudice 0 4 94 ABILITY TESTING OF HANDICAPPED PEOPLEor unssarranted assumptions about the limitations produced byhandicapping conditions.

This policy has brouptsignificant diange. Under Section 504 and the Education for AllHandicapped Children Act, all duldi en ssith handicapping wnditionsare for the fast time guaianteed an appropriate education at publicexpense in the most integrated setting possible. The due processprocedures that are the centerpieces of P.L. 94-142 and the Section504 regulations seek to ensure that educational decisions ssill be madeon the basis of the particular child's ,needs, not on the basis ofunfounded assumptions about the child's pqrformance capabilities.Fhe meaning of equal opportunity for ;idults seekingjobs or highereducation is not y et...as dear as the policy concerni-ng schovl children,but some general principles hase been established.

With one possible exception, all of thealternate media used to administer tests to Nisuatly impaired peoplerequire more time than the regular form. Reading braille and usinga cassette recorder or a reader take longer than reading regularprint. Reading large type may or may not be more time-consuming,depending on .the layout of the material and on the nature and-severity,of the impairment. It should be noted that the Law SchoolAdmission Test allolr.s no extra time for any exaIninee, a practicethat,may have paix<'Ltlarly severe effects on Nisually impaired exam-inees.In setting time limits for a test for the general population, testdevelopers usually establish a limit within which 75 to 90 percent ofthe candidates can complete all of the items (see Tinkleman 1971,Toops 1960). Such a procedure could be duplicated for handicappedtest takers orsfor different test modifications, although a.large numberof trials would be necessary. To obtain such data for a large national'testing program, one would hay e.to.aggregate examinees over manyfest administrations in many different locations.Only a few studies of the time needed by handicapped individualsto ,complele a modified test are available. For tests for which nostudies have been conducted, time limits are either set arbitrarily(usually as a multiple of the standard time) or waived altogether.Studies of the appropriate time limits for modified tests have beenundertaken by the U. S. Office of Personnel Management (Nesterand Sapinkopf 1981, Sapinkopf 1978). In one study, deaf studentsfirst took the Professional and Administrative Career Examination(PACE) wish unlimited time. Then the investigators determined theamount of time needed for 90 percent of.the test takers to completeeiich part of the test. Similar procedures w ere eit ploy ed in establishingtime limits for N is u a Ily handicapped individuals. Tithe limits wereestablished separately for each combination of test part and meaiumof test administration. The results of these studies specifying a timelimit foi- each test part and each medium of test administration, (e.g.,braille) or combination of media (e.g., braille and reader) weresubsequently inwrporated into instructions for test examiners forregular use in administering the test to handicapped people.Speed tests' usually are considered inappropriate for test takers diflererues ui swres on a pure speed test depend only on speed ofresponse.

Recentls, howeser, questions hase arisen as to whatextent power tests are actualls speeded, and concern has beenexpressed that speededness might dif ferentially affect the takers (Donlon 1980a, Donlon 19804 If itwere found that the pow er -tests are more speeded for nonhandi-capped examinees than pre% lously thought, there would be reasontir question the wisdom (or fairness) of setting time limits forhandicapped examinees (particularly those with sisual impairments)as a multiple of the time allowed ful tytandard administration, say2 or 2',2 times the regular time limit. gich an allowance may producea test that is still speeded for handicapped people and penalizes themunnecessarily. Such a procedure also piesumes for example, that, theratio of ihe speed of reading braille sersus print isfhe same for alltypes of material and all lesels of difficulty commonly occurring on'standardized tests (see Nolan 1962).A studs of nonhandicapped students by Wild and Durso (1979)showed that increasing the time allwwed for experimental sections ofthGraduate.Re.cord Examination (GRE) from 20 to 30 minutesresulted in small but.statistically significant score increases. The sizesof the increases were not significantly different for groups definedby ethnicity, age,and sex. Although handicapped test rakers were'not included in the study , the results are important for that groupbecause they suggest that scores on these experimental subtests ofthe GRE, deseloped just like the nonexperimental or \"operational\"subtests, are significantly affected by speed of response. Thus, onemight predict that gis mg test takers a generous di- an unlimitedamount of, ume would significantly increase their scores. The limitingfac tor of fatigiie would, of course, has c to be:considered if one Ello.sedfrom considering a 10-minute.mcrease (as in the Wild and Dursostudy) to considering a seseral-hour increase (as often occurs inpractice). The effects of time limits on psychometric properties oftests other than mean srores (especially reliability and salidity) mustalso be considered.Lengthening the time for administration of a test is only one of 112-34r 102 ABILITY TESTING OF HANDICAPPED PEOPLEseYeral waYs in which the testing time for examinees can be altered.Taking more rest periods while holding constant the total length ofume for actually taking the test is one such change. Another is a .combination of lengthening the test administration time and,includingmore rest periods. Still ,mother is allowing not only a longer timeperiod in which to take a test but also more than one day . Obviously,an unlimited tune period during a single day regardless of the timeIultimately allowed would not benefit a disabled indiyidual whobecomes fatigued in a relatiy el% short period. Considering the negatiy eeffects of fatigue, extending time limits well beyond those thoughtto be defensible for nonhandicapped examinees may ri u t unApectedand unreasonablcdemands on handicapped examinees.Although modinntions in the time allowed for tests are considew.e.41.-4among the appropriate test options, there are fess, data aYailable tosuppoit any wnclusions about' thel effects of sittings, (rt, number of recesses on the test results. Fur-,thermore, little is knOWn abouAgly much time people with yariousholdfrapping conditions aCtually need, because records of timeacnially used are rare, and empiriral studies to set time limits areeyen less frequerit. Clearly, mote research on time limits for testmodifications and for different handicapping conditions is necessary. ,i. dr.4 Changes in Test Content J , '.Changes in test content cif e often required for exantlees with yisualor hearing impairments. For Yisually impaired people, items must beexamined for possible \"yisual biases.\" Test items contain a Yisual biasifthey measpre knowledge, skills, or concepts learned primatrilythrough Yision if they use Yisual stimuli to measure' kni?..sy ledgeacquired through othen--senses. Although either ty pe of Y il bias. mity lie detected empirically, the second type maywell be easi .i. thanthe former to identify and correct by simPly reading th items,spotting the offenders, and substituting nom, isual stimuli. Sincv thesubstitutions may alter other characteristics of the items, the modifieditems should be tried (Mt before they are used in operational testing...s.ituations. Visual biases of the first type may be more difficult toidentify and remedx, especially by test deYelopers who are unfamiliarwith yisual impairments. Examples of information acquired primarilythrough %won would include questions relating to geology, meteor-ology, geography, architecture, or geometry or items requiring dis-crimination of relationships Along Colors or spatial features./ 1 he most thorough and detailed documentation of modifications 113 Psychometric Requirements of the Regulations 103intest content is that done on the PACE, administered by the Officeof Personnel Management for federal employment. The contenrofthe PACE has been hiodified for yisually and hearing-impairedexaminees. For the y isually impaired, two item t pes Yy ere deletedfigure analogies tabular umipletionbecause a suitable methodof the \u00abmtent wuld not be found. Other items werereyiewed by panels of experh to identify those with yisual biases.Scoring norms were established by administering the modified itemsto sighted PACE examinees (see Nester 1980, Sapinkopf 1978). Changes in the Testing EnvironmentM'ans of the modifications in the waYs in which tests are administeredfor handicapped people necessitate that the tests be gken indiyiduallyrather than to groups of respondents. The reasons for haying anindiyidtial administration include the existence of no pr...tical andcornenient way to use a group administration, the desire not tointerfere with other; in a group taking a test, and other considerationsfor handicapped examinees, such as wanting to reduce tfieir anxiety,iner the test. Although the administration of a test on an indiyidualbasis is probably the most important modtfication in the testingenyironment needed by landicapped examinees, there are someadditional alterations that may be required. For example, a changein location will be required if the seandard testing sit& is not accessible\\to people in sy heelchairs. Examinees with certain physical disabilities,\\-\\ maYbe ruorecomfortable Is ith tables or chairs unlike the usual ones,,for example, tabletops may need to be bigger or at a different height.Certain lighting conditions may make reading easier for the partiallysighted. Soyetimes a test ma), be administered to a person confinedto bed, saya yictim of an automobile accident.The administration of a test to one individual may differ inimportant ways from the standard group administration. The inter-action betweerr.the exaMiner and The examinee may haye on tbe resu ting score. Ragosta (1980)studied such interaction and, while she reported many fayorablereactions of test takers to test administrat ,rs, she also recorded someproblems, some of 'which seemed to stem from inexperience, igno-rance, or bias on the part of the test administrator. Some examplesa negative comments follow (Ragosta 1980:35-36): -1 he teat her (test a(Iministiator) was uncomfortable with my disability Hekept asking me questions like .did I know what I was there for and did 11 4 104 ABILITY TESTING OF HANDICAPPED PEOPLEI realize the miportance of the test, etc. I felt he was questioning my mentalability jcvebril palsied student).I fought to take SATs. They said there was no large print versipn! A guidapcecounselor gave the test to me orally, , she was aggrasated when I had to askher to repeat.

Tape recorders might be okay [legally blind student].When a test administrator walks around, It is bard to hear what he is saying.I try ... then I read directions again. I lose ume [hearing-unpaired styclent]7.7At present, there are no comprehensive data on the seriousness orpervasiveness of such difficulties. The problems cited above probablydeflate the test scores or handicapped people, but without systematicstudies there is no way to know the nature and extent of the effects.There are also no data on cases in which test administrators,.inten-tionally or not, give cues to correct answers or otherwise helphandicapped examinees. The Option of Not Taking a Test , One alternative to modifying a test is to exempt handicapped peoplefrom taking the test. When a testing requirement is waived, biograph-ical data, work samples, academic transcripts, and other evidenceusually provide a basis on which a candidate's record can be evaluated.Handicapped people, however, particularly those with visual impair-ments, have argued that exempting them from taking a test placesthem at a disadvantage compared with other applicants (NationalFederation of the Blind 1980).4 'Costs of Modifying TestsSince the regulations implementing Section 504 require that tests beappropriately modified for handicapped people, questions of the 'Clearly, there are differences of opinion, but most who expressed their views to thepanel wanted to improve tests, not to waive them. Nexertheless, in some situations thewaiver of a testing requirement may be thefairest and most appropriate action Itshouldbe notel, however, that, for the general population, alternatives to tests, suchas those listed above, generally have considerably lower reliability and validity thantests themselves. '1151 Rsychometric Requirements of the Regulations 105costs of such modifications naturally arise. Some test producers protestthat the costs are too high. There is no comprehensive informationavailable on this issue, but we present some general estimates of thecosts. We note that an appropriate ev aluation of the total costs of testmodification would require data on the costs of all types of modifi-cation for all of the tests used in employ ment and educational testingIn this sesion we present only a sketch of such a Lilculation foreducational testing. The cost figures cited in this section were obtainedfrom a private testing organization. .i Before proceeding we note two difficulties n calculating costsFirst, the expenditures invohed in modifying tests represent the truesocial costs (as typically defined by economists) only if the prices ofresources used in test modification adequately reflect their value inalternative uses. Prices witl not be accurate reflections of value whenmarkets are not perfectly competitive, and it appears, at least super-ficially, that the testing industry is not competitive. The number oftesting firms is relativ ely small and the consumers of tests, at least inthe educational segment of the industry, , are organizationally linkedto the producers. The observed data on costs are, therefore, a proxywhose true relationship to social costs is not defined. This caveatapplies to all observed costs on testing and not just to the data thatwe present. The second difficulty in calculating. costs lies in deter-mining how much of the costs of modifying tests is attributable tochanges required to eliminate test bias relating to handicappingconditions. Consider, for example, a situation in which a printed testis translated into braille. Should one count the expenditures forproducing braille tests and of producing and reporting scores as thecost of the modification? Or is it more appropriate to define the costof modification as the difference between the braille-related costs andthose that would have been incurred to test the same number ofindividuals using standard tests? Either basis of cost calculation couldbe appropriate depending on the situation. Changes in ContentChanges in content are required whgfi-the substance of a test questiorirelates to information or concepts that certain people cannot expe-rience or perceive because of a handicap. The content of educationaladMissions tests, howelrer, is most often not modified for handicappedpeople. Experts review existing standard test forms and choose formodification those with the least potential for bias. No cost estimatesare available. 116 0 106 Changes in MediumCommonly as ailable modifications of admissions tests include far ge-t) pe, braille, and cassette Yersions. In 1979-80 the production ofbraille forms of a %idely used test cost roughly $6,800 for 30 copies,or an aYerage cost per test taker of $22(Lliassette Yersions of the testcost $5,600 for 100 copies, or an aYerage cost per test taker of $56.The cost for 200 copies of a large-print %as that portion- of the expenditures ar_e fixedrather than Nariable costs. The total cost of the large-print Nersion.islikely to be approximately constant oYer a %ide range of quantities,since the c44st of preparing copy and printing plates is independentof the number of copies produced from those plates. The aYerage scosti figures, therefore, are extremely sensitke to ihe quantity of testinitruments produced.ABILITY TESTING OP HANDICAPPED PEOPLE 4Changes in Test AdnurnstrationThe primary costs' incui red in modifying test administration proce-dures are the %ages paid to test center superb isors and proctors. Itwas estimated that in1979-80, the slyer% ision tests for 500handicapped people cost $27,000, 01 an ayerage cost of $54 per testtaker. Of t.his group, 314 took standard versions of the test.The costs of modify ing the testing enyironment are, at least interms of current practices, plimarily Nariable in nature. In addition.the Ilea% y relance on thj-use of personnel and time indkates thatkthe potential economies of an increase in the number of testsadministered is quite's'thall. One %mild expect, ther Yary rather directly uith nunibei .of tests adminis-tered and that the abet age total cost per test %ill be approximatelyconstant over the number of tests administered. Administrative Co'stsSome test modifications requir e alterations in the method of producingand reporting test scores. In addition, there are a Yariety of clericalprocedUres required for the processing of applications for modifiedtests. In the aboye example, the costs of producing scores from' the186 modified tests totaled $1t400, ay An additipnal $15,600 was reported 4Is the sum of the cost ofck-rical procedures relating to test registration and score reporting 11 7 A Psychometric Requirements of the Regulations 107.($11,000) and of the cost of colltt.ting, shipping. and checking testmaterials ($4,600). The clerical costs were computed_ from the ac-counting cost of a special clerical section whose entire, function isprocessing materials for handicapped test takers. Finally there wereadministrative expenditures fot pre-test information booklcts inprinted and braille form, information modified tests, andthe costs of \"program management.\" The ,suin oi these 'costs was$22,200, approximately 55 percent of these costs were for manage-ment. The sum of clerical and other administrative costs, therefore,was $37,800, or approximately $76 per person.Hence, for this test in 1979-80, the average total cost of modificationsfor handicapping conditions, including all of those mentioned above,was $156 per person, ranging from $130 to $364 per persondepending on the type of test modification. MEASURES OF ABILITIES INDEPENDENT OF HANDICAPSThe regulations directly state that tests should measure a handicappedperson's level of aptitude or achievement and not the impairedfunctioning unless the latter is what the test purports to measure.This is equivalent to saying that a handicapping condition shouldhave no effect whatsoever on test scores unless the test is explicitlydesigned to meastability directly related to the handicap. Inaddition, an \"Analysis of the al Regulation,\" w hich was publishedas an appendix to the final regulations, includes the followingstateinent (42: Fed. Reg. 22692): .Sectio84.12(b)(3) also requites a recipient-try assure itself that admissionstests are selected and administered to applicants with imparted sensory,manual, or speaking skills in such manner as is necessary to &AM unfairdistortion of test results. Methods hate been deteloped for testing theaptitude and achievenent of persons who are not able to take written testsor et en to make the mai ks required for mechanically scored objectite tests,in addition, methods fot testing persons with usual or hearing impairmentare tRailable. A recipient, under this paragraph, must assure itself that suchmethod's are used with respect to the selection and administration of antadmissions tests that it uses.This explanation ,logically rests on the assumption that the use ofmodified tests am) test administration procedures is in itselisufficientto ensure that a test will, reflect abilities that are unaffected by anexaminee's handicap. \"Fhis assumption is not true, the panel, alongwith othets who are knowledgeable about test development, rejectsIt as a reasonable or safe working assumption. 11 8 108 ABILITY TESTING OF HANDICAPPED PEOPLEAlthough the goal of constructing measures that are unaffected bya handicapping condition is generally accepted as the ideal, most testdevelopers believe that it is largely unattainable in the near future inmany if not most Instances. Clearly, there are cases in ,which ahandicapping condition has almOst no effect on test performanceand, therefore, modifications of the test are not needed. There arealso cases in which the modifications that are needed are so straight-forvvard that they can safely be assumed to have no effect on the testscores. However, especially vv hen a handicap is severe and when atest requires high-level _cognitive functioning, the effects of thehandicap on the test are potentially enormous and extremely difficultif not impossible to eradicate.In its identification of points in the regulations that the panelbeliexes cannot be supported by current scientific endeavor, the Panelhas identified points in psyChometric theory that need further de-velopmen,t. No test scorefor handicapped or nonhandicappedexamineesis a totally pure measure of an ability. . Every test score isdistorted in some way Ey en much of our language regarding testsreveals this phenomenon. test scores reflect, they indicate, theyrepresent. Tests give only indirect pictures of what it is they claim tomeasure. All measuresphysical as well as psychologicalare affectedin one way or another by the measuring instrument. Psychometricianscall this inevitable inaccuracy \"measurement error\" and estimate it,Inthe process of developing a test. For example, a test of reading abilityvvill be easier for a student who just hapfiens to be interested in andfamiliar vvith the subjects in the reading passages. Yet the student'sknovv ledge of those particular subjects has nothing directly to do withhis or her reading ability and ideally should not affect scort* on thereading test. The estimated measurement error will take into accountthis and many other (usually unknown) sot;Kces of random error in , test scores.Consider another example closer to the panel's. focus. Sup,pose thata group of deaf people is given a test containing passages on Americanhistory that are vvritten with a more sophisticated vocabnlary andmore complicated syntax thantrequired to express the importantideas. For the deaf test takers the test might be a legitimate measureof linguistic fluency in the context of American history, but it is nota suitable measure of knowledge of American history. The well;documented linguistic deficit of deaf people, particularly the prelin-gually deaf, ould prey ent,them from accurately displaying theirknowledge of American history unless the language of the test weresimplified. For the deaf examinees in this example, the error in the Psychometric Requirements of the Regulations 109scores taken as measures of knowledge of American history is likelyto be much larger than it would be for nonhandicapved test takers.Some of the error would be random but much would probably besystematicand it would lower the seores of the dearpeople. Addi-tonally,, the usual estimatesof measurement error do not reflect thisor other systematic errors.Domain-referenced testang provides an example that focuses ourattention on the ability that a test is claimed to measure. The initialstep in constructing a domain-referenced test is to define the domain,first generally, and then in terms of more specific skills or knowledge.(Even this first step is someWhat arbitrary; experts might definedomains rather differently.) The next step is to decide how to measurethe different skills, what content .to include, what levels of lifficultyto cover, and how to weight each componerivin-the test. Then theitems are written and refined, psychometric properties of the test aredetermined, and the test is ready to be administered.Suppose that the finished product is packaged and sold as theAcme Test of Reasoning Ability. The title hardly 'begins to descAbewhat the test measures. There are many tests of reasoning ability,arul,they all differ from one another in more or less significant ways.Users of the test would have to delve deeply in the literature(presumably published with the test) on how various concepts weredefined, how measures were developed, and what characterized thesample,s,, of examinees on whom the test was tried out. Only thenwould the users begin to understand what scores on the Acme Testof Reasoning Ability actually reflect. Furthermore, the meaning(s)the users attach to scores on-the test might change and would almostcertainly be enriched with increased familiarity both with the test andwith how people with various scores perform in other situations.Some of the users knowledge would be specific to that test, and somewould have derived from experience about-that general type of testa paper-and-pencil, multiple-choice, timed test of reasoning ability.Measurement issues, already difficult, become much more compli-cated when the test or the test administration procedures are modifiedfor use with handicapped people. To carry the example further,suppose the test is modified so that it can be given to visually impairedexaminees, and assume that the modifications have been expertlyexecuted and that the resulting test is the best that could be devisedfor the visually impaired. The quality of the modifications notwith-standing, the test users are at a loss as to how to interpret the scores.There are no standards against which to evaluate the scores of thevisually impaired. And much of what the users would haye learned 12 \u00fc 110 ABILITY TESTING OF HANDICAPPED PEOPLEabout the Acme 'lest must be questioned.,Are all of the same subtestsused? How heavy was the v isual loading pf the original test; tiowmuch has the content beeh changed? Are the same cognitive processesused by visually impaired people in answering the test questions? Arethe same cognitive processes required of v isually impaired people inother situations of interest? Does performance on the test bear thesame relationship to othel .performance for sighted as for visuallyimpaired people? The list of questions is long and has implicationsfar beyond testing. All that is known about perception and cognitioncould and should be brought to bear.In summary, , the panel believes that psycholpgy and psychometricsare not yet fully capable of ensuring that tests fox handicapped peoplemeasure skills independent of handicapping conditions. The require-ment ihat they do so, though straightforward in intent, poses seriousproblems for psychologists who attempt to define various abilities,,tomeasure those abilities, and to describe the under!) ing cognitiveprocesses. In short, the panel heliev es that demonstrating that testscan provide measures of abilities independent of, ,handicappingconditions should be regarded as a long-term research goal. Thepanel believes that full compliance with this requirement is notcurrently possible, how ey er, compliance with other psychometricrequirements of the regulations are not only possible but will lead to/ tests for handicapped people,that cap he used faiily and intelligentlyas predictors of later performance. VALIDATION OF TESTS FOR HANDICAPPED PEOPLEEducational TestingThe Section 504 regulations require thdt a test that has .; dispropor-tionately adverse effect on handicapped people be validated for thepurpose in question..005reclude using that test if a test with lessadverse effect is shown to exist. The regulations further require thatpostsecondary educational admissions tests be validated against first-year grades inthe educationarprogram and that studies be conductedperiodically against the criterion of overall success in the program.1 bus, the regulations very clearly emphasize the importance ofdemonstrating the v alidity of tests that are used for handicappedpeople.Strictly speaking, one should always refer to the validity of aparticular use of a test. It is the use and not the test itself that hasvalidity. Validity is not an either/or attribute of use of a test: it exists PsYchometric Requirements of the Regulations 111%arying (tepees in %aims situations.

Other predictors, such as variables representing,extracurricular activities, can be added to the 'regression equStion; ingeneral, however, the best' predictors have been found to be grade-point averages and admissions test scores (Skager 1982).Neither testing companies nor colleges and universities have rou-tinely conducted either kind ot validation study, either against thecriterima4i.first-year grades or against the criterion of success in the,program. The testing companies have argued since the drafting ofthe Section 504 regulations that analogous studies could not beconducted for handkapped students because of the small numb9sofssuch students. Recently, however, research methods that have beendeyekped to study other relatively small groups are being Used insmall studies of handicapped examinees. The -research staff at theEducatiorial Testing Service has developed and tote methods ofpooling data,across institutions or yeats in order to increase thenumbers of minority group members to a level sufficient for statistiralstudy (Braun and Jones 1980, Dempster et al. 1980, and Rubin 1980):T1;ey currently are conducting two studiesone of deaf students atthe California State University at Northridge, and one of learning-disabled students at Curry College in Massachusettsand are aggre-gating the data across several years. Such efforts indicate thatvalidation studies of tests for handicapped people are possible, atleast in snme.5ettings. The panel looks with optimism on the possibilityof pooling data for graups of handicapped students across years andacross similar institutions, say, small liberal arts colleges or large stateuniversities._EmPloyment Testing . fUnfortunately, there is much le'ss hope of applying similar techniqussin employment testing of handicapped people. The largest employ-ment testing program in the country is operated by the Office ofPersonnel Management using the Professional and AdministrativeCareer Examination. Since 1975, when Modified versions of the PACEwere first made available,approximately 300 blin4 and 100 deaf$ people have taken the exam each year (this compares witti 100,000to 150,000 nonhandicappedpeople per year). OPM has no data onthe number of handicapped candidates who are employed, bothbecause their PACE scores are not flagged and because handicapped4,1,23:40P Psychometric Requirements of the Regulationi 113-candidates are nutidenthedon the register of ^candidates. However,-since the PACE covers 118 federal civil service jobs, it is unlikely thatthere would be enough handicapped people in. any giv'en job toconduct alidation studies, even if per;ple with certain disabilities tendto be in relatively few .of the 118 occupations. As,an indicator of thenumber of deaf people in jobs filled through the PACE, OPM searchedthe central registry of Schedule A (exempted) appointments andfound 11 deaf people ig-PACE jobs in 1974 in the entire country(Unfortunately for ou'r purposes-, that central registry has beendiscontinued.) If OPM does not have what could safely be considereda large testing program for handicapped people, there is almostcertainly no other employ ment testing program for handicappedpeople that could be considered larse. In addition, because of thewide variability of jobseven those that require similar training orseem similar along other dimensionsthe problems of pooling jobsfor the purpose of validating selection tests are likely to be moresevere than in educational settings. Therefore, there i$ little hope ofamassing solid validity data for employ ment tests of handicapped.people exceptin rare cases. Nevertheless, the panel dues not despairof collecting information that will improve_employ ment testing of4iandicapped people. We see several promising ways of gatheringuseful data.The first would be analogous, and as similar as possible, to themethods of performing multijurisdictional validity _studies of em-ploy ment tests in the general population. The principle is endorsedin the Uniform Guidelines for Employee. Selection Procedures (EqualEmployment Opportunity Commission 1978). Highly similar jobs indifferent places (different businesses or industries or different loca-tions) are pooled for the purpose of validating the single employmenttest used to select em'ployees for all of the jobs. The procedurerequireertation among many parties but offers an otherwisenonexistent possibility of validating tests. Of course, care must betaken to ensure the closest possible similarity among situations.A second possible way of collecting usefUl data would be similar toa study being undertaken jointly by OPM and the RehabilitationResearch and Training Center at George Washington University.- The study began with theidentifilation of handicapped employeesthroughout the country and the description of accdmmodations thathave been made for them. The study will include a job analysis ofthe positions held by handicapped employees, a sumnery of howwell the employees are performing, and how they were selected foremplo.yment. Thus, in a general sense, one component of the study \\ .411.0124 114 ABILITY TESTING OF HANDICAPPED PEOPLE .is a validity stud) -of the employee selection procedures used for,handicapped people using.the criterion of performance on the job. COMPARABILITY OF TESTS FOR HANDICAPPED ANDNONHANDICAPPED PEOPLEThe prohibition of preadmission inquiries regarding a handicappingcondition, iv hich was added to the regulations follow ing the periodof comment, had ramifications that doubtless. far exceeded theexpectations of the drafters of the prov ision. This reqUirementprohibited the usual practice of the testing companies of noting onthe score reports to educational institutionS that a score resulted froma nonstandard test administration. In most cases, this \"flagging\" isequivalent to identifying the examinee as handicapped. The aban-donment of the practice of flagging was clearly iv hat the drafters hadintended because many handicapped people felt that the involuntarydisclogire of the fact that they are handicapped' was not only aviolation of their rights to privacy but an impediment to theiropportunity to be considered equally for admission to postsecondaryeducational i,nstitutioils.These considerations nom itIstanding, the solution to the problemwas not a simple removal of the designation of nonstandard admin-'istration on score reports. The testing companies argued that theymust be allowed to continue to flag scores resulting from n9nstandardadministrations. to remove the flag would imply that scores from themodified tests were equiv alent to, in fact, indistinguishable from,scores on the standard fornis. Yet handicapped examinees' scoTeshave not been shim n to be comparable in any sense to those ofnontlandicapped people. Hence, universally removing the flags wouldin many cases work'to the disadvantage of handicapped examinees.In this section we propose that the establishment of a relationbetween scores from modified tests and the kind of performance inschool or employ ment that serves as the kalidity criterion for standardtests can, in effect, serve to define comparability /of test scores onmodified and standard fUtrns. Although this concept dertVrs--instraightforward manner from basic psychrometric theory, its appli-cationis,rather surprisingly, a flovel approach to the practicalproblems of establishing comparability. If all test modifications re-quired by handicapped people could be shown to be strictly compa-rable with standard tests through traditional equating procedures,then there would be no need for special considerations that attendsuch modrfications. The panel, however, is cony inced that traditional 125 Psychometric Requirements of the Regulations 115approaches cannot be applied to establish comparability of standardand modified forms in all respects, especially Yy ith regard to underly ingabilities. For this reason yye are willing to turn away from acceptedprocedures and ady mate an innoYatiYe aRproach that has not, to thebest .of our knowledge, been tried on i large scale in operatingprograms.When testing companies introduce a new form of an existing test,they use a procedure called -equating\" to ensure that the new, formwill produce scores that can be considered the same as scores onexisting forms ofxthe test. Equating is a technical term that describesa process of calibrking two or more alternate forms of the same testthat measure the same abilities and are used on the same populationof test takers. As Angoff (1971:562-563) notes:With equatingproperls executed it becomes possible to measure growth, tocharl trends, and to metge data es en when the separate pieces of data densefrom different forms of iaest kth somewhat different item characteristics.It also becomeS possiblP0 compare directly the performances of twoindisiduals who has e taken dif ferent forms of a test. In a high-premiumselection program, for example for college admissions or for scholarshipawards, it is espeualls important fin reasons of quit, alone that no applicantbe gis en special ads antage or.disadsantage because pf the fortuitour admin-istration of a or difficult form of the test.Successful equating lends constancy of meaning to test scores, mertime and across applicant groups.Because such equating kis been the usual meansmf establishingamparabilit} among forms of a test, it is the definition of compar-abifity that test producers hake understood the regulations to re'quire.During formal cornment on the proposed and draft regulations, the}protested the impossibility of complying with such a requirement.One impediment to equating test scores resulting from standard andnonstandard administrations is the largely uncharted ef fect of sari-ation in the mode,of test admimstratkm. Psychdmetricians simply donot now ,know precisely how, scores are affected by translation of apaper-and-pencil test for oral or tactile presentation or by remoYalof a time limit. In other words,lest producers argued that there isirssufficient reason to beliee that a standard test and its modifiedcounterpart can be considered the same test.Furthermore, modifications in the medium in which a test isadministered haYe unknown ef fects on the cognitiye processes calledon by the Yarious types of test questions. Such effects are extremelydifficult if not impossible Co me;iltlie empirically. Deleting certain 126 i.116 ABILITY TESTING OF HANDICAPPED PEOPLEtypes of items from a testfor example, removing cartographyquestions from orally administered testsfurther increases doubtregarding the similarity of a standard and modified test forms It 'is,therefore, not clear that the same abilities are being measured.Finally, because the present strengths of psychometrics are moreempirical than theoretical, relativ ely little is understood about themental processes underlying test-taking behavior or the specificdeficits or the special skills developed by people with handicaps as aregult of their v isual, aural, or motor impairments. In addition, thetechniques most commonly used to equate test forms 'require that thesame population of examinees take at least portions of all forms ofthe test. When dealing with a population as heterogeneous andnecessitating as luany special adaptations as handicapped people, this ..seems almost Impossible. In general, then, the test developer cannotconsider the handicapped and nonhandicapped populations to bethe same in the sense assumed by the technology of equating.,' For these reasons, test producers concluded that, despite the policyof the Office for Civil Rights, modified tests could not be consideredto produce scores that are strictly equivalent to thosevroduced bystandard administrations. After careful consideration of the matter,the panel agrees that itis not now possible to equate tests forhandicapped and nonhandicapped people.There is, however, akcond and slighily less restrictive psychometricconcept that should be considered iri attempts to align more closelytest scores for handicapped 'and nonhandicapped people: ihe pro-duction of \"comparable\" (in this sense, technical term) scores. Wequote again from Angoff (1971:590): .-.,Unlike the problem ofequivalentscores, which is restricted to the case ofparallel forms of a test, that is to tests of the same psychological function,the problem ofcomparablescores may be thought of quite simply as theproblems of \"equating\" testsof differentpsychologicalfunctions. Ordinarily,two testsare considered to have been made comparablewith respect to a .particular group of examineesif their distributions Of scores are identical[emphasis in the original].As Indicated in Angoff's definition, scor es. usually can be Eonsideredcomparable only for a specific population taking the test underspecific conditions. Comparability can be extended to other groupsbut only-if they are highly similar7.with respect to the abilities beingmeasured, to the group on which the comparability was established.The most common procedures for deriving comparability require 12 7 Psychometric Requirements of the Regulations 117that the tests be administered to a reference group and that the scoresof each test be scaled to have equal means and standard deviations.Obvious ls, because of the modifications of tests necessary for hand-icapped people, not Al modified forms could be administered to thesame group. Eve iiif a way vvere found to do this, the resultingcomparability could not' be extended to cover the heterogeneousgroups on, andicapped peoplew ho would eventually take the tests.Thus, the standard technical concept of comparability does notprovide a feasible means of establishing the correspondence betweenstandard test forms and those modified for handicapped people.There is another approach to comparability, however, that is morelikely to be attainable if there is full cooperation of test users, testtakers, and compliance authorities. The panel considers predictb,evalidity to offer the greatest promise in the relatisely large testingprograms under iris estigation. (Small testing programs, particularlyemploy ment testing, present special problems.) In tpis approach, thegoal is to make tests for handicapped and nonhandicapped applicantspredict equally well the performance of interest. Although the contentof tests modified for handicapped people is kepi as similar as possibleto that for nonhandicapped people, there is no attempt to make thetest scores mean exactly the same thing in terms of the abilities beingmeasured. This proposal is discussed more fully in Chapter 6, asforms. the_basis for the panel's major policy recommendations, butits psychometric features are discussed here.Predictive validity giv es an estimate of the strength of the associationbetween test scores and a measitre of performance on the criterionto be predicted. In college admissions, SAT or ACT scores (usuallyin conjunction with high school grades) are used to pkedict first-yearcollege grades. The prediction equation isuseful in statisticallypredicting from test scores and high school grades how well collegeapplicants are expected to perform in the freshman year of college,based on experience with many previous applicants. Colleges anduniversities ty pically participate in validation studi s performed bythe testing companies and rel,iew the results of th dies for theirown campuses. Thus, over time, admissions o ers accumulateknowledge, based on ernpirical experience at their schools, about the.meaning and predictie significance of test scores and patterns ofscores and grades. The predicthe validation technique works fairlywell for the general population, althou-gh there are always individualdeiations (some of them large), and suspicion occasionally arises thatthe particular interpretation of test scores is inappropriate for ans.128 118 ABILITY TESTING OF HANDICAPPED PEOPLEentire group of applicantsin our case, peoele with handicappingconditions. In that instance, more refined studies of the special groupare in order.The panel believes there is sufficient reason to posit the predictivevalidity approach to defining comparability as the most fruitful pathtoward a reasonable solution to the current problems in testinghandicapped people. The first step in the proposed plan is researchto answer questions of w hether the approach, which is technicallypossible, will y ield satisfactory score transformations and, secondly, ,whether the prediction equations will be sufficiently accurate. Put,hiother 11,11, the basic question is whether, with existing scores, oneprediction equation is suitable for all students, including studentswith a specific handicap taking a particular modified form of a test.If not, the question becomes one of w hat adjustments in the predictionequations are needed for the handicapped people, and whether theadjustments can be accomplished by a transformation of the scorescale for the modified test forms. Answers to these queries can beobtained through empirical investigation. Furthermore, the necessarydata already exist; they need to be compiled and analyzed. Thestudies necessary to determine the feasibility of making the scores onmodified forms comparable to those on standard forms throughpredictive validation would be possible if there is cooperation amorigtest users, test publishers:handicapped students, and the Office forCivil Rights.The technology needed to determine the predictiv e validity of testsfor handicapped people in large testing programs is currently avail-able. The procedures routinely used to validate tests for the generalpopulation could be modified to avoid the problem of the smallnumbers uf handicapped students by pooling (grouping together)students at several similar schools or students w ho entered a gi?eninstitution in different years. Given the prediction equations at anumber pf colleges and universities based on all students and scoresfor students vv ith a particular handicap w ho took a particular modi-fication of the test, predicted and actual criterion scores can beobtained. For example, students Who took the large-type version oftherACT and enrolled in large state universities in the Midwest couldbe grouped together and compared with a sample of their nonhan-dicapped classmates. Criterion scores at each school could be stand-ardized so they could be compared across schools, and the disuep4nciesbetween predicted and actual criterion scores could then be pooledacross institutions. Similar techniques could be used to aggregateacross years at a given school. Distributions of discrepancies between12 -,- Psychometric Requirements of the Regulations 119predicted and actual criterion scores for handicapped students couldthen be analyzed and compared with the corresponding distributionsfor the general population. The comparison of the distribution ofprediction errors for the handicapped anci nonhandicapped groupswould tell w hether predictii'm for the two (or more) groups wascomparable or w hether there were systematic differences betweenthe groups.The approach could be improved by the use of Bay esian techniques(see Lindley 1970, Novick et al. 1972) or empirical-Bayes techniques(see Braun and Jones 1980, Rubin 1980). The Bay esian and empirical-Bay es techniques may offer substantial advantages in terms of esti-mation because of the small number of handicapped students in mostinstitutions. But the basic concept is the same. If there is a consistenttendency for predicted grades to be lower (or higher) than actualgrades for members of a special group, then either different predictionsystems are needed or predictor scores for the special group need tobe rescaled by a transformation equation that will eliminate thesystematic tendency for predicted scores to be too low or too high.The types of outcomes that might be anticipated and the associatedproblems in meeting the federal regulations can be considered w ithoutdelving into the technical details of estimation (or, for that matter,identifying the estimation techniques to be used). It should be noted,however, that the answer regarding comparability or the particularscore transformation to be used may not be the same for every specialgroup or every modification. The possibility of this complication canbe seen more fully w hen we examine the general pr.ediction equation.LetY, = the criterion score for person i at institution j,T,, = the test score for person z at institution j,Xy = the score on the nontest predictor for person,i atinstitution j,E, = the error of prediction for person i at institution j.The basic linear model for a nonhandicapped person taking thestandard form of the test may then be written,asY, = a, + b,T, + c,X + Ey, ( I )where a, b, and c are regression coefficients. Parallel equati9ns couldbe constructed for handicapped applicants taking nonstandard formsof the test as130 ABILITY TESTING OF HANDICAPPED PEOPLE Y9k = a, + b,T9, + c,X9, + E9h, (2)where k designates each combination of, handicapping coudition and .modified form of a test.Values for test scores and the nontest predictor, presumably highschool grade-point average, would be entered in the first equationfor nonhandicapped students and into the second 'equation for groupsof handicapped students at selected colleges. Predicted first-yeargrades' would be calculated separately for groups and then comparedwith actual first-year grades.Thus, at a given institution (or cluster of institutions) there wouldbe one equation for the nonhandicapped students, (1), and one foreach major combination of handicapping condition and test modifi-cation, (2). One pair of assumptions to be tested is whether the sameprediction equation works equally well for people with the samehandicapping condition who take different modified forms andwhether one equation serves people with different handicappingconditions who take the same form.The regression coefficients and error terms would be comparedfor the different groups. Ideally, of course, the regression coefficientswould be the same in both equations, the distribution of error terms(E,) would-be the same for handicapped people as for the rest of thepopulation, and the equations would 10e the same at all institutions.This would be equivalent to saying that special adjustments for thescores of handicapped people are unnecessary at all institutions andthat the prediction is as accurate for all handicapped groups as forthe general population, that is, that the same regression equationworks equally well for handicapped and nonhandicapped examinees.This would mean that a person would not need to be identified ashandicapped and that the predictor scores would not have to beadjusted depending on handicapped status. Under those conditionsthe scores Would be comparable for purposes of this prediction, andspecial flagging of scores would be unnecessary.The major concern would be with the error terms. Again, ideally,the prediction errors for the nonhandicapped and the handicappedwould have the same distribution, which would indicate that predictionusing the modified test forms and high school grades was as accuratefor handicapped people as for the general population at those schools.If, on the other hand, predictions based on a modified form tendedto have substantially larger errors of estimate, then the question of JP 1 7Psychometric Requirements of the Regulations 121flagging would again need to be addressed. The best solution to thisproblem, of course, would be to find an improved test modificationthat yielded equally accurate predictions to those of the standardform.A second concern would be with the comparison of the regressioncoefficients for the nonhandicapped and the handicapped equations.Ideally, the same equation would work equally well for both groups,that is, test scores and high'school grades would be weighted equillyin the two prediction equations, which would imply that transfor-mations of the test scores would not be necessary for handicappedpeople. If any of the regression coefficients differs from equation (1)tck (2), there would then be a need for either separate predictionequations for modified forms at various schools or for an adjustmentof the test scores for the modified form. The first of these possibilities,separate prediction equations at different schools, is technically easier,but major changes would be required on the part of test users andpublishers for this solution to satisfy the requirements of the regu-lations. In order to avoid iderfying handicapped students, scoreswould have to be reported in terms of predicted grades at selectedinstitutions. Test scores, per se, wouldnothe- reported for anyapplicant. Though technically feasible, this would indeed be a majorshift-r-one that would require agreement among a diverse ,array ofinstitutions and test takers. It would also prevent alternative uses oftest scores. For these reasons the panel does not endorse this option.:The second alternative, transforming modified form test scores, isthe clearly preferable alternative, but a technically satisfactory solutionmay or may not exist. The goal would be to find a transformation oftest scores, To, for the modified form sUch that, after the transfor-mation', the regression cofficients in equations (1) and (2) are equal.This means that test scores would be weighted equally for handicappedand nonhandicapped applicants, as would high school grades. Fur-thermore, Se desired transformation would be the same at allinstitutions. It is possible to imagine situations in, which this goalcould be readily achieved, but its feasibility can be determined onlythrough the analysis of empirical results. It is possible that the goalcould be achieved to a satisfactory degree fOr some handicaps andmodified forms but not othett:Until the validation reiearch we have outlined is completed, thereis no way of knowing whether the goal of equivalent prediction forhandicapped and nonhandicapped people can be attained in the nearfuture. If it appea,rs that the goal will not be reached for some time, ..132 122 ABILITY TEtTING OF FIANBICAPPED PEOPLEtheniit will be necessary to weigh the 4lative 'advantagesof temporarilyaccepting differences in precision of prediction while av oiding pread-mission identification of a handicap versus flagging scores or removingthe test requirement. There seems to be no simple resolution of thispotential dilemma, only the hope that research will identify testmodifications that avoid ,it. , ......., i 33... It.. 6r 6Recommended Policies ,and Procedures The Panel on Testing of Handicapped People was charged with thetask of studying the psychoinetric, social, economic, legal, and ethicalissues surrounding the use of standardized tests in making decisionsabout handicapped people, with particular referente to popsecondiryadmissions. The panel's foremost conclusion is that the technicalproblems of developing and validating tests that accommodate specifichandicaps, while very difficult, ate not insurmountable.,In the first part of this chapter we outline a plan of action thatoffers promise of a solution to the problem of producing test scoresfor handicapped applicants that can be used in the same way as scoresfor the general population. The proposed solution is, we believe, thesingle most important product of the panel, and will, if acted onresponsibly by all concerned parties, succeed in eliminating the mostserious problems currently associated with establishing nondiscrimi-natory testing practicg for handicapped people. That section, on theissues of validity and comparability, is divided into three subsections:(1) the regulations and the problem of comparability, (2) flagging,and (3) small testing programs. The panel's conclusions and recorri-mendations are presented at the end of each subsection.The panel has also reached a number of other conclusions regardingthe ways in which tests are developed for, administered to, and usedto make decisions about people with handicapping condif ns. Thesecond part of this chapter presents those additional co usions andrecommendations, which address issues other than the entral policy123134 6124 ABILITiTESTING OF HANDICAPPED PEOPLEquestions that constituted our major charge. The second part of thechapter, which presents issues of test administration, is also divided.intothr.ee subsections, each with its own cdnclusions and recommen-dations.In Chapter 7, we suggest research directions that, over the longerterm, can be expected to illuminate the underlying mental processes ,tapped by various test tasks and thus provide better insight into the,nature of the differences in cognitive or expressive functioning relatedto deafness, blindness, or other handjcappineconditions. THE ISSUES OF VALIDITY AND COMPARABILITYTests tan, and sometimes do, open the way to new opportunities for'handicapped people by allowing.them a chance to demonstrate theirabilities, but tests can also function as barriers to the'fullest pdssibleparticipation of handicapped peoPle in American society. For teststo serve the,interests of people with handicaps more consistently thanthey have in the past,amajor cooperative effort will be. required. Inorder to carry out its policy recommendations, the panel calls ongovernment officials, testing companies, large institutional test users,and' handicapped test takers tjiAutogether in a program of testdevelopment and validatresearch that offers the promise ofensuring handicapped applicants equal opportunity in the selectionprocess. The participation of eacli is crucial to the success of the planspecified below. ,Sectipn N4 and the Problem of ComparabilityThe fundamental intent ofSection1504 of the Rehabilitation Act of1973 is to eliminate unnecessary barriers,'including (potentially dis-criminatory testing practices, to the full participation of handicappedpeople in the life of the nation. Administrative interpretation ofSection 504 has focused on two situations in whkh tests are comeonlyugV21 in making deci;ions about people: toting for admission topostsecondary educatiOnal institutions and testing for selection andpromotio,n in employment settings.As detailed in Chapter 5, the regulations implementing Section504 seem to require that test'developers and users Toddy tests andtest administration procedures for use with h(bdkapped people,construct and administer tests in such a manner that they reflect skillsindependent of handicapping conditions, report seores for handi-capped people in a manner, such that they are indistinguishable from .133)' . Rmended Policia and Pr &educes 125S-those for nonhanclicappe4 people, and validate tests for handicapped .people for the'purpose at hand. In the subsection of the regulationsdealing with employment testing, the requirement that a test beliown, to be job-related is sulistituted for the requirement that it bevalidatetagainst educational performance.These requirements derive logically from two assumptions: first,that handicaPped people can be tested in a way that will not reflectthe effects of their handicap,*and second, that the regulting test scoresswill bq, comparable ni some sense to those of the general population.The panel considers the first assumption a long-term research goanot a present actuality. With regard.to the second assumptionwitdue respect to the discipline of psychometrics and to the good f--intentions of' the compliance authoritieswe conclude that the re-quirement that test results must reflect the handicapped applicant'saptitude or achievement level rather than the applicant's ,impairedsensory, manual, or speaking skills is largely beyond the presentcompetence of psychometrics. Compliance authorities should treatthe second requirement as a goal of science and social policy ratherthan as a requirement of the law that can be currently imple ented.The panelpent tluch time deliberatingvarious defin. 'oT,compsarability the requirement of the r gulat. nthat test scores of handicapped aRplicants not be differentiated from,those of other test takers while at the same time keeping within thelboundsr3f curreht psychometric learning, and we prropose a newapproach to, this issbe. The regulations do not explicitly\" state thattests or test scores for handicapped people must be made comparableto those Idr nonbandicapped'people, but that is clearly the implicationof the qgulations (see Chapter 5). The regulations' prohibition ofthe jclentification of test scores that rest& from nonstandard admin-istrationto handicapped individua,ls (flagging) assumes that testscores fi r handicapped people can be made comparable to (in fact,indistin uishable from) those for nonhandicapped people If teststhat ha e been modified as required could be shown to be strictlycompar ble to standard tests through traditional procedureofdemdn rating comparability, there would be no need f ecialconsicie ations Of modified tests. Those pincedures are not, however, Gg. applica le to tests modified for handicapped people. .After careful consideration, the panel concluded thit it is not noW,geossibte to achieve the kind of comparability, based'-on traditionalequating procedures. 1nstead, the panel has concluded tnat predictivevalidabon, that is, the establishing of a relation between scores from ,Jnochhed tests and the kind of peiformance in school or emplwym&t. .1 fti.I ... 126 ABILITY TESTING OF HANDICAPPED PEOPLEthat serves as the validity criterion for standard tests, can and shouldbe used to define comparability of modified and standard forms.fli)Although using predictive validity to define the comparability ofdifferent forms of a test derives in straightforward manner frombasic psychometric theory, it is, rather surprisingly, a novel approachto the practical problems of establishing comparability. The panel isconvinced that traditional approaches cannot be applied to establishse m parability of stanClard and modified forms in all respects, especiallywith regard to Underlying abilities. For this reason we recommendturning away from accepted procedures and advocate an innovativeapproach that has not, to the best of our knowledge, been tried oneft large scale in operating programs.We recommend that, in the four-year period after implementationof the panel's recommendations, sponsors of the large testing pro-grams develop modifieg tests to accommodate most kinds of sensoryand motor handicaps and conduct predictive validity studies in orderto ascertain whether the modified tests have a predictive power nearthat of the standard jests used with the general population. Theo-retically, this is an attainable form of comParability, but empiricalvalidity studies Will have to be'conducted in order to determine theactual feasibility of the approach. At the end of the research anddevelopment period, it should be possible to detormine whethermodified and standard forms of a test actually have comparable.predictive Power. If the studies proceed smoothly, it may also bepossible to report the results of standard and modified tests on asingle scale, because the tests will Me equivalent predictive power.The existence of a single scale would totally obviate flagging. Ifduring the researdkand development period one or more modifiedf rms are found to predict the criterion measure much less well thane standard form, then it may still be possible to refine each modi4edform in order to improve its predictive validity. (See Chapter 5 for#definitions of validity and for technical discussion of the feasibility ofthis proposal and of score transformation.)The major technical problem with doing validation research onmodified tests in the past has been the inadequacy of sample size,but that problem can be obviated by pooling data gathered in severalyears or at large numbers of similar educational institutions. TheOffice for Civil Rights can play an importafft role in facilitating thishcess by encouraging the National Center for Education Stalisticsand the Committee on National Statistics of the National ResearchCouncil to gather demographic statistics on the hkiclicapped siudentpopulation.jr--1137IP* Recommended Policies and Procedures 127We recommend that work be concentrated first on the large testingprograms so that the costs can be spread across a sizable applicantpopulation and so be kept Within reasonable bounds:Most of thelarge testing programs have been offering some modified forms-foryears, and the panel was informed that a good deal of data exists atcolleges and universities that could pros ide the initial steps in asYstematic research effort. Thus, there should be no need for for alengthy lead-in period. We therefore recommend that work com-mence as soon as possible and that the Nalidation studies be completedwithin four years of the implementation 9f these recommendationsby the Office for Civ il Rights.The labels \"large\" and \"small\" testing programs are used as anabbreviated way to distinguish between those programs in whichvalidation research is believed to have a greater or smaller probabilityof being feasible. The distinction is not perfectly clear, however, andis not just a. matter of size. In general, the greater the experiencewith a testing program, the better the validation study is likely to be.1\",The experience with a p gram can be measured in several ways,including total numberadministrations, number of years used,extensA,eness and quality of research on the test, and number ofsettings (for example, number of colleges Or employers). A \"small\"program would be one that is relatis ely new, seldom used, and fromwhich the examinees go into a variety of schools or jobs. Withoutquestion, the Scholastic Aptitude Test and the American CollegeTesting Program's assessment can be considered \"large testing pro-.grams,\" although some combinations of test modification and hand-icapPing condition may be troublesome for even these tests. Inaddition, most modifications of the Graduate Record ExaminationAptitude Tests, and the...r\\aduate Management Admission Test(although modifications of the4GM. 'first became.av ailable in 1979%80) can be validated for handicapped people. It may well be thatcertain modification-s of other tests can also be v alidated for handi-capped examinees. We believe that work should begin with the largetesting programs mentioned above so that procedures can be refinedand applied to other situations and so thatwith great carefindingsI can be generalized. CqnclusionThe existing research on the validity of tests and testmodifications used with handicapped people in postsecondary ad-missions and employment selection is in most cases insufficient tojudgeadequatelp-gUen test:s s a lidity . Most postsecondary admissionstests are modified and administered to handicapped people without 1 38 128 ABILITY TESTING' OF HANDICAPPED PEOPLEempirical evidence of the appropriateness of the nn fications. Inaddition, the modified forms are not developed empirically or usedon a trial basis before they are administered for reaIdecision making.,ConclusionIt is not now possible to eitablish the comparability ofmodified and standard tests by the formal equating procedures thatare used to establish the equivalence of alternate forms of a test usedwith nonhandicapp. ed people. ConclusionEmpirical validation of the predictive Rower of modifiedtests is theoretically aetainable and would seem to satisfy the statutoryrequirement that handicapped individuals receiv e equal treatment inpostsecondary admissions and employment selection. , ..ConclusionEvenhanded treatment of handicapped and nonhandi-capped applicants would be best achieved by requiring that thepredictive validity of a modified test be equivalent (within a givenrange) to that for the original test. In that situation, scores on themodified test could be used for prediction in the same way, , and withthe same degree of confidence, aS scores on the standard test.' ConclusionGiven the existence of equivalent predictive N al id i ties forstandard and modified tests, there would be no technical bar totranslating the scores from all of the tests to a common scale.Conclusion The main technical problem in establishing the predictivevalidity of modified tests, the inadequacy of sample size, can beovercome by pooling data from several institutions or from several syears.rConclusion The practicality of undertaking predictive validity re-search is cler in the case of the large testing programs. Manypostsecondary, admissions tests are in this category, although it maybe difficult to get a/sufficient sample population for every categoryof handicap on tests like the Graduate Record Examination AdvancedTests, which cover 20 disciplines. Recommendation 1The Panel recommends that the Office for Civil-.Rights require that postsecondary educational institutions subject toSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, in their role as membersof the corporations that sponsor the large testing programs, instructthe testing companies to begin at the earliest opportunity to develop 1 39 ,Recommended Policies and Procedures 129modified tests to meet the needs of individuals vb ith sensory andmotor handicaps and to perform predictive validation studies onthese tests. Thealidity studies should be completed and reportedwithin four yrs of theplementation of this panel's recommen-dations by the Office for Civ ights. Recommendation 2To ensure the success of these N al idat ion efforts,the Office for Civil Rights should do every thing in its power toencourage handicapped students to participate in the studies (afteradmission). Such encouragement might include making informationabout ace- purposes of the validation program available to the majororganizations'representing the handicapped and to those who countelhandicapped people, and undertaking other public education activ-ities.1Recommendation 3Validation studies should be performed separatelyfor each ty pe of test modification. In some cases it may also benecessary to validate a particular modification for people with differ-ent types or degrees of handicap. For example, in the.yersion of ates1 presented orally or on tape, people with a learning disability mayhave a pattern of responses and a relationship between test andcriterion that are distinct from people with a visual ;n1pairment. Reiommendatzon 4Test developers should, as the predictiv e v alidationproceeds, develop separate scales for each test, both standard andmodified. When the modified tests have been brought to a conditionof equivalent predfctive power with the test for the general population,the scores can be translated to a common scale before reporting. Atthis point, all reasons for flagging will have been eliminated. Recommendation 5The panel recommends that the requirement inthe regulations to use only N a 1 id ated tests for handicapped people bewaived during the four-year research period, provided that a user ofmodified tests with unknown N alidi ty for the appropriate handicappedgroup may use only those tests for which producers certify thatreSearch on validation of the type here described is under-way. TheOffice for Civil Rights should establish provisions for monitoring andperiodic reporting by test developers to show adherence to therecommended policies regarding validation studies.Recommendation 6The panel recommends that after the four-yearresearch period no test user covered by the regulation may use a- 1 4 0k - 130 ABILITY TESTING OF HANDICAPPED PEOPLEmodified form of a test whose vafidity with respect to relevantperformance is unknown or for which the necessary refinements in.the modified forms have not been made.Recommendation 7 The panel recommends that at the close of thefour-year research period a working group be assembled to examinethe validity evidence submitted by the testing cornPanies and otherinvestigators. The tasks of the group should include (1) determinationof the usefulness of modifications for tarious handicapped groups,that is, demonstration of reasonably equitalent degrees of preOictitetahdity as compared with the talidity of the standard forms for thegeneral population, and (2) determination of specific consequencesin those Lases in which the predictite Nalidities are not found to liewithin acceptable limits for a modified form or a particular handi-capped group.Clearly, if the t;lidity of a modified form approximates that of thestandard eorm, the working group will recommend acceptance anduse of the modified form. If the talidity of another form is slightlyless than iacceptable, there may be reason to believe that with areasona6le amount of rurther effort the form can be improted andthe predictive validity thereby increased (for exaMple, by using abetter reader for a cassette tersion, or a simpler answer sheet, or aclearer presentation of math items for the tisually impaired). If thetalidity of a modified form is markedly tower than is acceptable, the,working group must decide whether further work on the form islikely to be fruitful or whether that form should be dropped. Theworking group sflould look for patterns across tests, for example,finding for all tests studied that no adjustment is ne&led for a gitenmodification or handicapping condition. In drawing generalizations,caution must be exercised to ensure close similarity of the tests, theabilities being measured, and the performance being predicted. Thepanel recommends that the rights of the test takers to accurateassessment should be giten highest priority, with- somewhat lowerpriority being git en to prohibition of preselection inquiry. The panelfurther recommends that inditidual applicants should be git en theright to decide for themselves whether or not they choose to takeforms of the test that hate not been found technically adequate. FlaggingOne of the most difficult and controversial aspects of the federalattempt to ensure equal treatment of handicapped people in selectionsituations has,been the flagging of test scores to indicate a nonstandard141 Recommended Policies and Procedures 131administration. The etTdence, limited though it may be, indicatesthat handkapped test takers as a group tend to score markedly low eron such tests as the college admissions tests than their non handicappedpeers. In light of this etidence, test det elopers and others reasonedthat, as a group, handicapped apphcants would be penalized more iftheir scores were not flagged' than if they were. Hence, testingcompanies currently publish statements alerting decision makers roweigh more heail other sources of information about an applicantwhose test score is flagged.Test det elopers, psychologists, and educator's suspect that some ofthat difference in test scores mat result from inadequacies in themodified telts,s hile some mat result from poorer educationalopportunitA, more limited experience than the at erage test taker,or limitations produced by the handicapping condition. In the absenceof systematic y ahdation studies, it is impossible to estimate how muchof the score difference is error and how much reflects lower per-fisomance probabilities. It was, no doubt, the strength of this concernthat led the Office for 0%11 Rights to hold in abeyance since early in1978 the part of the regulations that bans preadmission inquirythrough an informal agreement knqw n as the \"interim policy.\"Although the regulationsreminon the books as the standard for,testing people with handicapping conditions, OCR's interim policyacknowledges that more research into the y alidity of the modifiedtests is necessary before full compliance can\\be realized..( The panel has listened closely to the representatiy es of handicappedpeople. Many hat e expressed the opinion that the existence of aninterim policy, ,particularly one as tentatiye and unofficial as theunderstanding currentlrti situ, has blunted the intent of Section 504.Contrary to the lengthy process of comment and discussion thatpreceded final publication of the regulalion in 1977, they point out,the interim policy was established at the initiative of the Office forCivil Rights alone. The population that, the rules were designed toprotecthandicapped test takerslhad no y oice in the establishmentof this crucial waiver of a portion of the regulations.At the satire time, there is no consensus within the handicappedcommunity on the merits of identifying oneself as handicapped(luring thy admissions process. The panel has heard strong statementson both sides of the issue and finds merit in each position. There isstrong agreement, how ey er, on two points: (1) the quasi-officialinterim policy must be rescinded as soon as possible, and (2) torequire an Indic, idual to take an examination with unknow n y alidityand meaning is to nullify that person's effort.We endorse both points and take them as the basis for our142 132 ABILITY TESTING OF HANDICAPPED PEOPLErecommended plan of action. to the degree that it is successful, anintensive research effort to establish the predictive Nal id i ty of modifiedadmissions tests will ultimately obv iate the necessity for any flaggingof test scores derived from nonstandard administrations. In themeantime we strongly urge that the client boards and testing com-panies adcpt a policy of allow ing.each applicant who has taken amodified test to decide whether or not the user institution should bealerted to that fact. Presnmably,\" many who achieve high scores willopt for anonymity, , others with high scores may feel that opennessabout their handicapping condition gives them added advantage,those whose scores imply below-average performance will want theirtest scores flagged in order to have other factors weighed moreheavily in the selection decision.The quid pro quo, of course, is that after being admitted, everyhandicapped student must be strongly encouraged to participate inthe validation studies. Conduston/The research literature shows that the oft-held thathe dentification of an applicant as handicapped alwaysworks tois or her disadvantage is not accurate. In fact, identificationsometirjes works to the advantage of the applicant with a handicap-_ ping \u00e7\u00f3ndition (see Chapter 1 and Appendix A). Recommendation 8Considering the diversity of situations and theloaned perceived effects of identification of a person as, handicapped,the panel recompends no general prohibition or allowance of flag-ging. The panel recommends that in the period before the N ali dat i o nstudies have been completed, the locus of control over the flaggingof scores to be used for educational admissions should be shiftedfrom the test dev eloper to the handicapped person. The gains inprivacy and' control to thehandicapped applicant outweigh anydisadvantage associated with the temporary divergence from custom-ary practice. Moreover, equity considerations suggest that the gainforhandicapped indiv iduals outweighs the possible disadvantage forthe nonhandicapped, who would have no corresponding choice.However, this recommendation requires that applicants be carefullycounseled concerning both the merits and the disadvantages ofidentifying a handicapping condition. The decision to alert admissionsofficers to the presence of a handicap that may adversely affect testscores should be separate from and independent of the test taker'sdecision about N ol u n ta r y participation in validation research.143...y Recommended Policies and Procedures 133Small Testing ProgranisMost of the discussion abor e has been der eloped with postsecondaryadmissions tests in mind. Although there is no theoretical reason w hythe conclusions and recommendations drawn with that focus shouldnot also be applicable in the employment sphere, most employersand licensing and certification agencies, among others, hare relatirelysmall testing programs. The issues in ralidating tests administered tosmall numbers of peoplehandicapped and nonhandicappedaresome% hat different from those for large testing programs, evenWhere the samples of handicapped people can be considered relatirelysmall. In small programs there are different economic and technicalconsiderations, most of shich emanate from the fact that there is nota large base of experience from the testingof the general populationto proride support for the ,testing of the handicapped. The technicalproblems with empirical ralidation w ith small samples are particularlyserere because some sources of rariability may be unknown. Some.large employers, including the federal government, could draw onlarge enough samples of handicapped applicants to do predictireralidation studies. There is also some possibility that multijurisdic-tionalalidation efforts could solre the problems of sample size forcertain kinds of jobs and certain kindsCsf handicapping conditions.Nerertheless, predictire studies in employment will be far moredifficult to institute and organize than in the educational context. Itseems likely that must employers will hare to depend on the experiencethat will be gleaned in other settings in the coming years and in themeantime continue w ith the alternate assessment procedures, suchas inteniews,ork samples, and probationary periods, among others(described in Chapter 3). ConclusionSmall testing programs, including most employ ment test-ing, present great problems. It may often be impractical to do empiricalstudies in the employment sphere, although the concept of multijur-isdictional studies offers some hope for a means of conducting,Alidation research. Absence of alidated employment testing, espe-cially for entry-lerel jobs, may be particularly problematic for somehandUapped people because there is less likely to be supportingeridence that an employer could use in place of or in addition to atest score.Re\u00abnnmendation 9 The panel recommends that research on thepredictire %Aldo of tests for the handtcapped be undertaken in the 144 134 ABILITY TESTING OF HANDICAPPED PEOPLEemploy ment sphere as well as in education, ev en though most privateemployers have small testing programs. Although the research islikely to take longer and to be less rigorous than that for largeprograms, there are some techniques that offer promise of solutions.Pooling of data across institutions and across y ears may providesolutiops to problems in some situations, current multijurisdictionalvalidation of employ ment tests may offer techniques that could beadapted for use ANith handicapped applicants in some job categoriesor in some educational settings. These and other potentially beneficialtechniques should be explored by those with small testing programs.Large employers with ,large testing programs, such as the federalgovernment, should proceed immediately with the kinds of v alidationresearch outlined above for large educational testers.Recommendation 10 The panel recommends that the Office for CivilRights encourage the use of multiple sources of information byemploy ers _in their selection of qualified handicapped applicants.Sours of information, which supplement or substitute for testscoy\u00e9s,. include letters of recommendation, personal interviews, jobples, and probationary periods of employ ment. Encouragemento use multiple sources will be most critical for entry-level jobs whereit also may be most difficult to find several relevant sources. 'ISSUES OF TEST ADMINISTRATIONEmanatingnmendations that supplement,or support the major policy recommen-dations on validity and comparability.V V Modifying Tests. For Handicapped PeopleThe panel has been in an especially fortunate position to view thepolicies regarding modifications of tests for handicapped people heldby a wide variety' of organizations. Because of its high visibility (from,notices in professional joUrnals and newsletters and from publicityrelated to the panel's open meeting in March 1980); the panel hasreceived requests for guidance from people responsible for large andsmall testing programs as well as from those concerned with testingin classrooms. From its Na n tage point the panel has observed that thepractices and the levels of sophistication vary widely among thegroups who have assumed or w ho have been gii:en the responsibility .145 Recommended Policies and Procedures 135for accommodating the needs of handicapped pepple in their testingprograms.ConclusionAlthough it is true that modifications of some tests hakebeen ayailable for 20 years or orri-Fr-, methods for accommodatingthe needs of handicapped ,people on standardized tests are far fromsystematk or unisersally known. The factors to be considered arenumerous and often much more subtle or complicated than manypeople recognize. -The panel has been impressed by the determination,thoroughness, and sensitiyity of some and appalled by the ignoranceand insensitiyity of others yk ho are responsible for testing handicappedpeople. Among at least some of them, howeser, there appears to be21 desire to ktirn how to modify tests appropriately.Recommendation 11The panel recommends wider publicity anddistribution of information on how to modify tests and test admin-istration procedures for use with handicapped people. One of thehandiest and most helpful references is,the Guide for AdminisaringExaminatwits to Handicapped Individuals for Employment Purposes (Heatonet al. 1980). Although this guide may not giye sufficient detail for allusers, it may serye as a usef ul model for similar documents con,cerningother types of tests.Recommendatwn 12One commonly employed technique, that is:theuse of groups,of expert handicapped people to re% iew modified tests,is endorsed by this panel. No one knows as well as a knowledgeableand sensitiye blind person, for example, what difficulties other blindpeop ecounter on a particular test.Recommendation 13We unde score here the necessity of research onthe effects of modifications on test scores and on .the effects ofhandicapping conditions on the cognitiye processes uriderlying testperformance. Obylously, modifying tests and test administrationprocedures is but one step in accommOating handicapped peoplein the testing situation. Knowing what tf0 resultingscores signify isof the utmost importance and can be determined only after aconsiderable amount of carefully planned, executed, and analyzedresearch.Demand For Modified Test Forms1 he data from the two largest deYelopers of educational tests clearlyindicate an increasing numbeLoLadministrations of modified-tests sl 46 /--\".136 \\ cABILITY TESTING OF HANDICAPPED PEOPLEover the last five or so years. The increases are probably caused byincreased numbers of handicapped people completing high schooland applying to some type of postsecondary school as well as byhandicapped people's increased awareness of the availability of themodified forms. ConclusionThe increases in the number of handicapped peopletaking standardized tests (whether modified or not) are importantfor several reasons.First, they indicate that more handicappedindividuals are participating more fully in American society. Second,they underscore the necessity of making modified forms available,the demand is growing too fast to be ignored. Third, the increasingnumbers offer greater hope for timely and rigorous validation of thetests administered to handicapped people.Condumon The cited increases notwithstanding, there have been anumber of complaints of inadequate or inaccurate information re-garding the availability of the modified forms. Systematic data on themagnitude of the problem do not exist, but the panel believes thecomplaints should be considered seriously. Lack of information aboutmodified forms of tests may discourage some handicapped peoplefrom attempting or accomplishing some important and satisfyingendeavors.Recommendation 14High school counselors should assume respon-sibilityfor informing handicapped students of the availability ofmodified forms of college admissions and other relevant tests. Coun-selors should help individual students select the most appropriatemodification and assist them ill any other way possible, for example,in requesting the modified form and in understanding the implicationsof flagging or not flagging a test score.Special Problems With Certain TestsA few tests or types of tests have come to the Panel's attention asposing special problems for handicapped people. Mintmum Competency TestsAs the number of handicapped students completing high schoolgrows, there is increased need to examine state and local policies fit fr-+ Recommended Policies and Procedures 137regarding minimum competency testing programs. There are twobroad areas of concern directly relevant to the panel's charge: theavailability of modified forms of the tests and the awarding of diplomascontingent on passing the minimum competency test.ConclusionThe fairness of minimum compet7ncy testing programs,particularly those that make the awarding of a diploma contingenton passing the test, may be critical for many handicapped peoplewho completethigh school. Full consideration of the needs of hand-icapped students is essential if they are not to be summarily deniedhigh school diplomas. Where diplomas are required for furthereducation or for employment the impact of minimum competencyprograms is especially acute. Recommendation 15The Office for Civil Rights should study theeffects of miniimum competency testing programs on handicappedpeople. State ,and local policies should be reviewed to ensure thatonly validated tests are used for handicapped people, that modifiedforms are readily available, and that scoring procedures are de-monstrably nondiscriminatory. Special attention should be given topolicies regarding the awarding of diplomas based on scores on -prminimum competency tests. The Law School Admission TestThe panel has heard more criticism of the LSAT than of any othersingle test or testing program. Criticisms focus on the policy ofallowing no extra time in the administration of the LSAT, a policyset presumably to approximate compliance with the Section 504regulations.ConclusionThe panel believes that the restrictive policy of the LawSchool Admission Council regarding accommodations on the LSATfor handicapped people is discriminatory and detrimental to potentiallaw school applicants with handicapping conditions.,'Recommendation 16 The panel recommends that the Law SchoolAdmission Council review its policy in light of this panel's centralpolicy recommendation. We encourage that more modificatiOns ofthe test and its administration procedures ,be supplied and thatvalidation studies be conducted, as described earlier in this chapter.\\ 1 4 8_ 138 ABILITY TESTING OF HANDICAPPED PEOPLE Certification and LicensingInquiries by the panel revealed that relatively few handicapped peoplehave, requested modifications in certification or licensing examina-tions. Still there is some reason to suspect that handicapped ,people,are discouraged from pursuits that would lead to attairiment of aprofessional certi,ficate or license long before they approach thetesting situation. Since the panel has had little hvd evidence con-cerning certification and licensing, we draw no firm conckonsregarding the presence yi.r absence of discrimination. Nevertheless,the panel believes these credentials may become increasingly impor-tant as more handicapped people complete education and trainingprograms and prepare to enter the labor force.Recommendation 17Because of the dearth of sound evidence andthe potential importance of professional credentials for hand kappedpeople, the panej recommends that the Office for Civil Rights perform'a modest but nonetheless important investigation to determine whetherthere are, as some suspect, serious problems for handica`pped peoplein obtaining occupational certificatesland licenses due to requirementsfor achieving a score on a standardized test. FUTURE DIRECTIONSWe do not pretend that improvement and i\"'alidation of modifiedtestsor handicapped people will be an easy or automatic process.The implementation of our recommended plan of action for testvalidationbe difficult.It may be necessary, for exdmple, tovalidate a giv en modified test form for a number of kinds or degreesof handicap. A test designed for the deaf will,'no doubt, demonstratedifferent predictive power for those who hav e been cieaf since birthand those who experienced laler onset. For that reason we havesuggested a time period that is long enough to allow for the completionof the validation studies, hOwever, we want to express our sense ofthe urgency of the situation. Four years is adequate time only if workis begun immediately and if sufficient resources are de8icatedlo theendeavors. For several of the postsecondary admissions tests, datahave already been accumulating for several years. Those th44shouldbe retrieved and analyzed without delay.We would also caution that the program we are recommendingwill no't solve all of the problems that handicapped applicants havewith test performance. It is the totality of one's ed4ation, training,149, Recommended Policies and Procedures 139and experience that is brought to a standardized test, and itiany\"'handicapped people hav e grown up in relatively deprived or aty pitalcircumstances,These deficits can only be remedied by better schoolingand a more accessible environment through t the maturationalyears.What the irogr\u00e2m can do is to assure that at the moment ofcompetition, the handicapped applicant is assessed as Zermpe1rar'6-any other applicant. In other words, Me progratiT cannot make upfor thingrnot learned or al;ilines not 'developed, but it can ensurethat the probability of successful performante in a college psogram(or on the job) is adequately predicted. Without such a program ofvaliaation research, the use of tests risks great injustice.The Office for Civil Rights carinot, of course, mandate the suCcessof the valiaation eff&t, but it can facilitate it. It can and shouldrequire that the necessuy research conducted within four yearsafter its implementatiOn of this pane s recommendations. This re-quirement is well within the ver of OCR because of existingenforcement and institutional arrangements. OCR'currently has the..authority to find.colleges or universities out of compliance with theSection 504 regulations. It is those same schools that have.poer overthe testing companies througth theirs membership in the governikbodies such as The. College, Board. Thus, if OCR implements thepanel's central policy recommendation arid if the testing companiesdo not perforui the required researth, thecolleges will be found outof compliance fos using tests that are not beirrg/validated for,handicapped. people. 4We believe that the plan outlitcd above offers the best pOssiblesynthesis of fairness considerations and technical) capabilities foforeseeable future. The proposed solution, Ifowever, has all thlimitations of any ltipproach that is largely atheoretical. Predictivevalidity does not explain why some people will flrobably succeed andsome fail, and it does not describe the abilities that are being measured.It describes the statistical relationship between test safes and theperformance to be ptedicted. Therefore, we also strongly urge thegradual accumulation of research on Cognitive abilities to greatlyenhance information obtained throligh validation strategies that arebased solely on statistical relationships. In psychometOcs, there is arevitalized interest in construct validity, that is, in theories of whateach kind of itep-,reasures. This line of research seems particularlyimportant in uiWersiTanding the abilities of pebple who have handi-tapping conditions anti of finding the most productive accommoda-tions, notiust in test format, but of pedagogical methods, restructuring 15 ,I,A.;140 ABILITY TESTING OF HANDICAPPED PEOPLEof job tasks, and so on. The Office of Personnel Management hasmade some important beginnings with its modifications of the PACE(although that examination is now to be phased out for reasonsunrelated to its use with handicappdd- people). ,,--It is important to emphasize that this is the work of decades. But0)-itis work that should begin now and with the encouragement offederal funding agencies, such as the National Institute on Handi-capped Research and other parts of the Department of Education.a e , \\ 0_.1a.. 151, A.0., 7Recommended Research) Almost since th\u00e7 promulgation of the Section 504 regulations, it hasbeen clear that there exists insufficient information to allow for thedemonstrably valid testing of handicapped people, as required in theregulations. Information on standardized arid modified tests takenby handicapped people, that is, data on their reliability and validity,and on the effects of modifying test administration procedures, isessential to the fulfillment of the spirit of the Rehabilitation Act of1.973. In other words, full compliance with the Section 504 regulationswill be possible only after further 'research has been completed.Therefore, in order that colleges and universities would not be foundout of compliance until the needed research could be planned andexecuted, the Office tor Civil Rights formulated and instituted theinterim policy. The task of specifying the research that would providethe necessary information about tests and their use for people withhandicappingconditions was explicitly included in the charge to thePanel on Teskrik,,of Handicapped People. Thereto ,* the panel hasincorporated research items that-deal specifically With characteristicsof tests as administered to handicapped people in both its researchand policy recommendations.As the paners work progressed, it became apparent that too littlewas known not only about the tests administered to handicappedpeople to determine their validity, but also about the effeps of existingtesting practices on the performance of handicapped\\people. Thepanel, therefore, has specified in its research agenda studies to141..1;'N.152 142 ABILITY TESTING OF HANDICAPPED PEOPLEproduce the deired information on Edbw test scores are used andhow they affect the lives of people ,with handicapping conditions.Several topics,all having significant implications for policy, areincluded under this broad heading. The first is the validity of testsadministered to people with handicapping conditions. The second isinformation on the experiences of handicapped people as theyencounter tests. for example, how often they are tested, what kindsof tests they take, what information they obtain from counselors, andhow they perceive tests and testing personnel. The third is thedecision-making process. how test scores and other information areused to make selection decisions regarding handicapped people andwhat will be the effects on these practices of different flagging policiesand of.2dditional information on test validity. Such studies offer theadded advantage that they will provide data on w hich to evaluate theeffects of modifications in the policies recommended by the panel.At the outset, the panel was hindered in its attempts to define thescope of the problems involved in testing of handicapped people andtb place them in perspective. The hindrance took the form ofUnreliable, inconsistent, or uninterpretable data on handicappedpeople in the United States and on their experience in taking testsand in entering the mainstream of education and work. As aconsequence, the panel atso recommends a fourth topic of research.the improvement and expansion of demographic data on people withhandicapping conditions, particularly those sho have the potentialto enter the mainstream of American life. Some of the researchrecommended in this area is only indirectly related to the panel'sstudy and, therefore, is given lower priority, even though it is ofprimary interest to others. Within each of the four main sections ofthe research agenda, those topics for proposed studies that the panelvoted to give highest priority are marked with an asterisk (*) and areplaced first within their respective sections. THE VALIDITY OF TESTS FOR HANDICAPPED PEOPLEInformation on the validity of tests administered to handicappedpeople is most urgently needed so that progress toward compliancewith the Section 504 regulations can be made. It is for good reasonthat validity is mentioned most prominently in the regulations. Lackingknowledge of the validity uf a test, that is, of some indication of howwell a test tfieasures w hat it purports to measure, one is preventedfrprn using the test results with confidene. Although some bandi-capped individuals can take standardized tests under tlje standard 153 Recommended Research 143conditions and be reasonably certain that their abilities are beingreflected accurately, others require,modificatipns in the test or testingprocedures that cast doubt on the accuracy and meaning of themeasures. The effects of most modiftations are unknown, kid thepanel strongly urges research to begin charting the effects, especiallyon the validity of the instruments. *Nonstandard Testing Procedures and Validity What are the effects uf modifying tests and test administration procedureson the distributions uf test scores, test reliability, test validity, and subjectivereports of examinees, such as ease of comprehension uf test instructions andquestions, perceived time pressures, and feelings of fatigue?Very littleis known about the effects of various deviations fromstandard test administration procedures. Een changes for nonhand-icapped examinees, such as arying Ftime limits or rest periods, haebeen insufficiently studied. More pertinent to the panel's study, theeffects of changes in the standard test administration procedures(such as large type, tape recorders, amanuenses, and others) areirtually unknown. Of central concern is the effect of these changeson the validity of the test. If it could be shown that all of themodifications made for handicapped people in a ghen test producedscores that predicted future performance as well as scores on theregular ersion of the test, then nearly all doubt about the appro-priateness of the test would disappear. Without that information,however, the person trying to use the scores does not know theirmeaning and has no guidelines for legitimate interpretations.Studies on this topic would focus ob.the effects of test modificationson objecthe measures, such as changes in the distribution of testscores (means and standard deiations), test reliability, test alidity,and subjectie report's of the examinees (for example, ease of com-prehension of instructions and test questions, perceived time pres-sures, and feelings of fatigue). Such studies must include as muchinformation as possible on the characteristics of the arious modifi-cations and on their relation to one aruither and to the standardforms. information can be accumulated to build a store of knowledgeon what modified tests seem to measure for people with differenthandicapping conditions and whether the abilities measured appearto differ over various..modifications.Admittedly, some of tbe research will present subtle and compli-cated problems in experimental design. Research on the effects of 1 54 144 ABILITY TESTING OF HANDICAPPED PEOPLEchanges in the medium of presentation (for example, braille versusdifferent sizes of print versus aural presentation) will probably requirethe use of very caiefully matched samples, because few. people wouldbe equally facile in several mo'cles of presentatidn and because theyprobably could not take the same test several times for the purposeof comparing media. Some of the problems might be overcomethrough the use of emperimental designs, perhaps involving balancedpresentations of different (est forms or perhaps through training ofnonhandicapped experimental subjects in the use of alternate media(for example, cassettes). Although ethical considerations will prohibitmost experimentation in actual test situations, other types of researchpresent fewer difficulties and could even be performed using non-handicapped examinees. For example, some research on speed ofresponding as it affects test scores and on the effects of various timelimits and rsest periods could be done with nonhandicapped people.Because of the methodological difficulties inherent in much of thework suggested in this research, it will be especially important thatresearchers exercise extreme care and that they be especially observantto note when procedures do and do not work. It may be that someof the most valuable findings will be more qualitative or subjectivethan quantitative or objective. *Validation Techniques for Use.on Small Samples of ExamineesWhat methods are currently available for measuring test reliability andvalidity with small or heterogeneous samples? What are the advantages anddisadvantages of the methods, includiu pooling data across samples?The panel's policy recommendations deal extensively with validationresearch and rely heavily on pooling data from several samples as aworkable technique. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that the techniqueis not yet!ully developed and also that there are situations in whichpooling !bay be of limited value. Therefore, we recommend that thelimits of the applicability of pooling be explored, that other techniquesbe sought, and that the practical implications of reduced certainty inthe validity of tests be investigated. We suggest two tasks: a reviewof the current techniques of measuring test reliability and validity,and the development and trial of methods of estimating test reliabilityand validity for small samples. The first task should be conducted byor in close cooperation with the test development Companies andshould emphasize any techniques that offer promise for either smallor heterogeneous samples. The second task calls for the development 1 5 5 Recommended Research 145of practical ways to prepare data for pooling, for example, standard-izing grades across schools or programs or years. Other techniques,such as matching handicapped and nonhandicapped students oremployers, should also be explored. Uncertainty in the Validity of Tests for Small Samples of ,Examinees How accurate is the information regarding validity that is obtained by poolingdata across small samples relative to that obtained by usi4 large samples?What are the effects on decision making of varying degrees of certaintyregarding test validity?Psychometricians and test developers have traditionally relied onlarge samples of examinees on which to norm tests and to measuretheir reliability and a li d i .Emphasis on people with handicappingconditions, however, has confirmed what has been learned in workwith minority groups. practical techniques for developing and vali-dating tests used with small samples must be refined. Fortunately, asnoted in Chapter 5, new techniques for pooling data across institutionsand years have been developed for minority groups and offer promisefor work with handicapped examinees.The main advantage of using large samples is that they increasethe. re-searcher's confidence in the results.. A test developed on asample of 50 people may have the same validity coefficient forpredicting job success as a test developed on a sample of 1,000, butthe larger sample produces more reliable statisticsthat is, estimatesthat vary less from sample to sample. However; increasing samplesize is only one statistical method for reducing uncertaint; poolingresults from small samples over time or across situations is another.There should be an investigation of the effects of pooling techniqueson the accuracy of information about tests, especially their predictivevalidity.Furthermore, rather little is known about how information regard-ing error in test scores or in predictions based on test scores is used.by decision makers. Therefore, there should be an exploration of theways in which information on the uncertainty in test scores or in testvalidity is used by decision makers. This task could be accomplishedby reviewing measures of reliability and validity of a sample of testsand surveying a sample-of people who use those tests to determineif there is a relationship between the uncertainty of the scores and 156 146 ABILITY TESTING OF HANDICAPPED PEOPLEtheir predictiNe power, on the one hand, and the ways the scores areused, on the other. HANDICAPPED PEOPLE AND THE TESTING SITUATIONEen though this panel has amassed information on the testing ofhandicapped people from many sources, there remain importantareas in which little information is aNailable. Fie research topics aresuggested below. *Types of Modifications What are the characteristics, particularly regarding handicapping conditions,of handicapped people who request test modifications, in comparison withthose who take standard administrations, in .comparison with those whorequest ,test waiyers, and in comparison with those who choose not toparticipate in activities requiring tests?The panel has compiled the aNailable data on the frequency of useof ,arious modifications of seeral educational, employment, andcertification or licensing tests. Howeer, the picture presented bythese data is far from complete. In many cases The type or seerityof the handicapping condition of the people.requesting each modi-fication is not known, it is not known how many handicapped peopletook the test in the standard form or requested a waher, and it isnot known how many other eligible handicapped pebple do notfora N a riet y of reasonsrequest modified tests. The panel suggests thatsuch information be collected from examinees in the future becauseof its utility in at least two regards. first, the information could beused to help future handicapped examinees decide w hat modificationswould be most appr opriate, sewnd, the information In ould be essential_in validity studies. *Alternatives and Supplements to Standardized Paper-and-PencilTestsWhat procedures that may he used as alternatiyes or, supplements tostandardized paper-and-pencil tests offer special promise of application forpeople with handicapping conditions?Although test scores are but one part Of ihe information used tomake decisions about people, there have been many criticisms of .c.. Recommended Research 147standardized testing and many calls foi alternatiyes. There has notbeen much eyidence of success in finding pr,actical and did alter-natiy es, howeYer, eYen for the nonhandicapped population. The needfor such alternatiyes and supplements may be seen as even greaterfor the' handicapped population since the meaning of scores on manytests is called into question by the modification of testing procedures.The panel therefore I ewmmends research on the means of as-sessing the abilities (*handicapped people other than with standard-ized paper-and-pencil tests. In the educational sphere, in addition toteachers' ratings, the use of a questionnaire on a student's accom-plishments may have promise. The Graduate Record ExaminationBoard has begun work on something similar for its general studentpopulation. Performance tests, long used by rehabilitation agencies,ma% provide an alternative to paper-and-pencil tests in the employ-inent sphere. Assessment centers, which are becoming popular inselecting business executives, cost from $300 to between S3,000 and$1,000 per person and may require several days to administer, butthey may be useful in selecting high-le% el professionals with handi-capping conditions.Studies of such methods should assess their practicalitythe easewith which they can tie applied to handicapped peopleas 1,vell astheir demands on time and money. Studies should also attempt todetermine the potential for systematic discrimination against handi-capped people and should compare that risk with the potential orknown bias of standardized'paper-and-pencil tests. The %aridity ofalternathe method.s of assessment should also be examd if collec-tion of the necessan dtita is feasible. Failing aertraleyaluation tec hniques, the practicality of compiling quantitativedata necessary for measures of Yalidity should be examined. Reason-able but nonquantitatiy e or nonobjctiye means of judging the relativequalm of the alternative measures should be explored. , Attitudes of Testing Personnel Toward Handicapped PeopleWhat are the effects of attitudes toward handuapped people held b testingpersiinnel on the test mines Of handkapped indiciduals and on the uses ofthosi! s( ores%It isideh reported that nonhandkapped individuals have a varietyof attitudes toward handicapped people, many of them inaccui ate ordhunninaton. Soi.w iesearch shows that certain people react real-isticallY toward blind people w hum they know but are afraid of or 1 58 148 ABILITY TESTING OF HANDICAPPED PEOPLEhostile toward the blind as a group. Nonhandicapped peOple mayassurne handicapped people generally to be incompetent, althoughin some instances they are believed to possess superior abilities. (Areview of the research literature on labeling of handicapped peopleappears in Appendix A.) . The panel has particular interest in the attitudes of personnel whointeract with handicapped people with regard to testscounselors,examiners, readers, amanuenses, and those who use test scores inmaking decisions. The panel recommends that studies of the attitudes.of testing personnel in a variety of settings be conducted.Data for the studies could be drawn from samples of four groups:(1) people who administer tests to handicapped examinees for edu-cational, emPloyment, and licensing purposes; (2) people who assisthancrcapped examinees with the tests, tha, is, read for them, signfor them, and so on; (3) people who score the tests or evaluate thescoTes, and (4) people who make decisions on the basis of test scores.For purposes of clarification and corroboration, data should begathered in a variety of ways, sitch as attitude questionnaires andinterviews with testing personnel as well as interviews with handi-capped examinees. The goals of the studies should be to estimate the',nature and extent of the effect of the attitudes of testing personnelon the test performance of handicapped people and on the use ofthose scores and to guide the development of strategies for eliminat-ing, mitigating, or offsetting these effects. Requesting Test ModificationsWhat information do handicapped individuals who may need to request amodified test currently have, and what do they need to make the bestinformed decisions?Handicapped examinees currently make a decision regarding teststhat their. nonhandicapped peers are not asked to make: 'whichmodification of a test offers the most advantageous testing arrange-ment. There is some fear that test takers with handicapping conditionsmay not have sufficient information from test publishers or counselorsto choose most wisely among the alternatives available. People withmild handicapping conditions may have a very difficult choice tomake. whether to take the standard administration, which may bemore troublesome but will be reported without a special identifier,or to take a modified form, which may be somewhat easier but willfor most tests result in a flagged score and greatly reduced intg- 1 5 9 _Recommended Research 149pretability. People recently disabled may also have an extremelydifficult choice because they may not yet have acquired a facility forany modified form, they are likely to find both choosing the formand actually taking the test troublesome. The pervasiveness andseverity of the problems associated with choosing one type of testadministration or er others are unknown and could be investigatedby surreying handicapped examinees. Questions relating to knowl-edge about and attitudes toward test modifications could be answeredin a small study or could be incorporated into a larger study. Coaching and Experience in Taking TestsWhat are the effects on later test performance of handicapped people'sexperiences with tests, including the experiences cumulated over the yearsin school as well asttee specifictraining in test coaching courses?Evidenceboth experimental and anecdotalsuggests that if one'sexperience in taking tests is limited, then test performancecpay beartificially suppressed by lack of familiarity with common testingprocedures and test-taking strategies. Results of studies of coachingand the experience of adults taking tests long after they havecompleted their schooling (when they are unfamiliar with tests andtend to score lower than one might predict) support this finding.Furthermore, for handicapped students the tests they take in ele-mentary and secondary schools may bear little resemblance to mod-ifications of standardized tests for college admission. Therefore, thepanel recommends conducting studies to determine if handicappedpeople's experience with standardized tests seriously disadvantagesthem. .Two general ty pes of studies are suggested. experimental studiesof the effects for handicapped examinees of coaching, that is, specialtraining in strategies to use in taking tests, and nonexperimentalstudies (probably using carefully matched samples) of handicappedstudents with varying degrees of experience with standardized tests.Studies of the second ty pe may be helpful in shaping policies regardingthe exemption of handicapped. people from testing requirements.Studies of coaching would help in measurbg the efficacy of offeringcoaching courses for handicapped people, either courses essentiallythe same as those for nonhandicapped people or courses with specialinstruction on how to handle modified test forms. One must be clearin generalizing from either type of study to distinguish betweenintensive training in test-taking skills and long-term exposure to sests. 160 150 ABILITY TESTING OF HANDICAPPED PEOPLELongitudinal Studies through Transition StagesWhat information and advice do handicapped people receive, what strategiesdo theyuse, and what problems do they face as they encounter tests at pointsof transition in their livTests are usedto influence decisionsat important transition pointsin people's lives. Those transition points may be especially critical forpeople who are trying to overcome disadvantages in order to partic-ipate fully in American society, including some handicapped people.At times when they may need special support, handicapped peoplemay receive inaccurate informatiop or inappropriate counseling. Whatproblems do handicapped people ace, what advice do they receive,and what strategies do they use as ey prepare to move from highschool to coflege, or from school to wo k, or from sheltered workshopsto regular jobs, or from life with farm les to life on their own? Howwell do various techniques in counselin and rehabilitation serve the.,needs of handicapped people in transiti n?To answer these and similar question , the panel recommendslongitudinal research following a sample of andicapped people fromhigh school through their early to middle \u00e8venties. Data should becollected and analyzed on a wide variety topics, including anydifficulties that occur in testing situations, t e relationships of testscores to other variables (school experience an\u00e8 performance, teach-ers' ratings, socioeconomic variables, and othe s), the consequencesoflabelingon a person's expectations and pe formance; and theconsequences on decisions made abou ,an indiv idual. Datashould include perceptions of the handicapped pe Vie, their parents,teachers, employers, and counselors as well as m e objective meas-ures, such as test scores, grades, and other measu es of apiitude orperformance. Sample design should be given espe 'ally careful con-sideration to balance the desire to have a homogen ous sample forease of management and a heterogeneous sample Ipr ease of gen-eralizability. HANDICAPPED PEOPLE AND THE DECISION-MAKI G PROCESSMore important than the test scores themselves are the 1ays in whichthey are used to influence decisions abotrt people. Th use of thescores is especially critical for handicapped people sirkce they areseldom normed and are often flagged as a signal that th y cannot beinterpreted in the same ways as scores that result from t e standardadministration of a test. lGj Recommended Research 151*Role of Test Scores in the Decision-Making Process Howare test scores actualls used in making deusions regarding handkappedpeople for education, employment, rehabilitation, and certification or licen-sing purposes?The information the panel has uncovered on how various institutions,(schools, employers, rehabilitation agencies, and certification or licen-sing agencies) use tests for handicapped people is somewhat frag-mented, and the information ay ailable in employ ment settings isespecially sketchy. Since more complete information would be helpful,we recommend suryeys of key personnel in schools, employ mentsettings, rehabilitation agencies, and certification or licensing agencies.Information regarding employ ment selection and placement is es-pecially difficult to obtain because of the small numbers of handi-capped appficants and employees and because of the lack of large-scale tests or systematic selection procedures. Howeler, that infor-mation iscritical in identifying and oyercoming barriers to theemploy ment of qualified people with handicapping conditions. Thesurveys should describe current policies and compare any policiesthat are different for handicapped and nonhandicapped people.They should seek to distinguish between policies for handicappedpeople that seem fair and effective and those that do not. Suchsurveys should also estimate the prevalence of different policies andcompare the stated objecthes of the policies with what is actuallyachieved. -The suryeys should be conducted so that results can bereported separately for various ty pes of institutions or organizations.large state universities compared with small liberal arts' colleges,various ty pes of business or industreies, priy ate compared with publicrehabilitation agencies, and so on. Such work should be linked tostudies of the effects of testing (or of Yarious selection proceduresand policies), and every effort should be made to determine whatprocedures are actually used, not just purported to be used. Flagged Scores Flow are flagged test stores auutdIr used IL making deusions about handi-capped applicants%When admissions tests for postsecondary .schools are taken undernonstandard conditions, the score reports to the schools make noteof that fact and thereby notify the admissions officers that the 1 62 152 ABILITY TESTING.6F HANDICAPPED PEOPLEapplicants aLe probably handicapped. Yet preadmission, inquiry re-garding handicapping conditions is prohibited in the federal regu-lations on the assumption that the information vvould be used toapplicants' disadYantage more often than to their adYantage. Someadmissions officials argue, howeyer, that the flags on the test scoresare used to the adYantage of handicapped applicants: if the flaggedscore is high and other material corrqborates it, the student isadmitted, if the flagged score is low , it is ignored and other informationis used to deckle about admitting the applicant. A suryey of actualpractice might corroborate this iew or reyeal different uses, or, atthe. yery least, Yariations in the use of flagged scores. Furthermore,It is not known how often a flagged test score is the only indicationin an applicant's portfolio that he or she is handicapped. St*thinformation could be reyealed by the applicant's entollment in aspecial school, program, or classes, in letters of recommencLition, incertain extracurricular activ,ities; or by the candidate's voluntarystatement.While there has been research on the effects of labeling a personas handicapped, the sum of eidence yields contradictory conclusions.Additional knowledge would greatly aid in formulating policy. . There-fore, the panel recommends research to describe the current use offlagged scores. A sample of individual cases should be followedthrough:the admissions process to attempt to ascertain the effect offlags on the interpretation of scores and on the weight of tlie ss.oresin the decision-making process. Admittedly, this kiild of study isdifficult to conduct because of necessary assurances of confideOality ,and the resultsWill be suspect if the admissions officers know explicitlyabout the goals of the study. Therefore, the stutly design is critical,and the study may need to be supplemented witit an experiment inwhich admissions officers make decisions regarding fqpotheticalhandicapped and nonhandicapped candidates, with control yariablesrelating to their qualifications. The panel acknowledges that thedifficulties may lead to esults that are less than completely satisfactorybut behey es this topic is important enough to warrant study. Models for the Decision-Making Process What decision r ules and models are used in determining vv hether handK appedindividuals shoukl be admitted to schools, or employed, or aat ded er tificatesand licenses?

Incidence of Handicapping Conditions-%hat are the exisung sources of data on handicappecfpeople, and hou canther be made compatible-- f:1oi4 can definitions of handicapping rnditionsused far a %ariety of purposes Er, different groups be made comparable'Nearly every pieceoflekallegislation and every agency or orga-nization dealing with handicapped people uses a different definition-of handicapping condition or handicapped person. One reason, forthe differences stems from the particusion or concern of aparticular, act oi age,ncy.It. would be naive to expect an agencyconcerned about the placement of elementary school students ineducational programs to define its population of interest in a wayperfectly compatible witk.that of an oi'sganization concerned with theemployment of adults. A second reason for the differences is that,for the many types of disability, the severity of an impairment isdescribed in different ways. For example, hearing impairments arescaled in relation to unimpaired auditory acuity and may be relatedto a specific range of pitch. Blindness is scaled very differently,however, and here are several markedly different types of visualImpairment (foample, total blindness, perception of 'light only,and restriction of visual field) that are not amehable to clear andconuse comparison. For motor handkaps, there is no widely acceptedscale of severity. The lack of a common scale makes many potentiallyvaluable comparisons across handicaps difficult if not impossible.Since classification schemes differ, and estimates vary widely, e,;eriwhen defin,itions seem comparable, we urge that steps'be taken tomake the various definitions of handicap'ping conditions as compa-rable as is practical. One possible way to do'this would be to hold aconference withappropriate representatises from the National HealthSurvey., the Social SecurityAdministrasion, other relesant agencies,and, professional and adkocacy associations along with apple expe-rienced in the statistical aspects of demography. The tapics to becovered should include:Summaries of sources of data on handicapped people. Tfiesummaries could be organized by type of dfsability, ty pe of source(for example, public' or private sector), or use oPthe data (for example,administrative or research). 1 Recommended Research 1552. Characteristics of each data source. Attention should be givento how to combine data from various sources that hae differentpurposes, use different definitions of disabilities, and employ differentmethods of data collection.3. Additional analyses of existing data. Is there additional infor-mation that could be obtained from 9isting data sets? In particular,can hner tabulations be made for rlie and severity of handicappingcondition? Is there Information relating to partkular concerns of thepaneFand the Office for Civil Rights (for example, testing, education,and employment) that can be obtained from existing sources?4. Data for the future. What data collection efforts are anticipatedfor the fture? How can shortcomings of existing data sets beovercome? What are the most important questions to be answeredby analysis of:the data? What efforts should feceie highest priority?How should various efforts be coordinated? How convincing are thearguments fin maintaining different definitions of handicapping.; condiudns in different surveys? The results of such a conferencewould be tiseful to both researchers and policy makers in the privatesector and in government. Such a conference should increase thelikelihood that unnecessary duplication of effort is reduced, that thedat7a collected by diverse sources would be compatible, and that thedat; would be collected and analyzed in the most useful and com-prehensible fashion..\".Social Indicators Regarding Handicapped People How can one (lescribe the soual and economic characteristics of the lives ofpeople with handicapping conditions?There are a number of signs that the lives of handicapped peopleare changing markedly withregard to e54ucation, work, and inde-pendent !iv* arrangements. For policy .Tnd administrative purposesIt is Important to have accurate and current information about socialand economic characteristics of the lives of these people. Therefore,the panel recommends that social indicators regarding handicappedpeople be compiled.I he book Soctallnduators III (U.S. Department of C)mmerce 1980),produced by the Bureau of the Census, should serve as a model forwork on the handicapped population.jhe new work (whether .aseparate volume or part of a more generai publication) should presentdata on social, ewnomic, educational, and health characteristics ofhandicapped people. The quality cif data from differek 'sources 166 (156 ABILITY TESTING OF HANDIGAPPEP PEOPLEshould be indicated as they are compiled and published. Data thatrelate social, educational, health, and emplosment factors should belocated (or collected), analyzed, and presented.As the existing data are.-compiled, consideration should be gisento- thher questions to lie asked and other data to be collected. Inaddition, the desirability of producing such a compilation periodicallyand charting changes or trends should be assessed. It is likely thatthe Office of Federal Statistical Policy and Standards in the U.S.Departhient of Commerce could offer saluable assistance in planningor executing this project. Epidemiology of the Handicapped Population. How can.one describe the inciderice and distribution of %arms handicappingconditiow, across populltion groups defined b% age, sex, racial or ethnicmemberIip, social and economic characteristics, and tire like. What are theknown causes of sarious conditions? What are the 'projected needs of thesegroups%Prot iding sersices to meet the diterse*needs of handicapped peoplecould be planned more effectit ely if information about the incidenceand distribution of. tarious handicappingconditions were know n.Since certain groups, say children affected ut wero by their mothers'rubella, commortly hate a unique set of needs, knowing the incidenceof rubella among pregnant women in tarious cohorts would make itrelatitely easy to predict the future strUcture and probable needs ofa segment of the population. To follow this example further, schoolsfor the deaf could plan more effectitely and testing organizationscould predict the demand fpr gettain types of modifications ifinformation on rubMla were known. Therefore, studies of the epi-demiology of disabilities would be usef ill for a widerange of situations.The major' toi;:tics that should be insestigated are the incidence,distribution, and likely or know n causes t)f arious disabilities andthe educational, medical, and ;pcial needs of people with t ariousdisabilities.People ,with multiple handicaps often hate special needs or acombination of needs that may not be readily met in existingadministratite arrangeprents for pro% iding sersices.-In addition, onehanailap by oi- may masquerade as another, creatmgthe possibility that some needs are not met. To allow for better,informed planning in the i,,,hort and long run, the,panel ,t1sp ret.om-mends that research, be conducted to pro% ide aefurestimates of the 6 7 I RecommenVed Research 157 asiLe of groups ssith multiple hagdicaps and to describe their needs atvarious points in the life c)cle.

GUSKIN Federal law and our beliefs in equal opportunity require that decisionson educational admissions and employee se.lecfion be unbia.d. Peoplewith handicapping conditions must not be denied admissio0o schoolsor employment positions because they are members of a particulargroup or class. One way to enforce this principle is to deny access tointormation on group membership to decision makers. This approachmay be feasible when decisions are made largely on the basis ofestablished credentials that provide objective data, such as test scores,high school grades, employ ment experience, and educational back- . ground. In these cleg, such potentia* biasing information as age,sex, race, disability, and religion can be deleted rrom applicationforms. This solution to the problem assumes that, if decision makersknow the particular characteristic of a person, in our case, that aperson has a handicapping condition, then the decision will blibiasedagainst the person. This paper reviews the published literature relatingto that hypothesized biasing effect.What kind of theory and tesearch is relevant to this probl m?Sociological and social, psychological writers and investigators h vesttreen interested in such topics as bias, prejudice, and stereotypes forover 50 years (see, for ex'ample, Rice 1.926). In more recent work *Dm literature review was drawn from a larger paper by the author commissioneby the Panel on Testing of Handicapped People169178C. 4170 Appendix A ,oter the past 15 years, psychologists and 8ducators have becomeinterested itj. the efrects of expectations in the laboratory (Rosenthal1976) andthe school (Dusek 1975), sociologists hat e been examiningthf'quences of labeling someone as det iant (Schurr 1971), andpersonnel selection researchers hate become concerned with inter-% ie}ver bias against women and minority group members (Artey1979a,b). There is-salso a umsiderable body of literature on bias intesting (Jensen 1980) and in sele,ctit e admissions in higher educatiOn(Carnegie Counul tin Polity Studies in Higher Education 1977).Finally, in the past few year's cognitite psychologists have protidednew approaches to deal with the classification and integration ofinformativn that bears directly on how stereotypes about groups areformuhated and what their consequences are (Hamilton 1979). Be-of, the-scope and size of the potentially relevant works, thisretiew is highly selectite and draws most hextily on those studiesdeemed most critical.In addition to the larger bo dy of reletant work outlined abotie,research and theory dealing specifically with reactions to the handi-capped are accumulating (Bartel and Guskin 1980). Topics includeattitudes and Jones 180, Yuker et al.1970), reactions-to integiation (Semmel et al. 1979), labeling and bias(Guskin I978, MacMillan et al. 1974, Rains et al. 1975), and thepresumed\u00b0negatite consequences of knotting that inditiduals arehandicapped (Hobbs ON ey (1979b) has pointed out, stereUty pes may influence a decisionin three ways. (I) their general negatite effect may lead directly torejection, (2) the content of the group stereoty pe may be incdnsistentith the occupational stereoty pe or job expectations, (3) the stereoty peniat lead the decision maker to use a different \u00a7et of criteria.orstandards in etaluating the applipnt. To illustrate each of theseinfluences: (1) attitudes toward the mentally ill may be t ery negatite,leading to few job ofkrs, (2) expectations regarding the mentallyretarded may Jead employers to select them for unSkilled but notskilled jobs, (3).the blind applicant for college who has high schooldiploma but was in the bcIttorn half of the class may be admitted tocollege because et en ttis marginal performance is seen as a sign thatthe, injit Klual i.highlmotitated and intelligent whereas a sigbtecpersim c redenuals would be judged inadequate.As Aryey (1979b) points out, interviewers may also become bias d I 7 j Appendix A 171as a result of dif ferenti.il behaf ior thepart of the discomfort or misinterpretations by the interfiewer. Thus,interviewers may experience tension in interviewing a candidate Witha speech defeet and therefore may attribute poor social or intellectualskills to the applicant. In the case In hich decisions are based onwritten documents ralher than Inter-fief% s, the same phenomenonmay appear in letters of reference from those ith only superficialcontacts with the applicant, whose disc oral ort is copfeyed in theletterWe hafe seer?, then, how information about handicaps may leadto negatife outcomes and also how positife effects may e .obtained.What evidence is there that these actuallv occur? .EMPIRICAL FINDINGS ON THE EFFECTS OF KNOWINGSOMEONE IS HANDICAPPEDtStereotypes and Attitudes About the HandicappedIn thrs type-of study, interffews, questionnaires, or other paper-and-psncil inhruments are employed to obtain answers to such questionsas. What do you think a typical-mentally ill person would be like?HOW willing would you be to hate each of the following people as aroommate: epileptic, amputee, athlete, delinquent? . .. Would yoube employ\"adisabled worker? rn all of these cases, theirespondent h gif en almost no information about the person exceptthe bandicap, and efen that information is usUally a popular labelrather than a clear picture of the handicapping condition. rn addition,these studies usually infolfe a forced choice ,situation. That is, theperson may choose which answer to gife but may not indicate thatfhe feels he liad inadequSte information to make a judgment. Underthese conditions, it is not surpri&ing that reactions to the handicapped -areJess favorable than ;to the nonhandicapped and that there is ahierarchy of preferentes for handicaps (Yuker et al. 1970, Jones ,. 1980). ..-We may illustrate a study uf 'stereotypes by examining some of thefindin0 of Gottwald's (1970) nalional.public opinion surf ey on pubkcinformation about mental retardation. On one part of the surf ey,.\"\"(respondents were asked to describe g \"mentally retarded- perSon anda \"normal\" person on a series of 16 bipolar adjective scales Theretarded person was seen mpre negatifely than tfie normal ersonon each of the 16 scales. Hie largest differences were on Msane kane,useless-useful, ,fick-healthy, and ignorant-ediu ated, The smallest dif-i 1 the ugly-beautiful, cruel-kind, dis-honest-honest, smilier andless4epresentative samples(e.g., Gus kin 1963a,b), which hate also found that-mental retardatiohis associated by others with incompetence and mental illness and isseen as very different from delinquency. .An illustration of an Attitude study that provides evidence on ahierarchy of handicaps is found in an investigation by 5hears ancJensema (1969-), who first 'asked 94 normal adults to rank 10 \"an-omAlies\" in terms `of perceived severity and then had them indicatetheir degree of acceplance of each condition on a series situations_-varying in both severity and willingness to Accept people withthe condition, the most positive reactions were to theamputee, blind,and wheekhair conditions, intermediate reactions were to the harelip,stutterer, and deaf-mute conditions; there was a more negatiyereatnon to the cerebral palsied, and the_most unfavOrable reactionswere to the mentally ill, retarded; and homosexual conditions. The'most relevarttAndingsfor this paper are those that indicate how,willing respondents would be to work with each type of person.Approximately 90 percent say triey would ,,work with those who wereaniputees, in wheelchairs, or blind, mou would wiik with those harelip (80%), stutterers (74%) fewer would work wiaithe mentally11 (37%), retarded (30%), or homosexual (2.7%).A variant of this approach that is more relvant to die issue at handis the investigation of employers' ratings of employ mein acceptability.Rickard and-colleagues (1963) studied, 105 personnel directors andschool administrators and repbrted that former tuberculosis t)altientswere preferred, followed byliiheelchatt handicapped:then deafpeop14, epileptics were the least preferred. A similat study (Nikoloff1962) asked 197 priYtcipals to evaluate the employability of handl- -- capped people as teacheu. Blind OR deaf people were judged to' beless employable thari arose with a slpeech handicap,' who were in turn'less employable than those with an artificial leg or crutch. The Influence bf liandicap Labels on Evaluation of IndividualsThe second category of studies attempts to test explicitly the'assump-tion that stereotypes and attitudes do'in fact Affect the way we reactto others. Subje(as are asked to.make ratings after they are 'presented , Apptndix A 173 sob%informatiop about an individual IA itlror without inc&4ting that theindnidual is handicapped. The other information m4: be presentedin a verbal.sketch (e.g., Guskin 1963b, Jaffe 1966, The videotape may be of atrained nonhandicapped actor (e.g., Gottlieb 1974, 1975.1) or of theunrehearsed behaior of a handicapped indiidual (e.g., Guskin1962a,b). Furthermore, the sketches-or tapes may be structured orselected to ary systematically with the behaior of the indiidual.Two uhestigationslby Gottlieb (1974,.1975a) illustrate this para-digm. In the first study (Gottlieb 1974), elementary school childrenjudged a child obsered on a ideotape as performing either com-petently or incompetently on a spelling task. The obsered child wasdescribed either as a fifth-grade pupil or as being enrolled in a special,class for.retarded children. The obsened child was actually the sameon both tapes and had been instructed to perform competently forthe \"competent\" segment. The study was carried out in 'two schools,one middle-class and one lower-class. The label did not hae an effecton either school, and only in the middle-class school did the com-petence manipulation result in differential judgments.an the second inv-estigation (Gottlieb 1975a), the design as similarbut videotapes V-aried in aggressiye beh.aior. The same hild wasshown either playing quietly with clay at hJ,s desk or \"acting o t\"\"withit. throwing the day on the floor, stomOlig ora banging 4 ith hisfist. This time the retarded label and the ag essienes4nd thtinteraction of. the two ariableshad significant e children'sjudgments. when the obsened aggressieness and retarded label-were combined, the judgments (ratings and social distance measures)were substantially more negatie than could be predicted from theseparate effects of each variable. One interpretation of these findingsis that judges tend to \"normaliie\" when the data is not fully corhincing,interpreting the erbal or behavioral information as possibly noi-mal.However, the combination of thee two negatiye pieces of inforalionJushes the judge over the threshold:, for perceiying the child asdeviant.Gottlieb's two studies (1974, 1975a) illustrate the diversity of findingsof studies in this area. Handicapping information may lead to morenegative evaluations, but the effect is highly dependent on otherinformation presented 'about the indiidual. Posithe information willtend to neutrallie the stereotype while negative information may be 1 82 174 Appendix Af aCcentuated by alp stereotype. Of course, if the other information isunambiguously negative, the stereotype may even result in -morefavcirable judgments (Golin 1970). Judgments of ResumesOne highly relevant variant of the aboveApproach presents subjectswith simulated job resumes with or without labeling information andinstructs them to rate the suitability of the applicant for employmentand'or an appropriate salary offer. Studies using this method toexamine bias resulting from race, sex, or age information as well ashandicaps are summarized by Arvey (1979b). Studies using thisparadigm with handicap labels have been reported by Krefting and'Brief (1977), Rose and Brief (1979), a.nd Shaw (1972).The Shaw (1972) study was designed to examine the differentialeffects of negative 'stereotypes on evaluation of candidates for diffe;-ent occupations. The stereotyping information {has eit er gender(male or female), state of financial and domestic affairs (married ordiTorced and having personal financial problems), orp1sical health(no problem specified or 4fF, a withered. arm, and weak visionrequiring glasses). Subjects *ere 132 college recruiters, roughly halfof whom were seeking science and engineering graduates and halfseeking management trainees.. They were given resumes with pho-togr,aphs, and half were randomly given Nariants of the resumes that lhdudedone of the three ty pes of stereotyping information. Since,the major interest of the author was in the difference between the1,sct occupations in the stereotyping effect, they never did test thebiasing effect itself but only the occupational impact on the effect.There was no differential effect of occupation when the candidatehad a physical health problem. -However, the author presenteddescriptive daka ahd noted that the health problem led to morepositive ratings on an adjective check list Allan did the ,controlcondition. -The differences were smaller and less consistent whensubjects were asked to make ratings relativeto hiring the candidate,but there was clearly no trend to reject the handicapped applicant.Krefting.and Brief (1977) examined the effects of applicant disa-bility and work experience or judgments of a set of applicationmaterials by 145 college students. The position applied f'or was atypist's position, and all of the information provided was Positive intone, indicating the candidate was qualified. Under the disabilitycondition, the applicant was indicated to be confined to a w heelchairdue to an automobile accident. A physician's report stated that the 3 Appendix A 175applicantis a paraplegic \u00abffifined to a wheelchair, but her con cf tionhas been stable fort-0%er fou,r years.

Onoterall rating of the applicant. no main effect of disabilits was found,but there was significant interaction between disabilits. and experi-ences While the disabled applicant without experience was preferredto the inexperienced nyndisabled, when both applicants were expe-rienced,. the nondisabled was preferred. (Another was of describingthe finding is that among the disabled, the inexperienced applicantW a s s(nnew hat preferred. for the nondisabled, the experienced ap-plicant was highlt preferred.) This result was contrary nithe authors'expectations that there would be a generally negatit e reaction to thedisabled but that this-would be counteracted IA experience. A relatedinteraction that mat explain the oterall ratings is that on potentialfor staying. 1.-co- the nondisabled, those with experience are seen asmore likely to stat than the inexperienced, for the disaHed, theinexperienced are seen as more likels to stay.Rose and Brief (1979) compared the effects of two ty pes of disability(epileptic and amputee) on et aluations of candidates for jobs aryingin degree of public \u00abmita\u00ab and degree of superb isory responsibdity.As in the pret ious studs, the applkant was described as highlyqualified in the simulated application materials and the disabilits wasdescribed as under control and not influencing job performance.Ratings were made on a series of employment-related scales by 211adt anced business administration students, and a judgment was madeabout whether the applicant should be hired. The ef fects of thedisabihts were examined on 11 measures The only negatite effectof disability was a loner salart rating for'the amputee than for theepileptic or nondisabled. Posuite effects of disability were foundwhen wmparing the epileptic condition with the control on satisfac-tort relalionship with clients and customers and working well withother emplosees. 1 he authors point out that their positit e findingsmay be limited- to the case where clients are described as highlyqualified_['hese findings on judgments of resumes are et en less supportit eof a negatit e stereots ping ef fect of handicap information than the .14 -,176 Appendix Astudies involving verbal descriptions or videotapes. Perhaps theincorporation in the resume studies of information describing positiv equalities that are directly rele% ant to employ ment leads to a discounting'bf negative stereotypes.,Field Experiments Examining the Effects of HandicapInformationA few investigations go beyond the simulation uf decision making toobserve what behavior occurs w hen handicap information is ploy idedor withheld in a naturalistic environment. In a series of studies, Kleckhas examined the effect of a simulatei1 disability (amputee in w heel-chair) on the way others interact both verbally persoh (Kleck 1975).In one \"amputee\" wasan inter% iewer, it %as found that there was greater physiologicalarousal ((;SR) w hen interacting with the amputee than w hen inter-acting with a nondisabled interviewer, shorter answers were given toquestions from the amputee than from the nondisabled, and theperson interviewed expressed more frequent conformity to theinter% 'ewer's presumed beliefs w hen the latter was an amputee. Theresults suggest greater anxiety or tension and less \"naturalness\" wheninteracting with a disabled person.In a second study, Kleck (1968) filmed the behavior of the subjectbeing inter% iewed and had him rate the inter% favorable impressions of the disabled inter% iewer than thenondisabled, less MON ement in the presence of the disabled, and lessvariation in focus of visual attention w hen being inter% iewed by theamputee. As in the earlier study, opinions were distorted in thedirection of that of the amputee. These findings also imply lessfreedom or more tension when interacting with the disabled.In a third study (Kleck 1969), the nondisabled person was askedto train two other people in Origami (oriental paper folding) afterbeing trained herself.,One of the people she trained was an vampu tee\",both were confederates of the experimenter. The training sessionswere monitored by a hidden television camera. Kleck measured thedistance between the trainer and her student and found that theaverage distance Was less with the \"normal\" than the \"disabled\"person. This effect occurred, however, only in the first teachingsession', not the second. Similarly, a difference in impressions, w hichfavored the amputee, occ urred only after the first and not the secondsession. Finally, disabled learners in both sessions were rated as more i 83... itppendix A 177interested and motiyated in the le rning task. As in the first twoincestigations, N e r bal statements by,tthe nondisabled seemed to bebiased in-f-of the disabled but iphy erbal measures suggested lesscomfort with the disabled. The third siudy adds the suggestiye findingthat some of the differences diminish Ater a period of time.A series of studies by Jones (1968).examined the influence of thepresence of a simulated \"blind\" person on the performance of otherpeople on a learning task. While there was no obsery able influenceon the learning task, subjects said their performance was impairedas a result of interaction with the blind person.Farina and his associates haye conducted a rdated series of inves-tigations. Farina ,md Ring (1965) examined the influence of inter-action with a presumed mentally ill person on performance on acooperauye game. Both people were naiye subjects but none, one, orboth were priyatek informed that the other was mentally ill. It wasfound that perceiying the coworker as mentally ill enhanced per-formance. Howeser, w hen the coworker was perceiyed as me Ilyrigill, subjects preferred to work alone, they also tended to blame t\\mentally ill partner for inadequacies in their joint performance. Theresults make clear that discomfort may accompany improyed per-formance under certain conditions.Although it number of studies have manipulated information inteaching situations, modeled on the well-known and highly. criticizedexpectancy study by Rosenthal and Jacobson (1968), the emphasis inthese studies has generally been on measuring outcomes for learners,and the findings hay e usually been disappointing (Dusek 1975).Furthermore, few of these studies hate invoked the handicapped,and ey enjewer hate manipulated information about the handicap(as opposed to information about general potential).Guskin (1978) summarized the expectancy findings as they' relateto mental retardation. It appears that while real differences in abilitycan influence the behayior of those who interact with the retarded,it is more difficult to demonstrate effects of artificially induced beliefsabout competence ley el on interaction. One exception to the generallynegatne findings on this topic is provided by Farina and colleagues(1976). College students were asked to participate in an experimentat a state training school, supposedly to determine what kind ofstudents worked best with what kind of residents. Students were toldthey would meet someone who was either mentally retarded, mentallyill, or normal. The person they actually met was a confederate of theexperimenter. Fhe interaction was a pair of learning tasks, in the(irst of which the student was to administer shocks when the learner 3186 178 Appendix Amade errors. The major behacioral measures were the magnitudeand the dukation of shocks administered. (These were got actuallyreceired b ifie confederates.) It was found that mentally retardedconfederates were administered less intense shocks and of less durationthan either the \"mentally ill\" or \"normal\" confederates. There wastlso a significant interaction between the confederate and the label.One of the four confederates was administered longer shocks as thementa4 retarded than in both of the other conditions.'Thus the behacioral findings of this siudy indicate that the mentallyretarded label can hace a differential effect on the performance ofothers and that the effect appears to be supponicer at least in thist),pe of learning situation where less may be expected of the retarded.The differential effects of the characteristics of particular \"retarded\"indiciduals on others' reactions is also of interest, since some retardeduidic iduals may actually elicit more punitiNe responses as a result of.the label. Ocerall, then, these interaction experiments suggest highlyaried outcomes of thinking someone is handicapped, depending onw hether what is measured is nom erbal or cerbal or task performanceand on the interactive demands of the si uation.diReactions to Interaction with Handicapt6,1 Job ApplicantsIn an extension of their studies of reactions to mentally ill people,Farina and his associates hace carried out a series of incestigationsof workers' ecaluations of former mental patients following jobinterciews. In each study, workers were told that management was-exploring the use of fellow workers to carry out job inteniews andecaluate candidates and was 'also interested in the job potential offormer mental patients. Before each inteniew, the worker was toldthat the applicant either was or was not a former mental patient. Theapplicant was the same for all interciews in each substudy and cariedfrom study to study in gender. The type of workerincluding hospital.workers, department store employees, and unher,sity physical plantemploy eescaried from study to study, but all were considered tofall within the lower socioeconomic classes. In addition to Nary irig theinformotion about hospitalization for mental illness, the inteniewsalso caned in the behaior display ed by the applicant. For half of theverNiewers in each study, ,the applicant portrayed calm, relaxedbeliacior, fo.r the other half, the applicant portrayed nerous, tensebehaNior. In all of the studies, this behacioral difference resulted insignificant ef fec tiithat the more nerNous applicant was seon muchless facorably. 1 he findings were much less consistent for tip infor-,.. 1 s 7 Appendix-A 179mation about mental illness. Generally; male workers rejected formermentai patients and women accepted them, and male former patientswere more rejected than females. Since the earlier studk imolvedsame-sex applicants and interYiewers (Farina et Hagelauer et. al.1978),examined ariations in both applicant and interiewer sex. It wasfound that women accepted both male and female former merit>patients but that men reacted differently, depending on the applicant'sgender, showing ke n, weak biasing effects for women but dramaticallynegative reactions to male former mental patients.One of the limitations of the AKA e series of studies is that theseinter% iewers were not normarly inohed in making personnel deci-sions study (Farina and Felner 1973), a confederate ofthe experimenters obtained 32 job inter6ews in manufacturing firms,--iiirdii-aring in half of these that he had been in mental hospital forthe pre% ums nine months and in the other., half that he had beentra,eling for the same period of time. The filter% iews_were surrep-titiously rewrded arid subsequently analyzed fur probability of gettinga job and interYiewer friendliness. The actual number of jobs offeredeither immediately or subsequently by telephone was tWo for theformer patient condition and four for the control condition. 06-%iously,the numbers are too small to demonstrate significant effects.Howeer, iv 'the rated probability of getting a job and friendlinessof interiewr, the former mental patient was rated significantly lowerthan the control.johrrson and Heal (1976) had an applicant approach 50 employ rnent,_agencies looking for arb as a receptionist-typist. She appeared forhalf of the intemews in a wheelchair. She was offered fewer futurejob inteniews when handicapped and was generally discouraged bythe interviewers.Unlike the prewous studies, each of. which had a single person asthe applicant in Al job inter6ews, Brand and Claiborn (1976) hadsix trained college students apply for a total of 36.advertised retaili sales jobs, presenting fhemsehes as f rner convicts, former mentalpatients, or former. tuberc'ulosis pa lents. Although the presentedwork history was marginal, approximately two thirds of the applicantswei e offered positions regardless of the stigmatizing conditions. Nosignifitant differences appeared among the three conditions. Theauthors Atributed the findings to the Ne rba I and social skills of theapplicants in the interview situation,. , Faking together the three studies of actual job interviews andstudies of worker inteiews of former. mental palients, it appears ) 188 .180 Appendix Athat handicap in formatton may bias some kinds of interviewers againstcertain types of applicants, but that this negative effect is by no meansinevitable. SUMMARY,AND DISCUSSION OF EMPIRICAL STUDIESWhat can We make of the diverse set of findings reported and' theirinconsistency with the commonly described bias against handicappedpeople? First, the studies indicate that when people know only thehandicap, they react negatively to it, and the strength of the reactionv.aries greatly by the nature and severity of the handicap.Second, information about handicap may influence judgments ofa hypothetical person presented in verbal sketches or 'of an observedindividual presented onid e o ta pe . Although negative effects havebeen demonstrated, they are highly .dependent on the particularfeatures of the person that are not related to the handicap. in manyinstances no differences are found, afid occasionally positive effectsof handicap labels are obtained. In Ithe special case in which theinformation was presented as a set of application materials for a job,three studies found either a slight positive effect or mixed positiveand negative effects, depending on the applicant's experience, thespecific disability, and the particular judgment being made.- Finally, where investigatorshave examined what happens in situ-ations in which other people interact with the handicapped individual,interpersonal behavior appears to be influenced by the haOicap,showing that the other person is uncomfortable and attributes thediscomfort to the handicapped person. Behaviors, however, may beprotective rather than negative. In those investigations in which the()interaction involves a handicapped job applicant, findings are niixed,depending on the sex of the applicant and the interviewer as well asother unspecified factors.Can we say any more than \"it dependsthat handicapping infor-mation may or may' not influence decisions iv that we cannot.predictits effect in any specific situation because there are too many othervariables that may influence the effect?\" Why are these findings notfully supportive of reports of widespread difficulty experienced byhandicapped people in obtaining jobs (e.g., Nagi et al. I972)?One clue comes from Farina's series of studies in which the jobapplicant's nervousn-ess was manipulated for half of the candidateswho were controls and half of those who were supposedly formermental patients. Nervousness consistently resulted in rejection, al-though tfts, label had mixed effects: Apparently, when applicantsdemonsirate confidence and social skills in the interview, this often ,1 9 Appendix A 181overcomes any resistance that might be established by the handicap.SimilaTly, in the studies by Gottlieb (1974, 1975a,b), and Yoshida andMeyers (1975), competence was recognized and the label \"mentallyretarded\" was ignored. It may be that handicapped applicants areless likelyto present themselves ina way that establishes theircompetence, in other words, more like the nervous candidate inFarina's studies. Another study by Farina and his associates (1971)demonstrates that, mental patients were more likely to be tense andperform poorly in a situation in which they thought the other personknew they were mentallyll. It may be that a lack of confidence andcompetence in job interviews is also common among nonhandicappedindividuals with a recent history of unemployment.Another possible explanation is that most of the handicappedpeople seeking jobs are men, and most employment interviewers aremenconditions that Farina's studies suggest are least favorable forhandiLapped people. In addition, many of the less severely handi-capped people may not have observable handicaps and may chooseto \"pass\" as nonhandicapped, the,reby depressing the \"success rate\"for research purposes and also giving employers no reason to changetheir perceptions of handicapped people.How relevant are these findings to formal decision making, wherethe candidate is not met and the applicant is judged. largely on thebasis of objective data, such as test scores? First, most of the experi-mental studies do not invoke interaction with the candidate butrequire judges to rate or make decisions on the basis of verbaldescriptions or resumes, and, therefore, seem relevant. Second,ratings based on interviews may have the same status before the lawas do test scores (Arvey, 1979a,b),aand their appropriAteness may bechallenged if they result in disproportionate rejection of applicants;who are handicapped, and if they cannot be demonstrated to beotherise valid.It sIrould be noted that very little, if any, biag was found in thestudies that used resumes. The characterization of the applicant inthe miterials was positive in each study, and in none of the studiesdid the decision maker assume that the judgment would lead to actualemployment or rejection of an applicant. This may limit the applic-ability of the findings to the \"real world\"..of formal decision making. CONCLUSIONS1. Knowledge that someone is handicapped, in the absence ofother exposure to or information about the person, is likely to lead 1 9 0 182 Appendix Ato less ,positive evaluatio' ris thitn if the person did not have a hand-capping condition.2. These evaluations Vvill vary with the severity and nature of thehandicap.3. When other information is known about a person, knowledgeof a han4ic4 will have less impact than yy hen other information isabsebt.4. Depending on the -nature of both the other information .indthe handicapping knowledge, the effects of the latter may be nil,small or large, positive or negative.a. Where the other information is positive and inconsistent witha stereoty pe (e.g., a blind high school senior in:the upper half of hisregular, high school .class), the handicap will not result in a morenegative evaluation and may, by its contrast with the stereoty pe, leadto a more positive evaluation than for .1 nonhandicapped person W it hthe same \"other\" characteristicS.b. Where Che other information is ambiguous or somewhatnegative, the handicap information may either accentuate the negativeevaluations or decrease them (e.g., a below-aveiage SAT score maybe seen as accountable by the special difficulty faced by a blindstudent taking an oral or braille version of the,test).5. Empirical data on these, effects (in #4) are limited both innumber and in representativeness of naturconditions. real life\" are more heavily constrained byother factors, such as the proportion of all applicants w ho can be (ormust be) hired and formal decision rules about minimal academicrecords and requirements and minimal test`scoros.7. Decisions about handicapped people are, also influenced by thedesire to be fair, to be consistent W it h regulations, And to appear justand equitable.,8. Although the avoidance of negative bias is,uf course the primary'Concern,. positice discrimination in admissions or empl )yment mayhave even more serious negative consequences for ndicappedpeople if they\u00b0 are placed in a situation in which they 1re likely tofail.REFERENCESR D 11979a) Fairness in Seleding Employes Reading, Mass Addison-Wesley,Arey, the S 1(1980),hamlicap as Wruickshank.. ed.

Tbe meeting was held ol+March 34-15, 1980, at theNational Academy of Scientes. / .. ,Participants were asked to submit written testimony prior to the.nyeting and were urged to share with the panel copies of any studieson tfie assessment and, selection of people with various handicaps,the participation of handic7apped people in ed 1 cation anc( employ-ment, and alternatives to conventional testin 1 thatrare especially'suitable for handicapped people. A list of people ana organizationsinvited to contribute to the meeting is attached; those who spoke atthe meeting or submitted material are so designated.v 7TEST DEVELOPERS .,Several test developers, bt)th pr.ofit:making and nonprofit organiza-tions, presented Matera to the panel. The U.S. Office of PersonnelManagement (OPM) also presented information on test development, 495 Appendix B. 187,but since`their procedures have uhique characteristics. they will bediscussed sepaiwels The major test,developers are best known fortheir tests Used for-educational selection and placement, however,two of the three organizations also develop tests for employmerarselection as well as certification and licerure.The American Callege Testing Program (ACT) rePorts that ineach recefit sears 11.,000 of thelollege conpus, but only 1,000- take e- the .-;LCT in modified form. The 4.lucational Testtng Service (ETS)reports that in 1978-79 about 2,50b of their 1,000,000 test taTer'stook the' Scholastic Aptitude Test (SATrin modified Jorm. ETSno record of those handicapped examinees who take the SAT undAstandardoionditions. While the Psychological Corporation publishestests used in educational, medical, and mployment settings, tgeirtest of major interest to the panel is the Miller Analogies Test, IA hich'is used along with other- information-to make decisions regardingadmissions to graduate sthools The In swre reports to t.st users, all &tree test developers,note those scores did- rosulted f km a nonstandard administrationirf a test. 1Itr..The major a may of test devel6pers in accomThodating culling out items that are inanopriate for a given handicapping \u00abmdition.Modificationstf testing procedures include e)tended time liniitsprinting of the test in large type or hraille, recording of the test on 7cassettes, Kipling of large answer sheets, and provision for tht useof a reader or an amanuensis.,Some tests administered to the deafmay have reduced emphasis on verVil ability. Not all altered formats 1-or procedures are available for all testing programs. The selet.tion ofwhich to make available-appears to depend on the judged apprUpri-ateness of die ,modifkations for the particular test and predictedactivity as 'Well 'as on economic considerations. Good adaptationsrequire keen awareness of ramifications of a variety of handicappingconditions as well as mnsiderable sophistication in test development.Only one of the three privale test developers who testified had at,that time concitIcted validation studies for handicapped examineesalone. ACT has studied the performance of handicapped studentswho took the AC1 on a national test date, th:n i\u00a7, who took tfAtestwithout modifkation. (Since that time El S has also cendertaken stAies 1 9 6*-N : 188 Appendix Bof the predictive validity of the SAT for some handicapped students!)ACT found the test predicted first-year college grades as well forthose handicapped examinees as for the nonhandicapped; however,this study leaves unanswered the questiqn of how welh variousmodifications of a test predict later performance. Test developers saythey have condutted no such studies because of the small numbersof students with the same handicap entering the same institution inthe same year. ACT reports that only 13 colleges,requiring the ACThad enrolled 75 or more handicapped studentSin a recent three,-year period. ETS has suggested a serategy that may allow for thepooling of students in different schpols for the purpose of conducting,,predictive validity studies. EKS has also suggested that studies ofconstruct validity might be possible vvkere studies of predittive validityare precluded by small sample sizes. There [lave been no studies toestimate the magnitude of score differences expected as a result ofdifferent test administration procedures. FEDERAL GOVERNMENTThe Office of Personnel Managenient (OPM) reported on the changeiin test administration methods and test thntent to accommodatehandicapped people in the Professional and Administrative CareerExamination (PACE). OPM offers considerable flexibility in testadministration methods to handicapped examinees. Time limits havebeen set empirically for eaCh test part and each ty pe of modification.OPM has done extensive work in changing the content of a. test tomeasure the intended abilities. Their wqrk falls into four categories; .4(1ddeting single items and sAstituting more appropriate items toMeasure,the same ability, (2) modifying items to better measuie theintended ability(3) deleting all items bf one ty pe and substitutinganother item type to meakure the ability, and (4) deleting all items totesti.on ability,and therefae not measuring that ability. -Iin modifying its tests OPM uses experts w ho are knowledgeableabout specific handicaPs, as do other test developers. OPM afso'compiles and uses considerable information on the psychometricCharacteristics of its items and tests. Tests for handicapped competitors.are statisticallyequated\" with those for nonhandicapped competitors;that is, they are made toihave approximately the same mea-n, standarddeviation, and distribution of scores. OPM uses measures of constructvalidity rather than predictive validity, thereby being able to estimatethe ;ralidity of a test as modified in a particular vv:iy. Scores obtained 9 '7, Appendix B 189by handicapped ,people are not flagged but are used in the samemanner as those of nonhandicapped competitors.Representatives from the Bureau of Education fur the HandicappedIBEH) outlined its role in administering P.L. 94-142, the Educationfor All Handicapped Children Act, with particular emphasis onaspects relating to assessment of handicapped children. BEH hasfunded several research projects on testing of. handicapped peopleand is concerned with issues .such as the fpllowing How can existingtests be modified fur appropriate use with the handicapped? Whatinterpretations of results-of modified tests are warranted: be-treated fairly in minimum competency te,stingprograms. especiallyyy hen graduation from high school is madecontingent on passing the tests: In the fall of 1980 BEH will collectdata on the extent to yy hich handicapped children experience testingin the schools. The panel expressed interest in seeing a report ofthose dataRepresentatives from the Veterans Administration (VA) focusedon the positivesaspects of pslechcilogical testing, stating that t6ts offera compassionate, objective, and precise means of evaluating people'sperformance. ihe VA provides'Yocational wunseling. to its clients toassist them in achieving irfdependence and efficiency Representativesof The VA noted that norms based solely on handicapped examineesmay nut be appropriate % hen handisApped people are competingwith nonhandicapped. Tests'were Vt seen as barriers to ap'propriatejob-placement, although it %as noted that this belief was based onexperience rather than data. It wa,s stressed, however, that tests canbe dangerous unless Used appropriately by pqrsonnel who are %en-trained with respect to both resting and dealing with handicappedpeople.The spokesperson from the National Institote on HandicappedResearch (NI FIR) described the new organization, its probable futureactivities, and those of its predecessors, especial4 the RehabilitationSenices Administration (RSA). Since the early 1960s RSA has fundedresearch relating to the development of tests but not the validationor use of tests. NI HR is interested in statistical data on liandicappedpeople and will be responsible for wllecting the information in acentral location. EDUCATORSSeveral educators, or people from organizatioI representing edu-cators or educational institutions, testified in t open meeting Tilt198 190 Appendix BNational Education Association (NEA) expressed its concern about,implementation of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act(P.L. 94-142), an act the NEA endorses. The NEA is principally'concerned with the use of tests in formulating students' indi idualizededucational programs (IEP). They belieye that teachers and otherssh uld be adequately trained to administer and interpret tests inor er to formulate satisfactorily a strident) IEP. The NEA opposesthe use of equiyalency examinations in litt of traditional criteria forawardihg a high school diploma. The,NEA believes that handkappedstudents should nabe denied the nght to take tests and that reducedstandards of educational achieyemen should not be applied tohandicapped students. Howeyer, the NEA seriously questions thevalue of using standardized tests at all.A spokesperson from the American Associatibrtof CollegiateRegistrars and Admissions Officers (AACRAO) described the diffi-culties in trying to deal fairly with handicapped people who applyfor admission to college. It was reported that it is common, but notuniversal, practice to note w hen low scores are associated with anonstandard administration of a college enrrance test so that specialconsideration can be giyen the handicapped applicant. There is saidto be considerable confusiim among admissions officers, howeyer,oyer the meaning of scom resulting from minstandard test admin-istrations. It .is also possible that an admissions officer will fail tonotice that a particular score has been flagged. In a survey byAACRAO of 60 public and priate four-year schools in II states, noschool reported changing its admissions policies because of theimplementation of the Section 504 regulations. AV:RAO recom-mends continuing to collect andoinalyze data to Judge the y atlidity ofthe tests as giy en to handicapped people It was reported that schoolsdo not usually reject students solely because of lois test scores.& representative from the Center for Unique Learners, ices to mukiply handicapped,students at Gal- 'laudet College, spoke to the panel. She stressed that one of the mainproblems is in the human interaction in the testing situation. that it.is important to distinguish between an examjnee's failure to, under-stand a question and his or her failure to know the answer, and thatIt is also important for a lest administrator to be supportiye, to giyea handicapped examinee a sense of accomplishment. ,The Association on Handicapped Student Service Programs inPost-Secondary Education submitted written testimony to the panel.Briefly, the associatidn endorses the use of data such as grades and.193 Appendix B 191extracurriculai activities tosupplemernttest results as well as researchto increase the,accuracy of assessment of handicapped people. EMPLOYERSHuman Resources Center 'IA Albertson. Ness York, submitted' awritten statement to the panel. The statement outlined some of thetesting problems faced in the rehabilitation of people with'disabilities.Flexibility in testing, the use of local norms, and a close link with thelocal business community were stressed as important to the successof the rehabilitation system.The Metropolitan Ness York Chapter of the National RehabilitationAssociation issued a brief written statement outlining its concernswith discriminatory testing procedures.A representative of the Animal Husbandry Division, Departmentof AmmarMedicine, Uniformed Services t_Tniversity of the HealthSciences spoke at the mecpting. He outlined concerns relating toappropriate training and testing of hearing-impaired personnel. Herecounted that the deaf people in his training program were trainedand tested fairly only when a *sign interpreter was provided.Representatives from tlie New York State Office of VocationalRehabilitation (OVR) were present at the meeting. Theystressed theneed for psychologists involveil in the testing of handicapped peopleto shed their biases and pr etonceived notions about what handicappedpeople can do and to become familiar with rehabilitation placticesfor modifying Jobs or training handicapped people to perform certainjobs. The main problem is perceived to be the improper use of tests,stemming from inadequate training of those who a.dminister tests,not the tests per se. The New York OVR hias anecdotal, but notsystematic, evidence to support this view. They believe that thecurrent safeguards against discriminatory testing of handicappedpeople are inadequate in part because handicapped people may notbe aware of their rights and the sanctions available to them andbecause employers may not know txactly what constitutes compliancewith the federal regulations.,An unscheduled speaker represented Youthwork, Inc., a firmunder contract with the U.S. Department of Labor doing CETA(Comprehensie Employment and Training Act) demonstration proj-ects with economically disadvantaged, minority, and handicappedyoung people. Youthwork, Inc., is interested in learning ham/ tomodify tests appropriately for handicapped people and is willing to 20 0 192 Appendix I3.,share with the panel information ithas on the experiences ofhandicapped youth in its programs. GROUPS REPRESENTING HANbICAPPED PEOPLEThe statement of the American Foundation for the Blind discussedproblems associated with testing v isually impaired people, such asdeciding 'which norm groups to use for comparative purposes,determining the extent to w hich a low score is attributable to impairedk isual functioning:rather than lack of ability, , the effect a the amountof. vision on the testing process, and the adv isability of using certaintest modifications and aids. It was noted that blind people are dividedin their attitudes toward special tests and separate norms.Testimony from the National Federation of the Blind cited nu-merous examples of discrimination against blind people, some in-volving the use of tests. The representative stressed that blind people ' iwant to be treated equally, ,that is, the same as nonhandicappedpeople. They seek equality of opportunity and view testing as a rightthat should not be denied blind people. For example, they want theright to take the LSAT to compete for admission lo law school;Furthermore, many think the, flagging of a score as resulting from anonstandard administration is prejudicial and confusing to those w hotry to interpret the test score. They want tests that are the same asthose for sighted people and that can be interpretedin the same wayThe National Federation of the Blind offers its help to those whowork with the blind and try t9 understand their special situations, ,including those who construct or modify rests for the blind.The spokesperson for the National Association of the Deaf con-tended that no test currently in use is k alid for the deaf and that testsliould be given in the examinee's language, which for many deafpeople is American Sign Language. Pending the development df teststhat are fair and 'valid for deaf individuals, they should not be tested.Deaf people should be involved in future test development andmodification. Gases of discrimination against deaf people in publica,nd private employment were described.The Alexander Graham Bell itssociation of the Deaf advocatesaunil-oral communication of deaf people to facilitate their, partici-pation in society. It was noted that.audiometric tests are often usedto place hearing-impaired children in educational programs and thatthe dectsion to keep a hearing-impaired child out of the regularclassroom may work to his or her disadvantage. Audiometric testsare necessary for hearing-impaired students, but they snould 193stipplementedtli otho tese.

The UCPA representatisessee educational mainstreaming as a positne goal. They suggest thathandicapped people i eceise naming in test-taking skills and strategies.The representam es f rcini the Association for Children with Learn-ing Disabilities (AcLD) highlighted some of the areas of disabslity tobe umsidered testing disabiliiyis defined.as a discrepancs between mental ability and one or morelof the follow mg area(' of defi-nition mdependent hase a leaming disabilits in a spedfic area.

PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND RESEARCHERS**Twogroups witInc the Ametican Psychological Association (APA)were represented at the meeting. the Disision of Industrial andOrganizational Psychology (Disision 14) and the Task -.Force on 202 r .Appendix BNychology and the I landicapped of the Board on Sqcial and EthicalResponsibility.The representative_of.the task force outlined issues of coricerp 'topsychologists, particularly tbe establishment. and use of a'ppropriatenormand the limited infor mation on the % alidity of tests administeredto handicapped people. The APA supported P.L. 94-142 but isconcerned about proper implemehtation of the act, in particular, theappropriate use of tests with handicapped children. It %as noted Ufamost textbool$s on testing say little if any thipg about testing handi-capeed people, and tfiat textboqks on tho disabled rarely say mUchabout testing. The APA tincourages the panel ter help in its efforts toensurealquateniraining of peoV who test handicapped individuals.The task force encoUrages the use of behavioral assiessrnents, such-asthe work gjrnple, iu place of the usual standardized tests, even though -,.. developing anq using them can be very expefisive.In 1975 the,'vision yf Industrial and-Organizational MythologypuirliShed-principles f r the validatioii and use of persormel selectionprocedures, but concerns regarding handicapped people were notspecifically mentioned. That publication is currently being revisedand will be shared with the panel % hen it has cleared review. Employ ersmust deal Oth complicated and perhaps conflicting 'federal recfuire-ments with regard to retruitment and selection, including the'regu-lations rogarding handicapped people. Industrial psychologists haveserious doubts as to whether compliance with ihe regulations con-'cerning testing of the handicapped is possible. In resporise to aquestion, the representative sj3eculated that courts- may accept evi-dence of validity (such as content validity) other than predictive oicriterion;related validity if the study, , especially the job analysis, iswell done. He predicted that in the future more tests will he used inemployment selection and that they will be betterthan those currentlyused.-The representatie from the American Association for the Ad-vancernerit of Science (AAAS) described the work of the AXAS withhandicapped scientists over the last five and a half years. The'AAAShas studied the barriers faced by scientists in their educ,Ition andcareers. The American Council on Education (ACE),, has initiatedproject HEATH (Higher Education and 'the Handicapped) to givetechnical *assistanceto 3,000 colleges and universities regardingcompliance with the Section 504 regulations. The representative seestesti4 as a majar source of discrimination against handicappedpeople but believes that nondiscriminatory tests should be madeavailable to handicapped people, IN ho May want to demonstrate theirabilities 'via test results.203 /heAmerican Association of CollegiatRegistrars amd Admissions Of-ficers had reported informally that a study .by that orgapization'showed that admissions,officers pay, little attention to the tes,t scoresof handicapped applicants unless dile score is high b6c consider otherinOrcators of performance. If that is true, theAAAS repiesentative.argued, then admissions procedures would Piot be altered substantiallyif admissionstests were waived for handicapped applicants but couldbe improved if nimdiscriminatory tests wire available.A representative 'from the Deafness Research ankl Training Genterat New York University testified' about problems in asselsing deafpeople. Two factors that must be considered in the assessm,ent ofdeaf people are degree of impairment :Ind age of onset, both ofv,hich affect linguistic competence and general experience. Problemsin the adrbinistration and interpretation of tests may or may not beobvious or sev ere.' Recent studies have shown that deaf children tendto distribute thtmselv es normally on performance on inAligencetesti and that the predictive altet of the scores is the same as f%hearing children.In response to a questiont the spokesperson repbrted Research and Training- Center's with been promising. Researchets. videotaped and signedinstructions for certainwork sample instruments and adriMiisteredthem to deaf examinees.
