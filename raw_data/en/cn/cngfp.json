Disease results when this balance is disturbed either due to infections, inflammations, trauma, autoimmune diseases, tumors. Whatever the reason, with any of these, the body has a strong immune system, which reacts to these changes and tries to ensure that balance is restored as quickly as possible and with minimal effect on overall bodily function. While most of us have a natural tendency to do so, some have a weak immune system to fight against common health issues. This makes them more prone to infections and they take more time to repair and restore health. However, there are a number of homeopathic supplements that can help to strengthen immunity. These can be used with the consultation of a professional, and this can help improve overall health.
