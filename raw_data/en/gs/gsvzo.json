The level of acceptance and use of CAM, however, is unknown among patients being treated for psychotic disorders. Psychotic patients were surveyed about their use of and attitudes toward CAM. Questions included basic demographic and socio-economic items as well as the lifetime and 12-month use of CAM. Data were collected from June to October 2005. A sample of 172 participants representing 8.4% of the total eligible population of the outpatient clinics within the Schizophrenia Program at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto Canada completed the survey. Considering all forms of CAM, the lifetime and 12-month prevalence rate were 88% and 68%, respectively. The use and perceived safety of CAM by this population is similar to that reported by the general population. Clinical and public health implications of these findings are discussed.", "sitename": "De Gruyter", "date": "2010-09-04", "cleaned_text": "The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), including alternative therapies (ALT) and natural health products (NHP) such as vitamin and herbal supplements, is increasingly accepted in both the general population as well as in patients with mood and anxiety disorders.
