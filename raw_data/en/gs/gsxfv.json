Decrease in Average Daily Attendance. --Any school district which has a decrease in total average daily attendance of one percent (1%) of its average daily attendance in the then current school year from the total average daily attendance used for determining the allowance in the edu\u00ad cational support program for the school year inmediately preceding, the allowance of funds from the educational support program may be based on the average daily attendance of the school year inmediately preceding, less one percent (1%). When this provision is applied, the decrease in average daily attendance shall be proporti onately distributed among the various categories of support units that are appropriate for the dis\u00ad trict. (2.) Application of Support Program to Separate Schools/Attendance Units in District. (a.) Separate Elementary School. --Any separate elementary school shall be allowed to participate in the educational support program as though the school were the only elementary school operated by the district. (b.) Hardship Elementary School. --Upon application of the board of trustees of a school district, the state board of education is empowered to determine that a given elementary school or elementary schools within the school district, not otherwise qualifying, are entitled to be counted as a separate elementary school as defined in section 33-1001, Idaho Code, when, in the discretion of the state board of education, special conditions exist warranting the reten\u00ad tion of the school as a separate attendance unit and the retention results in a substantial increase in cost per pupil in average daily attendance above the average cost per pupil in average daily atten\u00ad dance of the remainder of the district's elementary grade school pupils. An elementary school operating as a previously approved hardship elementary school shall continue to be considered as a sep\u00ad arate attendance unit, unless the hardship status of the elementary school is rescinded by the state board of education. ic-2 Separate Secondary School. --Any separate secondary school shall be allowed to participate in the educational support program as though the school were the only secondary school operated by the district. id-2 Elementary/Secondary School Attendance Units. --Elementary grades in an elementary/secondary school will be funded as a sepa\u00ad rate attendance unit if all elementary grades served are situated more than ten (10) miles distance from both the nearest like elemen\u00ad tary grades within the same school district and from the location of 1st E.S. 2006 IDAHO SESSION LAWS 19 RS16445 the office of the superintendent of schools of such district, or from the office of the chief administrative officer of such district if the district employs no superintendent of schools. Secondary grades in an elementary/secondary school will be funded as a sepa\u00ad rate attendance unit if all secondary grades served are located more than fifteen (15) miles by an all-weather road from the nearest like secondary grades operated by the district. 1eT2 Hardship Secondary School. --Any district which operated two (2)secondary schools separated by less than fifteen (15) miles, but which district was created through consolidation subsequent to leg\u00ad islative action pursuant to chapter 111, laws of 1947, and which school buildings were constructed prior to 1935, shall be entitled to count the schools as separate attendance units. 1fT2 Minimum Pupils Required. --Any elementary school having less than ten (10) pupils in average daily attendance shall not be allowed to participate in the state or county support program unless the school has been approved for operation by the state board of education. (3T) Remote Schools. --The board of trustees of any Idaho school dist;ict which operates and maintains a school which is remote and iso\u00ad lated from the other schools of the state because of geographical or topographical conditions may petition the state board of education to recognize and approve the school as a remote and necessary school. The petition shall be in form and content approved by the state board of education and shall provide such information as the state board of edu\u00ad cation may require. Petitions for the recognition of a school as a remote and necessary school shall be filed annually at least ninety (90) days prior to the date of the annual meeting of the board of trustees as established in section 33-510, Idaho Code. Within forty-five (45) days after the receipt of a petition for the recognition of a remote and necessary school, the state board of educa\u00ad tion shall either approve or disapprove the petition and notify the board of trustees of its decision. Schools which the state board of edu\u00ad cation approves as being necessary and remote shall be allowed adequate funding within the support program for an acceptable educational program for the students of the school. In the case of a remote and necessary secondary school, grades 7-12, the educational program shall be deemed acceptable when, in the opinion of the state board of education, the accreditation standard relating to staff size, established in accordance with section 33-119, Idaho Code, has been met. The final determination of an acceptable program and adequate funding in the case of a remote and necessary elementary school shall be made by the state board of edu\u00ad cation. 14T2 Support Program When District Boundaries are Changed. iaT2 In new districts formed by the division of a district, the support program computed for the district divided in its last year of operation, shall be apportioned to the new districts created by the division, in the proportion that the average daily attendance of pupils, elementary and secondary combined, residing in the area of each new district so created, is to the average daily attendance of all pupils, elementary and secondary combined, in the district divided in its last year of operation before the division. 20 IDAHO SESSION LAWS 1st E.S. 2006 RS16445 ibTL When boundaries of districts are changed by excision or annex\u00ad ation of territory, the support program of any district from which territory is excised for the last year of operation before such excision shall be divided, and apportioned among the districts involved, as prescribed in subsection 4aT (4)(a) of this section. icT2 In new districts formed by consolidation of former districts, the support program allowance for a seven (7) year period following the formation of the new district, shall not be less than the com\u00ad bined support program allowances of the component districts in the last year of operation before Section 33-1004, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby amended to read as follows: 33-1004. STAFF ALLOWANCE. For each school district, a staff allow\u00ad ance shall be determined as follows: (1)Using the daily attendance reports that have been submitted for computing the February 15th apportionment of state funds as provided in section 33-1009, Idaho Code, determine the total support units for the district in the manner provided in section 33-1002 &;-b.(6)(a), Idaho Code; (2)Determine the instructional staff allowance by multiplying the support units by 1.1. A district must demonstrate that it actually employs the number of certificated instructional staff allowed. If the district does not employ the number allowed, the staff allowance shall be reduced to the actual number employed; (3)Determine the administrative staff allowance by multiplying the support units by .075; (4)Determine the classified staff allowance by multiplying the support units by .375; (5)Additional conditions governing staff allowance: (a)In determining the number of staff in subsections (2), (3) and1st E.S. 2006 IDAHO SESSION LAWS 21 RS16445 (4)of this section, a district may contract separately for services to be rendered by nondistrict employees and such employees may be counted in the staff allowance. A \"nondistrict employee\" means a person for whom the school district does not pay the employer's obligations for employee benefits. When a district contracts for the services of a nondistrict employee, only the salary portion of the contract shall be allowable for computations. (b) If there are circumstances preventing eligible use of staff allowance to which a district is entitled as provided in subsections (2)and (3) of this section, an appeal may be filed with the state department of education outlining the reasons and proposed alterna\u00ad tive use of these funds, and a waiver may be granted. (c)For any district with less than forty (40) support units: (i)The instructional staff allowance shall be calculated applying the actual number of support units. If the actual instructional staff employed in the school year is greater than the instructional staff allowance, then the instructional staff allowance shall be increased by one-half (1/2) staff allowance; and (ii)The administrative staff allowance shall be calculated applying the actual number of support units. If the actual administrative staff employed in the school year is greater than the administrative staff allowance, then the administra\u00ad tive staff allowance shall be increased by one-half (1/2) staff allowance. (iii)Additionally, for any district with less than twenty (20) support units, the instructional staff allowance shall be cal\u00ad culated applying the actual number of support units. If the number of instructional staff employed in the school year is greater than the instructional staff allowance, the staff allowance shall be increased as provided in paragraphs (i) and (ii)of this subsection, and by an additional one-half (1/2) instructional staff allowance. (d)For any school district with one (1) or more separate secondary schools serving grades nine (9) through twelve (12), the instruc\u00ad tional staff allowance shall be increased by two (2) additional instructional staff allowances for each such separate secondary school. (e) Only instructional, administrative and classified personnel compensated by the school district from the general maintenance and operation fund of the district shall be included in the calculation of staff allowance or in any other calculations based upon staff, including determination of the experience and education multiplier, the reporting requirements, or the district's salary-based appor\u00ad tionment calculation. No food service staff or transportation staff shall be included in the staff allowance. (6)In the event that the staff allowance in any category is insuf\u00ad ficient to meet accreditation standards, a district may appeal to the state board of education, demonstrating the insufficiency, and the state board may grant a waiver authorizing sufficient additional staff to be included within the staff allowance to meet accreditation standards. 22 IDAHO SESSION LAWS 1st E.S. 2006 RS16445 QQQ Such a waiver shall be limited to one (1) year, but may be renewed upon showing of continuing justification.

For charter schools in the initial year of operation, the petition shall include a proposal for transportation services with an estimated first year cost. The state department of edu\u00ad cation is authorized to include in the annual appropriation to the charter school eighty percent (80%) of the estimated transpor tation cost. The final appropriation payment in July shall reflect eighty-five percent (85%) of the actual cost. (5)Payment schedule. The state department of education is autho\u00ad rized to make an advance payment of twenty-five percent (25%) of a pub\u00ad lic charter school's estimated annual apportionment for its first year of operation, and each year thereafter, provided the public charter school has an increase of student population in any given year of twenty (20)students or more, to assist the school with initial start-up costs or payroll obligati ons. (a)For a state public charter school to receive the advance pay\u00ad ment, the school shall submit its anticipated fall membership for each grade level to the state department of education by June 1. (b)Using the figures provided by the public charter school, the state department of education shall determine an estimated annual apportionment from which the amount of the advance payment shall be calculated.

(1)For purposes of calculating the rate at which taxes shall be levied by or for each taxing district in which a revenue allocation area is located, the county collDlissioners shall, with respect to the taxable property located in such revenue allocation area, use the equalized assessed value of such taxable property as shown on the base assessment roll rather than on the current equalized assessed valuation of such taxable property. (2)With respect to each such taxing district, the tax rate calcu\u00ad lated under subsection (1) of this section shall be applied to the cur\u00ad rent equalized assessed valuation of all taxable property in the taxing district, including the taxable property in the revenue allocation area. The tax revenues thereby produced shall be allocated as follows: (a) To the taxing district shall be allocated and shall be paid by the county treasurer: (i)All taxes levied by the taxing district or on its behalf on taxable property located within the taxing district but out\u00ad side the revenue allocation area; and (ii)A portion of the taxes leviey the taxing district or on its behalf on the taxable property located within the reve\u00ad nue allocation area, which portion is the amount produced by applying the taxing district's tax rate determined under sub\u00ad section (1) of this section to the equalized assessed valua-1st E.S. 2006 IDAHO SESSION LAWS 25 RS16445 tion, as shown on the base assessment roll, of the taxable property located within the revenue renewal agency shall be allocated the balance, if any, of the taxes levied on the taxable property located within the revenue allocation area. (3)Upon enactment of an ordinance adopting a revenue allocation financing provision as part of an urban renewal plan, the urban renewal agency shall create a special fund or funds to be used for the purposes enumerated in this chapter. The revenues allocated to the urban renewal agency pursuant to this chapter, shall be paid to the agency by the treasurer of the county in which the revenue allocation district is located and shall be deposited by the agency into one ill or more of such special funds, The agency may, in addition, deposit into such spe\u00ad cial fund or funds such other income, proceeds, revenues and funds it may receive from sources other than the revenues allocated to it under subsection (2)(b) of this section. (4)For the purposes of section 63-803, Idaho Code, during the period when revenue allocation under this chapter is in effect, and solely with respect to any taxing district in which a revenue allocation area is located, the county commissioners shall, in fixing any tax levy, take into consideration the equalized assessed valuation of the taxable property situated in the revenue allocation area as shown in the base assessment roll, rather than the current equalized assessed value of such taxable property. (5)For all other purposes, including, without limitation, for pur\u00ad poses of sections 33-802, 33-1002 and 63-1313, Idaho Code, reference in the Idaho Code to the term \"market value for assessment purposes\" (or any other such similar term) shall mean market value for assessment pur\u00ad poses as defined in section 63-208, Idaho Code.

Said ratio study shall be conducted in accordance with nationally accepted procedures, From the ratio so ascertained the state tax comnis\u00ad sion shall compute the adjusted market value of all property assessed for property tax purposes, (3)The ratio shall be computed in each school district and applied to the market value for assessment purposes within each school district, (4)Sales used in determining the ratio required by this section shall be arm's length, market value property sales occurring in the year beginning on October 1 of the year preceding the year for which the adjusted market value is to be determined. The state tax comnission may, at its discretion, modify the sales period when doing so produces provably better representativeness of the actual ratio in any school district, The state tax conmission may also add independently conducted appraisals when the state tax commission believes that this procedure will improve the representativeness and reliability of the ratio, (5)Whenever the state tax cormnission is unable to determine with reasonable statistical certainty that the assessed 'value within any school district differs from the market value for assessment purposes, the state tax conmission may certify the assessed value to be the adjusted market value of any school district. (6)The state tax commission shall certify the adjusted market value of each school district to the state department of education and each county auditor no later than the first Monday in April each year. The state tax conmission shall prepare a report indicating procedures used in computing the adjusted market value and showing statistical mea\u00ad sures computed in the ratio study, This report shall be submitted to the state department of education at the same time as the certification of adjusted market value. The report of the state tax commission shall also be made available for public inspection in the office of the county auditor.

(a)The tax shall apply to, be computed on, and collected for all credit, installment, conditional or similar sales at the time of the sale or, in the case of rentals, at the time the rental is charged. (b)The tax hereby imposed shall be collected by the retailer from the consumer. (c)The state tax commission shall provide schedules for collection of the tax on sales which involve a fraction of a dollar. The retailer shall calculate the tax upon the entire amount of the purchases of the consumer made at a particular time and not separately upon each item purchased. The retailer may retain any amount collected under the bracket system prescribed which is in excess of the amount of tax for which he is liable to the state during the period as compensation for the work of collecting the tax, (d) It is unlawful for any retailer to advertise or hold out or state to the public or to any customer, directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the retailer or that it will not be added to the selling price of the property sold or that if added it or any part thereof will be refunded, Any person vio\u00ad lating any provision of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor, (e)The tax commission may by rule provide that the amount col\u00ad lected by the retailer from the customer in reimbursement of the tax be displayed separately from the list price, the price advertised on the premises, the marked price, or other price on the sales slip or other proof of sale. (f)The taxes imposed by this chapter shall apply to the sales to contractors purchasing for use in the performance of contracts with the United States. SECTION 19. That Section 63-3621, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby amended to read as follows: 63-3621. IMPOSITION AND RATE OF THE USE TAX --EXEMPTIONS. An excise tax is hereby imposed on the storage, use, or other consumption in this state of tangible personal property acquired on or after Jry 1, 2005, for storage, use, or other consumption in this state rate of fi,re six percent (5\u00a7%) of the value of the property, and a recent sales price shall be presumptive evidence of the value of the property unless the property is wireless teleconmunications equipment, in which case a recent sales price shall be conclusive evidence of the value of the property. (a)Every person storing, using, or otherwise consuming, in this1st E.S. 2006 IDAHO SESSION LAWS 29 RS16445 state, tangible personal property is liable for the tax. His liability is not extinguished until the tax has been paid to this state except that a receipt from a retailer maintaining a place of business in this state or engaged in business in this state given to the purchaser is sufficient to relieve the purchaser from further liability for the tax to which the receipt refers. A retailer shall not be considered to have stored, used or consumed wireless teleconmunications equipment by virtue of giving, selling or otherwise transferring such equipment at a dis\u00ad count as an inducement to a consumer to colll!lellce or continue a contract for teleconmunications service. (b)Every retailer engaged in business in this state, and making sales of tangible personal property for the storage, use, or other con\u00ad sumption in this state, not exempted under section 63-3622, Idaho Code, shall, at the time of making the sales or, if storage, use or other con\u00ad sumption of the tangible personal property is not then taxable hereun\u00ad der, at the time the storage, use or other consumption becomes taxable, collect the tax from the purchaser and give to the purchaser a receipt therefor in the manner and form prescribed by the state tax commission. (c)The provisions of this section shall not apply when the retailer pays sales tax on the transaction and collects reimbursement for such sales tax from the customer. (d)Every retailer engaged in business in this state or maintaining a place of business in this state shall register with the state tax com\u00ad mission and give the name and address of all agents operating in this state, the location of all distributions or sales houses or offices or other places of business in this state, and such other information as the state tax comnission may require. (e)For the purpose of the proper administration of this act and to prevent evasion of the use tax and the duty to collect the use tax, it shall be presumed that tangible personal property sold by any person for delivery in this state is sold for storage, use, or other consumption in this state. The burden of proving the sale is tax exempt is upon the person who makes the sale unless he obtains from the purchaser a resale certificate to the effect that the property is purchased for resale or rental, It shall be presumed that sales made to a person who has com\u00ad pleted a resale certificate for the seller's records are not taxable and the seller need not collect sales or use taxes unless the tangible per\u00ad sonal property purchased is taxable to the purchaser as a matter of law in the particular instance claimed on the resale certificate. A seller may accept a resale certificate from a purchaser prior to the time of sale, at the time of sale, or at any reasonable time after the sale when necessary to establish the privilege of the exemption. The resale certificate relieves the person selling the property from the burden of proof only if taken from a person who is engaged in the busi\u00ad ness of selling or renting tangible personal property and who holds the permit provided for by section 63-3620, Idaho Code, or who is a retailer not engaged in business in this state, and who, at the time of purchas\u00ad ing the tangible personal property, intends to sell or rent it in the regular course of business or is unable to ascertain at the time of pur\u00ad chase whether the property will be sold or will be used for some other purpose. Other than as provided elsewhere in this section, when a resale certificate, properly executed, is presented to the seller, the seller 30 IDAHO SESSION LAWS 1st E.S. 2006 RS16445 has no duty or obligation to collect sales or use taxes in regard to any sales transaction so documented regardless of whether the purchaser properly or improperly claimed an exemption. A seller so relieved of the obligation to collect tax is also relieved of any liability to the pur\u00ad chaser for failure to collect tax or for making any report or disclosure of information required or permitted under this chapter. The resale certificate shall bear the name and address of the pur\u00ad chaser, shall be signed by the purchaser or his agent, shall indicate the number of the permit issued to the purchaser, or that the purchaser is an out-of-state retailer, and shall indicate the general character of the tangible personal property sold by the purchaser in the regular course of business. The certificate shall be substantially in such form as the state tax commission may prescribe. (f)If a purchaser who gives a resale certificate makes any storage or use of the property other than retention, demonstration or display while holding it for sale in the regular course of business, the storage or use is taxable as of the time the property is first so stored or used. (g)Any person violating any provision of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor and punishable by a fine not in excess of one hundred dol\u00ad lars ($100), and each violation shall constitute a separate offense. (h)It shall be presumed that tangible personal property shipped or brought to this state by the purchaser was purchased from a retailer, for storage, use or other consumption in this state. (i)It shall be presumed that tangible personal property delivered outside this state to a purchaser known by the retailer to be a resident of this state was purchased from a retailer for storage, use, or other consumption in this state. This presumption may be controverted by evi\u00ad dence satisfactory to.the state tax commission that the property was not purchased for storage, use, or other consumption in this state. (j)When the tangible personal property subject to use tax has been subjected to a general retail sales or use tax by another state of the United States in an amount equal to or greater than the amount of the Idaho tax, and evidence can be given of such payment, the property will not be subject to Idaho use tax. If the amount paid the other state was less, the property will be subject to use tax to the extent that the Idaho tax exceeds the tax paid to the other state. For the purposes of this subsection, a registration certificate or title issued by another state or subdivision thereof for a vehicle or trailer or a vessel as defined in section 67-7003, Idaho Code, shall be sufficient evidence of payment of a general retail sales or use tax. (k)The use tax herein imposed shall not apply to the use by a non\u00ad resident of this state of a motor vehicle which is registered or licensed under the laws of the state of his residence and is not used in this state more than a cumulative period of time totaling ninety (90) days in any consecutive twelve (12) months, and which is not required to be registered or licensed under the laws of this state. (1)The use tax herein imposed shall not apply to the use of house\u00ad hold goods, personal effects and personally owned motor vehicles by a resident of this state, if such articles were acquired by such person in another state while a resident of that state and primarily for use out\u00ad side this state and if such use was actual and substantial, but if an 1st E.S. 2006 IDAHO SESSION LAWS 31 RS16445 article was acquird less than three (3) months prior to the time he entered this state, it will be presumed that the article was acquired for use in this state and that its use outside this state was not actual and substantial. For purposes of this subsection, \"resident\" shall be as defined in section 63-3013 or 63-3013A, Idaho Code. (m)The use tax herein imposed shall not apply to the storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal property which is or will be incorporated into real property and which has been donated to and has become the property of: (1)A nonprofit organization as defined in section 63-36220, Idaho Code; or (2)The state of Idaho; or (3)Any political subdivision of the state. This exemption applies whether the tangible personal property is incor\u00ad porated in real property by the donee, a contractor or subcontractor of the donee, or any other person. SECTION 20.

An excise tax is hereby imposed on the storage, use, or other consumption in this state of tangible personal property acquired on or after ry October 1, 2005, for storage, use, or other consumption in this state at the rate of fie six percent (56%) of the value of the property, and a recent sales prishall be presumptive evidence of the value of the property unless the property is wireless teleconmunications equipment, in which case a recent sales price shall be conclusive evidence of the value of the property. 62 IDAHO SESSION LAWS Ch. 1, 1st E.S. 2006 (a)Every person storing, using, or otherwise consuming, in this state, tangible personal property is liable for the tax. His liability is not extinguished until the tax has been paid to this state except that a receipt from a retailer maintaining a place of business in this state or engaged in business in this state given to the purchaser is sufficient to relieve the purchaser from further liability for the tax to which the receipt refers. A retailer shall not be considered to have stored, used or consumed wireless telecolllBUilications equipment by virtue of giving, selling or otherwise transferring such equipment at a dis\u00ad count as an inducement to a consumer to conmence or continue a contract for telecolllllUilications service. (b)Every retailer engaged in business in this state, and making sales of tangible personal property for the storage, use, or other con\u00ad sumption in this state, not exempted under section 63-3622, Idaho Code, shall, at the time of making the sales or, if storage, use or other con\u00ad sumption of the tangible personal property is not then taxable hereun\u00ad der, at the time the storage, use or other consumption becomes taxable, collect the tax from the purchaser and give to the purchaser a receipt therefor in the manner and form prescribed by the state tax commission. Cc) The provisions of this section shall not apply when the retailer pays sales tax on the transaction and collects reimbursement for such sales tax from the customer. (d)Every retailer engaged in business in this state or maintaining a place of business in this state shall register with the state tax com\u00ad mission and give the name and address of all agents operating in this state, the location of all distributions or sales houses or offices or other places of business in this state, and such other information as the state tax conmission may require. (e)For the purpose of the proper administration of this act and to prevent evasion of the use tax and the duty to collect the use tax, it shall be presumed that tangible personal property sold by any person for delivery in this state is sold for storage, use, or other consumption in this state. The burden of proving the sale is tax exempt is upon the person who makes the sale unless he obtains from the purchaser a resale certificate to the effect that the property is purchased for resale or rental, It shall be presumed that sales made to a person who has com\u00ad pleted a resale certificate for the seller's records are not taxable and the seller need not collect sales or use taxes unless the tangible per\u00ad sonal property purchased is taxable to the purchaser as a matter of law in the particular instance claimed on the resale certificate. A seller may accept a resale certificate from a purchaser prior to the time of sale, at the time of sale, or at any reasonable time after the sale when necessary to establish the privilege of the exemption. The resale certificate relieves the person selling the property from the burden of proof only if taken from a person who is engaged in the busi\u00ad ness of selling or renting tangible personal property and who holds the permit provided for by section 63-3620, Idaho Code, or who is a retailer not engaged in business in this state, and who, at the time of purchas\u00ad ing the tangible personal property, intends to sell or rent it in the regular course of business or is unable to ascertain at the time of pur\u00ad chase whether the property will be sold or will be used for some other purpose. Other than as provided elsewhere in this section, when a resale certificate, properly executed, is presented to the seller, the seller has no duty or obligation to collect sales or use taxes in regard to any Ch. 1, 1st E.S. 2006 IDAHO SESSION LAWS 63 sales transaction so documented regardless of whether the purchaser properly or improperly claimed an exemption. A seller so relieved of the obligation to collect tax is also relieved of any liability to the pur\u00ad chaser for failure to collect tax or for making any report or disclosure of information required or permitted under this chapter. The resale certificate shall bear the name and address of the pur\u00ad chaser, shall be signed by the purchaser or his agent, shall indicate the number of the permit issued to the purchaser, or that the purchaser is an out-of-state retailer, and shall indicate the general character of the tangible personal property sold by the purchaser in the regular course of business. The certificate shall be substantially in such form as the state tax commission may prescribe. (f)If a purchaser who gives a resale certificate makes any storage or use of the property other than retention, demonstration or display while holding it for sale in the regular course of business, the storage or use is taxable as of the time the property is first so stored or used. (g)Any person violating any provision of this section is guilty of a misdemeanor and punishable by a fine not in excess of one hundred dol\u00ad lars ($100), and each violation shall constitute a separate offense. (h)It shall be presumed that tangible personal property shipped or brought to this state by the purchaser was purchased from a retailer, for storage, use or other consumption in this state. (i) It shall be presumed that tangible personal property delivered outside this state to a purchaser known by the retailer to be a resident of this state was purchased from a retailer for storage, use, or other consumption in this state. This presumption may be controverted by evi\u00ad dence satisfactory to the state tax commission that the property was not purchased for storage, use, or other consumption in this state. (j)When the tangible personal property subject to use tax has been subjected to a general retail sales or use tax by another state of the United States in an amount equal to or greater than the amount of the Idaho tax, and evidence can be given of such payment, the property will not be subject to Idaho use tax. If the amount paid the other state was less, the property will be subject to use tax to the extent that the Idaho tax exceeds the tax paid to the other state. For the purposes of this subsection, a registration certificate or title issued by another state or subdivision thereof for a vehicle or trailer or a vessel as defined in section 67-7003, Idaho Code, shall be sufficient evidence of payment of a general retail sales or use tax. (k) The use tax herein imposed shall not apply to the use by a non\u00ad resident of this state of a motor vehicle which is registered or licensed under the laws of the state of his residence and is not used in this state more than a cumulative period of time totaling ninety (90) days in any consecutive twelve (12) months, and which is not required to be registered or licensed under the laws of this state. (1)The use tax herein imposed shall not apply to the use of house\u00ad hold goods, personal effects and personally owned motor vehicles by a resident of this state, if such articles were acquired by such person in another state while a resident of that state and primarily for use out\u00ad side this state and if such use was actual and substantial, but if an article was acquired less than three (3) months prior to the time he entered this state, it will be presumed that the article was acquired for use in this state and that its use outside this state was not actual 64 IDAHO SESSION LAWS Ch. 1, 1st E.S. 2006 and substantial. For purposes of this subsection, 11resident11 shall be as defined in section 63-3013 or 63-3013A, Idaho Code. (m)The use tax herein imposed shall not apply to the storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal property which is or will be incorporated into real property and which has been donated to and has become the property of: (1)A nonprofit organization as defined in section 63-36220, Idaho Code; or (2)The state of Idaho; or (3)Any political subdivision of the state. This exemption applies whether the tangible personal property is incor\u00ad porated in real property by the donee, a contractor or subcontractor of the donee, or any other person, SECTION 20.

In the alternative, and subject to reasonable substanti\u00ad ation and consistent application by the group of related compa\u00ad nies, adjustments may be made to the profit and loss statements of the corporatio n incorporated outside the United States, if necessary , to conform such statements to tax accounting stan\u00ad dards as required by the Internal Revenue Code as if such cor\u00ad poration were incorporated in the United States and required to file a federal income tax return, subject to appropriate adjustments under the provisions of section 63-3022, Idaho Code; and (iii)iif the income computation for a group under paragraphs (i)and-(ii) of this subsection results in a loss, such loss shall be taken into account in other years, subject to the pro\u00ad visions of subsections (b) and (c) of section 63-3022, Idaho Code. (u)If compensation is paid in the form of a reasonable cash fee for the performance of management services directly for the United States government at the Idaho national engi:neeri:ng laboratory or any successor organization, separate accounting for that part of the busi\u00ad ness activity without regard to other activity of the taxpayer in the state of Idaho or elsewhere shall be required; provided that only that portion of general expenses clearly identifiable with Idaho business operations of that activity shall be allowed as a deduction.

(3)If the court determines that restitution is inappropriate or undesirable or if only partial or nominal restitut ion is ordered, it shall enter an order articulating the reasons therefor on the record, (4)If a separate written order of restitution is issued, an order of restitution shall be for an amount certain and shall be due and owing at the time of sentencing or at the date the amount of restitution is determined, whichever is later, An order of restitution may provide for interest from the date of the economic loss or injury, (5)The court may order the defendant to pay restitution to the victim in any case, regardless of whether the defendant is incarcerated or placed on probation, The court may order the defendant to pay all or a part of the restitution ordered to the court to be distributed by the court to the victims in a manner the court deems just. (6)Restitution orders shall be entered by the court at the time of sentencing or such later date as deemed necessary by the court, Economic loss shall be based upon the preponderance of evidence submitted to the court by the prosecutor, defendant, victim or presentence investigator. Each party shall have the right to present such evidence as may be rele-154 IDAHO SESSION LAWS c.63 2007 vant to the issue of restitution, and the court may consider such hear\u00ad say as may be contained in the presentence report, victim impact state\u00ad ment or otherwise provided to the court. (7)The court, in determining whether to order restitution and the amount of such restitution, shall consider the amount of economic loss sustained by the victim as a result of the offense, the financial resources, needs and earning ability of the defendant, and such other factors as the court deems appropriate. The immediate inability to pay restitution by a defendant shall not be, in and of itself, a reason to not order restitution. (8)In determining restitution, where it appears that more than one (1) person is responsible for a crime that results in economic loss to a victim, and one (1) or more of the suspects or defendants are not found, apprehended, charged, convicted or ordered to pay restitution, the court may require the remaining defendant or defendan ts, who are convicted of or plead guilty to the crime, to be jointly and severally responsible for the entire economic loss to the victim. (9)The court may, with the consent of the parties, order restitu\u00ad tion to victims, and/or any other person or entity, for economic loss or injury for crimes which are not adjudicated or are not before the court. (10)A defendant, against whom a restitution order has been entered, may, within forty-two (42) days of the entry of the order of restitu\u00ad tion, request relief from the restitution order in accordance with the Idaho rules of civil procedure relating to relief from final orders. (11)An order of restitution shall not preclude the victim from seeking any other legal remedy. (12)Every presentence report shall include a full statement of eco\u00ad nomic loss suffered by the victim or victims of the defendant's crime or crimes. (13)If there is more than one (1) victim, the restitution order shall provide that the directly injured victim(s) be fully compensated for so much of the loss caused by the defendant's criminal conduct which has not been paid by a third party, including persons referred to in subsection (l)(e)(ii), (iii) and (iv) of this section.

It may also designate specific high\u00ad ways or portions on which operation of a combination of vehicles with seven (7) through thirteen (13) axles will be subject to speci\u00ad fied lesser allowable gross weights. (b)Notwithstanding the figures shown in the table in this subsec\u00ad tion (1), two (2) consecutive sets of tandem axles may carry a gross load of thirty-four thousand (34,000) pounds each, providing the overall distance between the first and last axles of such consecu\u00ad tive sets of tandem axles is thirty-six (36) feet or more. (c)Vehicles may operate with reducible loads at gross weights greater than one hundred five thousand five hundred (105,500) pounds but not exceeding one hundred twenty-nine thousand (129,000) pounds on noninterstate highways in accordance with the provisions of sec\u00ad tion 49-1004, Idaho Code, provided such vehicles are in compliance162 IDAHO SESSION LAWS c.65 2007 with the weight formula specified in this subsection (1) of this section, have registered and have paid the registration fees as specified in section 49-434, Idaho Code, and are in compliance with the length restrictions set forth in section 49-1010(7), Idaho Code. (2) The weight limitations set forth in the table in subsection (1) of this section shall not apply to any vehicle, or combination of vehi\u00ad cles when a greater allowed weight in pounds would be permitted such vehicles under the table provided in this subsection, except that with regard to transportation on the United States federal interstate and defense highways of this state, the following table of allowable weights shall apply only to vehicles engaged in the transportation of logs, pulp wood, stull, rough lumber, poles or piling; or to any such vehicle engaged in the transportation of ores, concentrates, sand and gravel and aggregates thereof, in bulk; or to any such vehicle engaged in the transportation of agricultural conmodities, including livestock: Distance in feet between Allowed Load in Pounds the extremes of any group Vehicles with Vehicles with of 2 or more consecutive Three or Four Five or more axles axles axles 3 through 12 37,800 37,800 13 39 77,000 40 77,550 41 78,100 42 78,650 43 and over 79,000 The weight allowances provided in this subsection do not apply if the total gross weight of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is intended to exceed seventy-nine thousand (79,000) pounds as declared by the oper-c.652007 IDAHO SESSION LAWS 163 ator. When the provisions of this subsection are applicable to a vehicle or combination of vehicles, it shall be a violation of the provisions of this subsection if that vehicle or combination of vehicles exceeds the weights specified in this table. (3)In determining the gross weight of a vehicle or the gross weight of any two (2) or more consecutive axles under subsection (1) or (2) or (9) of this section, the total gross weight of the vehicle or combination of vehicles or the gross weight of any two (2) or more con\u00ad secutive axles shall be the sum of the axle weights. For the purposes of this chapter the gross weight of a vehicle or the gross weight of any two (2) or more consecutive axles may be deter\u00ad mined by accumulatively adding the separate weights of individual axles and tandem axles or groups of axles to determine gross weight. The results of any weighing at a temporary or permanent port of entry and the records relating to the calibration and accuracy of any scale at a temporary or permanent port of entry shall be admissible in any proceed\u00ad ing in this state. In order to prove a violation of the provisions of this section the state must show that: (a)The sum of the axle weights exceeds what is allowable under the provisions of subsection (1) or (2) or (9) of this section; (b)The scale involved in the weighing was at the time of weighing calibrated in conformity with and met the accuracy requirements of the standards for the enforcement of traffic and highway laws as set forth in the latest edition of handbook 44 of the national institute of standards and technology; (c)Weights of individual axles or axles within a comnonly sus\u00ad pended group of axles supported by a mechanical system designed to distribute equal wheel loads to individual axles in the group were utilized only to determine gross weights of that group of axles, and that any further evaluation of gross weights of combinations of axles considered only the accumulated gross weight of each such com\u00ad monly suspended group of axles. (4)In applying the weight limitations imposed in this section, a vehicle or combination of vehicles must comply exclusively with the weight limitations in either subsection (1) or (2) or (9) of this sec\u00ad tion. (5)In applying the weight limitations imposed in this section, the distance between axles shall be measured to the nearest even foot. When a fraction is exactly one-half (1/2) foot the next larger whole number shall be used. (6)The limitations imposed in this section are in addition and supplemental to all other laws imposing limitations upon the size and weight of vehicles. Further, single axles within groups of axles are subject to the provisions and limitations of this chapter. Single axles within groups of axles may be weighed and of this chapter, no vehi\u00ad cle, motor vehicle, trailer and/or semitrailer, or combination thereof, may be operated on the public highways of the state under loads which would result in the withholding of funds by operation of controlling federal law as provided in the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956, as amended. (8)Except as provided herein, no vehicle or combinati on of vehi\u00ad cles may proceed past the place of weighing at temporary or permanent ports of entry or checking stations when: the weight of a single axle exceeds the maximum limitations set forth herein by two thousand (2,000) pounds or more; the weight of a combination of axles, or gross vehicle weight exceeds the maximum allowable weight as set forth herein by seven percent (7%) or more. Vehicles or combinations of vehicles which exceed the weight limitations set forth herein shall be required to be brought into compliance with applicable weight limitations contained within this subsection at the place of weighing prior to continuing, except those vehicles or combinations of vehicles which are transporting loads which, in the determination of the board or other proper authorities in charge of or having jurisdiction over a highway, are deemed unsafe or impracti\u00ad cal to bring into compliance at the place of weighing, and except those vehicles which do not exceed fifteen percent (15%) over maximum axle and axle group weights set forth in this section. Vehicles or combinations of vehicles transporting loads in this latter category shall obtain a travel authorization to the nearest place of safe unloading, load adjustment or other means of legalization. (a)Neither the state of Idaho or its employees, nor any authority and its employees in charge of or having jurisdiction over a high\u00ad way, shall be held liable for personal injury or property damage resulting from the requirements of section 49-1001(8), Idaho Code. (b)The fee for a travel authorization as set forth above shall he fifty dollars ($50.00) and shall be on a form prescribed by the board or other proper authorities, and shall not be construed as contributing to a reduction in the penalties prescribed in section 49-1013, Idaho Code. (c)The board or other proper authorities in charge of or having jurisdiction over a highway shall adopt and enforce administrative rules as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this sec\u00ad tion.

The state department of education shall dis\u00ad burse such funds to school districts from moneys appropri ated from the bond levy equalization fund. The department shall disburse the funds by no later than September 1 of each year for school districts in which voters have approved the issuance of qualifying bonds by no later than January 1 of that calendar year, and which are certifying a qualifying bond interest and redemption payment for the fiscal year in which the disbursement is made. For districts with a value index below one (1), the percentage of each annual bond interest and redemption payment that is paid by the state shall be determined by dividing the difference between one (1) and the school district's value index by one (1). (2)For the purposes of this section, the annual bond interest and redemption payment shall be determined by dividing the total payment amounts by the number of fiscal years in which payments are to be made. The interest cost portion of the annual bond interest and redemption payment shall be determined by dividing the total interest paid by the number of fiscal years in which payments are to be made. For school dis\u00ad tricts not qualifying for a state payment in the first year of the bond interest and redemption payment schedule, due solely to the January l eligibility deadline, the state department of education shall distribute an additional payment in the next fiscal year, in the amount of such funds that the school district would have otherwise qualified for in the current fiscal year. (3)The provisions of this section may not be utilized to refinance existing debt or subsidize projects previously subsidized by state grants; provided however, that any school district that has issued qual\u00ad ifying bonds prior to June 30, 2004, in conformance with this section shall not be deemed to be refinancing existing debt when the qualifying bonds are utilized to finance the acquisition of public school facili\u00ad ties previously leased or financed through means other than the issuance of general obligation bonds approved by a two-thirds (2/3) vote at an election called for that purpose subject to subsection (5) of this sec\u00ad tion. (4)School districts shall annually report the status of all quali\u00ad fying bonds to the state department of education by January 1 of each year, including bonds approved by the voters, but not yet issued. Infor\u00ad mation submitted shall include the following: (a)The actual or estimated bond interest and redemption payment schedule; (b)Any qualifying bond that has been paid off; (c)Other information as may be required by the state department of education. (5)No school district eligible for participation in the bond levy equalization support program shall be deemed ineligible for partici pa\u00ad tion due to that school district's eligibility and prior participation in the safe school facilities loan and grant program or the Idaho safe schools facilities program under section 33-804A, 33-1017 or 33-1613, Idaho Code, provided that: (a)Such school district notifies the state department of education212 IDAHO SESSION LAWS c.79 2007 of its desire and eligibility to partici pate in the bond levy equal\u00ad ization support program; and (b)Such school district shall receive no state financial assis\u00ad tance under the bond levy equalization support program until the amount to which it would otherwise have been entitled to receive shall equal the amounts received by the school district under the safe school facilities loan and grant program or the Idaho safe schools facilities program under section 33-804A, 33-1017 or 33-1613, Idaho Code. (6)Any school district formed as a result of the consolidation of two (2) or more school districts that passes an eligible bond within three (3) years of the successful consolidation election shall partici\u00ad pate in the bond levy equalization support program at the district's actual value index minus twenty-five hundredths (.25). This adjustment shall apply for the duration of the bond interest and redemption payment schedule. If a school district advantaged by this subsection (6) deconsolidates either during the applicable bond interest and redemption payment schedule, or within a three (3) year period thereafter, each deconsolidated district shall, upon deconsolidation, repay to the bond levy equalization fund all additional subsidies received pursuant to this subsection (6). The proportions owed by each deconsolidated dis\u00ad trict shall be determined by the proportion that each district's market value for assessment purposes bears to the whole. SECTION 5.

When this provision is applied, the decrease in average daily attendance shall be proportionately distributed among the various categories of support units that are appropriate for the dis\u00ad trict. (2} Application of Support Program to Separate Schools/Attendance Units in District. (a} Separate Elementary School. --Any separate elementary school shall be allowed to participate in the educational support program as though the school were the only elementary school operated by the district. (b} Hardship Elementary School. --Upon application of the board of trustees of a school district, the state board of education is empowered to determine that a given elementary school or elementary schools within the school district, not otherwise qualifying, are entitled to be counted as a separate elementary school as defined in section 33-1001, Idaho Code, when, in the discretion of the state board of education, special conditions exist warranting the reten\u00ad tion of the school as a separate attendance unit and the retention results in a substantial increase in cost per pupil in average daily attendance above the average cost per pupil in average daily atten\u00ad dance of the remainder of the district's elementary grade school pupils. An elementary school operating as a previously approved hardship elementary school shall continue to be considered as a sep\u00ad arate attendance unit, unless the hardship status of the elementary school is rescinded by the state board of education. (c)Separate Secondary School. --Any separate secondary school shall be allowed to participate in the educational support program as though the school were the only secondary school operated by the district. (d)Elementary/Secondary School Attendance Units. --Elementary grades in an elementary/second ary school will be funded as a sepa\u00ad rate attendance unit if all elementary grades served are situated more than ten (10) miles distance from both the nearest like elemen\u00ad tary grades within the same school district and from the location of the office of the superintendent of schools of such district, or from the office of the chief administrative officer of such district if the district employs no superintendent of schools. Secondary grades in an elementary/secondary school will be funded as a sepa\u00ad rate attendance unit if all secondary grades served are located more than fifteen (15) miles by an all-weather road from the nearest like secondary grades operated by the district. (e)Hardship Secondary School. --Any district which operated two (2)secondary schools separated by less than fifteen (15) miles, but which district was created through consolidation subsequent to leg\u00ad islative action pursuant to chapter 111, laws of 1947, and which school buildings were constructed prior to 1935, shall be entitled to count the schools as separate attendance units. (f)Minimum Pupils Required. --Any elementary school having less than ten (10) pupils in average daily attendance shall not be allowed to participate in the state or county support program unless the school has been approved for operation by the state board of education.c.79 2007 IDAHO SESSION LAWS 217 (3)Remote Schools, The board of trustees of any Idaho school district which operates and maintains a school which is remote and iso\u00ad lated from the other schools of the state because of geographical or topographical conditions may petition the state board of education to recognize and approve the school as a remote and necessary school. The petition shall be in form and content approved by the state board of education and shall provide such information as the state board of edu\u00ad cation may require. Petitions for the recognition of a school as a remote and necessary school shall be filed annually at least ninety (90) days prior to the date of the annual meeting of the board of trustees as established in section 33-510, Idaho Code.

The final determination of an acceptable program and adequate funding in the case of a remote and necessary elementary school shall be made by the state board of edu\u00ad cation. (4)Support Program When District Boundaries are Changed, (a)In new districts formed by the division of a district, the sup\u00ad port program computed for the district divided in its last year of operation, shall be apportioned to the new districts created by the division, in the proportion that the average daily attendance of pupils, elementary and secondary combined, residing in the area of each new district so created, is to the average daily attendance of all pupils, elementary and secondary combined, in the district divided in its last year of operation before the division. (b)When boundaries of districts are changed by excision or annex\u00ad ation of territory, the support program of any district from which territory is excised for the last year of operation before such excision shall be divided, and apportioned among the districts involved, as prescribed in subsection (4)(a) of this section, (c)In new districts formed by consolidation of former districts after January 1, 2007, the support program allowance for a seven (7) year period following the formation of the new district, shall not be less than the combined support program allowances of the compo\u00ad nent districts in the last year of operation before consolidation. After the expiration of this period, the state department of educa\u00ad tion shall annually calculate the number of support units that would have been generated had the previous school districts not consoli\u00ad dated. All applicable state funding to the consolidated district shall then be provided based on a support unit number that is halfway between this figure and the actual support units, provided that it cannot be less than the actual support units. SECTION 7. That Section 33-906B, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby amended to read as follows: 218 IDAHO SESSION LAWS c.79 2007 33-906B, VALUE INDEX CALCULATION.

The value index for each school district shall be calculated as the sum of the following three (3)components: (1)The state department of education shall annually calculate the market value per support unit that is used to equalize school funding for each school district in the state, and the statewide average. The first portion of the value index shall be calculated by dividing the school district's market value for equalization purposes per support unit by the statewide average market value for equalization per support unit and dividing the result of this calculation by two (2). (2)The second portion of the value index shall be calculated by dividing the statewide unemployment rate by the unemployment rate in the county in which a plurality of the school district's market value for assessment purposes of taxable property is located, and dividing the result of this calculation by four (4). For the purposes of this subsec\u00ad tion, the statewide unemployment rate and county unemployment rates shall be based on the most recent average annual seasonal ly-adjusted unemployment rate data reported by the United States department of labor, for which there is a complete calendar year of data, (3)The third portion of the value index shall be calculated by dividing the county per capita income in the county in which a plurality of the school district's market value for assessment purposes of taxable property is located by the statewide per capita income, and dividing the result of this calculation by four (4). For the purposes of this subsec\u00ad tion, the statewide per capita income and county per capita income shall be based on the most recent data reported by the United States depart\u00ad ment of conmerce, for which there is a complete calendar year of data. If a bond is passed by a subdistrict created pursuant to section 33-351, Idaho Code, the index used shall be that of the school district. For subdistricts created as a result of consolidation, for the purposes of retiring prior bonded indebtedness, pursuant to section 33-3111 Idaho Code, the subdistrict shall retain the value index factor calculated in subsection (1) of this section, as such factor was calculated in the subdistrict's last fiscal year as a separate school district. The rema1n1ng components of the subdistrict1s value index calculati on shall be that of the consolidated school district, as calculated each year.

Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Idaho: SECTION 1. That Section 67-6201, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby amended to read as follows: 67-6201. PURPOSE. It is hereby declared: (a)That within the state there is a shortage of safe or sanitary dwelling acconmodations available which persons of low incomes can afford and that such persons are forced to occupy overcrowded and con\u00ad gested dwelling accommodations; that the aforesaid conditions cause an increase in and spread of disease and crime, and constitute a menace to the health, safety, morals and welfare of the residents of the state and impair economic values; that these conditions necessitate excessive and disproportionate expenditures of public funds for crime prevention and punishment, public health and safety, fire and accident protection, and other public services and facilities. (b)That private enterprise has not been able to provide, without assistance, an adequate supply of safe and sanitary dwellings at prices or rents which persons and families of low income can afford, or to achieve rehabilitation of much of the present low-income housing. It is imperative that the supply of housing for persons and families of low income be increased and that coordination and cooperation among private enterprise, state and local government be encouraged to sponsor, build and rehabilitate residential housing for such persons and families. (c)That the clearance, replanning and reconstruction of the areas in which unsanitary or unsafe housing conditions exist, and the provid\u00ad ing of safe and sanitary dwelling accommodations for persons of low incomes (which dwerr\u00b1ng-aeeommodati-on dwelling acconmodations need not be solely for persons of low incomes in order to avoid concentrations of such persons in specific localities), are public uses, and uses and pur\u00ad poses for which public money may be spent and private property acquired, and are governmental functions. (d)It is also declared and the legislature hereby finds that char-464 IDAHO SESSION LAWS c.152 2007 itable, educational, human service, cultural and other purposes pursued by nonprofit corporations are important public functions and public pur\u00ad poses that should be encouraged and that financing of nonprofit facili\u00ad ties for these purposes should be encouraged, without using state funds or lending the credit of the state, through the issuance of nonrecourse revenue bonds and the lending of the proceeds thereof to nonprofit cor\u00ad porations to promote their purposes. (e)It is further declared that in this state: (1)There exists an inadequate supply of funds at interest rates sufficiently low to enable persons engaged in agriculture in this state, particularly beginning farmers and ranchers, to pursue agri\u00ad cultural operations at present levels; (2)That such inability to pursue agricultural operations reduces the supply of agricultural commodities available to fulfill the needs of the citizens of this state; (3)That such inability to continue operations decreases available employment in the agricultural sector of the state and results in unemployment and its attendant problems; (4)That such conditions prevent the acquisition of an adequate capital stock of farm and ranch equipment and machinery, therefore impairing the productivity of agricultural land; (5)That such conditions are conducive to consolidation of acreage of agricultural land with fewer individuals living and farming and ranching on the traditional family farm and ranch; (6)That these conditions result in a loss in population, unemploy\u00ad ment and movement of persons from rural to urban areas accompanied by added costs to communities for creation of new public facilities and services; (7)That there have been recurrent shortages of funds from private market sources at reasonable rates of interest; (8)That these shortages have made the sale and purchase of agri\u00ad cultural land to beginning farmers and ranchers a virtual impossi\u00ad bility in many parts of the state; (9)That the ordinary operations of private enterprise have not in the past corrected these conditions; and (10)That a stable supply of adequate funds for agricultural financ\u00ad ing is required to encourage beginning farmers and ranchers in an orderly and sustained manner and to reduce the problems described herein. (f)It is further declared that in this state there is an urgent need to promote hidier employment; encourage the development of new jobs; maintain and supplement the capital investments in industry and commerce that currently exist in this state; encourage future employment by ensuring future capital investment; attract environment ally sound industry and commerce to the state; protect and enhance the quality of natural resources and the environment; and promote the production and conservation of energy; and that financing of economic development proj\u00ad ects in partnership with private financial institutions and state or local economic development entities for these purposes should be encour\u00ad aged, without using state funds or lending the credit of the state through the issuance of nonrecourse revenue bonds and the lending of the proceeds thereof for such purposes. isl It is hereby further declared that: (1)The growth of the economy of this state has prompted new andc.152 2007 IDAHO SESSION LAWS 465 ever-increasing uses of public highways, roads, and other transpor\u00ad tation infrastructure, and the existing transportation infrastruc\u00ad ture of this state cannot adequately accomnodate such greatly increased uses; (2)One of the major concerns of the citizens of this state is the ability of the state to address the long-term transportation infra\u00ad structure needs of this state that are critical to the continued growth of the state's economy and the maintenance of citizens' qual\u00ad ity of life; (3)Utilizing bonds or notes to finance projects for transportation infrastructure results in significant cost savings to the state, since such transportation projects can be completed at present day costs and at an accelera ted pace, but such bonds and notes need to be issued promptly in order to realize these cost savings; and (4)It is reasonable and necessary to utilize such bonds or notes for the financing of transportation projects. (gh) It is hereby further declared that all of the foregoing are public purposes and uses for which public moneys may be borrowed, expended or granted and that such activities are governmental functions and serve a public purpose in improving or otherwise benefiting the peo\u00ad ple of this state; that the necessity of enacting the provisions herein\u00ad after set forth is in the public interest and is hereby so declared as a matter of express legislativ e determination.

(2)To qualify for the rebate, the developer of a retail commercial complex whose stores sell tangible personal property or taxable services shall have those stores collect sales and use taxes on sales of tangible personal property or taxable services from the retail commercial com\u00ad plex. Any improvement or alteration to a public highway must be bonded in accordance with the public contracts bond act in chapter 19, title 54, Idaho Code.

A devel\u00ad oper of a retail commercial complex whose stores sell tangible personal property or taxable services must submit a claim for refund pursuant to this section within two (2) years of the developer's last expenditure on the interchange and/or related freeway interchange improvements and/or highway improvements. No interest shall be paid by the state on moneys refunded and all moneys refunded shall be paid from the sales tax account pursuant to subsection (11) of section 63-3638, Idaho Code, and shall be limited to a total aggregate of thirty-five million dollars ($35,000,000) or lesser amount if that is what was expended. (4)Once the developer of a retail co111Dercial complex whose stores sell tangible personal property or taxable services has recouped its costs of funding the interchange and/or related freeway interchange improvements and/or highway improvements and/or related transportation infrastructure, the developer shall be ineligible to receive the rebate pursuant to this section.

It is not the intent of the legislature that the procedures described in this-chapter sections 39-4509 through 39-4515, Idaho Code, are the only effective means of such communication, and nothing in this-chapter sections 39-4509 through 39-4515, Idaho Code, shall impair or supersede any legal right or legal responsibility which a person may have to effect the withholding or withdrawal of life\u00ad sustaining procedures in any lawful manner.

The legislature believes that the state of Idaho must strive to balance efforts to contain medicaid costs, improve program quality and improve access to services. The legislature further believes that the state of Idaho could achieve improved health outcomes for med\u00ad icaid participants by simplifying eligibility and developing health ben\u00ad efits for medicaid participants according to their health needs, includ\u00ad ing appropriate preventive and wellness services. (2) The legislature supports development, at a minimum, of the fol- lowing health-need categories: (a)Lo-Income Children and Working-Age Adults with No Special Health Needs.
