Introduction Leong Hwa Si Temple was founded on 21 March 1901 and has more than a hundred years of history. Located at 67 Shrewsbury Road Singapore 307834, the temple is freehold and has never been relocated since its existence. Leong Hwa Si Temple is a very unique and distinctive temple in terms of its infrastructure. With the colourful facade of its exterior, one would not have thought that the modern looking building is a temple. There is an equally colorful administrative building situated opposite the temple which is only accessible to the temple staff (Fig 1). This temple was rebuilt in 2002 and there is an evident difference in the physical structures of the old and new temple. Before the reconstruction, Leong Hwa Si was a typical traditional temple (Fig 2), which seemed rather closed off and exclusive. After the redevelopment, the temple design became much more modern and open. The temple was revamped due to severe water leakage problems in the old temple. Venerable Fa Cheng, the abbot of the temple, recounted that whenever it rained, water would seep in from the roofs, drenching the entire place. The rationale for the infrastructural change is to reconstruct the temple such that it appears more welcoming to anyone, and everyone, regardless of race, language or religion. Upon interviewing the abbot, he mentioned that he was not too clear about where the funds for the rebuilding came from as it happened a decade ago and there was no board of donations. The temple was previously known as Leong Hwa Chan Si and was only renamed Leong Hwa Si after a general meeting on 20 April 2003, to better reflect the activities of the temple after its redevelopment, for instance, with more involvement in the community services. While the main activities of the new temple are largely similar to that of the old temple, devotees today come from all dialects as compared to in the past, where devotees were mostly Hock Chew. Regular chanting sessions are conducted in the Chinese language. In addition, the temple does not have a fixed number of members. The dialect of the temple is Hock Chew and it was Monk Hui Guan from the mother temple - Lin Yang Chan Shi () in China - who founded Leong Hwa Si Temple. However, the abbot conveyed that the temple does not have links with it, nor to other temples in the region. Therefore, Leong Hwa Si is mainly an independent temple. 2. Gods of the Temple The main God of the temple is Shakyamuni Buddha () and the secondary Gods include Goddess of Mercy (), Bodhisattva (), Bhaiajyaguru Medicine Buddha () and Amitabha (). 2.1 Main God The main God of the temple is Shakyamuni Buddha, the founder of Buddhism. Shakyamuni was born as a prince in Nepal. 'Shakya', the Buddha's clan name suggests 'able to humane' while 'Muni' suggests 'sage'. As such, his name represents 'Sage of the Shakyas'. He is recognised by Buddhists as one who teaches enlightenment and attains full Buddhahood. He also shared his insights to help sentient beings to end rebirth and sufferings. His teachings were passed down by oral tradition for generations till today and have spread across many countries, such as India. 2.2 Secondary Gods Goddess of Mercy is one of the secondary Gods of the temple. Guanyin, in short for Guanshiyin, is an East Asian Bodhisattva of Great Compassion. In Sanskrit, her name 'Avalokiteshvara' represents 'Contemplator of Self-Mastery or Contemplator of the Sounds of the World.' Guanyin uses kindness, compassion, joy and giving to save all living beings. Buddhists also believe when one of their adherents departs from the world, they are placed by Guanyin in the heart of a lotus and sent to the Western Pure Land of Sukhavati (Western Paradise; ). Another secondary God is Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva. His greatest compassionate vow - If I do not go to the hell to help the suffering beings there, who else will? If the hells are not empty, I will not become a Buddha. Only when all living beings have been saved, will I attain Bodhi. The Sutra of Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva tells of great filial piety which the Bodhisattva practised that led to his illimitable vows to save all living beings. The sacred Bhaiajyaguru Medicine Buddha is a Buddha of Healing and Medicine, curing the sufferings of humans by using medicine in his teachings. He is renowned not just for healing, but also for his abilities to neutralise past bad karma, help individuals on the path of enlightenment and bring good fortune to those in need. 'The Buddha of Immeasurable Life and Light', Amitabha, is a celestial Buddha who is known for his longevity attribute. He was a king in the remote period of time and renounced his kingdom to become a monk. Additionally, he possesses infinite merits resulting from good deeds over countless past lives. 3. Other Rituals The temple organises the Medicine Buddha blessing ceremony in November. Their other rituals (Table 1) include Vesak day, Qing Ming, and regular chanting sessions every Sunday morning. Lanterns and lotus flower candles with names are bought by devotees to obtain blessings, with special meanings behind each colour. For example, red signifies prosperity and white signifies health. These will be lighted up during Medicine Buddha Blessing Ceremony (). 4. Temple Layout After the redevelopment of Leong Hwa Si Temple, the modern temple consists of 4 levels. They are namely - the Main Hall (), the Hall of Five Contemplations (), Amitabha Hall () and Ksitigarbha Hall (). 4.1 Main Hall () The Main Hall is located at Level 2 of Leong Hwa Si Temple. It consists of the main God Shakyamuni Buddha at the centre of the hall. Upon entrance into the main hall, the main God is situated at the centre, with many tables placed in front for prayers (Fig 3). The main hall of the temple holds most of the events and rituals conducted. Examples of events include the chanting sessions conducted every Sunday morning for the public as well as celebrations for the Gods' birthdays. 4.2 Hall of Five Contemplations () The Hall of Five Contemplations is located at Level 1, where is it an open-space concept with no official entrance or doors (Fig 4). This is to allow the temple to be more welcoming and accessible to the public, regardless of their race or religion. The Five Contemplations by Buddhist Master Thich Nhat Hanh is recited before meals. The practice of reciting these contemplations before eating is a way to foster mindful eating and helps to promote inner peace through food. There is also a visitor area where visitors can gather around and consume their meals after prayers. 4.3 Amitabha Hall () At level B1, we have the Amitabha Hall () (Fig 5). The Gods present in this hall are the Amitabha buddha (), Goddess of Mercy (), Buddha of the Reward of Action (Karmavipaka Buddha), Sangharama Bodhisattva (), Buddha of Strength (), Manjusri of Wisdom () and Grand Duke Jupiter (). Amitabha Hall holds numerous ancestral tablets and is where visitors pray to their ancestors, especially during occasions like Qing Ming. Tables are situated in front of the Gods and the ancestral tablets, for visitors to place their offerings during praying sessions. Furthermore, there is a visitor corner at the back, to facilitate the preparation of prayer items, such as offerings. 4.4 Ksitigarbha Hall () The Ksitigarbha Hall is located at Level B2, where there are columbariums for the storage of urns. The God situated at this hall is the Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva () (Fig 6). There are 2 main halls, namely, the Private Hall and the VIP Niches Hall. The Private Hall holds the grand niches while the VIP Niches Hall is only exclusively used for the storage of urns of temple monks who have passed away. This is a form of gratitude for their kind contributions and good deeds for the temple during their lifetimes. 5. Community Service Leong Hwa Si temple has a strong and active voluntary arm. Viriya Community Services was founded in 2001 by the parent organisation, Leong Hwa Monastery, with the objective to provide community and social services to low-income families in Singapore regardless of race and religion. Over the years, their outreach has grown as they strive to better meet the needs of all members of the society and they are currently engaged in thirteen projects (Fig 7). Every year, they serve more than 5,000 beneficiaries, including children and youth, families and the elderly. The public can directly make donations at the temple to fund these community projects. The very first project embarked on is the Leong Hwa Chan Si Temple - NKF Dialysis Centre. Fund raising started in 1995 and a sum of S$1.8 million was raised to finance the entire capital costs of the centre. The official opening of the centre was on 31 March 2002 by Minister Lim Swee Say. In his speech, he congratulated Leong Hwa Si Temple and NKF for their foresight and vision to help elderly patients who require lifelong dialysis. The daily running of this centre is managed by NKF qualified personnel, to take care of their 108 patients. This is also the first NKF Dialysis Centre to customise a unique exercise programme for each individual patient. The strong support community in this centre would give patients hope and a renewed zest for life. Leong Hwa Si has been actively organising and participating in many community projects, one of which is the KK Women's and Children's Hospital Homecare Programme. This programme aims to help chronically ill children to get an early discharge from the hospital by providing families with financial, community and emotional support. In support of this programme since 2004, Viriya Community Services has contributed a yearly amount of $240,000 to KK Women's and Children's Hospital and since 31 December 2014, Viriya Community Services has in total contributed $1.82 million to the hospital. This programme has benefitted as many as 536 chronically-ill children. 6. Interesting Stories A friendly auntie volunteer in her 50s gave us a tour of the temple and showed us to the shelves at the back of Amitabha Hall, where there were unclaimed ancestral tablets. These ancestral tablets were moved from the old temple. However, unlike the rest, there have been no claims for these tablets and no maintenance fees were paid. Hence, they were placed on the shelves instead of the main area. At a corner of the Ksitigarbha Hall, we noticed hospital beds and wheelchairs cluttered together, placed around rather disorderly. Curious, we asked the auntie, who shared that those were old equipment donated by the families of the deceased. The temple, in turn, readily donates them to anyone who might need them. The temple did not have a proper storage space to store these donated items, which was why they were gradually piling up! To ensure the survival of Leong Hwa Si temple, Venerable Sek Meow Ee, the President of the temple, believes in the need for a modern management to provide funds for the operations of the temple. As such, Leong Hwa Si Temple has set up a number of businesses such as the Leong Hwa Chan Si-Tan Kim Hai Buddhist Child Development Centre. With constant developments, the temple does not solely depend on the donations from the public and hence continuously implements new strategies to raise funds for its operations. 7. Conclusion Our trip to Leong Hwa Si Temple was indeed an enriching and memorable one. It has greatly broadened our perspectives, allowing us to gain a deeper understanding of the history, practices and teachings of Buddhism. However, the pervasive uncertainty of the temple's future still remains. In recent years, due to the modernisation and secularisation of Singapore, traditional culture and Buddhism have diminished in significance. The complexities of religion coupled with the lower exposure to it, resulting in the reduction in interest amongst youths, have remained a problem for the mere continuation of the temples. While the exterior of these religious places can be transformed to attract more adherents, the sanctity ultimately boils down to the faith from within and without a resurrection of folk religiosity, it is challenging for these temples to perpetuate their totality especially in their distinctive traditions. Despite the challenges and uncertainties temples face, they strongly believe that the teachings of Buddhism should continue to be preserved and spread amongst the public. Not only are temples collective memories of the past, they also serve as places to provide the younger generation with a greater understanding of the everyday life of Chinese Singaporeans. We remembered there was a heavy downpour on the day of our visit. As the temple was located amongst rows of terrace houses, it was slightly inaccessible from the main road. It was rainy and cold but the warmth we received from the temple staff and volunteers who gladly and enthusiastically assisted us truly touched our hearts. Not only did they make multiple trips in and out of their office to search for informative materials, they also kindly offered to photocopy them for us. The friendly volunteer auntie even insisted on giving us a tour around the temple halfway through her lunch. Moreover, they repeatedly invited us for a free lunch of vegetarian food! We are extremely grateful for this experience. Though it was raining heavily outside the temple, there were definitely warm rays of sunshine inside.
