Background : The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Covid -19 Treatment Panel1 has recommended the use of several treatments for outpatients with symptoms of mild -moderate COVID -19 who are at high risk for progression to severe infection . 2. Eligibility/Patient Selection : Each patient should only be offered one treatment during the course of infection . *As of November 2022, the available monoclonal antibodies are not effective against the predominant variants. 2. 1 Treatment requirements : Patients must meet all the following criteria to be eligible for any outpatient treatment at UCLA : Not requiring any supplemental O2 or increase from baseline O2 requirements SARS- CoV-2 positive test at least < 7 days prior (< 5 days for paxlovid) Symptom onset < 7 days prior (<5 days for paxlovid and molnupiravir) At least one high -risk criterion (see below) 2. 2 High risk criteria : Age 65 regardless of medical co -morbidities Diabetes Immunosuppressive disease or immunosuppressive therapy (see below) CKD (CrCl < 60 ml/min per Cockroft -Gault for > 3 months) Obesity (BMI 25 or if 12 -17 years BMI 95th percentile (based on CDC growth chart)) Neurologic diseases: cerebrovascular diseases, Down Syndrome or other neurodevelopmental disorders, or dementia Pregnancy if other risk factors and under maternal fetal medicine consultation (consider checking antibody status) Hemoglobin disorders (sickle cell, thalassemia) Hypertension OR Cardiovascular disease (congenital heart disease, heart failure, CAD, cardiomyopathy, or pulmonary HTN) Chronic lung disease (COPD/emphysema, moderate -severe asthma, CF, pulmonary fibrosis) Medical- related technological dependence (tracheostomy, gastrostomy, or positive pressure ventilation not related to COVID -19) Other CDC defined high risk criteria including history of smoking, history of cancer, liver disease, well controlled HIV, mental health disorders and substance use disorders Symptomatic without new O2 requirementSymptom onset <5 daysNo serious drug interactions: Order Paxlovid via UCLA pharmacy (see below) Serious drug interactions and pending supply: Monoclonal Antibodies* or Remdesivir via REF 1012 Molnupiravir may be used in times of drug scarcity for high risk patients Symptom onset 6-7 daysMonoclonal antibodies* or Remdesivir pending supply via REF 1012UCLA Health Outpatient Treatment GuidanceLast Updated: 1 2/16/22 Socioeconomically disadvantaged patients considered given increased risk of mortality. 2.3 Prioritization in times of scarcity : The following tiered strategy modified from the NIH approach will be implemented during times when referrals exceed supply . Treatment of COVID -19 in unvaccinated/ i ncompletely vaccinated individuals with clinical risk factors for severe illness and /or vaccinated who are unable to mount an adequate immune response ( i.e., immunocompromising conditions). Tier 1 Unvaccinated individuals at the highest risk of severe disease (anyone aged 75 years or anyone aged 65 years with additional risk factors) OR Individuals with severe immunocompromising conditions not expected to mount an adequate immune response to COVI D-19 vaccination or SARS- CoV-2 infection due to their underlying conditions, regardless of vaccine status (highest risk) Tier 2a Tier 2A - Unvaccinated individuals at risk of severe disease not included in Tier 1 (anyone aged 65 years or anyone aged < 65 years with clinical risk factors based on criteria above) Tier 2b Tier 2B - Moderate -severe immunocompromise (per CDC criteria) not otherwise included in Tier 1, regardless of vaccine status and age Tier 3 * Vaccinated individuals at high risk of sever e disease (anyone aged 75 years or anyone aged 65 years with high risk criteria other than immunosuppression) Tier 4 * Tier 4 - Vaccinated individuals at risk of severe disease (anyone aged 65 years or anyone aged <65 with high risk criteria other than immunosuppression ) *Pending supply Tiers 3 and 4 may be further stratified based on absence of booster shot or only 1 J&J Severe i mmunocompromising conditions (Tier 1) : Patients who are within 1 year of receiving B- cell depleting therapies (e.g., rituximab, antigen receptor T cell recipients Post -hematopoietic cell trans plant recipients who have chronic graft versus host disease or who are taking immunosuppressive medications for another indication Patients with hematologic malignancies who are on active therapy Lung transplant recipients Patients who are within 1 year of receiving a solid -organ transplant (other than lung transplant) Solid -organ transplant recipients with recent treatment for acute rejection with T or B cell depleting agents Patients with severe combined immunodeficiencies Patients with untreated HIV who have a CD4 T lymphocyte cell count <50 cells/mm3 Moderate immunocompromising conditions (Tier 2B): Active cancer treatment for non -hem malignancies (e.g. myelosuppressive chemotherapy) Solid organ transplant on immunosuppression HSCT <2 y ears (without GVHD/not taking immunosuppressive meds for another indication) Moderate primary immunodeficiency treatment Untreated/advanced HIV, CD4 count <200 high -dose corticosteroids ( >20mg daily for at least 2 weeks) or other drugs that may suppress your immune response (active, within the last month) UCLA Health Outpatient Treatment GuidanceLast Updated: 1 2/16/22 When demand e xceeds supply on any given day, the order time stamp and a point system, specifically prioritizing risk of disease severity and risk of exposure (including socioeconomic vulnerability), will be included in the allocation process. A lottery system may also be utilized if multiple individuals have the same risk for disease severity. R eferrals will be reviewed at 10:30am on each calendar day. 3. Selection of Therapies /Ordering : Agents will be considered depending on availability, activity against circulating strain, and contraindications. 3.1 Available Options Paxlovid ( PO), a protease inhibitor: several drug interactions Remdesivir targeting RNA polymerase Molnupiravir (PO): nucleoside prodrug that targets RNA polymerase Table 1: Available Options and Considerations Paxlovid (nirmatrelavir/ritonavir) Remdesivir Molnupiravir Standard Dose Nirmatrelvir 300mg (two 150 mg tablets) with 100 mg ritonavir (one 100mg tablet), with all three tablets taken together twice daily for 5 days with or without food 200mg IV day 1 100mg IV d2-3 800mg po BID x 5 days Window 5 days from sx onset 7 days from sx onset 5 days from symptom onset Efficacy 89% risk reduction in hospitalization 87% risk reduction in hospitalization 30% reduction in hospitalization Drug Interactions -Substrate and inhibitor of CYP3A4 -Review Appendix No hydroxychloroquine lowers remdesivir activity No significant interaction Pregnancy/ Lactation Limited data, must be approved by MFM Limited data, generally considered safe Contraindicated Renal adjustment -For eGFR >30 ml/min and <60 ml/min: decrease dose to 150 mg nirmatrelvir (one 150 mg tablet) and 100 mg ritonavir (one 100 mg tablet) twice daily x 5 days with or without food -Not recommended for eGFR < 30 ml/min Manufac turer's labeling does not recommend use for eGFR<30 ml/min, but significant toxicity with a short duration of therapy is unlikely. Benefits may outweigh the risks in select patients . No adjustments Hepatic adjustment Not recommended in severe impairment Not recommende d if AST/ALT >10 x ULN No adjustments 3.2 Dispensing Requirements Patients must receive fact sheets and consent to treatment prior to administration. Paxlovid fact sheet (available in English and Spanish ) Remdesivir fact sheet separate and specific to UCLA Health available here at this time Molnupiravir fact sheet is available in Engl ish and Spanish . UCLA Health Outpatient Treatment GuidanceLast Updated: 1 2/16/22 3.3 How to order/refer to outpatient therapies (IV only ): Provider places order for REF1012 ( Referral for COVID -19 Outpatient Therapies ) Patient is assessed by Outpatient COVID -19 Treatment Team and, if eligible, scheduled for outpatient infusion at one of 3 infusion sites: - Bowyer ( Hem -Onc patients) - CTRC - IV League in Culver City (pending availability) - Select patients may receive remdesivir via home health through our partnered agencies (Accent Care and Intracare) 3.4 molnupiravir can be sent directly to the below pharmacies for curbside pickup if supply is available . - Medical Plaza Level 1 Pharmacy - Hours : Mon-Fri 8a-6p , Sat 8a-4p ; 310-794-1170 - UCLA Santa Monica 16th Street Pharma cy - Pharmacies If you have eligible patients whom we are not able to accommodate with oral therapies due to supply , consider one of these outpatient pharmacies that carry oral antiviral therapies. Providers must screen patient's medication list for drug interactions (see Table below or use https://www.covid19 - druginteractions.org ). UCLA Health Outpatient Treatment GuidanceLast Updated: 1 2/16/22 3.5 Emergency Department Guidance : However, patients should NOT be referred to the ED specifically for treatment. Socioeconomically vulnerable patients unable to access care otherwise will be prioritized . In such rare circumstances the ED can arrange for h ome health remdesivir via the two above agencies (See Section 3.3). All such decisions should be approved by Tara Vijayan, MD (Medical Director of Antimicrobial Stewardship) p31173 or the Covid ID attending on call (RRMC p89292 and SMH p89234 ). In addition, patients who meet the criteria for Paxlovid (high risk, symptoms <5 days and no contraindicated drug interactions) can have the medication ordered at the 200 Med Plaza Level 1 pharmacy or the SM 16th street pharmacy (see Section 3.4 and 3.4.1 above) .
