You should feel comfortable during the entirety of your treatment. Though you should not feel pain, you may feel differing sensations. The insertion of a filament may feel like a slight pinch, similar to that of a mosquito bite. You may feel a following temporary sensation such as a dull ache, tingling, warming or moving sensation. This sensation is known as de qi, or the arrival of qi to the point, and indicates that the body is responding to acupuncture stimulation. Is acupuncture safe? Yes - we take your health and safety very seriously. During an acupuncture treatment, sterile, non-toxic, single-use needles are used, and are later disposed of properly in a biohazard container. All points are chosen and needled cautiously, avoiding nerves, blood vessels, and organs. Prior to licensing, Dr. Yolanda completed a 4-year Doctoral Program, was trained and certified in Clean Needle Technique, and passed a series of National Board Exams to ensure cleanliness and safety. She is also Board-Certified through the NCCAOM. What should I expect during my first visit? All new patients are asked to complete a patient information and health history form for Dr. Yolanda to get a clear understanding of past and present health concerns. During the initial appointment, 30 minutes are dedicated to discussing primary concerns in great detail. The physical exam may include taking vital signs, examining the tongue and pulse, facial diagnosis, abdominal palpation, and more, depending on the individual. All of this information leads to a working diagnosis in which strategic acupoints are chosen based on the presenting signs and symptoms of each individual. Dr. Yolanda then inserts the filaments, which will be retained for 15-30 minutes, allowing you to relax. Dr. Yolanda may choose to include an adjunctive modality to aid in your healing process such as gua sha, e-stim, cupping, moxibustion, and/or an herbal formula suggestion. How long are treatments? Initial appointments last 90 minutes with each follow-up appointment lasting 60 minutes. We ask new patients to arrive 15 minutes prior to their appointment to fill out paperwork. This paperwork may also be downloaded, completed, and emailed prior or brought to the initial visit. If you choose to make an appointment for a specific modality such as cupping or gua sha, the appointment lasts 30 min. How many treatments do I need? This depends on the individual and what is being treated. Acute cases typically resolve in 4-6 treatments while chronic cases may need a longer course of treatment. Improvement of chronic cases should be seen within 8-12 weeks, and may require \"maintenance\" care after initial treatment. This means you may need to gradually reduce number of treatments over time from every other week to once a month, once every 3 months, and so on. How do I prepare for a treatment? Please bring copies of any previous medical records and current medications and/or supplements with you. We generally suggest wearing loose-fitting clothing to your appointment, or bringing a pair of shorts along with you. Also, please have something to eat approximately one hour prior to your treatment as well. What is orthopedic acupuncture? Orthopedic acupuncture is a musculoskeletal acupuncture approach to treat orthopedic pain, postural imbalances, and soft tissue injuries through the stimulation of both motor points as well as traditional acupuncture points to not only relieve the presenting concern, but also promote the overall health and function of the body. What about pediatric care? Children often respond quickly to treatment. Though acupuncture can be used, most commonly, other techniques are utilized such as acupressure, tui na, and herbal therapy. Is herbal medicine beneficial? Yes. An herbal formula is tailored to you based on your individual signs and symptoms. Herbal therapy is effective and enhances acupuncture treatment, as you can take herbal remedies in the comfort of your own home on a daily basis. Are herbal remedies safe? Yes. Throughout Dr. Yolanda's 4-year Doctoral Program, she learned about single herbs and formulations of herbs, including their cautions and contraindications as well as their interactions with western pharmaceuticals. This is why a current up-to-date list of medications is important to avoid any potential herb-drug interaction. Also, Dr. Yolanda only use herbal companies who perform quality control and scientific testing on their herbs to assure safety and potency. What is your cancellation policy? If you need to cancel an appointment, we require a 24-hour advanced notice, which allows us to offer an appointment to a patient on a wait-list. Cancellations less than 24 hours are subject to a $50 fee while missed appointments without any notification are subject to the full amount of an appointment - $100. Do you offer packages?

Do you offer special pricing for military, police, fire, and 65+? Yes - we offer special pricing for military, veterans, police, fire, emergency personnel, and individuals 65+. What forms of payments do you accept?
