The practitioner can then go into those areas of the body, mind, or spirit that are out of balance and bring them back into balance with some hands-on integrative approaches. She demonstrates a portable auriculotherapy device that she uses to scan various points on the ear to find an area of unusually high frequencies, which she can then treat by sending in a stimulus to balance those energies. Dr. Nelson has been an RN in the healthcare professions for 35 years, with emphasis in Integrative Medicine. Dr. Nelson's experience crosses all disciplines and areas of expertise in the alternative and allopathic healthcare fields. She has passionately pursued her interests in Integrative Medicine and acquired exceptional insight and aptitude for the expansive use of Integrative approaches and state of the art electro-medicine technologies. She has had a passion for demonstrating the multidisciplinary approaches, blended with the variety of approaches in assisting the Body/Mind to relax, de-stress, relieve pain and bringing a healthy balance back to the individual.
