This Spring Booster programme is available for: - adults aged 75 years and over. - residents in a care home for older adults. - individuals aged 5 years and over who are immunosuppressed. From 24 March 2023, invitation letters will be sent in batches to around 7,000 eligible islanders.

Letters are being sent to those who are eligible for an autumn booster. Further details will be included on the invitation letter. Primary Booster A primary booster continues to be offered to the following people: - Anyone over the age of 16 provided that 3 months has elapsed since their second primary dose of vaccine (or single dose if Janssen). - Children and young people aged 12 to 15 no sooner than 3 months after completion of their primary course if they are in a clinical risk group or are a household contact of someone who is immunosuppressed, or if they are severely immunosuppressed and have had a third primary dose. Please note that if you have recently had Covid-19, you cannot have your booster until 28 days have passed since the day you tested positive. Those aged 12 to 17 will need to wait 12 weeks. The booster programme is being offered, in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). Individuals are being offered a booster provided that 3 months has passed since the date of their final primary dose of vaccine. If you have not had your first or second primary dose or booster and would now like a vaccine, please contact the Vaccination Call Centre (VCC) by emailing [vcc@gov.gg](mailto:vcc@gov.gg) or by calling 01481 220001. What is the booster vaccine for? We are offering a booster programme in line with the recommendations of JCVI. This is because, like for some other vaccines, levels of protection afforded by the primary COVID-19 vaccination programme may begin to wane over time in some individuals. This booster dose will help extend the protection a person has gained from their first 2 doses to give them longer term protection. The JCVI advises that the booster vaccine dose is offered no earlier than 3 months after completion of the primary vaccine course. However, this doesn't mean that you are 'no longer vaccinated' as soon as 3 months has elapsed. Protection against severe disease from the first 2 doses seems to decline very slowly. So, there is no cause for concern if the booster vaccine is given after the 3-month time-point. The booster dose should help to extend a person's protection.
