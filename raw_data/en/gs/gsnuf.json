The National Institute of Health Clinical Trials website currently lists 3489 clinical trials as of September 30, 2020. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP)1 website, ''there is a need to ensure that all inform decisions about the health care of the available evidence.'' Many drug candidates are being repurposed to manage COVID-19 by expedited observational studies and clinical trials across different populations worldwide, even as the search for vaccines is gathering momentum. The urgency of the current pandemic demands immediate and pragmatic clinical responses. A surprising dissonance between conventional medical research and clinical practice can be observed during this pandemic, challenging fundamental assumptions of evidence-based medicine and conventional biomedical practice. Might this development lead us to a pier of practice-based evidence (PBE) focusing on patient-centered care on compassionate grounds? Or does the global medical community need to strike a better balance between those two approaches to optimizing therapeutic responses to this pandemic? A recent editorial in PLOS Medicine reads, ''It is surely time to turn to a more fit-for-purpose scientific paradigm. Complex adaptive systems theory proposes that precise quantification of particular cause-effect relationships is both impossible (because such relationships are not constant and cannot be meaningfully isolated) and unnecessary (because what matters is what emerges in a particular real-world situation).'' Harnessing medical resources effectively and other safety measures is particularly critical for emerging countries, which are ill-equipped to meet the multifaceted challenges of an escalating pandemic. India is now the second most affected country globally after the United States and faces a challenging situation of inadequate medical infrastructures, insufficient health care investments, and social structures. The mainstream public health care machinery in India is already overwhelmed in major cities across the country. It has led to various pandemic response guidelines based on local realities in different Indian federal states. In such a scenario, it is essential to mobilize all available resources, including traditional medicine systems in India and in all countries with pluralistic health care systems. According to the WHO traditional medicine strategy (2014-2023) midterm review report8 (based on the inputs from 179 countries), 88% of the 194 WHO member states have acknowledged the use of traditional and complementary medicine (which corresponds to 170 member states). However, there appear to be no systematic efforts globally or nationally \u2014 except in China \u2014 to explore the potential of traditional and integrative health care practices during the pandemic. In a recent development, the \"Regional expert Committee on Traditional Medicine for COVID-19 formed by the World Health Organization (WHO), the Africa Centre for Disease Control and Prevention and the African Union Commission for Social Affairs has endorsed a protocol for phase III clinical trials of herbal medicine for COVID-19 as well as a charter and terms of reference for the establishment of a data and safety monitoring board for herbal medicine clinical trials.'' The PBE building exercise that has been evoked by the COVID-19 pandemic puts all medical systems\u2014conventional medicine and traditional medicine systems\u2014on more or less level ground. An unprecedented opportunity is emerging for a constructive dialogue between the systems and coevolution and systematic collaboration within a synergistic framework. The PBE and the complexity research approaches, which are primary methods of yurveda and other traditional medical systems, need to complement the conventional research. Traditional medicine systems such as yurveda have a highly developed theoretical and methodological framework to study new diseases and develop treatment guidelines based on rationale derived from clinical medicine principles and therapeutic experience since millennia. Epidemics have been described at large even in the classic canonical texts of yurveda and have provided a substantial repertoire of treatment strategies that not only have a long history of safe use but also have proven effcacious in similar pathologies. The application of systematic protocols to formulate clinical practice guidelines from yurveda and their integration into COVID-19 patients' treatment could fill gaps and unmet needs in the official health response systems. The WHO sanctions and lays down the criteria for using interventions not based on robust evidence, described as a ''Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered and Experimental Interventions (MEURI).'' MEURI has been endorsed by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) as per the National Guidelines for Ethical Committees for Reviewing Biomedical and Research During the COVID Pandemic, which could, in principle, approve such yurveda studies with appropriate ethical reviews. yurveda-Related Initiatives in India The National Interdisciplinary Research and Development Task Force for AYUSH research in COVID-19 was constituted in India on April 2020 to streamline AYUSH's COVID-19 response (yurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homoeopathy). The primary rationale was that all AYUSH interventions for COVID-19 should be rigorously built on robust research for which systematic cooperation between AYUSH and biomedical physicians and scientists is necessary. Clinical trials have been initiated to evaluate the efficacy of Asvagandha (Withania somnifera L.) for the management of COVID-19. Clinical Trials Registry India lists 107 studies (as on August 20, 2020) on yurveda initiated by various institutions using the guidelines issued by the Ministry of AYUSH. General clinical practice guidelines have also been formulated. "}
