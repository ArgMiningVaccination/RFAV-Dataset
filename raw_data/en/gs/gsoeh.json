Myocarditis and pericarditis have been reported following administration of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine The safety of the primary series Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine was evaluated in participants 6 months of age and older in 3 clinical studies conducted in the United States, Europe, Turkey, South Africa, and South America. Study BNT162-01 (Study 1) was a Phase 1/2, 2-part, dose-escalation trial that enrolled 60 participants, 18 through 55 years of age. Study C4591001 (Study 2) is a Phase placebo-controlled, observer-blind, dose-finding, vaccine candidate-selection (Phase 1) and efficacy (Phase 2/3) study that has enrolled approximately 46,000 participants, 12 years of age or older. Of these, approximately 43,448 participants [21,720 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (30 mcg modRNA); 21,728 placebo] in Phase 2/3 are 16 years of age or older (including 138 and 145 participants 16 and 17 years of age in the vaccine and placebo groups, respectively) and 2,260 participants are 12 through 15 years of age (1,131 and 1,129 in the vaccine and placebo groups, respectively). Study C4591007 (Study 3) is a Phase 1/2/3 multicenter, observer-blind, immunogenicity and efficacy (Phase 2/3) study that has enrolled 4,695 participants 5 through 11 years of age, of whom 3,109 participants received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (10 mcg modRNA) and 1,538 participants received placebo in Phase 2/3. Study 3 also enrolled 1,776 participants 6 through 23 months of age, of whom 1,178 participants were in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (3 mcg modRNA) group and 598 participants in the placebo group; and also enrolled 2,750 participants 2 through 4 years of age, of whom 1,835 participants were in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine group and 915 participants in the placebo group in Phase 2/3. In Study 2 and Study 3, all participants 6 months through 4 years of age, 5 through 11 years of age, 12 through 15 years of age, and a subset of participants 16 years of age and older, were monitored for solicited local and systemic reactions and use of antipyretic medication after each vaccination in an electronic diary. Participants are being monitored for unsolicited adverse events, including serious adverse events, throughout the study [from Dose 1 through 1 month after the last vaccination (all unsolicited adverse events) or 6 months (serious adverse events) after the last vaccination]. Tables 1 through 4 present the frequency and severity of solicited local and systemic reactions, within 7 days following each dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and placebo in participants 6 months through 4 years of age. Participants 6 Through 23 Months of Age (3-Dose Primary Series) In an analysis of Study 3 (Phase 2/3), based on data in the blinded placebo-controlled follow-up period up to the cutoff date of April 29, 2022, 570 participants 6 through 23 months of age who received a 3-dose primary series [386 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (3 mcg modRNA); 184 placebo] have been followed for a median of 1.3 months after the third dose. Demographic characteristics in Study 3 were generally similar with regard to age, gender, race, and ethnicity among participants 6 through 23 months of age who received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and those who received placebo. Among the 1,178 participants 6 through 23 months of age who received at least 1 dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, 50.0% were male and 50.0% were female, were White, were multi-racial, 13.7% were Hispanic/Latino, 7.7% were Asian, 3.6% were Black or African American, and 0.3% were American Indian/Alaska Native. Solicited Local and Systemic Adverse Reactions The mean duration of tenderness at the injection site after Dose 3 was 1.5 days (range 1 to 9 days), for redness 1.5 days (range 1 to 5 days), and for swelling 1.8 days (range 1 to 3 days) for participants 6 through 23 months of age in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine group in the blinded placebo-controlled follow-up period (cutoff date of April 29, 2022). |Note: Reactions were collected in an electronic diary (e-diary) from Day 1 to Day 7 after vaccination.| Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine Redness Any 124 (10.6) 44 (7.4) 107 (9.3) 39 (6.6) 26 (7.1) 9 (5.3) Mild 114 (9.7) 41 (6.9) 97 (8.5) 36 (6.1) 17 (4.7) 8 (4.7) Moderate 10 (0.9) 3 (0.5) 10 (0.9) 3 (0.5) 8 (2.2) 1 (0.6) Severe 0 0 0 0 1 (0.3) 0 Swelling Any 46 (3.9) 15 (2.5) 45 (3.9) 9 (1.5) 10 (2.7) 3 (1.8) Mild 40 (3.4) 13 (2.2) 39 (3.4) 8 (1.4) 7 (1.9) 3 (1.8) Moderate 6 (0.5) 2 (0.3) 6 (0.5) 1 (0.2) 3 (0.8) 0 Severe 0 0 0 0 0 0 Tenderness at the injection site Any 192 (16.6) 66 (11.2) 171 (15.0) 50 (8.5) 58 (16.0) 20 (11.8) Mild 181 (15.6) 61 (10.3) 154 (13.5) 42 (7.1) 51 (14.1) 17 (10.0) Moderate 11 (0.9) 5 (0.8) 16 (1.4) 8 (1.4) 7 (1.9) 3 (1.8) Severe 0 0 1 (0.1) 0 0 0 |Note: Events and use of antipyretic or pain medication were collected in an electronic diary (e-diary) from Day 1 to Day 7 after each dose.| Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine Fever 38.0 85 (7.2) 43 (7.2) 85 (7.4) 36 (6.1) 25 (6.8) 10 (5.9) 38.0 to 38.4 42 (3.6) 22 (3.7) 41 (3.6) 18 (3.0) 14 (3.8) 7 (4.1) >38.4 to 38.9 23 (2.0) 14 (2.4) 20 (1.7) 11 (1.9) 5 (1.4) 2 (1.2) >38.9 to 40.0 19 (1.6) 6 (1.0) 23 (2.0) 7 (1.2) 5 (1.4) 1 (0.6) >40.0 1 (0.1) 1 (0.2) 1 (0.1) 0 1 (0.3) 0 Decreased appetite Any 257 (22.2) 125 (21.2) 252 (22.2) 106 (18.0) 73 (20.2) 23 (13.5) Mild 138 (11.9) 73 (12.4) 157 (13.8) 63 (10.7) 42 (11.6) 13 (7.6) Moderate 116 (10.0) 51 (8.6) 91 (8.0) 42 (7.1) 27 (7.5) 10 (5.9) Severe 3 (0.3) 1 (0.2) 4 (0.4) 1 (0.2) 4 (1.1) 0 Drowsiness Any 313 (27.0) 173 (29.3) 271 (23.8) 125 (21.2) 72 (19.9) 22 (12.9) Mild 251 (21.7) 130 (22.0) 201 (17.7) 98 (16.6) 50 (13.8) 15 (8.8) Moderate 60 (5.2) 41 (6.9) 66 (5.8) 26 (4.4) 21 (5.8) 6 (3.5) Severe 2 (0.2) 2 (0.3) 4 (0.4) 1 (0.2) 1 (0.3) 1 (0.6) Irritability Any 593 (51.2) 279 (47.2) 539 (47.4) 240 (40.7) 158 (43.6) 64 (37.6) Mild 245 (21.1) 106 (17.9) 213 (18.7) 89 (15.1) 56 (15.5) 27 (15.9) Moderate 341 (29.4) 173 (29.3) 319 (28.1) 146 (24.7) 101 (27.9) 37 (21.8) Severe 7 (0.6) 0 7 (0.6) 5 (0.8) 1 (0.3) 0 Use of antipyretic or pain medication 281 (24.0) 117 (19.7) 243 (21.2) 111 (18.8) 70 (19.2) 28 (16.5) Unsolicited Adverse Events In the following analyses of Study 3 in participants 6 through 23 months of age (386 of whom received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and 184 of whom received placebo), 83.7% of participants had at least 30 days of follow-up after Dose 3. Serious Adverse Events Serious adverse events from Dose 1 through 1 month after Dose 3, with an overall median of 1.3 months follow-up after Dose 3 were reported by 1.4% of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine recipients and by 2.3% of placebo recipients. No serious adverse events were reported that were considered related to vaccination. Non-Serious Adverse Events Non-serious adverse events from Dose 1 through up to 1 month after Dose 3, in ongoing follow-up were reported by 29.1% of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine recipients and by 26.3% of placebo recipients. From Dose 1 through 30 days after Dose 3, lymphadenopathy was reported in 2 (0.2%) participants in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine group vs. 0 (0%) in the placebo group. There were no other notable patterns between treatment groups for specific categories of non-serious adverse events that would suggest a causal relationship to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Participants 2 Through 4 Years of Age (3-Dose Primary Series) In an analysis of Study 3 (Phase 2/3), based on data in the blinded placebo-controlled follow-up period up to the cutoff date of April 29, 2022, 886 participants 2 through 4 years of age who received a 3-dose primary series [606 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (3 mcg modRNA); 280 placebo] have been followed a median of 1.4 months after the third dose. Demographic characteristics in Study 3 were generally similar with regard to age, gender, race, and ethnicity among participants 2 through 4 years of age who received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and those who received placebo. Among the 1,835 participants 2 through 4 years of age who received at least 1 dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, 49.1% were male and 50.9% were female, were White, were Hispanic/Latino, 7.1% were multi-racial, 6.9% were Asian, 5.1% were Black or African American, and 0.2% were American Indian/Alaska Native. Solicited Local and Systemic Adverse Reactions The mean duration of pain at the injection site after Dose 3 was 1.7 days (range 1 to 14 days), for redness 1.5 days (range 1 to 3 days), and for swelling 1.8 days (range 1 to 4 days) for participants 2 through 4 years of age in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine group in the blinded placebo-controlled follow-up period (cutoff date of April 29, 2022). |Note: Reactions were collected in an electronic diary (e-diary) from Day 1 to Day 7 after vaccination.| Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine Redness Any 160 (8.8) 77 (8.5) 202 (11.4) 50 (5.7) 60 (10.9) 9 (3.4) Mild 137 (7.5) 67 (7.4) 170 (9.6) 43 (4.9) 53 (9.6) 7 (2.7) Moderate 22 (1.2) 9 (1.0) 31 (1.7) 7 (0.8) 7 (1.3) 2 (0.8) Severe 1 (0.1) 1 (0.1) 1 (0.1) 0 0 0 Swelling Any 67 (3.7) 26 (2.9) 102 (5.7) 18 (2.1) 17 (3.1) 3 (1.1) Mild 59 (3.2) 21 (2.3) 81 (4.6) 16 (1.8) 16 (2.9) 3 (1.1) Moderate 8 (0.4) 5 (0.6) 21 (1.2) 2 (0.2) 1 (0.2) 0 Severe 0 0 0 0 0 0 Pain at the injection site Any 559 (30.8) 186 (20.6) 550 (31.0) 178 (20.3) 146 (26.7) 35 (13.4) Mild 522 (28.8) 178 (19.7) 514 (29.0) 169 (19.3) 130 (23.8) 33 (12.6) Moderate 37 (2.0) 7 (0.8) 36 (2.0) 8 (0.9) 16 (2.9) 2 (0.8) Severe 0 1 (0.1) 0 1 (0.1) 0 0 |Note: Events and use of antipyretic or pain medication were collected in an electronic diary (e-diary) from Day 1 to Day 7 after each dose.| Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine Fever 38.0 95 (5.2) 48 (5.3) 88 (4.9) 46 (5.2) 28 (5.1) 11 (4.2) 38.0 to 38.4 57 (3.1) 24 (2.6) 41 (2.3) 17 (1.9) 16 (2.9) 4 (1.5) >38.4 to 38.9 24 (1.3) 16 (1.8) 26 (1.5) 21 (2.4) 8 (1.4) 4 (1.5) >38.9 to 40.0 13 (0.7) 8 (0.9) 19 (1.1) 8 (0.9) 4 (0.7) 3 (1.1) >40.0 1 (0.1) 0 2 (0.1) 0 0 0 Fatigue Any 539 (29.7) 277 (30.6) 456 (25.7) 201 (22.9) 134 (24.5) 57 (21.8) Mild 335 (18.5) 176 (19.4) 267 (15.1) 120 (13.7) 87 (15.9) 35 (13.4) Moderate 198 (10.9) 96 (10.6) 181 (10.2) 78 (8.9) 45 (8.2) 22 (8.4) Severe 6 (0.3) 5 (0.6) 8 (0.5) 3 (0.3) 2 (0.4) 0 Headache Any 81 (4.5) 44 (4.9) 81 (4.6) 36 (4.1) 27 (4.9) 11 (4.2) Mild 63 (3.5) 35 (3.9) 63 (3.6) 23 (2.6) 19 (3.5) 10 (3.8) Moderate 18 (1.0) 8 (0.9) 18 (1.0) 12 (1.4) 8 (1.5) 1 (0.4) Severe 0 1 (0.1) 0 1 (0.1) 0 0 Chills Any 41 (2.3) 22 (2.4) 53 (3.0) 23 (2.6) 18 (3.3) 7 (2.7) Mild 28 (1.5) 16 (1.8) 35 (2.0) 17 (1.9) 14 (2.6) 7 (2.7) Moderate 10 (0.6) 6 (0.7) 18 (1.0) 6 (0.7) 3 (0.5) 0 Severe 3 (0.2) 0 0 0 1 (0.2) 0 Vomiting Any 54 (3.0) 24 (2.7) 61 (3.4) 29 (3.3) 9 (1.6) 10 (3.8) Mild 44 (2.4) 14 (1.5) 55 (3.1) 26 (3.0) 7 (1.3) 9 (3.4) Moderate 10 (0.6) 10 (1.1) 6 (0.3) 3 (0.3) 2 (0.4) 1 (0.4) Severe 0 0 0 0 0 0 Diarrhea Any 139 (7.7) 72 (8.0) 118 (6.7) 64 (7.3) 28 (5.1) 13 (5.0) Mild 130 (7.2) 64 (7.1) 105 (5.9) 57 (6.5) 21 (3.8) 10 (3.8) Moderate 9 (0.5) 8 (0.9) 12 (0.7) 7 (0.8) 7 (1.3) 3 (1.1) Severe 0 0 1 (0.1) 0 0 0 New or worsened muscle pain Any 43 (2.4) 15 (1.7) 46 (2.6) 21 (2.4) 11 (2.0) 4 (1.5) Mild 33 (1.8) 13 (1.4) 33 (1.9) 17 (1.9) 8 (1.5) 4 (1.5) Moderate 9 (0.5) 2 (0.2) 13 (0.7) 4 (0.5) 3 (0.5) 0 Severe 1 (0.1) 0 0 0 0 0 New or worsened joint pain Any 14 (0.8) 18 (2.0) 24 (1.4) 9 (1.0) 7 (1.3) 2 (0.8) Mild 12 (0.7) 13 (1.4) 18 (1.0) 6 (0.7) 5 (0.9) 2 (0.8) Moderate 2 (0.1) 5 (0.6) 6 (0.3) 3 (0.3) 1 (0.2) 0 Severe 0 0 0 0 1 (0.2) 0 Use of antipyretic or pain medication 197 (10.8) 83 (9.1) 177 (9.9) 74 (8.4) 47 (8.5) 18 (6.9) Unsolicited Adverse Events In the following analyses of Study 3 in participants 2 through 4 years of age (606 of whom received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and 280 of whom received placebo), 76.6% of participants had at least 30 days of follow-up after Dose 3. Serious Adverse Events Serious adverse events from Dose 1 through 1 month after Dose 3, with an overall median of 1.4 months follow-up after Dose 3 were reported by 0.7% of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine recipients and by 0.9% of placebo recipients. One serious adverse event of fever (maximum temperature 40.3\u00b0C) on Day 3 after Dose 2 in a 4-year-old was considered possibly related to vaccination. Non-Serious Adverse Events Non-serious adverse events from Dose 1 through up to 30 days after Dose 3, in ongoing follow-up were reported by 18.5% of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine recipients and by 18.5% of placebo recipients. From Dose 1 through 30 days after Dose 3, lymphadenopathy was reported in 1 (0.1%) participant in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (3 mcg modRNA) group vs. 0 (0.0%) in the placebo group. There were no other notable patterns between treatment groups for specific categories of non-serious adverse events that would suggest a causal relationship to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Participants 5 Through 11 Years of Age (2-Dose Primary Series) In an analysis of Study 3 (Phase 2/3), based on data up to the cutoff date of September 06, 2021, 2,268 participants [1,518 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (10 mcg modRNA); 750 placebo] were 5 through 11 years of age. Of these, 2,158 (95.1%) [1,444 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (10 mcg modRNA) and 714 placebo] participants have been followed for at least 2 months after the second dose. An analysis of Study 3 Phase 2/3 adverse event data also included another 2,379 participants [1,591 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (10 mcg modRNA) and 788 placebo], of whom 71.2% had a follow-up period for at least 2 weeks after Dose 2 up to the cutoff date of October 8, 2021. The safety evaluation in Study 3 is ongoing. Demographic characteristics in Study 3 were generally similar with regard to age, gender, race, and ethnicity among participants 5 through 11 years of age who received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (10 mcg modRNA) and those who received placebo. Among the 4,647 participants 5 through 11 years of age who received at least 1 dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (10 mcg modRNA) or placebo, 51.8% were male and 48.2% were female, 77.3% were White, 5.8% were Black or African American, 16.9% were Hispanic/Latino, 8.3% were Asian, and 0.4% were American Indian/Alaska Native. Unsolicited Adverse Events In the following analyses of Study 3 in participants 5 through 11 years of age (1,518 of whom received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine [10 mcg modRNA] and 750 of whom received placebo), 99.5% of participants had at least 30 days of follow-up after Dose 2. Serious Adverse Events In 1 group of participants (initial enrollment cohort) with a median of 2.3 months follow-up post Dose 2, no serious adverse events were reported that were considered related to vaccination. In a second group of participants (expansion cohort) with a median of 2.4 weeks follow-up post Dose 2, no serious adverse events were reported that were considered related to vaccination. Non-Serious Adverse Events In 1 group of participants (initial enrollment cohort), non-serious adverse events from Dose 1 through up to 30 days after Dose 2 up to the cutoff date of September 06, 2021, in ongoing follow-up were reported by 10.9% of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (10 mcg modRNA) recipients and by 9.1% of placebo recipients. In this group of participants, >99% had follow-up 30 days post Dose 2. In a second group of participants (expansion cohort) for which the median follow-up was 2.4 weeks (range 0 - 3.7 weeks), non-serious adverse events from Dose 1 through the cutoff date of October 8, 2021, were reported by 7.1% of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (10 mcg modRNA) recipients and by 6.3% of placebo recipients. In the initial enrollment cohort, from Dose 1 through 30 days after Dose 2, lymphadenopathy was reported in 13 (0.9%) participants in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (10 mcg modRNA) group vs. 1 (0.1%) in the placebo group. In the expansion cohort from Dose 1 through the cutoff date, lymphadenopathy was reported in 6 (0.4%) participants in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (10 mcg modRNA) group vs. 3 (0.4%) in the placebo group. There were no other notable patterns between treatment groups for specific categories of non-serious adverse events that would suggest a causal relationship to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Participants 12 Through 15 Years of Age (2-Dose Primary Series) In an analysis of Study 2, based on data up to the cutoff date of March 13, 2021, 2,260 participants [1,131 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (30 mcg modRNA); 1,129 placebo] were 12 through 15 years of age. Of these, 1,308 (660 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and 648 placebo) participants have been followed for at least 2 months after the second dose. The safety evaluation in Study 2 is ongoing. Demographic characteristics in Study 2 were generally similar with regard to age, gender, race, and ethnicity among participants who received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and those who received placebo. Overall, among the participants who received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, 50.1% were male and 49.9% were female, 85.9% were White, 4.6% were Black or African American, 11.7% were Hispanic/Latino, 6.4% were Asian, and 0.4% were American Indian/Alaska Native. Unsolicited Adverse Events In the following analyses of Study 2 in participants 12 through 15 years of age (1,131 of whom received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and 1,129 of whom received placebo), 98.3% of study participants had at least 30 days of follow-up after Dose 2. Serious Adverse Events Serious adverse events from Dose 1 through up to 30 days after Dose 2 in ongoing follow-up were reported by 0.4% of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine recipients and by 0.1% of placebo recipients. There were no notable patterns or numerical imbalances between treatment groups for specific categories of serious adverse events that would suggest a causal relationship to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Non-Serious Adverse Events Non-serious adverse events from Dose 1 through up to 30 days after Dose 2 in ongoing follow-up were reported by 5.8% of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine recipients and by 5.8% of placebo recipients. From Dose 1 through 30 days after Dose 2, reports of lymphadenopathy plausibly related to the study intervention were imbalanced, with notably more cases in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine group (7) vs. the placebo group (1). There were no other notable patterns or numerical imbalances between treatment groups for specific categories of non-serious adverse events that would suggest a causal relationship to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Participants 16 Years of Age and Older (2-Dose Primary Series) At the time of the analysis of Study 2 for the EUA, 37,586 [18,801 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (30 mcg modRNA) and 18,785 placebo] participants 16 years of age or older had been followed for a median of 2 months after the second dose. The safety evaluation in Study 2 is ongoing. The safety population includes participants 16 years and older enrolled by October 9, 2020, and includes safety data accrued through November 14, 2020. Demographic characteristics in Study 2 were generally similar with regard to age, gender, race, and ethnicity among participants who received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and those who received placebo. Overall, among the total participants who received either the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or placebo, 50.6% were male and 49.4% were female, 83.1% were White, 9.1% were Black or African American, 28.0% were Hispanic/Latino, 4.3% were Asian, and 0.5% were American Indian/Alaska Native. Unsolicited Adverse Events Serious Adverse Events In Study 2, among participants 16 through 55 years of age who had received at least 1 dose of vaccine or placebo (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine = 10,841; placebo = 10,851), serious adverse events from Dose 1 through up to 30 days after Dose 2 in ongoing follow-up were reported by 0.4% of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine recipients and by 0.3% of placebo recipients. In a similar analysis, in participants 56 years of age and older (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine = 7,960, placebo = 7,934), serious adverse events were reported by 0.8% of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine recipients and by 0.6% of placebo recipients who received at least 1 dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or placebo, respectively. In these analyses, 91.6% of study participants had at least 30 days of follow-up after Dose 2. Appendicitis was reported as a serious adverse event for 12 participants, and numerically higher in the vaccine group, 8 vaccine participants and 4 placebo participants. Currently available information is insufficient to determine a causal relationship with the vaccine. There were no other notable patterns or numerical imbalances between treatment groups for specific categories of serious adverse events (including neurologic, neuro-inflammatory, and thrombotic events) that would suggest a causal relationship to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Non-Serious Adverse Events In Study 2 in which 10,841 participants 16 through 55 years of age received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and 10,851 participants received placebo, non-serious adverse events from Dose 1 through up to 30 days after Dose 2 in ongoing follow-up were reported in 29.3% of participants who received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and 13.2% of participants in the placebo group, for participants who received at least 1 dose. Overall, in a similar analysis in which 7,960 participants 56 years of age and older received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, non-serious adverse events within 30 days were reported in 23.8% of participants who received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and 11.7% of participants in the placebo group, for participants who received at least 1 dose. In these analyses, 91.6% of study participants had at least 30 days of follow-up after Dose 2. The higher frequency of reported unsolicited non-serious adverse events among Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine recipients compared to placebo recipients was primarily attributed to local and systemic adverse events reported during the first 7 days following vaccination that are consistent with adverse reactions solicited among participants in the reactogenicity subset. From Dose 1 through 30 days after Dose 2, reports of lymphadenopathy were imbalanced with notably more cases in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine group (64) vs. the placebo group (6), which is plausibly related to vaccination. Throughout the safety follow-up period to date, Bell's palsy (facial paralysis) was reported by 4 participants in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine group. Onset of facial paralysis was Day 37 after Dose 1 (participant did not receive Dose 2) and Days 3, 9, and 48 after Dose 2. No cases of Bell's palsy were reported in the placebo group. Currently available information is insufficient to determine a causal relationship with the vaccine. There were no other notable patterns or numerical imbalances between treatment groups for specific categories of non-serious adverse events (including other neurologic or neuro-inflammatory, and thrombotic events) that would suggest a causal relationship to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Bivalent Vaccine (Original and Omicron BA.1) Administered as a Second Booster Dose in Individuals Greater than 55 Years of Age In Study 4, a total of 610 participants greater than 55 years of age previously vaccinated with a 2-dose primary series and 1 booster dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine went on to receive a second booster dose with either Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or the bivalent vaccine (Original and Omicron BA.1). The 305 participants greater than 55 years who received a second booster dose with the bivalent vaccine (Original and Omicron BA.1) received it 4.7 to 11.5 months after receiving the first booster dose and had a median follow-up time of 1.7 months up to a data cutoff date of May 16, 2022. Their median age was 67 years (range 56 through 85 years of age), 53.1% were male and 46.9% were female, 89.8% were White, 14.8% were Hispanic/Latino, 5.2% were Asian, and 4.3% were Black or African American. Solicited Local and Systemic Adverse Reactions Table 5 and Table 6 present the frequency and severity of reported solicited local reactions and systemic reactions, respectively, within 7 days of a second booster dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or bivalent vaccine (Original and Omicron BA.1). In participants who received the bivalent vaccine (Original and Omicron BA.1), the mean duration of injection site pain, redness, and swelling was 2.2 days (range 1 to 12 days), 2.9 days (range 1 to 10 days), and 1.9 days (range 1 to 4 days), respectively. |Note: Adverse Reactions were collected in the electronic diary (e-diary) from day of vaccination (Day 1) through Day 7 after the study vaccination.| Redness Any (>2 cm) 19 (6.4) 21 (7.0) Mild 12 (4.0) 13 (4.3) Moderate 6 (2.0) 8 (2.7) Severe 1 (0.3) 0 Swelling Any (>2 cm) 18 (6.0) 20 (6.6) Mild 10 (3.4) 14 (4.7) Moderate 8 (2.7) 6 (2.0) Severe 0 0 Pain at the injection site Any 179 (60.1) 175 (58.1) Mild 154 (51.7) 159 (52.8) Moderate 24 (8.1) 15 (5.0) Severe 1 (0.3) 1 (0.3) |Note: Adverse reactions and use of antipyretic or pain medication were collected in the electronic diary (e-diary) from day of vaccination (Day 1) through Day 7 after the study vaccination.| Fever 38.0\u00b0C 11 (3.7) 15 (5.0) 38.0\u00b0C to 38.4\u00b0C 6 (2.0) 11 (3.7) >38.4\u00b0C to 38.9\u00b0C 5 (1.7) 0 >38.9\u00b0C to 40.0\u00b0C 0 4 (1.3) >40.0\u00b0C 0 0 Fatigue Any 135 (45.3) 148 (49.2) Mild 70 (23.5) 88 (29.2) Moderate 64 (21.5) 55 (18.3) Severe 1 (0.3) 5 (1.7) Headache Any 79 (26.5) 101 (33.6) Mild 47 (15.8) 71 (23.6) Moderate 31 (10.4) 29 (9.6) Severe 1 (0.3) 1 (0.3) Chills Any 49 (16.4) 39 (13.0) Mild 32 (10.7) 25 (8.3) Moderate 17 (5.7) 14 (4.7) Severe 0 0 Vomiting Any 4 (1.3) 5 (1.7) Mild 2 (0.7) 5 (1.7) Moderate 2 (0.7) 0 Severe 0 0 Diarrhea Any 13 (4.4) 27 (9.0) Mild 10 (3.4) 18 (6.0) Moderate 3 (1.0) 5 (1.7) Severe 0 4 (1.3) New or worsened muscle pain Any 59 (19.8) 67 (22.3) Mild 35 (11.7) 40 (13.3) Moderate 24 (8.1) 27 (9.0) Severe 0 0 New or worsened joint pain Any 27 (9.1) 34 (11.3) Mild 16 (5.4) 23 (7.6) Moderate 11 (3.7) 11 (3.7) Severe 0 0 Use of antipyretic or pain medication 80 (26.8) 88 (29.2) Unsolicited Adverse Events Overall, the participants who received a second booster dose with the bivalent vaccine (Original and Omicron BA.1) had a median follow-up time of 1.7 months (range 1.0 to 2.0 months) to the cutoff date (May 16, 2022). In an analysis of all unsolicited adverse events reported following the second booster dose, through 1 month after the booster dose, those assessed as adverse reactions not already captured by solicited local and systemic reactions were lymphadenopathy (n = 1; 0.3%) for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and (n = 1; 0.3%) for the bivalent vaccine (Original and Omicron BA.1), nausea (n = 1; 0.3%) for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and (n = 1; 0.3%) for the bivalent vaccine (Original and Omicron BA.1), and malaise (n = 0) for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and (n = 1; 0.3%) for the bivalent vaccine (Original and Omicron BA.1). Serious Adverse Events Serious adverse events up to 1 month after the second booster dose in ongoing follow-up were reported by no Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine recipients and by 1 bivalent vaccine (Original and Omicron BA.1) recipient (1 serious adverse event considered unrelated to the vaccine). Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent (Original and Omicron BA.4/BA.5) In Study 6, all participants 6 months through 4 years of age were monitored for solicited local and systemic reactions and use of antipyretic medication after the vaccination in an electronic diary. Participants are being monitored for unsolicited adverse events, including serious adverse events, throughout the study [through 1 month after the booster (fourth dose)]. Tables 7 through 10 present the frequency and severity of solicited local and systemic reactions, within 7 days following a booster (fourth dose) of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent in participants 6 through 23 months of age and 2 through 4 years of age who were previously vaccinated with a 3-dose primary series of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Participants 6 Through 23 Months of Age Who Received a Booster Dose with Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent (Original and Omicron BA.4/BA.5) In a subset of Study 6, 24 participants 6 through 23 months previously vaccinated with a 3-dose primary series of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (3 mcg modRNA) received a booster (fourth dose) of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent (Original and Omicron BA.4/BA.5) (3 mcg modRNA). Participants received a booster dose with Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent 2.1 to 8.6 months after receiving their third dose with Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 and had a median follow-up time of 1.6 months (range 1.5 to 2.3 months) up to a data cutoff date of November 25, 2022. Their median age was 19 months (range 12 through 23 months), 58.3% were female and 41.7% were male, 54.2% were White, 20.8% were Asian, 20.8% were multi-racial, 16.7% were Hispanic/Latino, and 4.2% were Black or African American. Solicited Local and Systemic Adverse Reactions Table 7 and Table 8 present the frequency and severity of reported solicited local reactions and systemic reactions, respectively, within 7 days of a booster (fourth dose) of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent. The duration of injection site tenderness, swelling and redness for all events observed was 1 day.

Each 0.2 mL dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent supplied in multiple dose vials with maroon caps and labels with maroon borders also includes the following ingredients: lipids (0.04 mg ((4-hydroxybutyl)azanediyl)bis(hexane-6,1-diyl)bis(2-hexyldecanoate), 0.005 mg 2[(polyethylene glycol)-2000]-N,N-ditetradecylacetamide, 0.01 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, and 0.02 mg cholesterol), 3.2 mg sucrose, 0.006 mg tromethamine, and 0.04 mg tromethamine hydrochloride. The diluent (sterile 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP) contributes 1.52 mg sodium chloride per dose. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent do not contain preservative. The vial stoppers are not made with natural rubber latex. The modRNA in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent are formulated in lipid particles, which enable delivery of the RNA into host cells to allow expression of the SARS-CoV-2 S antigen. The vaccine elicits an immune response to the S antigen, which protects against COVID-19. The effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for individuals 6 months through 4 years of age is based on efficacy of primary vaccination with this vaccine in individuals 16 years of age and older and effectiveness of primary vaccination with this vaccine in individuals 6 months through 4 years of age. The effectiveness of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent for the third dose of the primary series or for a booster dose in individuals 6 months through 4 years of age after completion of primary vaccination with 3 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is based on: Study 2 is a multinational, Phase 1/2/3, randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind, dose-finding, vaccine candidate-selection, and efficacy study in participants 12 years of age and older. Randomization was stratified by age: 12 through 15 years of age, 16 through 55 years of age, or 56 years of age and older, with a minimum of 40% of participants in the 56-year stratum. The study excluded participants who were immunocompromised and those who had previous clinical or microbiological diagnosis of COVID-19. Participants with preexisting stable disease, defined as disease not requiring significant change in therapy or hospitalization for worsening disease during the 6 weeks before enrollment, were included as were participants with known stable infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), or hepatitis B virus (HBV). In the Phase 2/3 portion of Study 2, based on data accrued through November 14, 2020, approximately 44,000 participants 12 years of age and older were randomized equally and received 2 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (30 mcg modRNA) or placebo separated by 21 days. Participants are planned to be followed for up to 24 months, for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID-19. The population for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint included 36,621 participants 12 years of age and older (18,242 in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine group and 18,379 in the placebo group) who did not have evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 through 7 days after the second dose.

Randomization was stratified by age: 6 through 23 months of age, 2 through 4 years of age, or 5 through 11 years of age. The study excluded participants who were immunocompromised and those who had previous clinical or microbiological diagnosis of COVID-19. Results from participants 6 months through 4 years of age are presented in this subsection. In Phase 2/3, a total of 1,776 participants 6 through 23 months of age and 2,750 participants 2 through 4 years of age were randomized 2:1 and received 3 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or saline placebo. Effectiveness in individuals 6 months through 4 years of age is based on a comparison of immune responses in this age group to individuals 16 through 25 years of age. Immunogenicity in Participants 2 Through 4 Years of Age After a 3-Dose Primary Series Immunogenicity analyses have been performed in the immunobridging subset of 143 Study 3 participants 2 through 4 years of age without evidence of infection up to 1 month after Dose 3 based on a data cutoff date of April 29, 2022. The evaluable immunogenicity population without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 3 of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine was comprised of 143 participants 2 through 4 years of age. Most participants in this analysis population were White (69.2%), with 5.6% Black or African American participants, 11.2% Asian participants, and 11.9% multi-racial participants. There were 11.2% Hispanic/Latino participants. The median age was 3.0 years and 44.1% of participants were male. There were 6.3% of participants reported as obese. In the evaluable immunogenicity population (regardless of evidence of prior infection), 11/204 participants (5.4%) were baseline positive for prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 50% neutralizing antibody titers (NT50) were compared between an immunogenicity subset of Phase 2/3 participants 2 through 4 years of age from Study 3 at 1 month after the 3-dose primary series and a randomly selected subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants 16 through 25 years of age at 1 month after the 2-dose primary series, using a microneutralization assay against the reference strain (USA_WA1/2020). The primary immunobridging analyses compared the geometric mean titers (using a geometric mean ratio [GMR]) and the seroresponse (defined as achieving at least 4-fold rise in SARS-CoV-2 NT50 from before Dose 1) rates in the evaluable immunogenicity population of participants without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 3 in participants 2 through 4 years of age and up to 1 month after Dose 2 in participants 16 through 25 years of age.

Efficacy in Participants 6 Months Through 4 Years of Age After a 3-Dose Primary Series A descriptive efficacy analysis of Study 3 was performed across the combined population of participants 6 months through 4 years of age based on PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases among 873 participants in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine group and 381 participants in the placebo group (2:1 randomization) who received 3 doses of study intervention during the blinded follow-up period when the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 (BA.2) was the predominant variant in circulation (data cutoff date of June 17, 2022). The evaluable efficacy population without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 7 days after Dose 3 of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine was comprised of 873 vaccine recipients and 381 placebo recipients 6 months through 4 years of age. Most vaccine recipients in this analysis population were White (76.3%), with 3.4% Black or African American participants, 10.0% Asian participants, and 10.1% who identified as multi-racial, other or not reported. There were 11.2% Hispanic/Latino vaccine recipients. Among the vaccine recipients, 51.1% were female. The median age was 16.0 months in vaccine recipients 6 through 23 months of age and the median age was 3.0 years in vaccine recipients 2 through 4 years of age. In the evaluable efficacy population, 8.7% of vaccine recipients had one or more comorbidities that increase the risk of severe COVID-19 as described in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) 69(32);1081-8 and/or obesity (BMI 95th percentile) for participants 2 through 4 years of age. Between participants who received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and those who received placebo, there were no notable differences in demographics. The median dose interval between Dose 2 and Dose 3 was 13.4 weeks (range 8 to 33 weeks) among participants 6 through 23 months of age and 10 weeks (range 8 to 34 weeks) among participants 2 through 4 years of age who received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. The median length of blinded follow-up for efficacy after Dose 3 was 1.7 months for participants 6 through 23 months of age and 2.1 months for participants 2 through 4 years of age in the Dose 3 Evaluable Efficacy Population who received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or placebo. The vaccine efficacy results after Dose 3 in participants 6 months through 4 years of age are presented in Table 17. |Abbreviations: NAAT coronavirus 2; VE = vaccine efficacy.| Note: Confirmed cases were determined by Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and at least 1 symptom consistent with COVID-19 (symptoms included: fever; new or increased cough; new or increased shortness of breath; chills; new or increased muscle pain; new loss of taste or smell; sore throat; diarrhea; vomiting; inability to eat/poor feeding).

This case occurred 44 days after Dose 3, based on a single criterion (increased heart rate) and did not require hospitalization. There were no cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children reported through the June 17, 2022 data cutoff date. In Study 6, a subset of 60 participants 6 months through 4 years of age received a booster dose (fourth dose) of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent (3 mcg modRNA) after receiving 3 prior doses of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (3 mcg modRNA). Neutralizing antibody levels following the fourth dose are presented in Table 18. Data from a subset of participants 6 months through 4 years of age in Study 3 who received 3 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (3 mcg modRNA) are included as a reference. There were no formal statistical comparisons of the immune response between subsets from the two studies. |Abbreviations: GMT = geometric mean titer; LLOQ respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

GMRs and seroresponse rates were evaluated at 1 month after vaccination with the bivalent vaccine (Original and Omicron BA.1). The bivalent vaccine (Original and Omicron BA.1) booster dose was administered 4.7 to 11.5 months (median 6.3 months) after the first booster dose. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine booster dose was administered 5.3 to 13.1 months (median 6.3 months) after the first booster dose. The primary objective of the study was to assess superiority with respect to level of 50% neutralizing titer (NT50) and noninferiority with respect to seroresponse rate of the anti-Omicron BA.1 immune response induced by a dose of the bivalent vaccine (Original and Omicron BA.1) relative to the response elicited by a dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine given as a second booster dose in participants greater than 55 years of age. A secondary objective of the study was to assess noninferiority with respect to level of NT50 to the Original SARS-COV-2 strain induced by a dose of the bivalent vaccine (Original and Omicron BA.1) relative to the response elicited by a dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine given as a second booster dose. A comparison of seroresponse rates to the Original strain was descriptive. Superiority of the anti-Omicron BA.1 NT50 for the bivalent vaccine (Original and Omicron BA.1) relative to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine was met, as the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for GMR was >1. Noninferiority of for vaccine (Original and Omicron BA.1) relative to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine was met, as the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for GMR was >0.67 and the point estimate of the GMR was 0.8 (Table 19). Noninferiority of the seroresponse rate to the Omicron BA.1 variant for the bivalent vaccine (Original and Omicron BA.1) relative to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine was met as the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference in percentages of participants with seroresponse is >-5% (Table 20).

[WHAT IS AN EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION (EUA)?] An EUA is a mechanism to facilitate the availability and use of medical products, including vaccines, during public health emergencies, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. An EUA is supported by a Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) declaration that circumstances exist to justify the emergency use of drugs and biological products during the COVID-19 pandemic. A product authorized for emergency use has not undergone the same type of review by FDA as an FDA-approved product. FDA may issue an EUA when certain criteria are met, which includes that there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. In addition, the FDA decision is based on the totality of the scientific evidence available showing that the product may be effective to prevent COVID-19 during the COVID-19 pandemic and that the known and potential benefits of the product outweigh the known and potential risks of the product. All of these criteria must be met to allow for the product to be used during the COVID-19 pandemic. An EUA is in effect for the duration of the COVID-19 EUA declaration justifying emergency use of this product, unless terminated or revoked (after which the product may no longer be used).
