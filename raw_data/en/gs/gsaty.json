CoutureRecently, I was having a conversation with a fellow heart-transplant recipient, when Iexplained to him that I was also adouble-lung transplant recipient.He replied, \"We hearts get all theattention, but you lungs get allthe complications.\" Begrudgingly,I agreed that he was correct. It isa fact of life, or should I say a factof transplant life, that lungtransplantation is problem prone. From the beginning of my ordeal, I ran into difficulties. Mypulmonologist referred me fortransplantation when I was told Ihad a year and a half left to live.Unfortunately, he didn't realizethat the wait for lung transplantshad grown much longer andcould take three years. I waslisted at the local center, but Iknew if I stayed there, I would diewhile waiting. Lungs, unlikekidneys, must be in therecipient's body and workingwithin four to six hours ofremoval and are only sharedwithin a 500-mile radius of thedonor's hospital. Therefore, Ineeded to find a transplant center in another part of the countrywith a shorter waiting list. I also found out it was not going to be easy to get a lung. Out ofthe approximately 5,000 organdonors each year only 10 to 20percent of them have suitablelungs to donate. Lungs are fragile and easily damaged bymechanical ventilation, traumaand infection, which are commoncircumstances surrounding braindeath. Because of the shortage, Iwas told that I could only get onelung. This way the lives of twopeople could be saved instead ofone. While this may seem admiralin the face of the organ donorshortage, it would, unfortunately,still leave me with one diseasedlung after the transplant. My diseased lung could become a source of infection and, becauseof its over-inflated size, interferewith the function of my trans-planted lung. I also knew most ofthe people I talked to whoreceived a single lung noticedthey had shortness of breathdoing simple tasks, while thepeople who had two lungstransplanted were playing tennis,hiking or swimming. The otherproblem I saw with a single lungtransplant was that it would leaveme with less lung reserve if and A publication for transplant recipients of all organs and their families, published by the National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

Summer is in full swing and if getting into a pool orsome type of water is an activity youparticipate in during this time of theyear, I 'm sure you 'll find the article on \"Water Workouts\" beneficial tostaying or getting in shape. Our\"Summertime Eating\" will also give you some great tips to complete the summer. Many of our readers have asked us to address pre- and post-transplant insurance issues, which we havedone in this issue. However, due to the complexity ofthis topic, we will be spreading it out over several issues. Depression is also a topic that is prevalent among transplant recipients. As with any chronic disease, it isnot unusual for recipients to experience periods ofdepression. I think you will find the article on depressionand the pharmacist 's recommendations of treatment to be very informative. As always, consult your transplantteam with your concerns. This is the year off from the U.S. Transplant Games, unless you are attending the World Games (see the nextissue for results), but it 's not too early to plan for the 2002 U.S. Transplant Games in Orlando, Florida.

The current rejection rate in lung transplant recipients is high, approx-imately 50 to 70 percent in the first five years. I figured, if I was going to have to go through with the transplant, I wanted to give it my best shot. So, Isearched the country to find a center willing to giveme two lungs. After about six months of numerousphone calls, faxes and rejections, I finally found acenter that would consider me for two lungs. I wentfor an evaluation and was accepted into their prog-ram. Within two weeks, I sold all my things andmoved to Florida where the center was located. I was very fortunate to have only waited 13 months for my transplant and when I received mycall, my transplant went off without a hitch. Unlikesome patients, who commonly experience what iscalled a dry run (they 're called when a lung becomes available, only to be told the lung is not suitable fordonation), my lungs were suitable for transplanta-tion. Unfortunately, one-third of the trips made bythe transplant team to inspect donated lungs turnout to be unsuccessful. The first year after my transplant was the most difficult. Lung transplants are unique among otherorgans because the lungs are the only major organregularly exposed to an outside environment that isteaming with deadly viruses, bacteria and fungi. Forthe first six months, I had to wear a mask in publicplaces, which really didn't bother me, since I was onoxygen all of the time prior to my transplant. To thisday, I wear a mask whenever I'm in an area whereI'm likely to encounter sick people, such as adoctor's office, a hospital or an airplane. I even woreone during the Transplant Games. You wouldn'tthink that I would need a mask at the Games, but Iencountered several participants there who weresick. You can always spot the lung transplantrecipients in a crowd. We're the ones wearingsurgical masks! Since my transplant, I have become an expert at not getting sick. In order to do so, I have adoptedsome unusual habits. I wash my hands frequently,especially before every meal. I know that doesn'tsound unusual, but I am constantly surprised bythe number of people who don't. I use my elbow or apaper towel to open the door to a public restroom.And if I think you are sick, I may not want to shakeLungs, So Precious Few continued from page 1your hand. Dodging germs is no easy task, but it becomes an essential skill to learn after anytransplant. Now that I have survived five years, I don't take any chances. I love gardening and yard work, butwill wear a mask and gloves to do it. I only travel bycar or train unless flying is absolutely necessary. Idon't pet strange dogs and cats like I do my ownbeloved pet. I take time off from work if I get a sorethroat and I am meticulous about taking mymedications regularly. Lung transplantation is a difficult road to travel, but one that I wouldn't trade for any other. Yet, Idon't want people to think that being a lungtransplant recipient is any harder than any othertype of transplant. They are all difficult. I'm notcomplaining either. I'd rather be able to breathewhen I laugh, cry or have sex. Anything more is justgravy. I often look at my transplant scar, whichspans the width of my chest and think to myself\"these are my war wounds.\" Karen A.

Medicare Has Two Parts PART A \u2014Offers 100 percent coverage for inpatient hospitalization and transplant surgery.The deductible is $776.00 per admission for 61-90 days, then a co-payment must be paid if theadmission goes beyond 60 days. If you arereadmitted within six months, the deductible doesnot have to be met again. After six months, itmust be paid. PART B \u2014Covers 80 percent of outpatient charges, for example, clinical appointments, bloodwork and immunosuppressant medications.There is a $100.00 deductible. The cost is $45.50per month. If you are receiving Social Security, itwill be deducted from your check, if not, you willbe billed quarterly.4 Transplant Chronicles, Vol. 9, No. 1eating right Summer Time Eating By Kimberlee Rast, RD Summer is the time for barbecues, picnics, pool parties and outdoor fun. Part of the fun is the greatfood of summer time. From barbecued chicken, potatosalad and homemade ice cream to shrimp and crabboils, fresh fruits and ice cream cones. The summerabundance of low fat foods is wonderful for transplantpatients. Using the grill to cook is an excellent way tokeep the fat content down, without losing flavor.Eating outdoors is also one way Americans enjoygetting together to eat as a family. The one concern for outdoor eating is food safety. Keeping foods at the wrong temperature can lead tofood-borne illness. People with decreased immunefunction are at a higher risk of \"catching\" a food-borneillness. Following some simple rules can help ensureno one in your family will come down with foodpoisoning. Antibacterial soaps, sponges and sprayswill not make up for sloppy kitchen hygiene. @ In general ... Wash your hands with soap and warm water before and afterhandling foods. Promptly wash cutting boards, plates and counter tops that come in contact withmeat juices or raw meat, using hot, soapy water.To sanitize after cleaning, put items through theautomatic dishwasher or rinse them in a solutionof one teaspoon of chlorine bleach to one quart ofwater. Avoid contamination by handling raw meat, poultry, seafood and eggs as if they werecontaminated with bacteria. Even if they do notstart out with enough bacteria to make you sick, ifmishandled they could. Do not use the samekitchenware for raw and cooked meat. Avoid cross-contamination. @ When grocery shopping and preparing ... Dented or damaged cans \u2014Do not eat foods from dented or damaged cans. Freshness dates \u2014Do not use food products after the freshness date hasexpired. An exception is milk, whichhas a sold by date and is still good for anotherweek. Raw eggs \u2014Do not eat raw eggs or uncooked dough which contains raw eggs. Wash produce thoroughly with water \u2014Use a scrub brush to remove dirt from potatoes, carrots andturnips. Peel and discard outer leaves and rinds.Wash prepackaged salad mixes and vegetables,even if the label says they are pre-washed. No soapor detergent is needed. Purchase fresh produce. Do not buy any produce that is shriveled, moldy or slimy. Buy only whatyou can use within a few days. Thaw frozen foods in the refrigerator. Not on the counter. Separate your cutting boards \u2014Use one board for raw meat, poultry and fish and use another boardfor salads and other foods. Buy fresh fish. Seafood should have a clean smell. The fish eyes should be clear, shiny and bulging(not sunken). @ When cooking ... Always cook thoroughly. Only thorough cooking will destroy anyharmful bacteria in the food.Freezing or rinsing foods in water willnot kill the bacteria. Avoid interrupted cooking. Meat and poultry products must be cooked thoroughly the first time.Afterward, they can be refrigerated and reheatedsafely. When microwaving food, follow manufacturers ' instruction carefully. Use microwave safecontainers, rotate them during the cooking processand let the food stand for the recommended time. Use a meat thermometer to check meat and poultry. Cook roasts and steaks to at least 145degrees, ground beef and pork to 160 degrees andwhole poultry to 180 degrees. Make sure meat, poultry and fish are cooked thoroughly. Fish should be opaque and flake easilywith a fork. Beef should look gray or brown inside.Chicken and pork should look white or tan. Beef,chicken and pork juices should be clear, not pink. @ Handling leftovers ...

Those of us who need to counteract the side effects of disease and medication need to build thosemuscles in a big way! Exercising in the water forcesyou to use both parts of the muscle pair. You 'll use your biceps with your triceps, your quadriceps withyour hamstring, etc. By balancing the work on bothsides, you provide equal strengthening, therebyreducing the risk of injury and overuse. Stretching in the water is a comfortable way to maintain flexibility and increase your range ofmotion. If you have not begun any kind of exerciseprogram, and you have access to a pool, begin withsimple water stretches. The tension in your body willslowly dissipate and the warm water will promoterelaxation and comfortable breathing. It is awonderful way to get your body to cooperate withexercise (and your mind). Don't underestimate the power of the water. Although the water hasits own cooling system, your heartrate will be about 10 beats less perminute than on land. It places asufficient demand on your heartand circulatory system. To improveefficiency, a water fitness programshould include the samecomponents as any workout. Startwith warm-up, then 20 to 30minutes of aerobic activity, strengthening movements, stretching to enhance flexibility and, finally, a cooldown. You may choose to participate in a wateraerobics class with friends, or take a swimminglesson. You 're never too old to learn deep water running. Deep water running is a more intenseexercise. You should learn it from someone withexperience. Getting the posture and motions correcttakes time and practice. Ask about lessons at yourhealth club, your local Y pools or running clubs.

Underwood, BS, AFAA, ACE, ACSM We may not be Esther Williams, but a jump into the water can provide a very effective workout, as wellas offer the power to soothe, calm, and refresh. Many of you are familiar with water aerobics, aerobic exercises performed in the water. Thecushioning of the water minimizes injuries and issoothing to your body. It allows you the benefits ofexercise and saves wear and tear on muscles, whileprotecting the joints. Over the past several years the popularity of water aerobics has grown because it appeals to all ages andfitness levels. But water workouts have been aroundfor years. In the past, water aerobics were usedmostly for rehabilitative therapy. The water'sbuoyancy, resistance and therapeutic massagingeffects contribute to the healing process. In additionto it being an effective workout, it alsosoothes the mind and the spirit. Wecan emerge from a swim feelingrefreshed and rejuvenated. It has givenus the time to work our cardiovascularsystem, tone our muscles, stretch ourbodies, relax our minds and find a bitof solitude. Many of the characteristics that doctors found to be effective forinjuries, athletes found irresistible as across-training tool. Water training is agood way of improving and maintainingyour fitness level without suffering any kind ofimpact. It is especially beneficial to transplantrecipients and dialysis patients, as long as it comeswith a physician 's approval. Many of us have other physical problems that we must deal with. Waterexercises are a way to get fit and stay fit. In order to swim or walk in the water, the body works in opposition. This movement between thearms and the legs is the basis for all human coordina-tion. While immersed in water, you are workingwonders for your overall balance and coordination.These activities will assist you in gaining strength,endurance and flexibility. It will help you to performdaily activities with greater ease and to gain strengthfor other activities that you may perform.

By Stephanie Johnstone, LCSW If you have a chronic illness or a transplant, depression could happen to you. Although you aregrateful for receiving your transplant, you are nowmore at risk for depression than people without achronic medical illness. There are many reasonswhy depression occurs. One reason is that livingwith a chronic illness can be difficult to handle forsome people. The daily stress of following strictmedical routines, adjusting to physical changes,explaining to others about your illness and fightingto fit into a world where you are not quite sick andnot quite well can take its toll on your mood. If youbegin to feel powerless under the stress and youlack a sense of control over your illness, it couldcontribute to depression.Combined with stress, the inabilityto solve life 's everyday problems can lead to depression. Your risk ofdepression can increase if you aresocially isolated and have lostcontact with loved ones, or yourhealth care providers. Thisisolation can make stress evenharder to tolerate. When people are forced to live with a chronic medical illness, itcan lead to changes in self-esteemthat can be another factorcontributing to depression. In aworld focused on beauty, strength,health, vitality and power, changesthat you are experiencing in bodyimage, financial earning power andsocial roles can leave you feeling less worthy thanyou truly are. The way you view yourself, and howmuch you perceive your illness to limit you, cancontribute to depression. This is called self-illnessschema and has been shown to be a key contrib-utor to depression in patients with a chronicillness. Another cause of depression can be your illness itself. Metabolic changes and medication sideeffects are two ways your illness can contribute todepression. For this reason, it is always importantto check with your doctor when you areexperiencing depression. He or she can assess ifyour illness or the treatment itself could becontributing. If you have been on dialysis prior toreceiving a transplant, or have not felt well for anextended period of time, your depression may beharder to detect. Additionally, depression is more likely if one or both of your parents suffered from depression.Since society was not always as open about thedisease of depression as we are now, it is possibleyour parent did not openly discuss depression withyou. Your parent might have self-medicateddepression with so-called nerve pills or alcohol.Perhaps he or she simply withdrew for periods oftime. Your doctor or social worker can use adepression screening instrument to help assess therole, if any, depression plays in your life. If youthink you have a family history of depression, orhave had a history of depression yourself, youshould monitor yourself for depression more regularly. If you have determined that you may be depressed, you are notalone. Until the last few decades,depression has often beenmisunderstood. In the pastdepression was mistakenly seen asa weakness of character or apersonality problem. Today,depression is more clearlyunderstood as a medical disease.The Surgeon General 's Report on Mental Health (1999) broughthome the fact that depressionaffects a large part of thepopulation at some time in life.Occurring across all classes,cultures and ages, depression isaffecting the wellness and survival of the world. The World Health Organization haseven declared it a leading cause of death worldwide. There is some good news. Since we have brought depression \"out of the closet,\" treatment for thecondition has improved and is considered safe andeffective. There are many ways to managedepression today. For some, emotional and socialrehabilitation alone can help. Increasing yourcontact with others and planning enjoyableactivities on a regular basis can help improve yourmood. Returning to an active life can be animportant step to help relieve your depression. Ifyou can include physical activity in` your newfoundlife, it is even better. Physical activity has beenshown to help alleviate depression in some people.If you are new to activity, mall-walking programs,arthro-swim classes, no-impact classes for seniors Continued on next pageTransplant Chronicles, Vol. 9, No. 1 7and for the disabled, are gentle start-up activities that can help. Just make sure to check with yourdoctor before beginning any physical activity. For others, depression management training might be indicated as a form of treatment fordepression. The NKF is developing supportmaterials that can be used by your clinic socialworker in depression management programs. If aprogram is not available at your clinic, it is mostlikely widely available in your community. Ask yourtransplant center social worker to refer you to aclinical social worker or psychologist in thecommunity that specializes in the treatment ofdepression. Many in this field use an effectiveintervention called Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy(CBT). In six to 20 weeks, this type of therapy canbe effective, not only in lifting depression, but inpreventing it from returning. CBT focuses onretraining the way you think about yourself andsituations in your life in order to lift your mood andimprove your quality of life. Other types of therapy,such as Interpersonal Therapy have also beenfound to be very effective within the same amountof time. Interpersonal Therapy focuses on restoringyour social and problem-solving skills andproviding the support you need to adjust tostressful situations and life transitions (such asliving with medical illness). Medicare and otherinsurances usually cover treatment programs andservices to reduce depression. For many patients suffering from depression, especially if that depression is greatly interferingwith their day-to-day functioning, anti-depressantmedication is recommended. Your doctor candiscuss the benefits of medication in treating yourdepression. Because depression is often affected bythe neurotransmission of certain brain chemicals,medication that helps our own brain chemistrywork better can often lift depression. Anti-depressant medications are not addictive or habitforming. Many are considered safe and effective forpeople with a chronic medical illness. Check withyour doctor to learn which anti-depressants youcan safely use. If your depression has been causingyou to neglect your care, medication may beimportant for your recovery. According to research,medication and depression management trainingcan work very effectively together. Many medicalclinics and hospitals nationwide are combining thetwo forms of treatment for depression to achievethe best results for people with medical illnesses.Just because you have received a long awaited transplant doesn 't mean that your adjustment to living with chronic illness is over. There is still thepotential to become depressed. Your rehabilitationafter transplant is not just a physical process, butan emotional one as well. Defining new roles foryourself requires acquiring, or polishing up on,social and emotional skills. It probably meansrenewing existing relationships and entering newones. It is a journey that may take awhile andrequire the right type of support. Feelings of fearand inadequacy are common, especially during thefirst few years following a transplant. So don 't neglect the emotional aspects of adjusting totransplantation. Watch over yourself for depression(see signs and symptoms below) and seek thesupport you need to prevent depression. If you dobecome depressed, reach out to your doctor ortransplant clinic nurse or social worker to seek areferral for depression management training. Don 't delay. Studies show that the sooner you seektreatment and support for depression, the lesschance the depression will worsen. The more youcan prevent or manage depression, the lessdepression will affect your health and wellness.Lucky for all of us, depression is a very treatabledisease.

Factorssuch as mental and social well-being, issues relatedto the transplant process, coexisting medicalconditions and the many medications that trans-plant patients take can contribute to depression.Consequently, transplant physicians and psychi-atrists take a lot of things into consideration whenevaluating a transplant patient for depression andpotential drug treatment. It is important for you as a transplant patient to talk to your transplant team about the sideeffects and symptoms you are experiencing andprovide a list of any new drugs or herbalpreparations you have been taking. Symptomsof depression include, but are not limited to:difficulty concentrating, change in appetite,change in sleep habits, fatigue, difficulty performingdaily tasks, state of unhappiness and feelings ofworthlessness. Disclosing this information makes iteasier for your doctor to pinpoint the cause of yoursymptoms and proceed with proper treatment. Thismay be as simple as changing the dose of one ofyour medications or as complex as selecting andprescribing an antidepressant. Corticosteroids (methylprednisolone, prednisone, etc.) are used in high doses after a transplant and,in many cases, are continued throughout life.Corticosteroids can cause central nervous system(CNS) side effects ranging from irritability, euphoriaand difficulty sleeping to depression, extremechanges in mood and concentration. Depressionrelated to corticosteroid use appears to occur morefrequently in patients taking larger doses. Tacrolimus (Prograf) and cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune, Gengraf) CNS side effects. Tacrolimus and cyclosporinehave been reported to cause headaches, tremors,dizziness, agitation, seizures, hallucinations anddepression. Although these effects are seen in kidneytransplant patients, they have occurred with greaterfrequency in liver transplant recipients. In manycases, these side effects correlate with the dose ofcyclosporine or tacrolimus used and can bedecreased or eliminated with a reduction in dose.This emphasizes the importance of monitoring yourblood level with your transplant team.Although patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept) have reported CNS side effects, most ofthese transplant patients were also receivingcyclosporine or tacrolimus as part of their immuno-suppressive regimen. Most of the side effectsattributed to mycophenolate thegastrointestinal side effects includeheadache, tremors and insomnia. To date,depression has not been reported as a side effectdirectly attributed to the use of azathioprine(Imuran) mycophenolate mofetil, or sirolimus. To manage depression in transplant patients a doctor may try to reduce the dosage of the drug causing the problem. If the depression continues after a reduction in dosage, your transplant doctor may consider switching you to another immunosuppressant. Drug therapy with an antidepressant may be considered when the above options have failed. Antidepressants that havebeen reported to interact with cyclosporine andtacrolimus, include nefazodone (Serzone),fluvoxamine (Luvox), and St. John 's Wort. Nefazodone and fluvoxamine increase the levels ofboth cyclosporine and tacrolimus, whereas St.John 's Wort has the opposite effect. Antidepressants that have been used safely be slightly increased whenfluoxetine is being taken concurrently and should bemonitored. Herbal products, sometimes calledalternative medicine (see Transplant Chronicles , volume 8, number 2, page 19), that are marketed assupporting mental health or emotional well-beingshould be avoided. These products may interactnegatively with other medications and causepotential harm. As a transplant patient, you should be aware of the signs and symptoms of depression and expressyour concerns to your transplant team. Symptoms ofdepression can often be managed without drugtherapy. If you suspect you may have clinicaldepression, transplant centers have the personneland resources available to treat your condition andprovide follow-up care.

The record increase in living donors accounted for almost half of a modest 5.4 percent gain in organtransplants performed in 2000 \u201422,827 compared to 1999 's 21,655 transplants. The number of living donors rose from 4,747 in 1999 to 5,532 in 2000, while the number ofcadaveric donors increased by only 159, a modest2.7 percent \u2014from 5,825 in 1999 to 5,984. Eye banking data revealed a similar pattern. The EBAAreported there were 46,949 corneas transplanted in2000, compared to 45,765 in 1999, a 2.6 percentincrease. However, the number of corneal donors in2000 actually declined by 1.5 percent over 1999. MOST WHO VOLUNTEER TO DONATE KIDNEY TO UNKNOWN RECIPIENT END UP NOT DONATING,MINNESOTA STUDY FINDS With living organ donation enjoying a major resurgence in the past several years \u2014there was a 16.5 percent increase in the U.S. last year \u2014much attention is being focused on living non-directedkidney donation to help ease the shortage of organsfor transplantation. However, a new study out ofMinnesota yielded sobering data that fewindividuals who volunteer to donate a kidney to anunknown recipient ever become donors. Arthur Matas, MD, and colleagues at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis evaluatedthe outcomes of 118 individuals who expressed aninterest in donating a kidney. All of the inquirieswere unsolicited, consisted of about the samenumber of men and women, and averaged 51 yearsof age. All were sent information on the surgical procedure and the evaluation process was mailed to all individuals who contacted the program. The end result revealed that more than half did not contact the program again after receiving theinformation or discussing the procedure withtransplant center staff, 32 were evaluated anddenied, nine are still completing the evaluation, andseven have donated a kidney. The researchers saidmedical reasons accounted for 17 of the denials, 11were for psychological reasons and four for ethicalreasons \u2014one of the ethical reasons for denial was \"unreasonable demands\" including a request forpayment. KIDNEY TRANSPLANTS FARE BEST WHEN PERFORMED BEFORE DIALYSIS IS NEEDED Kidney allografts from living donors survive longer when transplanted before the recipient has starteddialysis, according to a study in the March 8thissue of the New England Journal of Medicine . Compared to patients who received transplants after being on dialysis, patients who had neverundergone dialysis experienced a 34 percentreduction in allograft failure during the first yearpost-transplant, a 44 percent reduction during thesecond year, and a 62 percent reduction thereafter,reported Kevin Mange, MD, and colleagues from theUniversity of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. In theirreview of data from the U.S. Renal Data System, theauthors also found the magnitude of benefit waseven greater after adjusting for the cause of kidneydisease, the racial relationship between donor andrecipient, and the presence or absence of delayedallograft function. Only the adjustment for acutegraft rejection slightly attenuated the effect oftransplanting before dialysis. Based on their findings, the researchers speculated that preemptive transplantation mightmodulate immune mechanisms that shortenallograft survival. \"As physicians, we need toidentify patients with kidney problems and referthem to nephrologists sooner than what is presently Transplant News Digest Living Donation Soars; Kidney Transplants Fare Best Before Dialysis; HHS Secretary Thompson Speaks Out By Jim Warren, editor and publisherFrom the editors of Transplant News Transplant Chronicles, Vol. 9, No. 1 9Continued on next pagehappening in the United States,\" said Mange. \"Approximately 25 percent of recipients of kidneysfrom living donors receive their organs prior todialysis initiation.

To qualify, centers must have performed ten transplants per year with a one-year actuarialsurvival rate of 65 percent. The transplant procedure will benefit only the small portion of the Medicare population withintestine failure who can no longer be treated withintravenous feeding tubes, a procedure called totalparenteral nutrition (TPN). These patients are oftennot able to tolerate long-term TPN because theprocess may cause liver failure, the patients ' veins become clotted, the lines to deliver the nutrientsbecome infected, or the process caused severedehydration. \"Although only a few people may benefit from this coverage, it reflects our commitment to providing allof the nearly 40 million Medicare beneficiaries withaccess to proven new treatments and technologies,\"Secretary Thompson said. Fewer than 1,000 intestinal transplants have been performed in the U.S., with approximately two-thirds of the patients being children. NOTE : Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) has changed its name to CMS, the Centersfor Medicare and Medicaid Services.INFORMAL COALITION OF TRANSPLANT \u2014 GROUPS SEND DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMANSERVICES SECRETARY TOMMY THOMPSON SOMEIDEAS TO EASE THE DONOR SHORTAGE Eight national transplant-related organizations have proposed that the federal governmentimplement a dozen initiatives designed to make iteasier and more attractive for Americans to donateorgans and tissues. The list, which includes proposals to offer subsidies and grant leave time to donors, was sentto Secretary of Health and Human Services TommyThompson. The informal coalition of organizations signing off on the proposals include: American Association forthe Study of Liver Diseases; American Associationof Tissue Banks; American Liver Foundation;American Society Association ofOrgan Organizations; JuvenileDiabetes Foundation, International;National Kidney Foundation, and TransplantRecipients International Organization. \"By developing consensus around a set of comprehensive proposals designed to increase therate of organ and tissue donation in this country,the signatories to this document have attempted toprovide timely input into an important initiative ofthe new Administration,\" the organizations said in amemo to the Secretary. The coalition recognized that each signee has \"different points at which they will no longer be ableto support the details\" of certain proposals.Nevertheless, it emphasized, \"a large portion of thetransplant community is strongly supportive [of theSecretary 's initiative] and stands ready to work with the Administration and Congress to implement themost comprehensive and effective strategy possibleto dramatically increase the rate of organ donation.\" Here is the list of \"provisions\" offered to the Secretary in no order of priority with some of theexplanatory information to support the provision. 1. Payment for Travel and Subsistence Expenses for Living Organ Donors \u2014This provision is contained in organ donation legislation (H.R. 624)recently passed by the House of Representatives 10 Transplant Chronicles, Vol. 9, No. 1Continued on next pageTransplant Chronicles, Vol. 9, No. 1 112. Leave Time for Living Organ Donation \u2014A legislative strategy would focus on amending theFamily Medical Leave Act to require employers tooffer this benefit to its employees, while a non-governmental strategy would involve the encourage-ment of large private employers to offer this benefitto their employees. 3. Organ Coordinators \u2014Legislation has been introduced that would provide federal grants tohospitals and organ procurement organizations tofund staff positions for organ coordinators whowould be responsible for coordinating organdonation and recovery in a hospital or group ofhospitals. 4. Regional Hearings Conducted by HHS/Follow- up Report to Congress \u2014A series of HHS-sponsored hearings would help generate input into the processfrom a grassroots level and provide opportunity fora national debate on some of the more controversialorgan donation proposals. 5. Honoring Consent \u2014Legislation proposal seeks to enact a federal law (or have HHS encouragestates to amend their Anatomical Gift Act law toprovide such binding legal effect) requiring that anorgan donor card or an indication of organ donorstatus on a driver 's license be given binding legal effect, regardless of familial objections. 6. Support Stronger Demonstration Project Authority for HHS \u2014Currently, HHS ' demonstration project authority does not allow it to fund grantsthat might involve use of financial incentives toincrease donation, because of the prohibition inTitle II of NOTA (National Organ Transplant Act)against the purchase of organs for transplant.Proposal would loosen these demonstration projectrestrictions while requiring outside entity toconduct 'ethics ' check on each proposal. 7. National Registry of Organ Donors \u2014There seems to be a broad consensus for developing aninformation clearinghouse where an organprocurement organization could determine almostinstantly, at any time of the day or night, theintentions of an individual to be an organ donor. 8. National Donor Outcomes Registry \u2014Create a registry to track outcomes of living organ donorsand recipients to create a rich database to helpresearchers and clinicians in maximizing thepotential for successful living organ donations andtransplantations. 9. Study Disparities in Organ Transplantation \u2014 Recent reports have cited significant disparities inthe racial diversity of people listed for kidneytransplants. Federal funding should be made available to study the reasons for these disparitiesin various parts of the country and identify possiblesolutions. 10. Tissue Donation \u2014FDA should accelerate finalization of its regulatory agenda, includingrequiring registration of tissue banks, enhanceddonor suitability screening and testing, and the use of good tissue practices, including informedconsent safeguards. 11. Organ Donor Awareness \u2014Increase activities, including urging President Bush to issue proclama-tion on importance of organ donation, encouragingcongressmen to speak out in favor of donation, etc. 12. Semi-postal stamps \u2014A semi-postal stamp to encourage organ donation would raise awarenessand, because it would cost more than a normalpostage stamp, would fund organ and tissue donorawareness. (Editor's note : A semi-postal stamp is like the cancer awareness stamp that has been available forseveral years. The additional cost above the goingfirst class postage rate is donated to the cause.) U.S. RESEARCHERS FIND STEM CELLS IN HUMAN FAT Researchers at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) and the University of Pittsburgh(PA) said they have isolated human stem cells in fatremoved from patients during routine liposuction. Since many Americans would be more than happy to donate their fat in the name of science, thisfinding suggests a plentiful \u2014perhaps unlimited \u2014 supply of stem cells for medical research. Anestimated 600,000 liposuction procedures areperformed each year in the United States. \"Fat is perhaps the ideal source [of stem cells], \" said Marc Hedrick, MD, a UCLA plastic surgeon.\"There's plenty of it, it's easy and inexpensive to obtain, and [its removal] even has a secondarycosmetic benefit. \" In the experiment detailed in the April issue of the journal Tissue Engineering , the scientists took the fat and fluid sucked from the hips, buttocks, andstomachs of patients during elective liposuctionsurgery, washed and purified it, and treated it withan enzyme to break down the matrix holding thecells together. They then compared the fat stemcells with the stem cells obtained from bone marrowsamples. According to Adam Katz, MD, a plasticsurgeon at the University of Pittsburgh, Continued on next page12 Transplant Chronicles, Vol. 9, No. 1approximately a half-pound of fatty material can yield 50 million to 100 million undifferentiatedstem-like cells. These cells appear to have thepotential to grow into bone, fat, cartilage, or muscletissue, and studies in animals are underway atUCLA to determine if this is the case. MOVE FROM WISCONSIN GOVERNOR TO HHS SECRETARY RESHAPES THOMPSON 'S VIEW OF TRANSPLANT SYSTEM 'S NEEDS Jim Warren, co-producer of Transplant Video Journal , sat down with Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson onApril 17, 2001, following the unveiling of hisinitiative for reducing the nation's organ and tissuedonor shortage. Here are excerpts from theinterview. TRANSPLANT NEWS/TRANSPLANT VIDEO JOURNAL: You have announced a series of initiatives to address the organ donor shortage. Willyou briefly explain what they are? SECRETARY THOMPSON: Well, basically, they 're very simple. But I am very passionate about makingsure that we make them work. We 're trying to build up a partnership between businesses - large, medium and small, and with labor unions, to try tomake sure that they allow for the work place to be aplace for employees to sign up to be organ donors,blood donors, tissue donors or bone marrowdonors. Second, we want to make sure that individuals sign a new national donor card, not that the onesthey've already signed aren 't good enough, we just want to replicate the act so that more people getinvolved. And we have two witnesses on there, sopeople will make sure that they talk to their lovedones. Third, we want to develop a national gift of life medal. I want to thank the donor families. We didthat in Wisconsin. It was one of the most movingdays of my life when I invited the donor families tocome into the capital and I was able to give them agift of life medal. They were so appreciative of thefact that somebody recognized them and wanted tosay thank you. Fourth, we want to have a national dialogue about whether or not we should have a national registry oforgan donors. I 'm going to ask HRSA (Health Resources and Services Administration) to hold amini-convention to discuss what direction weshould go and how we might accomplish that. The fifth came out of something I did in Wisconsin. A young girl named Kelly was killed in a freakaccident with her boyfriend right after her 16thbirthday and she had gotten her driver's license.She had signed her donor card on the back of thedriver's license and her family fulfilled her wishes.As a result, she was able to help two families inWisconsin, and a woman in Missouri. Kelly's familywanted to do something in her memory. So we setup a program that mandates every child, when theyreach their 16th birthday and before they get theirdriver 's license, to take a 30-minute program on organ donation. I'd like to replicate that in everystate in America. TN/TVJ: In the past, the government hasn't done a whole lot in terms of promoting living donation,and yet, the new statistics out this year show thatalmost half the increase in new donations camefrom living donors, what does your department planto do to support living donation? THOMPSON: I think that living donation is the way of the future. Living donation went up 16percent last year and cadaveric donations only wentup by three percent. So you can see the growth isliving organ transplants. This department is goingto encourage living donors. We're going to give outinformation that it is not harmful to your body. TN/TVJ: In the past, the government hasn't done a whole lot in terms of promoting living donation,and yet, the new statistics out this year show thatalmost half the increase in new donations camefrom living donors, what does your department planto do to support living donation?

TN/TVJ: What message do you have for the transplant community? THOMPSON: First - thank you for being such wonderful dedicated people doing the necessaryheavy lifting to solve our problems. Second, I wantto be your partner. I want to work with you in aunified way in which we can accomplish the mostgood for America. Third, I'm going to use my officewherever I possibly can to encourage people to signup as donors. Or at least to pique their curiosity,get them involved, to ask some more questionsabout donation and its importance. TCTransplant Chronicles, Vol. 9, No. 1 13We entered the patient floor and knocked on the locked patient room doors that first weekend ondaily rounds in our new Lied Transplant Center. Toour surprise, not one patient or family member wasavailable. We immediately knew that we hadentered into a new concept of providing in-patienthospital care. It 's called Cooperative Care and part of the goal of such a facility is to promote patientprivacy. We learned from that first experience thatour daily rounds had to be scheduled at the sametime every day, so patients and their families wereavailable to us when we arrived. The incident alsosupported another benefit of Cooperative Care. Itallows patients and their family members tobecome an important part of their own treatmentand recovery team. So what is Cooperative Care? It is a practice that allows patients andtheir care partners to participate inthe treatment and recovery process,supported by multidisciplinaryhealth care professionals, in a home-like environment. Care partners areusually family members or closefriends who stay with the patient,throughout the course of treatment. The Cooperative Care setting at the University of Nebraska Medical Center/NebraskaHealth System is part of the Lied TransplantCenter. The Cooperative Care accommodations looklike hotel suites. They consist of a bedroom, sittingroom, bathroom and kitchenette. Patients leave thetraditional hospital quickly to move to the LiedTransplant Center for the remainder of theirhospital stay. To qualify for Cooperative Care thepatient must meet in-patient hospital criteria, havea care partner and be strong enough to get up andgo to the bathroom with minimal assistance. The care partner provides needed support and encouragement to the patient and can accompanythe patient to tests or appointments, attendeducational sessions to learn about care and homeneeds (such as medication and diet), and learnadditional skills that are necessary to assure aconfident and comfortable return home (like taking blood pressures, weights, changing dressings andhanging intravenous medications).The Lied Transplant Center provides hotel-type amenities like soap and shampoo. The bathroomsare all handicapped equipped. Patients and careproviders have access to their own cafeteria, anexercise room, play rooms and a resource center.Families have free access to computers, faxmachines, video games, movies and educationalmaterials in the resource center. The first priority of Cooperative Care is to continue to provide high quality care in a morerelaxed, private and educational setting. Using thiskind of facility has resulted in high patientsatisfaction. Other centers using this concept alsoreport faster patient recovery times and fewer medication errors, falls and re-admissions. Lower costs may be anadded benefit of this innovative care. The Lied Transplant Center also has a 24-hour staffed emergency andtreatment center. Patients avoid thewaiting times associated with atraditional emergency room. Certainprocedures such as biopsies can beperformed in the treatment area thus avoiding an overnight stay andadditional in-patient hospital costs.The building has state-of-the-art research laboratories, bringing patient care,education and research under one roof. It also hasrooms to house outpatients who need to stay in thearea. Transplantation of all organ types continues to grow each year. We have seen the survival ratesimprove in all types of transplant patients as wecontinually look for new ways to provide the mostmodern medical care. Not only do we strive toprovide the most up-to-date medical, surgical andnursing care, we also look at new ways to providecare in different types of settings. Cooperative Careis just one of the newer concepts in providing amore personalized, in-patient hospital experiencefor transplant patients and their families. Withtime, we might be able to see even greater benefitsfrom caring for people in this unique setting. TCCooperative Care \u2014A New Approach in Caring for Transplant Patients and Their Families By Laurel Williams, RN, MSN A home away from home: One room at the Lied Transplant Center.14 Transplant Chronicles, Vol. 9, No. 1Early efforts of the transAction Council executive committee revolved around looking intoissues that affected many transplant recipients. Werecognized that the cost of or lack of immunosup-pressive medications, the side effects of thesedrugs, financial and insurance issues and theconstant threat of rejection or infection had a realhold on all of us who make up the transplantrecipient community. These are life-alteringconcerns. In many cases, resulting problems arehandled uniquely by each of our transplant centersand, by in large, these issues arebeing dealt with appropriately. Sowe asked ourselves the harderquestions \u2014the ones that those who have struggled with otherissues post transplant hadunderneath the surface. These werethe thoughts we would not mentionto our transplant teams for anynumber of reasons or hadmentioned and received less than asufficient answer. We all viewed our transplant professionals as lifesavers. Theygave us a second chance and wewalked out of the hospital feelingbetter than we had in a long time.However, transplants not only savedour lives, but also changed our liveshaving a unique impact on eachrecipient. We found it was notunusual for our transplant teams to send us on ourway, with little support, to cope with how this life-changing transplant would affect our lives at thepsychosocial level. In some cases, transplantprofessionals were able only to take the approach of\"we saved your life \u2014now move on.\" In talking to many recipients we found that many issues that have not been addressed effectively.Some of these issues include: Depression Post-traumatic stress and daily stress Relationships Sexuality Health care management issuesDisability Returning to work or not Physical activity and exercise Nutrition Access to health care of all types Having a voice and being our own advocates. These discussions revealed to us that a transplant recipient 's bill of rights might be a good tool to create and to discuss with the transplantprofessionals. However, if we were asking transplant professionals to honor our concernswe needed to balance that with ourresponsibilities as transplantrecipients. Those responsibilitiesinclude everything from adherence totransplant medical regimes, toreporting any signs or symptoms of aproblem to financial responsibilityand all things in between. It is the hope of the transAction Council executive committee that the\"Transplant Recipients ' Bill of Rights and Responsibilities \" will help and empower transplant recipients intheir quest for all the care they needand deserve. By recognizing thatmany issues come from this life-changing event we hope that it willfree you to ask the hard questionsand receive the answers you need.We encourage each of you to read this document and, better yet \u2014use it.

They asked if I wantedto come along and see a polygamist compound thathad been turned into a Transplant House. Afterhearing the many stories of the polygamists in thearea, I was curious to see a former polygamist 's house now housing transplant recipients. I decidedto join the group. We piled into a large van andtook off for the approximately 45-minute drive upthe mountains on the outskirts of Salt Lake City. By the time we arrived, it was dark. We entered the large gatesthat brought us onto five acres ofground with five existing homes.The largest of the homes is29,000 square feet! Overlookingthe edge of the property lies theCity of Salt Lake, which became amass of glittering lights at night. The facility, which has the potential to house between 60 and 80 people, is the home of CommonThread, a non-profit organization that providesorgan and bone marrow transplant patients andtheir families with a place to stay while theyundergo medical treatment in the Salt Lake Cityarea hospitals. In February of 1998 Jason Ivers, a heart transplant recipient, established Common Thread.Kally Heslop, also a heart transplant recipient,joined Jason in November of the same year. Kallyand Jason had met 10 years earlier in the hospital.They began a campaign seeking $750,000 indonations to build or purchase a facility to housetransplant recipients. Not long afterwards, Jim Morse, a real estate developer, happened to be watching a localtelevision broadcast about Common Thread. It wasCommon Thread 's lucky break. Mr. Morse became interested in the cause and two days later he wasshowing Jason and Kally the compound he and hisbusiness partners had recently bought frompolygamists who vacated the grounds. A leaseagreement was worked out and Common Threadmoved their offices into the complex. Since May of2000 over 25 families have stayed at the complex, paying a small fee, or in some cases none at all. The Common Thread facility will also be home to Team Utah, the team that competes in the U.S.Transplant Games. There is a pool, basketball,table tennis and volleyball on the grounds, withtennis courts soon to be added, as well as amplespace for team meetings. Kally is the teammanager, just one of the many hats that she wears. As our tour ended and we headed back to the city, we felt totally in awe tohave seen such a phenomenalhome away from home fortransplant recipients and theirfamilies. It will enable thepatients to continue their care,yet be able to relax and forgetthe clinical piece of the hospitalor clinic. I believe that it isplaces such as this that allow for the patients to recover faster as their minds areat ease.

TCeating right continued from page 416 Transplant Chronicles, Vol 9, No. 1medical beat When Eating Is Just Not Enough By Adela T. Casas-Melley, MD There is a group of children and adults who cannot get enough calories and vitamins from thefoods that they eat because of a disease of theirintestines. These patients have to get additionalcalories and vitamins in their veins from aformulation of electrolytes, amino acids and fatscalled hyperal. Hyperal can be given as either asupplement to intestinal nutrition or as a substitutefor it. Some of the complications from hyperal are: Infections from the line that is needed Clotting of the vessels from the line Liver failure. Why does this happen, and what can we do about it? Intestinal failure is a very complex problem that has many causes.The most common cause is shortbowel (intestine) syndrome(SBS). Short bowel syndromecan be the end process of manydiseases. Some children areborn with short bowel lengthbecause of problems during apregnancy; others are born withnormal bowel length but developSBS because of the need tosurgically remove a part of theirintestine that is diseased. When thishappens, the children cannot take inenough liquid and calories to supportthemselves. They then need to be started onhyperal to get enough calories and fluid to surviveand grow. Some children eventually adapt to thelength of their intestine and can begin to take foodby mouth and get weaned off the hyperal. These arethe lucky ones. Unfortunately, some children with SBS either do not have enough length of intestine left to adapt ortheir intestines are too sick to adapt. Thereforethese children cannot come off the hyperal. Thiswould be acceptable if the hyperal did not causeany side effects. Unfortunately, especially in smallchildren, hyperal can cause damage to the liver.After long-term hyperal, the liver can be damaged soseverely that the patient would need a liver trans-plant to survive. When this happens, transplantingthe liver alone would not be enough because there would still be the need for hyperal after the trans-plant, which would start the cycle of injury again.These children need a small bowel transplant. Small bowel transplantation offers hope to adults and children with intestinal failure and life-threatening complications of hyperal. Intestinaltransplantation is a relatively young field. The firstintestinal transplants were attempted in the 60 's, but it was not until the late 80 's that real success with intestinal transplantation was seen. Intestinaltransplants are not as successful as other types of organ transplants; however, results have dramatic-ally improved over the last few years with long-term organ and patient survival exceeding 50 percent. As of December 2000, 38 centers in the United States had active clinical intestinal transplant programs, although the majority of transplants are done at a handful of programs. The Intestinal Transplant Registry reports that a total of 474 intestinal transplants have been performed. Patients with intestinal failure who develop end-stage liver disease, have episodes of recurrent infections from central lines, or have clotted their veins and have no access for future central lines are candidates for intestinal transplantation.These patients should be referred for evaluation toan active intestinal transplant center. Many patientswill need concurrent liver transplantation, and theextent of their liver disease is what dictates thetiming of transplantation. The one-year patientsurvival rate after combined liver/small boweltransplant is 65 percent, compared with a one-yearsurvival rate of 30 percent for patients who did notundergo transplantation. For patients who arereferred to centers early and have not developedend-stage liver disease, an isolated intestinaltransplant can be done. The one-year patientsurvival rate for this procedure is 92 percent. It is alife-saving procedure. Continued on page 18The one-year patient survival rate after combined liver/small bowel transplant is 65 percent compared with a one-year survival rate of 30 percent for patients who did not undergo transplantation.Transplant Chronicles, Vol. 9, No. 1 17Several times a year, the National Kidney Foundation of fers an educational series, in the form of a full-day workshop, to aid patients in copingwith chronic illness. The workshops, for patients,family members and donor families, are given indifferent parts of the country. The foundation 's transAction Council's \"Taking Control of Your Life\"workshop in Orlando, Florida (also the site of the2002 U.S. Transplant Games) offered severalsessions aimed at awareness and other patientissues. Dr. Robert Metzer, from the Florida Hospital and Translife, hosted a session entitled \"Long Term Survival with Transplant. \" He explained the issues with an excellent slide show. Someof his slides dealt with different types ofskin cancers, which can occur post-transplant. Dr. Metzer also helped theattendants understand the chart thatrates the various complicationsstemming from immunosuppressivedrug therapy. Today, doctors arediscovering new viruses that affectpeople with transplants due to theirsuppressed immune systems. Someof the best advice Dr. Metzer gave thesession 's attendants was to use sunscreen daily, exercise, be compliant with medications and eathealthy foods. It will help you keep your transplantfor a long time. Obesity and heart disease areissues all Americans face; for transplant recipientsthe concerns are significantly increased. Dr. Metzerstrongly advised transplant recipients to get annualcancer screenings. \"Nutritious Cooking Tips with Chef O \" was another session featuring professional chef andtransplant athlete Oliver Hale (Chef O) along withPeggy Harum, RD, CSR, LD. The food that wasbeing cooked during the demonstration smelledwonderful, but session rules prevented any tastingor sampling. The point of the session was to showhow easy it is to cook delicious, healthy mealsusing basic ingredients like pesto sauce, basil,cranberry juice and \"Oliver \" oil. Chef O convincedthe attendants that anyone can become a chef.An after-lunch session discussed various resources and ways to become involved with the local ESRDNetwork 7 and the Florida Coalition on Donation,as well as national organizations like the NKFtransAction, Donor Family and Patient and FamilyCouncils. The three national membership groupsfor recipients of all organs, donor families andkidney patients are free. A donor mom, Mary Ann Carpenter, gave an interesting talk on her involvement with donorfamilies and transplant awareness and how it haschanged her life. Other donor families andrecipients shared their personal stories during a coffee house sharing, which began during the Transplant Games. One roundtable discussion was entitled \"Relationships After Transplantation. \" There was some discussion on transplant recipientstrying to be just like everyone elseand the difficulties they encounter inrelationships because they have atransplant or chronic illness. \"Movement For Mind, Body and Soul\" was a session about the benefits of massage. One host, John Hurdle, discussed the benefits ofmassage therapy and demonstrated with a shortmassage. Barbara Wallace, another host, discussedYoga and taught the attendants some simplemovements and breathing exercises. She closed bytaking the room on a guided relaxation meditation.The group was so relaxed that no one wanted toleave. At a general session about the Donor Quilt and its history, three donor families added their Patches ofLove to the Quilt. It was an emotional moment foreveryone in attendance. The event closed with acandlelight ceremony. Several inspirational tributes to donors and transplant recipients were read aloud.

TCTaking Control of Your Life By J. T. Rhodes (Nine-year kidney transplant recipient and a U.S. Transplant Games silver and bronze medal winner) 18 Transplant Chronicles, Vol. 9, No. 1Care after intestinal transplantation is very complex and it is not unusual to spend an extendedperiod of time in the hospital. There are severalareas that the transplant team are concentrating onfor post-operative care. (1) Rejection - this is the most likely complication after transplantation, and the most common cause ofgraft loss. For the first few weeks after transplan-tation, the patients will undergo endoscopy. This is aprocedure in which a special scope is placed into theintestine so that a doctor can examine and biopsyareas of the intestine that look suspicious for rejec-tion. If there is rejection, then the immunosup-pression medicines that prevent rejection need to beadjusted and occasionally new medicines are added. (2) Infection - Infection and sepsis are associated with high mortality after intestinal transplantation.Because of the intense immunosuppression neededin these patients to prevent rejection, they are morelikely to develop significant infections. Viralinfections with cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) are also common. CMV is the mostcommon viral infection after transplantation and canlead to infection of the graft itself. EBV is a majorconcern because of its association with PTLD. PTLDis a type of lymphoma that develops in patients after transplantation as a side effect of immunosup-pression. The number of patients that develop thiscomplication is low, but it is almost universally fatal. (3) Nutrition and Fluid balance - fluid balance can be difficult after transplantation because theintestine has to be trained to work normally again.This could take months and require severaladmissions to the hospital for intravenous fluid forthe first year after transplantation. The wholepurpose of undergoing the transplant is to be able totake all nutrition by mouth. The transplant teamwill work hard with the patient and family alongwith a nutritionist and feeding therapist to get thepatient to full nutrition by mouth and off hyperal assoon as possible after transplantation. This group of patients requires a lot of close supervision on the part of the medical team. Thereis much room left for improvement in theirtreatment; however, the success rate with transplan-tation is much better than the rate of survival ofthose patients not transplanted. Patients askedabout their quality of life after transplantation reporttheir lives are better after transplantation than whileat home on hyperal. We have a long way to go withintestinal transplantation to equal the success rateof liver and kidney transplantation, but thetreatment is presently saving lives and the successrate is improving with every case performed.

Akidney recipient, named Shirley, her six-year-olddaughter and her parents were thanking us forsaving her life. This reality became mine by virtueof a decision to donate the organs of our only child,Shawn, when he died from a cerebral hemorrhagein September of 1990. The first anniversary of Shawn 's death was marked with a second letter from Shirley. Every daywas a new beginning for her andshe and her family would neverforget Shawn 's gift or us. She enrolled in nursing school, as a wayto help others herself. She wantedto know more about my son, butshe understood if I could not talkabout him. I can 't imagine a mother not wanting to talk about her child!I got in touch with an OrganProcurement Organization (OPO) tofind out what I could write. Armedwith pen in hand I shared mymemories of my son. We continuedto exchange letters and ourfriendship grew. Serendipity played its hand revealing our identities to one another and we agreed to sharetelephone numbers. Meeting was still not an optionfor me, although I knew that Shirley embraced theidea. She could have easily arranged a meetinganytime, but she graciously respected my wishes. In 1996, I received a call from Shirley. She had four tickets and a special request. She announcedthat she and Shawn 's kidney were graduating from nursing school (they did everything together). Ilaughed reminding her that nursing would not havebeen Shawn 's first career choice. She asked if my husband, Bill and I could attend her graduationalong with her husband and daughter. She quicklyadded that my wishes of not meeting her would stillbe honored. She suggested we sit in the back of theroom to avoid a chance meeting. Screams of joycame when I informed Shirley that I did not want tosit in the back and that it was time for us to meet.The timing was perfect! We celebrated Shirley 's graduation and our first meeting with her and herfamily and friends.Our lives continued, but eventually Shirley became sick. She never referred to her transplantedkidney as her own, but always as \"Shawn 's kidney.\" It was pointless for me to argue otherwise. I haveno idea what it is like to reject a kidney, but Iwitnessed how emotional it was for Shirley to loseShawn 's kidney. She believed she had failed me and she expected our friendship to end when shereceived another kidney. I assured her that it wouldnot. I told her that I remained friends with peoplewhom I had meet through Shawn. When he died,they remained my friends. However, I did admit to Shirley that I understood ourfriendship was different and mostcertainly had a unique beginning. In October of 1998, I went to visit Shirley at her home for thefirst and last time. Shirley wasdying. I had come to say goodbyeto my friend and she told me \"notears\" were allowed. She thankedme for the time our gift gave herand I thanked her. She could not imagine what I thanked her for. Iplaced the first letter she eversent me in her hands and the tears quietly rolled down her cheek as I heard herwhisper, \"Wow, I am good.\" I agreed. I believe thereis no such thing as a bad \"Thank You\" letter. In eight years, I have said my final good-byes to my son, my father, my brother and my friendShirley. This goodbye was very different. Shirleywas someone who was actually planning onrunning through heaven to find Shawn and shesaid she would check on my dad, as well as herown. I was jealous of those who would see my sonbefore me. It was wonderful to know that I couldtell this to Shirley and she would understand whatI could not tell my father or brother. Shirley died that October, but today her legacy lives on with Shawn 's. In one of our first phone conversations she told me that she would havegiven her life for my son and meant it with everyfiber of motherly love. I miss picking up the phoneand hearing, \"Do you know who this is?\" as if allmy friends who called had a strong Tennesseeaccent like Shirley did.
