Please read my [disclosure page](https://gonewmommy.com/disclosure-policy/). Non toxic body lotion is becoming more popular these days as people become more conscious of the ingredients in their skincare products. Your skin is the largest organ in your body, and it deserves the best care possible. Unfortunately, many commercial body lotions contain harmful chemicals that can do more harm than good. But don't worry, there are plenty of non-toxic body lotions with natural ingredients that can keep your skin healthy and glowing without putting your health at risk. In this post, we'll explore why you should choose non-toxic body lotion, what harmful chemicals to avoid, what to look for when choosing a non-toxic body lotion, and some non-toxic body lotions available in the market. Why Choose Non Toxic Body Lotion? The skin absorbs up to 60% of what is applied to it, which means that any chemicals in your lotion can enter your body and potentially cause harm. Non-toxic body lotion is made with natural ingredients, which means it is free from harmful chemicals that can cause skin irritation and allergic reactions. They don't contain harmful chemicals like parabens, phthalates, synthetic fragrances, and mineral oils that can cause skin irritation, disrupt hormones, and even increase the risk of cancer. What Chemicals are Typically Harmful in Other Body Lotions? Some of the chemicals commonly found in some lotions include parabens, phthalates, synthetic fragrances, and synthetic colors. Parabens are used as preservatives in skincare products, but they can mimic estrogen in the body, leading to hormonal imbalances. Phthalates are also found in some skincare products and they are often used to make fragrances last longer in skincare products. They can interfere with the endocrine system, leading to reproductive problems. Synthetic fragrances and colors are made from petroleum-based chemicals and can cause skin irritation and allergic reactions. Some products use mineral oils which are petroleum by-products that can clog pores, cause acne, and prevent the skin from breathing. What to Look for When Choosing a Non Toxic Body Lotion? When buying a natural, non-toxic body lotion, here are some things to look for: Ingredients: When choosing a non-toxic body lotion, it's important to read the label and look for ingredients that are natural and safe for your skin. Look for products that contain natural, organic ingredients such as plant-based oils like coconut oil, jojoba oil, shea butter, and cocoa butter, and also plant extracts such as aloe vera, chamomile, green tea, and calendula. Avoid products that contain synthetic fragrances, preservatives, or petroleum-based ingredients. Certifications: Certifications can also be helpful. Check for certifications like USDA Organic, Ecocert, or COSMOS Organic, which guarantee that the product meets specific standards for organic and natural ingredients. EWG verified is also a useful verification that avoids harmful chemicals. Packaging: Choose products that come in environmentally friendly packaging, such as glass or recyclable plastic, to reduce your environmental impact. Brand Reputation: Look for brands that prioritize transparency and sustainability. Check reviews and ratings from other customers to see if the brand has a good reputation for producing high-quality natural and non-toxic products. Personal Preferences: Consider any personal preferences you may have, such as scent or texture, and choose a product that meets your individual needs. What Non Toxic Body Lotions are Available?
