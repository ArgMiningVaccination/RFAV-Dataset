She has been able to tackle problems that none of my western medicine doctors have been able to figure out on their own. Sleep, severe pain, anxiety, headaches and stress just to name a few. I always walk out of her office feeing refreshed and very calm. I'm so thankful for Dr. Melati's work as well as her very friendly and passionate personality. Mollie H. I look forward to my weekly treatments as a way to manage the stress in my busy life. Work/life balance has never been something I've been very good at maintaining. Acupuncture has made it so my sleep is better and I can let go of the stress easier at the end of the day. Nicholle P. Christina exudes as much talent as she does compassion. She is a great listener and I attribute the excellent cupping and acupuncture treatments to that. Kristen V I feel very fortunate to have Christina working with me. She is very caring and has extensive expertise. Her treatments always send me home doing way better- in less pain and more relaxed. I just want Christina to know how much I appreciate her work and care! Terri S. I had so much apprehension before my first session, and afterwards, I just felt so much better! It was basically painless, and afterwards, the pain in my back felt so much better! Scott B. I'm in awe - I've tried so many other therapies (including pharmaceuticals) to try and help my migraines and this is the ONLY thing that has worked. Thank you!! Hayley G. "}
