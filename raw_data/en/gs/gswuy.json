Unsolicited AEs includes both serious (SAEs) and non-serious unsolicited AEs. An SAE was any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose resulted in death, was life-threatening, required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, was a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or was an important medical event. All participants were observed for 30 minutes after vaccination, and any unsolicited systemic AEs occurred during that time were recorded as immediate unsolicited AEs in the CRB. - Number of Participants With Unsolicited Adverse Events After Any Vaccination [ Time Frame: Within 28 days after any vaccination ]An unsolicited AE was an observed AE that does not fulfill the conditions prelisted in the CRB in terms of diagnosis and/or onset window post-vaccination. Unsolicited AEs included both serious and non-serious unsolicited AEs. An SAE was any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose resulted in death, was life-threatening, required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, was a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or was an important medical event. Adverse reactions (ARs) were AEs related to vaccination. An injection site reaction was an AR at and around the injection site. Systemic AEs were all AEs that were not injection or administration site reactions. - Number of Participants With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) After Any Vaccination [ Time Frame: From Day 0 up to 6 months (i.e. 180 days) post last vaccination ]An SAE was any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose resulted in death, was life-threatening, required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, was a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or was an important medical event. An SAE which caused death of the participant was considered as fatal SAE. Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) were defined as SAEs which included new onset of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, encephalitis/myelitis (including myelitis), Number of Participants Achieving Seroconversion Against Antigens Following Vaccination With Either a High-Dose Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine or Standard-Dose Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine or Adjuvanted Trivalent Influenza Vaccine [ Time Frame: Day 28 post any vaccination ]Anti-influenza antibodies were measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) A/H1N1, A/H3N2, Seroconversion: defined as titer <10(1/dilution) at Day 0 and post-vaccination titer greater than or equal to (>=)40(1/dilution) at Day 28, or HAI titer >=10(1/dilution) at Day 0 and >=4-fold increase in HAI titer (1/dilution) at Day 28. Data for this Outcome Measure (OM) was planned to be collected and reported for dose level (QIV-HD 30g and 45g) matched separate groups for QIV-SD (Groups 4a, 4b and 4c), instead of pooled QIV-SD arm. Due to complex study design and analysis of doses and age groups, QIV-SD group participants, who matched to participants in QIV-HD 30g and 45g dose formulations groups (who were 9 through 17 years old and shared matching age group with QIV-SD control group), included in Groups 4a, 4b and 4c in this OM might be counted in more than once in QIV-SD arms for different dose levels, as applicable. - Geometric Mean Titers (GMTs) of Influenza Antibodies Following Vaccination With Either a High-Dose Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine or Standard-Dose Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine or Adjuvanted Trivalent Influenza Vaccine [ Time Frame: Day 28 post any vaccination ]GMTs of anti-influenza antibodies were measured using an HAI assay for 4 strains: A/H1N1, A/H3N2, B Victoria lineage, and B Yamagata lineage. Data for this OM was planned to be collected and reported for dose level (QIV-HD 30 g and QIV-HD 45 g) matched separate groups for QIV-SD (Groups 4a, 4b and 4c), instead of pooled QIV-SD arm. Due to the complex study design and analysis of the dose formulation and age groups in the study, QIV-SD group participants, who matched to participants in the QIV-HD 30 g and QIV-HD 45 g dose formulations groups (who were 9 through 17 years old and shared a matching age group with QIV-SD control group), included in Groups 4a, 4b and 4c in this OM might be counted in more than once in QIV-SD arms for different dose levels, as applicable. - Geometric Mean Titer Ratios (GMTRs) of Influenza Antibodies Following Vaccination With Either a High-Dose Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine or Standard-Dose Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine or Adjuvanted Trivalent Influenza Vaccine [ Time Frame: Day 0 (pre-vaccination), Day 28 (post any vaccination) ]GMTs of anti-influenza antibodies were measured using an HAI assay for 4 strains: A/H1N1, A/H3N2, B Victoria lineage, and B Yamagata lineage. GMTRs were calculated as the ratio of GMTs post-vaccination and pre-vaccination. - Number of Participants With Neutralization Antibody Titers >= 40 (1/Dilution) Following Vaccination With Either a High-Dose Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine or Standard-Dose Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine or Adjuvanted Trivalent Influenza Vaccine [ Time Frame: Day 28 post any vaccination ]GMT was measured for each influenza strain using HAI assay method for 4 strains: A/H1N1, A/H3N2, B/Victoria lineage, and B/Yamagata lineage. - Geometric Titers of Influenza Antibodies (Measured by Seroneutralization [SN] Assay) Following Vaccination With Either High-Dose Quadrivalent or Standard-Dose Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine or Adjuvanted Trivalent Influenza Vaccine [ Time Frame: Day 28 post any vaccination ]GMT was measured for each influenza strain using SN assay method for 4 strains: A/H1N1, A/H3N2, B/Victoria lineage, and B/Yamagata lineage. - Geometric Mean Titers Ratio of Influenza Antibodies (Measured by Seroneutralization Assay) Following Vaccination With Either High-Dose Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine or Standard-Dose Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine or Adjuvanted Trivalent Influenza Vaccine [ Time Frame: Day 0 (pre-vaccination), Day 28 (post any vaccination) ]GMTRs of anti-influenza antibodies were measured using SN assay A/H1N1, A/H3N2, B/Victoria lineage and B/Yamagata lineage. GMTRs were calculated as the ratio of GMTs post vaccination and pre-vaccination. - Number of Participants With Neutralization Antibody Titers Above Pre-Defined Thresholds [ Time Frame: Day 28 post any vaccination ]Neutralizing Antibody titer was measured for each influenza strain with SN assay method for 4 strains: - Number of Participants With Two-Fold and Four-Fold Increase in Neutralization Antibody Titer [ Time Frame: Day 28 post any vaccination ]Neutralizing Antibody titer was measured for each influenza strain with SN method for 4 strains: A/H1N1, A/H3N2, B/Victoria lineage, and B/Yamagata lineage. 2-fold and was defined as the computed value = post-vaccination computed value / pre-vaccination computed value. - Number of Participants With Solicited Injection Site Reactions [ Time Frame: Within 7 days after any vaccination ]A solicited reaction was an expected adverse reaction (sign or symptom) observed and reported under the conditions (nature and onset) prelisted (i.e., solicited) in the CRB and considered as related to the administered vaccination. Solicited injection site reactions included tenderness/pain, erythema, swelling, induration and bruising. - Number of Participants With Solicited Systemic Reactions After Any Vaccination [ Time Frame: Within 7 days after any vaccination ]A solicited reaction was an expected adverse reaction (sign or symptom) observed and reported under the conditions (nature and onset) prelisted (i.e., solicited) in the CRB and considered as related to the administered vaccination. Solicited systemic reactions included fever, vomiting, crying abnormal, drowsiness, appetite loss and irritability. Fever was planned to be evaluated for the whole population where as, the other events (vomiting, crying abnormal, drowsiness, appetite lost, and irritability) were planned to be evaluated only in the participants aged 6 months to <36 months. - Number of Participants With Solicited Systemic Reactions After Any Vaccination: Participants Aged >36 Months [ Time Frame: Within 7 days after any vaccination ]A solicited reaction was an expected adverse reaction (sign or symptom) observed and reported under the conditions (nature and onset) prelisted (i.e., solicited) in the CRB and considered as related to the administered vaccination. Solicited systemic reactions included: headache, malaise, myalgia and shivering. Choosing to participate in a study is an important personal decision.
