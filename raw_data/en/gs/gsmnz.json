The aims of the studies reported here were to investigate the contribution and importance of nutritional influences on the complex and multi-factorial problem of the post-weaning growth check in the piglet. Multi-disciplinary investigations focussed upon the relationship between post-weaning nutrition and the gut ecosystem with specific emphasis on gut physiology, immunity and microflora. The influence of dietary acid binding-capacity (ABC) on gut morphology characteristics was investigated in 20 newly-weaned piglets up to 14 days post- weaning. Piglets offered the low ABC diet displayed more rapid recovery of villus height (after a degree of villus atrophy) than control animals (P<0.001). Prior to the initial villus atrophy, villus height increased significantly throughout the experimental period for both dietary treatment groups (P<0.001; <0.001 (L); <0.001 (Q)). In control animals, villus width was greater (P=0.006) compared with treatment animals, and villus width increased over time for both groups (P<0.001; <0.001 0.014 (Q)). Crypt depth also increased temporally (P<0.001; <0.001 (L)) for both dietary groups, with treatment animals exhibiting the greatest overall dietary mean (P=0.009). No significant differences between ileal digesta p1I and feed intake levels were determined. Despite the improvements in intestinal structure post-weaning, these effects were not manifested in increased performance, i. e. DLWG. The improvements in intestinal structure may not have been of significant magnitude to influence performance parameters. Dictary zinc oxidc (ZnO) and avilamycin supplcmcntation was found to effect on gut morphology; villus atrophy occurrcd 4 days for control animals. No significant differences bctwccn intestinal colifonm and lactobacilli load were established with respect to dietary treatment. Any differences observed in microflora load arc most likely to be age-dependent. A positive relationship was established between dietary treatment (ZnO, I avilamycin and ZnO plus avilamycin) on daily livc might gain post-wcaning (P<0.001). Although not significant (P>0.05), a positive influence of dietary ZnO supplcmcntation on feed intake lcvcls was apparent, which may account, in part, for the enhanced growth performance. This finding was not however manifested through modifications of intestinal morphology or the lactobacilli and coliform populations studied. This further suggests that dietary ZnO may exert an effect either luminally or systemically. Further research is required to determine the mechanism responsible for the enhanced feed intake and DLWG response. The effects of feeding a yeast-based nuclcotidc source pre- and post-weaning revealed no significant differences with respect to villus height and width. Crypt depth was significantly greater in animals fed the treatment diet post-weaning (P<0.001). Post- weaning nucleotide-supplemented diets were found to significantly reduce intestinal coliform load (P=0.033). Such an effect was not evident in animals fed the diets pre- weaning, suggesting that the gut microflora may have adapted to the dietary regimen throughout the pre-weaning period. Lymphocyte blastogcnesis assays revealed that piglets fed a yeast-based nucleotide source post-weaning might be immunosuppressed at the time weaning. Conversely, when the same diets (in terms of composition) were fed from 14 days pre-weaning (study 4), no indication of immunosuppression was evident. Since no dietary effects were apparent in either study, it is postulated that this could be a general effect of the diet per se and not the actual dietary composition. It is however also possible that the animals involved in study 4 were experiencing hypersensitivity reactions to the prc-wcaning dietary antigens. These animals were also combating an E. coli infection. Additional studies arc however required to identify conclusively a cause and effect relationship, and elucidate the complicated interactions between nutrition or feed intake and immunobiology in the post- weaned piglet. Implementation of dietary nucleotide-supplementation from 7 days pre- weaning through to 25 days post-weaning within a commercial environment was found to enhance significantly DLWG (P<0.001). In summary, the current work extends current knowledge and offers a greater understanding of the factors and complex process that influence the gut ecosystem and physiology in the post-weaned piglet. This thesis confirms the crucial role feed intake or, more specifically luminal nutrition, in post-wcancd piglets and has highlighted key areas for future investigation. II PUBLICATIONS Pickard, J.

REVIEW 1.1 GENERAL INTRODUCTION Under natural conditions weaning is a gradual process, but in modem pig production it is now common practice to wean abruptly (Fowler, 1985) and both animal and microflora require rapid adjustment to a radically different diet. At weaning, the young piglet is subject to a myriad of abrupt and simultaneous changes such as mixing, moving to a new environment, separation from the sow (and possibly littermates) and most importantly, change in food type and form associated with a move from a liquid to solid diets (which may also result in reduced water intake and decreased digestive enzyme activities). This frequently results in perturbation of the gut ecosystem. Collectively these factors often contribute to the post-weaning 'growth check', which is characterised by low voluntary food intake, poor growth performance, suppressed immunity, expression of enteric diseases and in some cases mortality. Even mild growth checks at this stage may compromise the overall growing/finishing performance (in terms of daily live-weight gain and days to slaughter). The interactions between pre- and post-weaning nutrition (including level of feed intake), gut physiology, microllora and immunology together with their relevance to health, welfare and performance are fundamental to solving the problems associated with weaning. A major challenge for the pig industry is to formulate economically viable growth- promoting diets to case the transition from sow's milk to wcancr diets (Thacker, 1999). Presently it is not sufficient for such diets merely to satisfy the nutritional requirements of weaned pigs, but they must also modulate microbial succession, stabilise the balance of commensal microbiota, improve immune function and thus enhance disease resistance (Kelly and King, 2001a). Furthermore, although the importance of the commensal / resident bacteria for health and disease is well documented, relatively little is known of the interaction between the diet, the microllora, the host and the implications for health and disease (Bach Knudsen, 2001). Chapter 1 1.2 GASTRO-INTESTINAL SYSTEM IN TIIC PILE-WEANING PIG 1.2.1 Introduction The maintenance of body functions requires animals to obtain energy and nutrients from food in order to carry out several body processes. Food is broken down into small particles by physical and chemical means and these structural units enter the alimentary tract. The process of food degradation within the animal is digestion. Smaller chemical compounds cross the intestinal epithelium and enter the bloodstream, in a process termed absorption. Pigs are classified as omnivorous animals with a relatively long small intestine for digestion and absorption. The diet exerts a major influence on intestinal epithelial differentiation and growth and this is most pronounced at periods of dietary change such as birth and weaning. During neonatal life extensive changes in gut morphology, transiently elevated protein transcytosis, sustained increases in de novo protein synthesis and both age-related and diet induced changes in brush-border membrane digestive and transporter functions occur (Kelly and King, 2001a). Furthermore, the mucosal surface becomes colonised by successions of gut bacterial groups. 1.2.2 Morphological development 1.2.2.1 Digestive tract The digestive tract has a tubelike structure, extends from the mouth to the anus and is divided into several components: mouth, pharynx, oesophagus, stomach, small intestine and large intestine (Figure 1.1). In the buccal cavity food is ground slightly, into small particles (assisted by the action of the teeth and tongue) to increase the surface area that aids chemical and microbiological degradation. Salivary secretions comprise primarily of water (0.99 as a proportion), with the remainder consisting of mucin, inorganic salts and some a-amylase capable of digesting starch. These provide lubrication and, due to the watery nature, facilitate mastication and deglutition. However, it is important to emphasise that mastication in the pig is not of major significance. Corring (1980) reported that in 45 kg pigs, an increase in the feed intake of a cereal-based diet resulted in both enhanced saliva volume secreted and total amylase output. Furthermore, when the same diets were fed wet, the saliva volume decreased while a-amylase output remained constant. 2 Chuptcr I The pharynx is the common pathway for both food and air, whereas the ocsophagus is the muscular tube that extends to the stomach, receives food for storage and is the site of digestion initiation (other than initial amylolysis through salivary amylase). The stomach is subdivided into four parts, which are continuous from one another, although they function separately: oesophageal, oesophageal region is the area around the cardiac region containing no glands and having the same epithelium as the oesophagus. All of the remaining three regions secrete mucus from their associated glands. In addition to mucus, which is usually secreted throughout the digestive tract, the stomach secretes hydrochloric acid (IICI) and pcpsinogen (gastric glands), whereas the hormone gastrin is produced in the pyloric glands. Gastrin is synthesised in response to the amount of protein present in the stomach, and stimulates the secretion of additional IICI. Pcpsinogen and IICI arc secreted into the lumen of the stomach where they initiate protein digestion, and gastrin is secreted into the blood. Pepsinogcn is a precursor of pepsin, a proteolytic enzyme with autocatalytic properties, and conversion occurs in the lumen under the influence of IICI, and begins at about pH 5. Optimal pepsin activity occurs at p1i 1.8 to 3.5 and initiates gastric digestion by degrading protein to peptides. 3 Gtaplrr i Figure 1.1: Gastro-intestinal 1.2.2.2 Anatomy and function of the small intestine The intestinal tract provides a complex interface between the animal and its environment and has two main functions: the absorption of nutrients, enabled by a singlc\"laycrcd epithelium, and the barrier mechanism against microbial and nutritional antigens by cells of the immune system (Kelly and King, 2001a). The small intestine is divided into three components based on anatomical, histological and functional characteristics: duodenum, jejunum and ilcum, and can be up to 20 m in length and account for one third of the total volume capacity of the whole Gil (Moran, 1982). Stomach contents enter the duodenum, which is closely associated with the pancreas. Secretions such as pancreatic juice and enzymes enter through the pancreatic 4 Chaptcr 1 duct, and are mixed with chyme, and bile that is formed in the liver and enters through the common bile duct. The movements of the small intestine facilitate mixing of the aforementioned enzymes and secretions. This also allows luminal digestion of carbohydrates, fats and proteins to occur, whilst maximising the exposure of the digested nutrient surface to the mucosa of the small intestine. Small intestinal activity can be either increased or decreased via the action of parasympathetic or sympathetic stimulation respectively. 1.2.2.3 Secretions of the small intestine The intestinal juice is derived from glands located in the crypts of Lieberk\u00fckn called Brunner's or duodenal glands. These glands are stimulated by the presence of food within the small intestine to produce mucus. In addition to water, salt and mucus, intestinal cells also produce a number of enzymes and hormones. For example, when the stomach contents enter the intestine, the hormones secretin and cholecystokinin (CCK) are secreted by the Secrctin inhibits, whilst CCK stimulates, small intestinal motility. Both are secreted into the blood and are carried to the stomach where they reduce the motility of the stomach and inhibit the release of gastrin and HCI. Secretin release is stimulated by acid perfusion of the duodenum and causes the pancreas to secrete NaHHCO3. The hormone CCK is secreted in response to the presence of protein and fat in the duodenum, and causes the pancreas to secrete both enzymes and pro-enzymes. 5 Chapter 1 Accessory gland developing from gut (e. g., pancreas) . longitudinal layer externa Figure 1.2: Diagrammatic representation of the wall structure of the digestive tract seen in the small and large intestine (after Cormack, 1987). 1.2.2.4 Structure of the small intestine The small intestine possesses the same structure in all three sections (duodenum, jejunum and ileum) and consists of four principal components: scrosa, muscle layer, connective tissue layer and submucosa (Figure 1.2). The scrosa covers the intestine and is continuous with the mesentery, the muscle layer is comprised of two sub-layers (circular smooth and longitudinal smooth muscle), the submucosa consists of connective tissue innervated with blood vessels, lymph vessels and nerve fibres and finally the mucosa which is an inert layer full of epithelial cells. The epithelial surface area is significantly increased by the mucosa, with the villi, (covered with columnar cells referred to as cntcrocytcs), and microvilli increasing the surface area ten-fold and thirty- to sixty-fold respectively (Caspary, 1987; Smith, 1992) thus rendering small intestinal digestion and / more efficient. Furthermore, numerous circular or spiral folds of the submucosa of the gut increase the small intestinal surface area by a factor of 3 (Caspary, 1987). Buddle and Bolton (1992) stated that the small intestine of a3 kg piglet at 10 days of age has a total absorptive area of 114 m2. Between the viii!, smaller tubular depressions are found, called crypts of Lieberkiikn (Figure 1.3), which secrete enterokinase, (which activates trypsinogen), and a limited amount of amylase. Intestinal epithelium cells are renewed through the process of mitosis from the crypt cells.

(1992) and Cranwcll (1995). Intestinal epithelium functionality is determined by the level of maturity and state of differentiation of the cnterocytes in addition to the number of functional cells present on the intestinal mucosa (Kelly et al., 1992). 1.2.3 Effect of maternal factors on intestinal structure and function The changing dietary input during ontogcny (e. g. amniotic fluid, maternal milk, weaning, post-weaning diet) imposes different demands on the intestine and influences its morphology, enzyme equipment and transport (\u00dfuddington, 1994). Colostrum and milk feeding have been shown to promote the maturation and growth of the developing intestinal epithelium (Kelly et al., 1991a; Burrin et al., 1992; Kelly et al., 1993; Wang and Xu, 1996) and is supported by a high rate of protein synthesis (Burrin et al., 1992). The ingestion of colostrum stimulates crypt cell proliferation (Zhang et al., 1997). The non-nutritive colostral factors that elicit proliferation and maturation of the gut include both immunoglobulins and biologically active substances, including insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) (Xu, 1996; Zhang et al., 1998). Similarly, maternal milk and colostrums (Grosvenor et al., 1993; Odle et al., 1996) or amniotic fluid contain many biologically active substances (Weaver et al., 1988) that stimulate both intestinal growth and development (Xu, 1996), and this stimulatory effect can also be detected in various intestinal cell lines (Cora et al., 1987; Ichiba et al., 1992). It can therefore be postulated that some macronutrients (such as hormones and growth factors) play an important role in the growth and development of neonates (Pasha, 2000). Specifically, in the pig, colostrums accelerate cnterocytc proliferation and maturation of the intestine (Jaeger et al., 1987; Koldovsky et a!., 1992), increase transport of electrolytes and nutrients (Bird et al. 1994), stimulate secretion of glucoregulatory hormones (Lepine et a!., 1989; Burrin et a!., 1992) and influence later development of the intestine (Kelly et a!., 1993). It is thought that these influences arc mediated by the high concentrations of growth factors present in colostrum. However, nutrients in colostrums may also be influential, either directly or indirectly by stimulating secretions (Zhang et al., 1997). Furthermore, variations in milk composition during lactation arc associated with alterations in the synthesis and intracellular processing of brush-border hydrolases and increased transport of nutrients and electrolytes in the suckled animal (Kelly and King, 2001a). 8 Chapter I The transfer of macromolecules across the intestinal wall represents an important transport mode that facilitates the uptake of a number of protein molecules such as immunoglobulins, growth factors, and many antigens including microorganisms (Dacha, 2000). The specific transport of macromolecules is generally achieved by binding of luminal factors to specific receptors that shuttle them across the intestinal mucosa without intracellular hydrolysis (Dacha, 2000). This macromolecular uptake and several colostral components, including immunoglobulins and trophic factors may be rapidly absorbed through the epithelium and transported into the circulation (Gaskins, 1998). The transport of macromolecules is particularly important physiologically during the postnatal period, as it facilitates the absorption of growth factors and immunoglobulin (Ig) G from maternal colostrums and milk (Pacha, 2000). Immunoglobulins comprise the majority of the total protein fraction of colostrums, with milk-specific proteins such as casein, 3-lactoglobulin and a-lactalbumin constituting the remainder. The levels of these maternally derived antibodies (immunoglobulins) arc highest at day 1 post-farrowing and then decline to very low levels by the time the pig reaches 3 weeks of age. This is crucial for piglets and other ungulates such as calves that are born almost agammaglobulincmic but are capable of transferring intact immunoglobulins from ingested colostrums to the circulation during the initial postnatal period (Westrom et a!., 1984). In pigs, transport and macromolecular uptake declines rapidly within the first postnatal days (often referred to as `gut closure') and although not fully understood, depends on factors such as epithelial maturation or increased intraluminal proteolysis (Tclemo et al., 1987; Martin et al., 1993; 1997). Furthermore, Sangild et al. (1999) provided evidence that factors responsible for mediating closure are present in the whey fraction of colostrum. Ekstrom and Westrom, (1991) stated that intestinal closure is thought to result from a decreased transfer of the intestinal macromolecules into the blood. Additionally, several authors (for example, Lcece et al., 1962; Lecce, 1973) have also reported that the ability of the gut to absorb macromolecules, in the case of immunoglobulins, is decreased as the total food intake increases. Moreover, since administration of immunoglobulin-frcc food can totally remove the ability of the gut to absorb immunoglobulins, the trigger for `gut-closure' to immunoglobulins is not dependent on the quantity of ingested food (Lccce, 1973). Once gut closure has occurred, the animals must then rely for 1-2 weeks on the persistence of circulating passively acquired immunoglobulins (Kelly, 1994). 9 Chanter I Rapid increases in intestinal dimensions occur during the early postnatal period, particularly the first 6h of suckling (Zhang et al., 1997). Compared with unsucklcd newborns, the intestines of pigs 24 h old were 29% longer and 86% heavier, with 130% more mucosa (Buddington et at., 2001). Adult-type cntcrocytcs replace the fetal-like cells over the initial 2 weeks of life, and exhibit much lower endocytic activity (Smith and Jarvis, 1977; Smith and Peacock, 1980). The cell replacement proceeds in a proximal- distal direction along the intestine, being complete in the proximal section by the time the pig is 6 days of age (Ekstrom and Wcstrom, 1991). Distally there is still uptake of macromolecules, which terminates by the time the pigs are 4-8 weeks of age and is concomitant with the complete replacement of the fetal-type cells. 1.2.4 Microbial colonisation of the GIT 1.2.4.1 Introduction The gut is a dynamic ecosystem of major complexity, and gastrointestinal health can be defined as the ability to maintain a balance within this system (Mclin et al., 2001). Furthermore, it is important to note that the health of the gut has a direct bearing on the growth and productivity of livestock animals, since the gut comprises the body's largest organ and its activity represents a considerable proportion of the animal's protein and energy requirements (Edmunds et al., 1980; Muramatsu et al., 1987). Dietary components and the gut microflora interact to exhibit a significant impact on the growth, development and intrinsic differentiation of the digestive tract in neonatal pigs. Extensive nutrient-gene interactions underpin the successful adaptation of neonates to non-liquid, lower fat, higher carbohydrate weaner diets (Kelly and King, 2001a). These changes in gene expression and the processing of gene products are entrained through diet-induced events that begin very early in postnatal life (Kelly and King, 2001a). Furthermore, Kelly and King (2001a) reasoned that due to the vast ecological diversity of the microflora, it is logical to assume that there is intimate contact and interaction between gut bacteria with subsequent homeostatic effects. The influences of the gastrointestinal microflora include: a) the growth and development of the host, b) nutritional requirements, c) morphogencsis of the GIT, d) modification (by metabolic activity) of endogenous and exogenous substances introduced into the gastrointestinal lumen and c) possession of an active role in preventing foreign microorganisms from becoming established (Visek, 1978). 10 Chapter I Colonising microorganisms (both benign and pathogenic) induce varied host responses extensively influencing digestive physiology and gut development. Microbial colonisation stimulates the intestinal immune system producing a constitutive, low-level inflammation and epithelial changes that can have both negative and positive effects on nutrient and energy absorption in the young (Gaskins, 1997; Anderson et al., 2000). Mostly non-pathogenic, anaerobic microorganisms from maternal and environmental origins continually colonise the intestinal tract and other mucous membranes (Fincgold et al., 1983; Conway, 1997). Generally, the dynamic balance between host physiology, diet and the gastrointestinal microbiota (involving synergic and antagonistic interactions) (Linton and Hinton, 1990) leads to the establishment of a stable microbial ecology, and the resultant bacterial population is commonly referred to as the natural, indigenous, resident, normal or commensal microflora that exert a positive influence in maintaining and establishing a healthy gut immune system (Kelly and King, 2001 a). It has been estimated that several hundred microbial species inhabit the mammalian GIT within the first few days of life (Kenworthy and Crabb, 1963; Finegold et at., 1983; Drasar and Barrow, 1985), that almost 99% of them are obligate anaerobes (Drasar and Hill, 1974). In pigs, concentrations of up to 109 and 1011 bacteria /g occur in the small intestine and colon/caecum, respectively (Smith and Jones, 1963; Leece, 1973) and much smaller numbers of microorganisms are present in the stomach. The pattern of colonisation is similar for most animals, with lactic acid bacteria, entcrobacteria and streptococcci appearing first, followed by obligate ancrobes (Conway, 1997). Facultatively anaerobic strains such as Escherichia coli and streptococci initially exist in highest numbers (Rotimi and Duerden, 1981; Stark and Lee, 1982). These bacteria may subsequently create a highly reduced environment that allows the growth of strictly anaerobic species. A preferred microbiota is that in which the so-called beneficial strains predominate over the potentially pathogenic species. Generally, those species classified as beneficial are bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, which possess various health promoting properties such as production of SCFA (which acidify gut contents), immuno-potentiation and inhibitory effects on the growth of harmful bacteria (Gibson and Robcrfroid, 1995). The bacterial population in the porcine GIT (viable counts /g fresh material) increases from 107-109 in the stomach to 109 in the distal small intestine, and further to 1010- 1011 in the colon, and with increasing proximal to distal abundance of obligate anacrobcs (Bach 11 Chapter I Knudsen et al., 1993; Jensen and Jorgensen, 1994). The majority of the culturablc bacteria in the colon are Gram-positive about 10% of the total culturable flora (Bach Knudsen, 2001). Dietary composition exerts a huge impact on the population, composition and activity of the commensal microflora. In addition to this horizontal variation in bacterial composition, there is also a vertical gradient of species distribution (Kelly et al., 1994). The mucosal environment differs both physically and chemically from the environment within the lumen. Additionally, the bacteria associated with the mucosa are likely to have a greater potential to influence the host than those present in the lumen (Kelly et al., 1994). Once established, this normal gut flora is believed to play an important role in the health of the host by competitively inhibiting colonisation by pathogenic forms by `microbial interference or exclusion' (Tannock, 1988; Schocni and Wong, 1994). Several microhabitats exist within the intestines that exert a selective influence on the local composition and metabolic activity of the microflora. These microniches are found in the proximal and distal intestine and are associated with the villus surface, crypts, cpithclial- associated mucins and luminal mucus (Kelly and King, 2001a). Variables that contribute to the regional compositional diversity include immune reactivity, the presence of gut receptors, nutrient availability and composition, the flow of digcsta, p11 and Eh (oxidation/reduction potential) and available molecular oxygen (Stewart et al., 1993). Furthermore, the normal microbiota in a single community may also differ from that of another of the same species due to differences in diet, husbandry or climatic conditions. The bacterial composition of the intestine of mammalian species has been reviewed by a number of authors, for example, Moughan et al. (1992) and Maxwell and Stewart (1994). For growth, bacteria require energy sources and nutrients, derived either exogcnously from the host diet or endogenously from sloughed-off epithelial cells, and cell secretions from the mucous blanket that coats much of the inner surface of the gut (Stewart et al., 1993). Competition for available substrates and adhesion sites, on both food particles and gut mucosa, are major factors determining the composition of the intestinal microbial population. Carbohydrates and proteins are degraded by the microbiota via fermentation and the end products provide a source of energy for the host. It is important to maintain homeostasis within the gut ecosystem, as invasion by non-commensal or pathogenic flora 12 Chapter I can result in diarrhoea (by damaging the gut wall) (Gibson and Wang, 1994). As such, the host has evolved defence mechanisms to prevent the establishment of such microbes. These include gastric acidity, rapid peristaltic movements and physical barriers such as mucin production. However, some gut species such as bactcroidcs, bifidobacteria, ruminococci are able to utilise mucin as a source of carbon and energy therefore reducing its protective effects (Gibson and Wang, 1994). As such a dynamic balance exists between mucin secretion by the host and its utilisation by the microbiota. A further defence mechanism is the normal indigenous flora itself, which may prevent enteric colonisation by opportunistic pathogens. This may be a consequence of competitive exclusion of pathogens by the indigenous flora. Alternatively, the indigenous flora may synthesize molecules that non-specifically stimulate the immune system or chemically interfere with the interaction between pathogens and intestinal epithelia (Kelly et al., 1994). Studies comparing germ-free (GF) and conventional (CONV) rodents suggest that normal gut flora also stimulates, or plays a regulatory role, in the development of the immune system (Thorbecke, 1959; Berg, 1983). For example, MacDonald and Carter (1979) and Woolverton et al. (1992) showed that the poor cell-mediated responses of GF mice could be restored by bacterial colonisation. 1.2.4.2 Bifidobacteria; beneficial effects on host health Bifidobacterium is a major group of saccharolytic bacteria in the colon, and constitutes up to 25% of the total population in the gut of adult and 95% in newborn humans (Kawase, 1982). Bifidobacteria have been shown to exert a number of beneficial effects on the host, which arc summarised in Figure 1.4 13 Chapter Reduce blood ammonia levels Lower blood Restore the normal cholesterol intestinal flora during levels antibiotic therapy BIFIDOBACTERIA Inhibit the growth of pathogens, for example by producing acetate & lactate Act as immunomodulators, for example promote attack against malignant cells Produce vitamins, for example B group, folic acid Figure 1.4: Properties of bifidobactcria that arc thought to be bcncficial to host health (adapted from Gibson and Robcrfroid, 1995). 1. Bifidobactcria produce metabolic end products (acetate, lactate), which arc strong acids that reduce the pit of the surrounding medium. This may therefore exert an antibacterial effect by inhibiting acid intolerant bacteria (Kaivase, 1982; Rasic, 1983). 2. This acid production results in the protonation of ammonia and amines which arc potentially toxic, to produce N114 which is non-diffusablc and therefore reduces blood ammonia levels (1(ansen, 1985). Furthermore bifidobactcria do not form principally B (Nishizawa, 1960; Licschcr, 1961) as cited by Gibson and Robcrfroid (1995), in addition to digestive enzymes c. g. Channrr I phosphatasc and lysozymc (Mingawa, 1970; Kawasc, 4. Specific cellular components of bifidobactcria act as immunomodulators and these bacteria have successfully restored normal intestinal flora during antibiotic therapy (Korshunov rt a!., 1985 as cited Gibson and Roberfroid, 1995). Although the gut can tolerate and indeed benefit from a threshold level of indigenous adhering bacteria (Fuller, 1992) it would be wrong to assume that the indigenous flora is always benign. Under conditions of nutritional or other physiological stress the indigenous population may exceed a safe threshold and constitute a pathological burden (King et al., 1993; Spitz et al., 1994). Malnutrition and long term parenteral nutrition have been shown to alter intestinal morphology, impair immune function and induce bacterial overgrowth. In the extreme, these changes have been implicated in the pathophysiology of translocation of bacteria leading to sepsis (Langkamp-Henken 1992; Deitch, 1994; Silk and et al., 1994). Surface proteins (invasins, internalins) implicated in the process of cellular invasion and bacterial translocation arc expressed by several enteric bacteria including Shigella, Yersinia and Salmonella (Wick et al., 1991). Furthermore, it has recently been demonstrated that ETEC which normally colonise the mucosal surface possess specialised features which facilitate cellular invasion (Elsinghorst and Kopccko, 1992). It has been suggested that under conditions of environmental stress such invasive gene products are expressed in a wide variety of normally non-invasive organisms. An important research goal of the future is to elucidate the mechanisms by which both adherent and non-adherent bacteria become invasive (Boedeker, 1994). The invasion processes are complex and involve the interaction of bacteria and extraccilular matrix components and cytoskeletal elements and plagiarisation of normal signal transduction mechanisms of the intestinal epithelium (Wick ct al., 1991). Dietary management is important for the prevention of colonisation of the gut by enteropathogens but also has a protective role in prevention of transepithelial translocation of bacteria. 1.2.5 Digestive enzyme activities At weaning (3-5 weeks of age), the digestive system of the piglet is extremely immature and under-developed. Dietary carbohydrates undergo the process of enzymatic breakdown by intestinal disaccharidasc activity and arc an important component of the overall digestive process in young piglets. It has been suggested that in early-weaned 15 Chanter I pigs, low feed consumption, growth check and diarrhoea in the immediate post-weaning period are related to the limited capacity of the gastrointestinal tract to digest and effectively utilise weaner diets (Hampson and Kidder, 1984; Hampson, 1994). Marked alterations in the intestinal mucosa have also been reported to reduce the ability of villi to transport amino acids (Smith, 1984), but food intake tends to be positively correlated with enzymic activity (McCracken and Kelly, 1984). Peak carbohydrase activity is known to occur between the first 0.2 and 0.3 (as a proportion) of the small intestine (Manners, and Stevens, 1972; Kelly et al., 1991a). Lactase activity normally declines with age, and weaning has been reported to influence this. Lactase is present at birth in large amounts and its activity reaches its maximum during the first week of life (Aumaitre and Corring, 1978). Furthermore, Miller et al. (1986) reported a significant decrease in lactase activity in the intestine 5 days after weaning. In a more recent study, Kelly et al. (1990) reported that weaned pigs which had received creep feed pre-weaning tended to have higher lactase activity during the immediate post-weaning period compared to those which received no creep feed, however this effect was not significant (80.2 compared to 67.2 gmol min /g protein for creep and non-creep fed respectively). When uncooked cereals (320 g/ kg) were given to weaned pigs lactase activity was slightly decreased (9.4 vs. 11.4 gmol min /g mucosa) in comparison to those fed a dried skim milk diet (McCracken and Kelly, 1984). Aumaitre and Corring (1978) were unable to detect any sucrase activity at birth, or during the first week of life but it increased gradually with age; sucrase activity in the duodenum was recorded at only 6 weeks of age while it appeared in the jejunum and ilcum after the first week. Although the provision of creep feed pre-weaning had no effect on the development of sucrase activity (Kelly et al., 1990), it was reported to be approximately 50% higher in the high creep feed groups than zero and no creep feed in unweaned piglets. Maltase, which is also found in the pancreatic juice, hydrolyses each maltose molecule into two glucose molecules. Activity of maltase is low at birth and increases gradually with age. Aumaitre and Coning (1978) reported that maltase activity increased up to the eighth week of life several fold (x 143). Furthermore, maltase 11 activity has been reported to be significantly higher during the post-weaning period for pigs fed uncooked cereal based diets (McCracken and Kelly, 1984). This is supported by findings of Miller et al. (1986) who weaned pigs at 6 weeks of age. Kelly et al. (1990) stated that creep 16 Charter 1 feeding of piglets prior to weaning was not associated with the post-wcaning increase in the activity of maltase enzymes. Kelly et a!. (1991a) later reported that total activity steadily increased during the post-weaning period and after 7 days was twice that found 3 days after weaning. Furthermore, in a study conducted by Kelly et a!. (1991b) where gastric intubation was employed to compare continuous and restricted nutrient supply on the digestive development of pigs weaned at 14 days of age, during the first 5 days post- weaning, it was also demonstrated that total maltase activity was significantly higher for the continuously fed pigs. 1.2.6 Enzyme secretion of the pancreas The pancreas is located near the first part of the duodenum and possesses both endocrine (produces hormones) and exocrine functions (produces sodium bicarbonate (NalICO3) and digestive enzymes). The pancreatic duct enters the initial part of the duodenum close to the common bile duct. The endocrine components of the pancreas (islets of Langerhans) are isolated groups of cells scattered throughout the connective tissue of the gland. The alpha (a) cells produce glucagons, the beta ((i) cells produce insulin and the delta (6) cells somatostatin. Glucagon and insulin pass directly to the blood, while somatostatin inhibits the release of insulin and glucagons from the pancreas and inhibits the release of growth hormone, thyrotropin and corticotropin from the adcnohypophysis. Only the exocrine secretions (NaUCO3 and digestive enzymes or their precursors) of the pancreas are involved in the digestive process. The secretion of NaIICO3 functions to neutralise or raise the pH of the acid component (LICI) of the chyme received from the stomach which then enters the duodenum. A further role is the neutralisation of the acids produced from the fermentation process in the large intestine, so that the degradation products can be absorbed. The pancreas secretes all the enzymes and their precursors (pro-enzymes) necessary for hydrolysing the proteins, fats and carbohydrates. The proteases are secreted pro-enzyme form and chymotrypsinobcn, clastase and carboxypcptidascs A and B. Trypsinogen is activated by cntcrokinasc which is present in the intestinal epithelium, to form trypsin only aller it reaches the brush border of the intestinal lumen. Trypsin then becomes the activator for the other pro- enzymes. Spontaneous conversion of trypsinogcn to trypsin is prevented in the pancreas by the presence of trypsin inhibitors. Control of pancreatic exocrine secretion is also dependent on the relative stimulation of the vagal autonomic nerves that innervate the 17 C/iaplcr I pancreas and also control the degree of secretion of three other hormones; secretin, cholecystokinin and gastrin. Changes in enzyme secretion of the pancreas during the initial weeks of life in piglets have been examined by several workers such as Corring at al. (1978); Efird et al. (1986); Owsley al. (1986); Makkink et al. (1994). For example, Corring et al. (1978) stated that the activities of lipase, amylase, trypsin and chymotrypsin undergo a dual-stage development; rapid growth in the first week of life and again from the 4`h to the 80' week of age. The authors also stated that there is a high correlation between pancreas to body weight ratio, which increases in the first week, and from the 4`h week of age growth is again more rapid (Corring et al., 1978). Similarly, Efird et al. (1982) observed dramatic changes in the development of the digestive system from birth to the 3rd week of age and at weaning. Later, Lindemann et a!. (1986) concluded that enzyme activity increases with age and that these were due to increases in both tissue weight and enzyme activity per gram of tissue. Pancreatic lipase hydrolyses fats (dietary triglycerides) into products (fatty acids and glycerol), which can then be absorbed. An optimum pHl for the action of trypsin in protein hydrolysis and lipase in fat hydrolysis is approximately 8. From birth to 6 weeks of age, specific activity (expressed in relation to total tissue proteins, mg RNA, or mg DNA) increased several fold (x 4.6) but after 2 weeks it was significantly lower (Coning et al., 1978). In a further study, lipase activity was found to increase from birth until 4 weeks of age, when maximum levels were obtained, but post-weaning the increase in total activity was due to increases in pancreas weight (Lindemann et al., 1986). Pancreatic amylase is secreted in its active form. hydrolyses starch to maltose, a disaccharide. Amylase activity has been reported to increase from 5 to 8 weeks of age (Corring et al., 1978; Lindeman et al., 1986; Owslcy et al., 1986), and this increase is most likely related to the requirement to digest dietary starch. Corring et al. (1978) reported that, at 3 weeks of age, specific activity was higher than at birth (x 2.8) and thereafter increased more rapidly until the 6`h week (x 27.5 between 0 and 42 days of age). The same pattern of increasing activity, as for lipase and amylase, is also observed for trypsin and chymotrypsin. From birth to 3-4 weeks of age, total activities per pancreatic gland increased by 2 and 3 fold for trypsin and chymotrypsin respectively, whereas until the 8`h week the increase was more rapid (by 94 and 10 fold respectively; Corring et al., 1978). Moreover, this is in agreement with the findings of Owsley et al. 18 Chapter 1 (1986), who measured activities in both the pancreas and small intestine, and reported that the total activity of amylase, trypsin and chymotrypsin increased significantly until 56 days (8 weeks) of age. Similar results for total trypsin and chymotrypsin activities were also reported by Efird et al. (1982) who observed a significant linear effect with age, from birth to 22 days of age; the higher proportional contribution for both enzymes was mainly attributable to the pancreas. Furthermore, Lindemann et al. (1986), reported a general depression in pancreatic enzyme activities, but not in gastric protcolytic activities, during the 18` week post-weaning. More recently, Kelly et at. (1991a) observed that anatomy, morphology and function of the gut in weaned pigs were affected by a continuous nutrient supply. 1.3 GASTRO-INTESTINAL SYSTEM IN TILE WEANED PIG 1.3.1 Introduction Over the past 50 years, the weaning age of piglets has been decreased from 10-12 weeks to current ages of 3-5 weeks (Nabuurs, 1998). At weaning, the piglet must rapidly adapt to major changes in both nutrition and environment, which is extremely stressful, both physically and psychologically. As such, the weaning transition is commonly accompanied by adverse changes in intestinal morphology, including villus atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, increased villus digestive capacity and reduced brush-border enzyme activity in the small intestine (McCracken et al., 1999). Specifically, factors such as the withdrawal of immunoglobulins and growth factors (present in sows' milk) at weaning, the presence of antigenic feed components and the proliferation of certain bacteria in the gut, are known to influence these morphological changes. These modifications may render the host vulnerable to infection by opportunistic and other pathogens. 1.3.2 Structure and function of the intestine Several factors may be implicated in weaning-associated morphological changes in the pig intestine. However, the precise aetiology of changes in gut structure and function after weaning remains to be fully elucidated. The dynamic process of small intestinal cell turnover is a function of the rates of crypt cell proliferation, migration along the crypt- villus axis and cell extrusion from the villus apex via apoptosis and sloughing (Ziegler et al., 1999). An increased rate of cell loss or a reduced rate of cell renewal could be responsible for villus atrophy post-weaning. If an increased rate of cell loss were apparent, then this would be associated with greater crypt-cell production and generally 19 Chanicr I increased crypt depth. However, villus atrophy may be a consequence of reduced cell division in the crypts, such as that which occurs as a result of fasting (Altmann, 1972; Goodlad and Wright, 1984; Goodlad et al., 1988). Although both of these factors arc likely to occur during the post-weaning period, resulting in lowering the villus height to crypt depth ratio, a reduced rate of cell renewal will have the most profound effect on gut structure. Hall and Byrne (1989) also reported a reduction in crypt cell production rate associated with villus atrophy, a phenomenon attributed to sub-optimal intakes (refer to section 1.6.5) of energy and protein. As crypt depth declined at 3 days, Eiall and Byrne (1989) suggested that villus atrophy was due to a slowed production of new cells and not an increased rate of loss of mature enterocytes from the surface of the villi. ilampson (1986) stated that the number of cells in the crypts did not increase 2 days post-weaning, but steadily increased thereafter until day 11. Whilst crypt elongation also occurred in unweaned pigs, the extent of the increase was greater in weaned animals. Therefore, as a consequence of these changes, the villus height: crypt depth ratio in weaned pigs is decreased compared to unweaned animals. Hiampson (1986) suggested that this represents a balance of cell production in the crypts and cell loss from the villi that began on day 5 post-weaning and continued for at least 5 weeks. This is evident in the change from longer, finger-like villi (newborn and suckling pigs) to wider leaf-like or tongue-like villi post-weaning. However, this only occurs post-weaning with continuous absence from the sow (Hiampson, 1986). 20 AN Chapter I a) h Figure 1.5: Scanning electron micrograph shoving typical appearance ( 1) lww fingerlike intestinal villi in a newborn pig and b) shorter leaf=shaped intestinal villi in a newly weaned pig (micrographs courtesy of D. Kelly). 1.4 IMMUNE SYSTEM OF THE PIGLET 1.4.1 Introduction At birth, piglets are immunocompetent, however they are also immunologically naive, having been protected within an antigen-free environment throughout gestation, and as such, antigen exposure is necessary for the development of the immune system. The antibodies present in colostrum therefore protect the neonate while it mounts an immune response to the organisms in the environment. Furthermore, the response to antigen 21 Chunlcr l primes and establishes the functional immune response early in ontobcny (Zanctti, 1992). It is well established that germ-free animals that are exposed to dietary but not bacterial antigens possess only a rudimentary immune system (Kelly and Coutts, 2000b). At weaning, protective maternal antibodies are removed and the weaned pig must rely on active rather than passive immune responses to protect against environmental microorganisms. Hence weaning may render some piglets immunocompromiscd, which creates a window of susceptibility to infections. The main sites of entry for microbes into the body are through the epithelial surfaces containing mucosal epithelial cells and 50% of the lymphoid mass is associated with these surfaces. These arc collectively called the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues (MALT) and include tissue associated with the genito-urinary system. 1.4.2 General overview of the immune system The primary function of the immune system is the elimination of infectious agents and minimisation of any damage. Broadly, the immune system can be separated into two categories: innate and acquired, the main difference between the two being that acquired is highly specific for a particular pathogen. The primary immunological organs consist of the bone marrow and the thymus, and the secondary organs include spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes and Peycr's patches (Kelly and King, 2001c). Immune responses arc produced primarily by leucocytes, which can be grouped into two major categories; lymphocytes and phagocytes. The latter group includes monocytes, macrophages and polymorphonuclear neutrophils and bind to the invading microorganisms, internalise and destroy them. These cells use primitive non-specific recognition systems enabling them to bind to a host of microbial products, hence they mediate innate immune responses. The lymphocytes are central and exclusive to the specific immune recognition of foreign antigens, both inside host cells and outside in the tissue fluids or blood. The lymphoid progenitor cell has the capacity to differentiate into T-cells (t-helper (Th) I and 2) or B- cells, and this is principally determined by the microenvironment to which they migrate (Kelly and Coutts, 2000b). T-cells develop from precursors in the thymus, whereas mammalian B-cells differentiate in the fetal liver and postnatal bone marrow. 22 Chapter B-cells combat cxtraccllular pathogens and their products by releasing antibody, which binds to the antigen. In the gut, this antibody is mainly an immunoglobulin (lg) isotypc. The antigen could be a molecule on the surface of a pathogen or a toxin, which it produces. T-lymphocytes posses a broader range of activities and arc primarily involved in antigen recognition and clearance, and in co-ordinating the response of i3-cells. For example, some are involved in the control of B-lymphocyte development and antibody production. A further group interacts with phagocytic cells to assist in the destruction of the pathogen that they have taken up. A final set of T-lymphocytes recognises cells infected by virus and destroys them. Interactions between T- and 13-cells, as well as antigen presenting cells, are critical to the development of specific immunity. Phagocytic cells remove particulate antigen by phagocytosis and are derived from myeloid progenitor cells. Macrophages, which are mononuclear phagocytes, arc also involved in antigen to T-cells (Kelly and Coutts, 2000b). 1.4.3 Cytokines Cytokines are small protein, signalling molecules, secreted by cells in response to a stimulus and can act in an autocrine or a paracrine manner. One of the most important roles of cytokines is in controlling the activity of lymphocytes. For example, intestinal epithelial-derived cytokines also play key roles in the cellular and functional development of the IEL (intra-epithelial T-lymphocytcs) and lamina propria compartments; however, the specific cytokines involved and modes of action have yet to be identified. Other functions include regulation of the amplitude and duration of immune responses and the activation of immune cells and the extent of their cytostatic, cytotoxic and antiviral activities (Reeves and Todd, 1996). There is a wide range of different cytokines that exert their effects in the immune system. These include intericukins (IL-1 ctc. ), growth factors and necrosis factors and there are more than 100 in total. Cytokincs are highly multifunctional and as such different cytokines have overlapping functions, which can yield them redundant. However, some cytokines can in combination function in a synergistic manner. For the pig, published reports on intestinal epithelial cell cytokincs have not yet been identified. 1.4.4 Immune mechanisms operative at mucosal surfaces The intestinal immune system is organised anatomically to provide several layers of defence with final protection being effected through complex interactions among the various cell types that reside in distinct locations. Cellular immune components of the 23 C/santcr I intestinal immune system include dispersed or non-organised cells found throughout the epithelium (lamina propria leukocytes and IEL), as well as highly organised lymphoid follicles such as Peyer's patches and lymph nodes. In addition to providing a protective physical barrier, the intestinal epithelium actively contributes to intestinal immunity by transducing information regarding the relative state of intestinal health to resident or transient immune cells in the underlying lamina propria. Those functions arc mediated through the ability of intestinal epithelial cells to present foreign antigens and to synthesise, secrete, and respond to numerous cytokines (Gaskins, 1997). 1.4.5 Immunologic functions of the intestinal epithelium Throughout the intestine, the outermost epithelial cell monolayer is organised into two morphologically and functionally distinct compartments, the crypt regions containing stem cells and Paneth cells, and the villi (small intestine) or epithelial cuffs (large intestine) containing one of several terminally differentiated epithelial cell types (Gaskins, 1997). The formation of tight junctions between adjacent epithelial cells in mature epithelia provides a key innate component of mucosal defence by serving simply as a physical barrier to the external environment (Gordon, 1989; Pottcn and Locflcr, 1990). Crypt stem cells move in a polarised fashion at a rate of one to two cell positions per hour, up the villus base towards its tip (Potten and Locflcr, 1990). During the translocation process, epithelial precursors differentiate into cntcrocytcs, goblet cells, or enterocndocrine cells (Gordon, 1989). Upon reaching the apical area of each villus, the resulting differentiated cells are extruded into the intestinal lumen. The process of continual desquamation and renewal of the gut epithelium plays a key defensive role by limiting opportunities for pathogens to colonise epithelial cells. Two epithelial cell types that also contribute important innate defence functions arc the Paneth cells which synthesise and secrete anti-bacterial peptides (Lehrer ct al., 1993) and the mucin- producing goblet cells (Neutra and Forstncr, 1987). Although certainly key protective components of the neonatal intestine, the developmental biology of both Pancth and goblet cells has not yet been described for the pig. Being the first site of intimate contact with the external environment, the epithelium is in direct contact with IEL and the numerous immune effector cells located in the laminar propria. Indeed, complex communication networks between cpithclial and submucosal cells, via a variety of bioactivc molecules, appear to underlie concerted inflammatory responses to luminal insults in the intestine (Gaskins, 1997). For example, in response to 24 C/saptcr I bacterial toxins or food antigens, activated lamina propria secrete cytokines and bioactive lipids which collectively increase motility and blood flow to the intestine, while inhibiting absorption and stimulating water and ion secretion by intestinal epithelial cells. When integrated, these physiological responses culminate in secretory diarrhoea, the common and major symptom of intestinal inflammation, regardless of precipitating insult (Hinterleitner and Powell, 1991). Intestinal epithelial-derived cytokines also play key roles in the cellular and functional development of the IEL and lamina propria compartments; however, the specific cytokines involved and modes of action have yet to be identified. 1.4.6 Influence of microflora Although bacteria play an important role in the development of the intestinal immune system (Gaskins, 1997; Gaskins, 1998; MacDonald and Pcttcrsson, 2000), some may actually also help to reduce maintenance costs of the gastrointestinal system (Kelly and King, 2001a). Commensal and pathogenic bacteria have evolved a diverse range of mechanisms that promote their survival within the gut ecosystem. Bacteria can produce a vast array of cytokine-inducing or cytokinc-modulating molecules that will regulate or direct the host response. Certain of these factors may promote the virulence and pathogenic potential of bacteria but others, paradoxically, may facilitate the maintenance of the indigenous microflora by beneficially regulating the immuno-inflammatory status of the gut (Kelly and King, 2001a). Furthermore, commensal microorganisms colonising the intestinal mucosa provide a barrier effect against pathogens by using a variety of mechanisms, such as occupation of niches, competition for nutrients and production of antimicrobial substances. Moreover, evidence is accumulating that these symbiotic microorganisms, including certain lactic acid bacteria (LAB) can modulate the homeostasis of the host's defence mechanisms, both innate and adaptive immune functions. The molecular basis and importance of crosstalk between the luminal microorganisms and the intestinal epithelium and immune cells is beginning to emerge (Kelly and King, 2001 a). 25 Chapter 1 1.5 GROWTH PROMOTION POST-WEANING 1.5.1 Introduction Antibiotics are well established in animal production where they have been historically used as a prophylactic against bacterial infection, therapy and as antimicrobial growth promoters (AGP). The use of antimicrobial agents for food animals may cause problems in the therapy of infections by selecting for resistance among bacteria pathogenic for animals or humans (Aarestrup, 1999). The emergence of resistant bacteria and resistance genes following the use of antimicrobial agents is relatively well documented and it seems evident that the use of all antimicrobial agents will encourage selection for resistance. 1.5.2 Antibiotic addition AGPs have been utilised within the agricultural industry for some 30 years even though their exact mode of action has not yet been fully elucidated. Concern regarding the predicted emergence of resistant strains of pathogenic species which may then be transferred to other bacteria, thus rendering them resistant (Aarestrup, 1999), has however, provoked an increasing public rejection of this farming practice. As a result of the risk of transmission of antibiotic resistance from food animals to man, the EU banned the use of virginamycin, tylosin phosphate, spiramycin and zinc bacitracin in animal feedstuffs from 1 July 1999 (Wegener ct al., 1999). Furthermore, the EU has recently produced legislation to ban the 4 remaining products (flavophospholipol, moncnsin sodium, salinomycin sodium and avilamycin) by 2006. There will be minimal, if any, benefit in withdrawing antibiotic growth promoters if this is accompanied by an escalation in the use of such products for clinical purposes. Hence, this has placed new emphasis on utilising the diet to control enteric bacterial infections, promote performance and the role and importance of gut health in achieving this in pigs. Moreover, alternative strategies to ensure a smooth and economic transition from the suckling to post-weaning period are required. Although the precise mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of antibiotics remains unclear, several mechanisms have been proposed. Bach Knudsen (2001) outlined a number of mechanisms, which may be responsible; 1. nutrients are more efficiently absorbed and fewer are utilised by the gut wall due to a thinner epithelium; 2. more nutrients are available to the host because of a reduced flora with subsequent alterations in epithelial functions within the porcine small intestine; 3. there is a reduction in harmful 26 Chanter I gut bacteria which may reduce performance (due to low-level inflammation) and cause subclinical infection; 4. production 5. microbial deconjugation of bile acids is reduced. These arc in agreement with hypotheses of Visek (1978) and Andersen el al. (1999). Moreover, the response to dietary antibiotic supplementation is offen greater in younger, unthrilty or stressed animals maintained under adverse management and environmental conditions. Basically, antibiotics arc thought to exert their effects through the increased utilisation of nutrients and a reduction in the maintenance costs of the gastrointestinal system. 1.5.3 Alternatives feed strategies Gut microflora can play a crucial role in host health, hence manipulation of the gut ecosystem seems a possible method in promoting health. There are numerous alternative strategies including dietary supplementation with enzymes, copper sulfate, zinc oxide, acidification, pro- and pre-biotics, herbal extracts and spices, or immuno\"potcntiators. At present 47 enzyme-products arc provisionally authorised within the EU. The latter supplements are perceived as being more `natural' in concept and are therefore likely to be more readily accepted by the consumer. Probiotics, are often defined as `a live microbial food supplement that beneficially affects the host animal by improving its intestinal microbial balance' (Fuller, 1989; Fuller, 1992; Fuller and Gibson, 1997). Probiotics are usually based on lactic acid producers such as lactobacilli and bifidobactcria and have been used in animals and humans to change the composition or balance of the gut flora. Postulated health advantages associated with probiotic intake include 1) alleviation of symptoms of lactase deficiency, 2) enhanced natural resistance to infectious diseases of the GIT, 3) improved digestion, and 4) stimulation of gastrointestinal immunity (Fuller, 1989; Fuller, 1992; Gibson and Roberfroid, 1995). However, any changes in colonic microbiota arc often transient and the colonisation of exogenous bacteria therefore becomes limited (i. e. the necessity to feed probiotics on a daily basis to replace the bacteria which are washed out of the colon). A prebiotic is a non-digestible food ingredient that beneficially affects the host by selectively stimulating the growth and/or activity of one or a limited number of bacterial species already resident in the colon (Gibson and Robcrfroid, 1995). Intake of prcbiotics can significantly modulate the colonic microbiota by enhancing the numbers of specific, beneficial bacteria. Such compounds include nondigcstible carbohydrates (such as oligo- 27 Chapter / and polysaccharides, resistant starch), some proteins and peptides and certain lipids such as ethers and esters. For example, evidence suggests that fructooligosaccharidcs are selectively fermented by most strains of bifidobacteria (Wang and Gibson, 1993). Synbiotics are 'a mixture of probiotics and prebiotics that beneficially affects the host by improving the survival and implantation of live microbial dietary supplements in the GIT, by selectively stimulating the growth and/or by activating the metabolism of one or a limited number of health-promoting bacteria, and thus improving host welfare' (Gibson and Robcrfroid, 1995). This combination of pre- and probiotics could improve the survival of the probiotic organism, because its specific substrate is readily available for its fermentation, and the resultant advantages include a combination of the benefits of live microorganisms and prebiotics to the host (Collins and Gibson, 1999). This could produce a number of benefits including improved survival of live bacteria in food products; enhanced number of ingested viable bacteria reaching the colon; stimulation of the growth and implantation of both exogenous and endogenous bacteria in the colon; and activation of the metabolism of these bacteria (only metabolically active bacteria can promote health). 1.6 PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH TILE POST-WEANING PERIOD 1.6.1 Introduction Numerous micro-ecosystems exist within the GIT, and a high diversity of the bacterial flora within these micro-ecosystems enhances the stability of the microbial population and contributes to a high colonisation resistance against invading pathogens (llcntgcs, 1983; Kuhn et al., 1993). Changcs/fl uctuat ions in the stability of this flora may result in overgrowth of indigenous and/or exogenous pathogenic bacteria possibly resulting in disease particularly diarrhoea. Enterotoxigenic E. coli and rotaviral infections arc common causes or contributing factors to scours, or diarrhoea, in suckled and weaned pigs. Possibly the most important predisposing factor in susceptibility of suckling pigs to infections is insufficient uptake of colostrum in the first hours of suckling which provides protective levels of IgA and other beneficial factors. A second important predisposing factor to enteric infections is the prevalence and expression of membrane and mucin glycoconjugatcs that serve as binding sites for enteropathogens a!., 1994; Thacker, 1999; Kelly and Coutts, 2000a; Kelly and King, 2001a). The chemistry and distribution of bacterial and viral binding 28 Chapter I sites on gut mucosal surfaces play important roles in determining host and tissue susceptibility and in triggering host responses. This is particularly noticeable in neonates, where both beneficial and harmful swings in microbial balance can accompany epithelial differentiation (Kelly et al., 1992; Stewart et al., 1993). Other predisposing factors in such infections include: inadequate feed and water intake; inadequate gastric acid secretion and unstable/fluctuating microbiota 1994; 2000a; Kelly and King, 2001a). 1.6.2 Voluntary feed intake / post-weaning anorexia Evidence suggests that voluntary feed intake immediately post-weaning has a fundamental role in the subsequent health and performance of the animal. For example, malnutrition studies have provided evidence that diet influences intestinal transport. Moreover, malnutrition and fasting have been shown to result in dramatic changes in mucosal barrier functions, and also modulate intestinal transport of nutrients and ions. Specifically, the permeability of the intestinal epithelium for macromolecules is increased (Rothman et al., 1985; Carey et al., 1994) and the content of mucosal IgA and the secretory component is markedly diminished (Ha and Woodward, 1997). Post-weaning malnutrition predisposes to infection by compromising the barrier and immune functions of the gut. At the same time, the infections adversely influence dietary intake and absorption and cause loss of endogenous nutrients (Calder and Jackson, 2000). 1.6.2.1'Luminal nutrition' and gut structure and function The weaning transition period usually results in a critical period of underfeeding during which the piglet needs to eat and adapt to digest the solid feed. Feed intake of piglets post-weaning is very low and both the extent and duration of underfeeding are extremely variable (Figure 1.6). This has both immediate and mid-term and marked effects on piglet growth, energy metabolism, and on metabolic changes associated with endocrine adjustments. Le Dividich and Seve, (2000) observed that the level of metabolisable energy (ME) intake achieved at the end of the first week post-weaning ranged between 700 and 800 kJ ME/kgo-75, irrespective of weaning age, and that this was only 60-70% of the pre-weaning milk ME intake; it was also stated that the pre-weaning ME intake is not achieved until approximately 2 weeks post-weaning. A reduction in feed intake immediately post-weaning (up to day 7) has also been shown to result in an increased critical body temperature (Le Dividich et al., 1979 as cited by Le Dividich, 1981); this is further supported by later studies of Le Dividich et al. (1980). 29 Chaplet. 2000' 1500\" ME Intake \u00b0 (k. 1/kg'75/d) 1000' 500- 0 Milk intake Solid food intake O8 O0 O O Day of weaning t 07 14 21 28 35 Pre-wean Period Post-wean Period (d 14 - 21) (Day) 0 Nohlct & Eticnnc, 1980 0 I, cibbrandt et al. 1975 1 Lc 1)ividicli cl al 1980-I981 [lurk et aI 1986 A Pitiske, 1993 Figure 1.6: The voluntary feed intake of pigs prc- and post-weaning (expressed as metabolisable energy (ME) per kg metabolic live weight) (adapted from Le E)ividich and Seve, 2000) It is well established that feed intake and subsequent nutrient flow along the gut is essential for its structural and functional maintenance (Diamond and Karasov, 198 3; Kelly et a!., 1992). The consequences of this lack of nutrients to the small intestinal lumen immediately post-weaning include detrimental effects on the rate of cell differentiation and cell turnover. This presence of food within the GIT has both direct and indirect effects on epithelial cell proliferation (Johnson, 1987). For example, l3urrin et al. (2000) performed a study in which suckling piglets were weaned and led etiterally in order to investigate the minimum amount of enteral nutrition necessary fier the stimulation and maintenance of intestinal growth. The authors reported that 40% of' total nutrient intake was required to increase mass and protein content of the intestine and 60`%% of total nutrient intake was necessary to stimulate proliferative activity (as determined From analysis of DNA content, crypt depth and 5-bromodeoxyuridine incorporation into crypt cell nuclei). 30 Chaptcr I Furthermore, villus atrophy and reduced crypt-cell production rates have all been demonstrated to be consequences of either dietary restriction (e. g. Nunez et al., 1995), intravenous feeding (e. g., Goodlad et al., 1992) or starvation (e. g., McNeill and l lamilton, 1971; Altmann, 1972). Such modifications in small intestinal morphology have been reported in the newly weaned pig, hence it seems likely that luminal nutrition is an important function in the integrity of the growth, structure and function of the small intestine post-weaning. Additionally, Deprez et al. (1987) and Cera et al. (1988) demonstrated that feeding a dry pelleted post-weaning feed decreased villus height. More specifically, McCracken et al. (1995), and Pluske et al. (1996a; b) illustrated the interdependence between voluntary food intake and mucosal architecture. Table 1.1 provides the effect of post-weaning energy intake level on villus height, expressed as percentage of villus height at weaning.

For example, Dunshea et al. (1997) provided piglets (weaned at 21 d) with supplemental skim milk during the suckling period (from 10 to 20 d) and reported increased feed intake immediately post-weaning (initial 2 d), 257 vs 30 g DM /d compared to piglets offered a 31 Chantcr I pellctcd diet. Additionally, Azain (1997) weaned piglets at 7-10 d and provided liquid artificial milk and recorded feed intake levels double (300 vs 130 gDM / d) than littermates fed dry feed during the first week post-weaning. Moreover, Pluskc el a!. (1996b; c) illustrated that, in comparison to unweaned piglets, feeding a milk liquid diet (ewes' or cows' fresh milk at 2 hourly intervals) immediately after weaning maintained both villus height and crypt depth. Pluske et al. (1996c) also illustrated a linear relationship between total dry matter intake and mean villus height along the length of the small intestine (Figure 1.7a). In turn, mean villus height explained 47% of the total variation in empty body-weight gain in the first five days after weaning (Figure 1.7b). This observation is in agreement with similar relationships reported in other studies (Li et al., 1991). It was concluded that as villus height can be correlated to the number of cntcrocytcs the villus column in 'normal' villi (Wright, 1982; Hampson and Smith, 1986), maintenance of food intake after weaning must have preserved entcrocyte number commensurate with a maintenance, or even enhancement (e. g., James et al., 1988), of digestive and absorptive capacity of digestive and absorptive capacity of each enterocyte (Pluske, 2000). Furthermore, in the study of Pluske et al. (1996e), mean villus height was highly correlated (r = 0.79; P <0.05) to empty body-weight gain (Figure 1.7c). Whilst the authors were unable to state definitively that cause and effect relationships exist between gut structure and weight gain, these data illustrate the apparent interdependence between voluntary food intake and mucosal structure in determining the post-weaning performance of piglets (Pluskc et al., 1996b; c). Additionally, in the study of Pluske et a!. (1996c), pigs fed ad libitun: exhibited growth rates in excess of 500 g/d indicating that digestive and absorptive capacity was not restricted. These data highlight the importance of stimulating food intake after weaning, whilst also emphasising the interdependence between absorbed nutrients, intestinal structure and growth rate in the immediate post-weaning period. Goodlad et al. (1988) proposed an alternative hypothesis for the preservation of villus height, in that villus cell population might increase by way of cell migration from the crypts without an accompanying increase in crypt-cell production rate. however, this is unlikely to explain the maintenance of villus height reported by Pluskc et al. (1996b; c) as this has only been observed in rats rc-fed after a period of short-term starvation (Altmann, 1972; Clarke, 1975). 32 Chmucr / a) 700 600 Mean villus height (\u00b5m) 500 400 300 o0 \"0 00 .\"o so 200 J 0 200 400 600 Dry matter intake (g / d) b) 600 Empty 400 body gain (gld) 200 0 - 200 300 400 500 600 700 Mean villus height (\u00b5m) 33 ('ha,; i rl c) 500 Empty body 300 gain (g / d) 100 -100 -300 200 300 400 500 Mean s'illus height (\u00b5m) Figure 1.7: Relationship between a) dry matter intake and mean villus height along the small intestine [y = P<0.00]; b) mean villus height along the small intestine and empty body-weight gain [y = -325.69 + 1.39x, R2 = 127.10): P=0.0021, in pigs offered cow's liquid milk at maintenance (\" ), 2.5 times maintenance (I ), or (id lihilum, (0 ) energy intake for 5 days after weaning (8 pigs per treatment) and c) [y = -612.0 + 2.33x, R=0.79; P=0.020] in pigs ofi red a pelleted starter (I) diet 1.7 IMMUNO-POTENTIATION 1.7.1 Introduction The mammalian immune system possesses mechanisms to detect chemical structures or molecules that are potentially dangerous, and utilise them as alarm signals to switch on the defence against infections. As a result, the immune system will respond to immuno- potentiators as if challenged by a pathogenic microbe (Sohn ei Ill., 2000). The ability to control an immune response f\u00fcr the benefit of' both the animal and production efficiency is the objective of' immunomo-potentiatloll in lood-producing animals, and substances that exert this control are called immuno-potentiators or immunomodulators (Blecha, 2001). Broad categories of immuno-potentiators include cytokines, pharmaceuticals, microbial products, neutraceuticals, and traditional medicinal plants. Immuno-potentiators are chemcials, drugs, stressors or actions that elevate the 34 Chapter J nonspecific defence mechanism or the specific immune response (Anderson, 1992), and hence render animals more resistant to infections by viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites. This definition also emphasises the complexity of the interaction between the immune system and its environment. If the non-specific defence mechanism is enhanced, there is no memory clement and so the response is likely to be of short duration. This explains why supplements such as nucleotides arc administered over a relatively short time period and on a daily basis. Although the mode of action at a molecular level is known only for a few immuno- potcntiators (Sohn et al., 2000), a number have been evaluated in a range of species including laboratory animals, ducks and fish, such as structural elements of bacteria (lipopolysaccharidcs, lipopeptides, glycoproteins), various 0-1,3-glucan products from bacteria and mycelial fungi, \u00df-1,3/1,6-glucans from the cell wall of baker's yeast, complex carbohydrate structures (glycans) from various biological sources including seaweed, peptides in extracts of certain animals and made by enzymatic hydrolysis of fish protein, blood plasma, vitamins, minerals, and synthetic products. The various immuno- potentiators of bacterial origin interact directly with phagocytic leukocytes as well as with the leukocytes involved in antibody production (refer to Sakai, (1999) for a review in fish). Immno-potcntiators of bacterial origin therefore seem to cause an enhancement of many different immune reactions within the body and arc also antigenic in nature, inducing antibody production against the immuno-potcntiator itself. However, bacterial immuno-potentiators, used as adjuvants in vaccines (large-scale utilisation in aquaculturc) have the disadvantage that much of the antibody producing capability of the body is wasted on the adjuvant. Macrophage activation by \u00df-glucans has been shown to enhance the capacity of the non-specific component of the immune system to resist bacterial infections (Burrells ca al., 2001). Administration of an immuno-potcntiator in early life should boost the immune system (thus increasing the animal's immunocompetence) throughout the post-weaning period when the piglet is most susceptible to infection and disease leading to reduced performance. Uses of immuno-potentiators such as those described above provide an effective means of increasing the immunocompctcncy and disease resistance of animals. 1.7.2 Nucleotides Nucleotides consist of a nitrogenous base, a pcntose sugar and one or more phosphate groups. The nitrogenous base is either a purine or pyrimidinc, the atoms of which arc 35 (Yiu/rhv l primarily derived from amino acids. Pyrimidine bases are six-membered rings, and include uracil (U), cytosine (C) and thymidinc (T). Purinc bases have a second five- membered ring, and include adenine (A), guanine ((i), hypoxanthinc and xanthine. A purine or pyrimidine base linked to a pentosc molecule constitutes a nucleoside. Nucleotides (low molecular weight biological compounds that are involved in almost all biochemical processes) are the building blocks of DNA and RNA and play essential roles in structural, metabolic, energetic, and regulatory functions particularly as components of' adenosine triphosphate and other nucleotide triphosphates and in many et al., 1995). phosphate HH representation of* a comprising a nitrogen- containing ring compound (the base, uracil), linked to a 5-carbon sugar (rihosc or deoxyribose) that carries a phosphate group. Nucleotides are contained within milk (in the tbrm of nucleic acids, nucleosides, nucleotides and related metabolic products (Carver, 1999) and are thought to contribute to the enhanced development of the immune and gastrointestinal systems of milk-fed young (Jyonouchi, 1994). The nucleotide content of' human milk is significantly higher than most cow's milk-based infant fbrmulac. Evidence suggests that dietary nucleotides enhance the gastrointestinal and immune systems of' fi)rmula-fcc infants. For example, infants fed nucleotide-supplemented versus non-supplemented formula have a lower incidence of'diarrhoea, and higher natural killer cell activity (Carver, 1999). These data 36 Chapter I suggest that human milk nuclcotidc may contribute to the superior clinical performance of the breast-fed infant. Although most tissues can synthcsisc nucleotides de novo, other cells such as immune cells and cells in the intestine (i. e. erythrocytes, polymorphonuclcar leukocytes, intestinal mucosa, bone marrow, hcmatopoictic cells, brain cells) are lacking in this capacity and must depend on pre-formed nucleotides (Carver el al., 1991; Quan, 1991). Mammalian requirements for exogenous nucleotides can vary considerably and can increase dramatically at times of rapid growth (i. e. the young, immature animal) or physiological stress (i. e. weaning) (Carver, 1994; Jyonouchi, 1994). Since nucleotides can be synthesised endogenously they arc therefore not considered essential nutrients. However, studies have suggested a role of nucleotides as 'semi- essential' or `conditionally essential' nutrients (Carver et al., 1991). For example, these nutrients may become essential when the endogenous supply is insufficient for normal function, even though their absence from the diet does not lead to a classic deficiency syndrome. Nucleotides are provided endogenously by de novo synthesis in tissues such as the liver. At least 109 nucleotides are necessary to perform one DNA replication; hence this is an energy-expensive process requiring amino acid precursors and energy in the form of ATP (Carver, 1999). It is therefore more efficient for an animal to use pre-formed nucleotides of dietary or endogenous origin than to synthesise them de novo (Roux, 1973; Uauy, 1994). Most dietary nucleotides are rapidly cataboliscd and excreted. Ilowcvcr, some arc incorporated into tissues, particularly at younger ages (during periods of rapid growth) and with fasting. Under conditions of limited nucleotide intake, rapid growth or certain disease challenge, dietary nucleotide may spare the cost of dc novo nucleotide synthesis and optimise the function of rapidly dividing tissues such as those of the gastrointestinal and immune systems. Animals fed nucleotide-supplemented versus non-nucleotide- supplemented diets exhibit enhanced gastrointestinal growth and maturation (Iijima et al., 1993), and improved recovery following small and large bowel injury. Indices of humoral and cellular immunity are enhanced, and survival rates arc higher following pathogenic infection (Carver, 1999). 37 Chaptcr I Despite the considerable research effort, the role of dietary nucleotides in the functioning of the immune system has not yet been fully elucidated. Ilowever, evidence suggests that immature lymphocytes arc not capable of synthesising purinc and pyrimidinc bases required to produce nucleotides and must therefore rely on the de novo synthesis of nucleotides by other organs such as the liver (Rudolph el aL, 1990) or an exogenous source such as the diet. 1.7.2.1 Immunological effects Feeding nuclcotide-supplemented compared with a nucleotide-free diet to rodents has been associated with increases in the following immune responses; 1. graft-versus host disease mortality (Kulkarni et al., 1994a); 2. rejection of allogenic starvation-induced immunosuppression (Kulkarni et al., 1994a); 6. natural killer cell activity and macrophage activation (Carver et al., 1990); 7. resistance to microbial (Kulkarni et macrophage phagocytic capacity 1994a); 9. spleen cell production of intcrlcukin-2 (IL-2) and expression of IL-2 receptors and lyt-1 surface (Kulkarni et a!., 1994a); 10. the number of antibody-secreting spleen cells produced culture (Jyonouchi peripheral total leukocyte counts and ncutrophil numbers following infection (Matsumoto et al., 1995). Many studies have investigated the role of dietary nucleosides and nuclcotidcs in the maintenance of the cclluar immune system. For example, the addition of dietary nucleosides and nucleotides to diets has been shown to increase DTII (delaycd\"type hypersensitivity) responses (Kulkarni et al., 1987), enhance host resistance to infection (Kulkami et al. (1986), Fanslow ct al. (1988), Adjci ct al. (1993)), affect the number and 38 Cl: aplcr 1 function of T\"hclpcr cells (Van Buren et al., 1985; Kulkarni et at., 1989; Rudolph et al., 1990; Jyonouchi et a!., 1994) and enhance the cytotoxic function of natural killer cells in BALB/c mice (Carver el al., 1990; Kulkarni cl al., 1994a). Van Buren et al. (1985) proposed that dietary nuclcotidcs exert effects on immune responsiveness by acting on the T-helper/inducer population, with the predominant effect on the initial phase of antigen processing and lymphocyte proliferation. The presumed mechanism is suppression of uncommitted T-lymphocyte responses, as demonstrated by higher levels of specific intracellular marker for undifferentiated lymphocytes in primary lymphoid organs in mice fed a nucleotide-free diet (Rudolph et al., 1983). A regulatory role of dietary nucleotides in immunohematopoicsis has also been proposed (Kulkarni ct al., 1992). Rudolph et al. (1990) suggested that dietary nucleotide effects on immunity were not previously observed, since they arc only evident under conditions of stress, such as immune challenge. Van Buren et al. (1983) demonstrated that dietary nucleotides enhanced in vitro and in vivo cell-mediated immunity to alloantigcns and cardiac allografts. Kulkami et al. (1989) showed that mice fed nucleotide-free diet containing 21% casein showed no recovery of the immune response, and that the host response against bacterial and fungal pathogens was decreased (Kulkarni, 1986 and Fanslow, 1988). These findings suggest that exogenous supply of nucleic acids and/or their component from dietary sources may be beneficial in maintaining normal body functions. 1.8 CONCLUSIONS The development of the GIT and its associated immune system, under the protection afforded by maternal passive immunity, occurs in a precise and highly regulated manner and results in an optimally primed system capable of providing nutrients for normal bodily functions and growth and also for immune protection, all essential for the survival of the young animal (Kelly and King, 2001a). However, current high-health farming systems with increasing production costs require a high throughput of animals, and the use of antibiotics to promote growth and combat infection is common practice. This is now threatened by legislation that prevents the use of those antibiotics to reduce any perceived health risks, and to combat the potential emergence of antibiotic resistance. The remaining 4 growth promoting antibiotics arc due to be banned in the European Union from 2006. Furthermore legislation has recently been proposed to increase the weaning age of piglets to a minimum of 28 days. It is postulated that this will have a significant 39 Chaptcr impact on the weaned pig, which will be more mature and better able to cope with, and adapt to, the wcaning proccss. The compromise between production levels, and the health and welfare of both animals and humans is complex. Alternative strategics must be developed which arc in line with health and welfare requirements, whilst also matching demand and market requirements. The modern consumer is increasingly demanding more stringent controls regarding the way in which food-producing animals arc reared. As such new food production strategies, which arc in-line with current legislation and consumer demands, are imperative. Information on the 'signals and inputs' required in early life to promote optimum immune function and disease resistance, and the energetics of these processes, may enable the manipulation of the nutrition and the environment (microbial exposure) of the young animal to satisfy both welfare, environmental and production criteria (Kelly and King, 2001 a). 1.9 OVERALL HYPOTHESES It was postulated that dietary manipulation would exert a beneficial effect on piglet post- weaning performance. Such beneficial effects would be monitored in terms of gut health i. e. gut morphology characteristics, identification and enumeration of a limited number of microbiological species, growth performance and in some later studies, peripheral lymphocyte blastogenesis assays. Such measurements would provide an indication of intestinal structure, microfloral load and immune status, which all impact on post- weaning growth performance. Hypotheses for individual studies are presented in the appropriate sections. 40 CHAPTER 2: GENERAL MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 INTRODUCTION Studies were undertaken to investigate the digestive physiology of the post-weaned pig with specific emphasis upon nutritional influences on gut microflora and health throughout the initial 2 weeks post-weaning. The same basal conventional starter diet (Provimi Ltd, Yorkshire, UK) was used throughout all studies, with treatment diets being altered in some manner. Certain details concerning housing, management, and parameters measured along with analytical procedures that were followed were similar for all studies and details of these are given below. Any departures from the general description, which occurred, are given in the appropriate sections. No procedures requiring a Home Office Project Licence were undertaken in any of the studies. 2.2 EXPERIMENTAL ANIMALS All experiments were performed under the same basic principles. Entire male, post-weaned piglets were employed for each study (except studies 1 and 5) of approximately 5 to 8 kg initial live-weight (studies 2-4 n= 36). In study 1,20 male piglets were employed and in study 5,96 mixed male and female piglets were employed. All animals were sourced from a local multiplier herd (commercial white hybrid) and litters were weaned at 28 days of age. Upon arrival at the site, the piglets were individually weighed and transferred to an environmentally controlled (temperature 28 - 32 \u00b0C, humidity 45%, and lighting regime 16 h light and 8h dark) room in the Pig Metabolism Building (experimental unit). 2.2.1 Housing and management Upon arrival at the experimental unit, piglets were randomly allocated to one experimental diet and were individually housed in pens with 1 m2 slatted floor space/pen (study 2- 4) or group housed (study 1), with 2 nipple drinkers and a feed trough. Each pen had partitions allowing visual, olfactory and limited tactile contact between adjacent pens (conforming to appropriate DEFRA (formerly MAFF) guidelines). Water was available ad libitum from 41 Chapter 2 nipple drinkers located in each pen at all times. Feed was also available ad libitum, refusals were removed, weighed and discarded twice daily. 2.3 DIETS Two experimental diets were evaluated in all trials except trial 2 which employed 4 diets. All the ingredients were conventional raw feed materials and diets were designed to be general starter diets. All diets were isoenergetic and isonitrogenous (15.4 MJ (DE) / kg and 230g crude protein (CP) / kg as fed) and were based on cooked cereals, wheatfeed, soya products, fishmeal, milk products, soya oil and a mineral / vitamin supplement. The control diet was the same for all five studies. All diets were produced by Provimi Ltd, Dalton Mill, Thirsk, North Yorkshire, England, and were bagged in 25 kg lots. The chemical composition of the diets used is presented in table 2.1. Although the diets were formulated to be identical in energy and nutrient specification, both seasonal variations together with variation in batch manufacture resulted in slight differences between diets used in different studies. As such, specific details concerning the diet specification for each study are presented in relevant sections (sections 3.1; 4.1 and 5A. 1). 42 Chapter 2 Table 2.1 Chemical composition of the diets used in studies 1 to 5 Nutrient Specification * Trial 1 Trial 2 Trials 3,4 &5 g/kg (as fed) Moisture (g/kg) 120 110 100 Oil A (Ether Extract) 70 75 90 Protein 230 220 230 Crude Fibre 30 25 25 Ash 60 54 60 DE (MJ/kg) 15.5 16.0 16.0 Total Lysine 15 16 16 Vitamin A (iu/kg) 16,000 16,000 12,500 Vitamin D3 (iu/kg) 2000 2000 2000 Vitamin E (iu/kg) 150 150 250 Copper (mg/kg) 165 165 165 Zinc (mg/kg) 140 140 140 ' Calculatcd valucs from formulation programmc 2.4 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE All piglets were weighed on days 0 (day of weaning and delivery to the experimental unit), 2, 4,6,9,12 and 14. The time of weighing remained the same throughout the trial period (07.30 h) in order to minimise any variability due to the influence of gut contents. The first 4 piglets wert slaughtered on day 0 (and shall now be referred to as baseline animals). This group of animals was expected to yield the same results as if they had been slaughtered pre-weaning as animals were slaughtered within 1 hour of weaning; it is assumed 43 Chapter 2 that the gut morphology will be the same as a pre-wcaned animal. The piglets wert serially slaughtered as follows: Table 2.2: Slaughter timetable Group Day 1 0 2 +2 3 +4 4 +6 5 +14 Eight piglets were slaughtered on each of the above 5 days; specific details of the number of animals slaughtered for each treatment group are described at appropriate points (sections 3.3; 4.3; 5A. 3; 5B. 3 and 5C. 3). 2.5. SLAUGHTER PROCEDURE Food was withdrawn from the piglets for 1 hour prior to slaughter to standardise any impact that gut contents may have. Animals were slaughtered by electrical stunning requiring a minimum of 1.3 Amps, with the maximum stun-stick interval being 30 seconds. The main jugular vein was severed, resulting in exsanguination (3 to 4 minutes were allowed to bleed out completely). The small intestine was then removed and the remaining parts discarded. The jejunum, duodenum, ileum, colon and rectal contents (studies 3 and 4; study 2 ilcal samples alone) were removed immediately and the p11 measured directly using a digital p11 meter (Mettle Toledo 320; Fisher Scientific UK). The p11 meter was calibrated prior to p11 measurement using phi 4.0,7.0 and 9.2 buffering solutions (Fisher Scientific UK). 44 Chapter 2 2.6 HISTOLOGY 2.6.1 Fixing and embedding tissue samples 2.6.1.1 Introduction A standard operating procedure, which describes the basic steps for fixing and embedding tissue samples, was followed. Preliminary studies performed in this laboratory have shown that Bouin's fixative (Zarkadas, 1999) adequately prepares piglet intestinal tissue for subsequent morphological measurements and was therefore used for all samples. 2.6.1.2 Fixing tissue samples Pieces of intestinal tissue (6 to 8 cm in length and 1 to 2 cm in diameter), were ligated at distances of proportionately 0.25 (proximal), 0.50 (medial) and 0.75 (distal) along the whole length of the small intestine, from the gastric pylorus to the ileo-caecal valve. At each side, both ends of the tissue were doubly tied and the loops filled by injecting Bouin's fixative (consisting of Picric acid, saturated concentration 238.1 ml I' (Sigma-Aldrich Co), and glacial acetic acid 47.6 ml 1\" (Fisher Scientific UK) into the lumen, then submersing the tissue in Bouin's fixative for a minimum period of 15 to 20 minutes. The lengths of fixed intestine were then cut off, rinsed with normal saline (0.9% w/v) to flush out the intestinal contents, and the tissue returned to fresh Bouin's fixative for storage. The period of time required for complete fixation depends on the volume / density of tissue present and the rate of penetration of the fixative. Previous work within this laboratory has shown 24 hours to allow full tissue penetration by the fixative (Zarkadas, 1999). After approximately 24 hours, the tissue was removed from the fixative and transferred to 70% (v/v) Industrial Methylated Spirit (I. M. S.; Fisher Scientific UK), with the solution being changed a number of times in order to remove excess fixative from the tissue, and stored in 70% I. M. S. until cmbcdding. A1 cm ring-shaped length of the tissue was then dehydrated by immersion in an ascending series of aqueous alcohol solutions (70,90 and 100% IMS) using TP1020 the tissuc was cleared with tolucnc (Fishcr Scientific UK), a substance that is miscible with both alcohol and paraffin wax thus allowing 45 Chapter 2 molten wax to penetrate the tissue. The duration of each step is dependent upon the size and thickness of the tissue sample. The schedule used for piglet gut samples is shown below in table 2.3. Table 2.3: Schedule of paraffin wax embedding of intestinal tissue. Step Chemical Duration 1 70% IMS 1 Overnight 2 70% IMS 2 1 hour 3 90% IMS 1 1 hour 4 90% IMS 2 1 hour 5 100% IMS 1 1 hour 6 100% IMS 2 1 hour 7 Toluene 1 1 hour 8 Toluene 2 1 hour 9 Wax 1 1 hour 10 Wax 2 1 hour Once the tissue had been infiltrated with wax, it was transferred as rapidly as possible into a pre-warmed embedding mould filled with molten wax and orientated as desired. The mould was cooled immediately in water at 15\u00b0C to prevent fracturing. Sample blocks were stored at 4\u00b0C to prevent softening of the wax and for ease of subsequent sectioning. 2.6.1.3 Sectioning and staining tissue samples After embedding, the tissue was subsequently sectioned a rotary microtome (11M 355; Microm Laborgcrate GmbH, Walldorf, Germany) feed being set at 8 microns (\u00b5m). Previous work within this laboratory has shown using serial sections, that villi in piglets of this age are less than 150 microns in diameter (Zarkadas, 1999). Therefore selecting every 28`h section ensures that a new villus is studied on each section. For each sample, 28,8 jim thick, transverse sections were cut, placed on slides, stretched flat using 1% glycerin albumin (Raymond A. Lamb Ltd) on a hot plate and baked overnight at 35 \u00b0C. 46 Chapter 2 The slides were run down a series of alcohols to rehydrate them prior to staining using a modified Milligan trichrome staining protocol in which a regressive hacmatoxylin stain replaces the acid fuchsin stage. The procedure for staining the tissue slides is outlined below (all chemicals and reagents were obtained from Fisher Scientific UK, unless otherwise stated). 1. Xylene 1: 2 min 2. Xylene 2: 2 min 3.

Mount slides: using metal forceps remove one slide at a time from the xylene, quickly dry the back of the slide with paper towel and place on the bench. Using a glass Pasteur pipette, apply DPX Mounting Medium (Raymond A. Lamb Ltd) to the slide. Add a cover slip. Using a mounted needle or similar, carefully remove any bubbles by applying gentle pressure to the coverslip. 2.7 HISTOLOGICAL MEASUREMENTS Slide mounted sections were measured using an Olympus system microscope (Model 131IS; Olympus Japan), with an eyepiece ocular graticule and stage micrometer (Raymond A. Lamb Ltd). The stage micrometer has a 2mm scale divided into 0.01 mm divisions. The eyepiece ocular graticule has 100 divisions, which are arbitrary and therefore require calibrating at each magnification used. The calibration is shown in below table 2.4. For study 1, sections were measured manually. However, for studies 2-4, sections were measured using a computerised image analysis system. This consisted of a Leitz system microscope (Model Diaplan; Leitz Wetzlar Germany) fitted with a Panasonic system camera (Model WV-F1513; Panasonic Japan). The camera projected live images to a computer that utilised an AGP video frame grabber (Model Flashpoint 3D Lite; Integral Technologies Inc). The villus height, width and crypt depth where then measured using Scion Image for Windows (version Beta 4.02 Scion Corporation). This software was calibrated using the stage micrometer as described above. Table 2.4: Graticule calibration Magnification 0.0100 10.0 x 200 0.0050 5.0 x 400 0.0025 2.5 x 1000 0.0010 1.0 'calibration for one section on the graticulc. 48 Chapter 2 Villi were selected for measurement from each section by the following criteria: the villus must be complete from tip to base (shown by a single layer of epithelial cells), have a clearly visible capillary network running down the centre of the villus, and include obvious crypt cells. Measurements were only taken from sections where the plane of section ran vertically from the tip of a villus to the base of an adjacent crypt. Ten of the tallest well-orientated villi (complete distance from muscle layer to tip), 10 associated crypts (taken as the distance between the villus base and the muscularis layer), and the villus width (one third down from the tip of the villus) were measured. All villi measurements were performed 'blind', as such piglet identification and dietary treatment where unknown at the time of measurement. A random selection of slides was given to an independent person to verify the measurements that had been taken. 2.8 MICROBIOLOGY 2.8.1 Introduction No microbiological analyses were undertaken for studies I and 5. Studies 2-4 employed microbial enumeration of digesta and faecal samples. However, study 4 employed a limited sampling procedure (Section 5B3.4). 2.8.2 Bacterial enumeration Bacterial enumeration expressed as colony forming units per ml or per g (cfu ml'' or cfu g was calculated using a serial dilution method. The sample (approx. lg for intestinal samples and I swab for faecal samples) to be quantified was diluted 10-fold in maximum recovery diluent (MRD; Oxoid Ltd; Appendix 1) (9 ml for intestinal and 10 ml for faecal samples) and further 10 fold dilutions prepared as necessary. An aliquot (100 microlitres (111) for lactobacilli and bifdobacteria, and 1 ml for coliforms and E. coil) of each dilution was spread plated on to the surface of an appropriate agar plate. The plates were allowed to dry and the agar plates incubated under the appropriate conditions. 2.8.3 Faecal sampling procedure Faccal swabs were collected from all pigs upon arrival at the experimental unit and alternate days thereafter (i. e. days 0,1,3,5,7,9,11,13 and 14) for studies 1-3. if collected and analysed correctly, faccal flora can be representative of colonic flora in terms of composition 49 Chapter 2 and function (Roberfroid et al., 1995). However, faecal samples arc an imprecise measurement of the actual status of the even the colon, and provide no information on the microflora of the ileum or caccum. The faecal swab was collected into 10 ml MIAU (Oxoid Ltd) and placed on ice. All samples were then blended using a vortex mixer (VM20 Chiltern Scientific) for a period of 30 seconds. This blended sample constituted the 1: 10 dilution for lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, E. coil and colifonn determinations where relevant. 2.8.4 Digesta and rectal sampling procedure Changes in the microflora of the small and large intestines can provide an indication of gut health and can be related to differences in growth performance. However, it should be noted that digesta samples provide information on the status of the gut microflora at a single point in time, although this technique has been employed successfully in a number of pig studies. The digesta and rectal samples were obtained from each piglet at slaughter (refer to section 2.5). Approximately Ig of each of the 4 intestinal and 1 rectal sample obtained from each piglet were individually weighed into a separate sterile stomacher bag (Model 400, Seward Ltd), and 9 ml MRD (Oxoid Ltd) added to each bag (i. e. 5 stomacher bags were prepared for each pig). The stomacher bag contents were then blended in a stomacher (Model BA 6021; Seward Ltd) for a period of 30 seconds. This blended sample constituted the 1: 10 dilution for lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and E. coli and coliform determination as stated above in section 2.8.2. 2.8.5 Culture media and enumeration of bacteria 2.8.5.1 Lactobacilli and bifidobactcria enumeration The agar used for the lactobacilli enumeration was Rogosa agar (Oxoid Ltd), which is designed for lactobacilli specifically (Appendix 3). A modified Columbia blood agar base (Oxoid Ltd) was used to determine bifdobacteria counts using the method of IIecrcns (1990) (Appcndix 3). The blended samples (faecal, digesta and rectal) were serially diluted using sterile MRD (Oxoid Ltd) and appropriate dilutions were plated on duplicate plates as described in section 2.8.2. Columbia agar plates were stacked in crates with semi-slatted sides, placed in a black plastic bag, gassed with CO2 to create capnophilic conditions and scaled. All plates were then incubated at 370 C for 72 hours. Following incubation, all colonies grown on Rogosa and 50 Chapter 2 Columbia agar were initially identified by Gram stain and catalasc tests (refer to section 2.8.5.3). The numbers of colonies were then counted on both plates and an average value taken. All plates were incubated with Quality Control plates; controls for Rogosa agar were Lactobacillus acidophilus (positive) and Staphylococcus aureus (negative), and for Columbia agar, Staphylococcus aureus (positive) and an uninoculated plate (negative) (Beercns, 1990). 2.8.5.2 Eschcrichia coil and Aliquots millilitre (ml) of each dilution of piglet faecal, intestinal and rectal samples (refer to sections 2.8.2 & 2.8.3) were spread onto coliform Petri film (3M) plates in duplicate and were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 24 hours. Both plates were counted and an average value taken. Red colonies were classified as coliforms, and blue colonies associated with gas were characterised as E. coli colonies. 2.8.5.3 Biochemical Tests Catalase: A colony under test was placed into a sterile bijoux bottle and hydrogen peroxide (1 ml, 5-10%v/v; Fisher Scientific, UK) was added. The evolution of gas indicates catalase activity. Gram stain: A small colony was emulsified in diluent, smeared onto a glass slide and allowed to air dry. The sample was heat fixed by passing it through a blue Bunsen flame. The Gram staining was carried out by immersing the slides in a series of dyes that were washed off in water before the application of the next reagent (Collins and Lyne, 1995). This comprised methyl violet (0.5% w/v; Raymond A. Lamb Ltd) for 1 minute; Lugol's iodine solution (Raymond A. Lamb Ltd) for 30 seconds; alcohol (95% ethanol; Fisher Scientific UK) for 1 min and carbol fuschin (1% w/v; Raymond A. Lamb Ltd) for 30 seconds. Finally, the colony was observed microscopically at x100 magnification under oil immersion. 2.9 IMMUNOLOGY 2.9.1 Isolation of porcine peripheral blood lymphocytes (1111L) Studies 3 and 4 employed a blood collection procedure outlined below for the isolation of peripheral blood lymphocytes. During the cxsanguination period (refer to section 2.5) when the main jugular vein had been severed with a sterile knife, 20 ml and 200 ml of blood for studies 3 and 4 respectively, were collected into hcparinised (1000 iu / ml; C. P. 51 Chanicr 2 Pharmaceuticals) centrifuge tubes. The samples were allowed to stand for 20-30 minutes to allow rouleaux formation of erythrocytes to occur. The supernatant plasma was then removed and layered over 6 ml Ficoll (Pharmacia Biotech) in a sterile 10 nil V-bottomed centrifuge tube. This was then centrifuged at 1400 rpm (475g) for 30 minutes. The lymphocytes were then harvested at the interface between the medium and the Ficoll and made up to 50 mis with flanks Balanced Salt Solution (IIBSS; Sigma-Aldrich Co. ). This was centrifuged at 1400 rpm for 15 minutes to `pellet' the lymphocytes (i. e. precipitate the lymphocytes out of solution at the base of the V-bottomed centrifuge tube). These were then washed in 50 ml HBSS by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 10 minutes. This was repeated twice to ensure removal of the platelets. The cells were then counted (using a haemocytometer) by 0.1% Trypan blue dye exclusion to determine the number of viable cells (Hudson and Ilay, 1976) and re-suspended in a solution of 10% concentration 2x 106 cell / ml. 2.9.2 Cryopreservation of porcine peripheral blood lymphocytes For study 5A all leucocytes were frozen upon isolation and the proliferation experiments carried out at a later date. In study SB all proliferation experiments were performed with fresh lymphocytes and a percentage frozen should any subsequent analysis be deemed necessary. The concentration at which the cells needed to be frozen (anticipating a 60% yield on thawing) was determined to achieve a final viable concentration of 2x 106 cell / ml. The dilution or concentration factor was also calculated. The lymphocytes were then centrifuged at 1000 rpm (275g) for 7-10 minutes at room temperature and the supernatant decanted, the required volume of freezing medium (10% DMSO Co. ) in heat )) added and gently re-suspended. Aliquots of l ml were added into each cryovial, which were then placed in a cryo 1\u00b0C freezing container (Nalgene) and transferred immediately to a -70\u00b0C freezer. The following day, the cryovials were placed into liquid nitrogen for long-term storage. 2.9.3 Alitogcn proliferation of peripheral blood lymphocytes - lymphocyte blastogenesis assay In study 5A, the lymphocytes were thawed, and the number of cells counted using a haemocytometer. The dilution of cells required to obtain a final concentration of 2x 106 cell / 52 Chapter 2 ml was determined. The 2 mitogens (Concanavalin A (Con Sigma-Aldrich Co. )), were diluted to provide a working concentration of 20 \u00b5g ml-1. This working solution was further diluted (with 13D1I)) achieve 3 final concentrations for each mitogen of 10,3.3 and 1.1 \u00b5g / ml. These concentrations of mitogcns were shown to be optimum by dose titration assays. For each mitogen, 100 p1 of each concentration was then added in triplicate to a 96 U- bottomed well plate. The plate was then placed in the incubator at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere to allow the CO2 to penetrate the mitogens prior to lymphocyte addition. Aliquots of 100 p1 of lymphocyte cells were then added to each well containing the mitogens, and 3 blank wells containing 20% RPMI-1640 alone (unstimulated wells; control) for each mitogen concentration were prepared. Preliminary validation assays using Con A, PIIA and PWM at concentrations of 0.5,1.0,2.5,5,10 and 20 pg / ml were conducted to assess the optimum lymphocyte stimulation level within our experimental conditions and genetic background of the pigs. The plate was then incubated at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified 5% C02 atmosphere for 48 h. Each well containing the cells and mitogens were then pulsed with 0.5 pCi of methyl-[311]-thymidine (Amersham Pharmacia). The plate was then incubated for a further 18 h at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Well contents were harvested onto fiber filters with a semi-automatic cell harvester (Model 11019 Skatron Instruments Ltd). The discs were left to dry for 40 minutes before being punched out into scintillation vials and I ml of scintillate (Ultima Gold; Packard Biosciences) was added. The vials were left to stand for 1 hour to allow the scintillate to penetrate the discs fully. The incorporated radioactivity was then measured using a Beta counter (Model Tri-card 2100 TR, Packard Biosciencc). 2.10 ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES 2.10.1 Analysis of dietary p11 Dietary p11 was determined by adding 25 ml distilled water to 5g of feed that was then mixed thoroughly. The p11 was measured directly using a digital Pli meter (Mettle Toledo 320; Fisher Scientific UK). The p11 meter was calibrated prior to pii measurement using piI 4.0,7.0 and 9.2 buffering solutions (Fishcr Scientific UK). 53 Chapter 2 2.11 CALCULATION OF RESULTS 2.11.1 Growth performance measurements 2.11.1.1 Daily live weight gain Determination of the average daily live-weight gain (DLWG) was performed by linear regression of live-weight, with the slope of the linear response being DLWG. This analysis is more accurate than start and final weights, and also permits a precise calculation of the number of days that an animal takes to grow to a specified weight. It also allows any differences due to dietary treatment to be determined. Example: The live-weights for a piglet were as follows: Day Live weight (kg) 0 6.4 2 6.8 6 7.9 12 11.5 14 14.4 The live-weights were plotted against days on which pigs were weighed. From the regression analysis (refer to appendix 3 for programme) the equation generated was (thc limit for R2 was 0.750) 54 Chapter 2 This specific piglet weighed 6.4 kg on the first day of the trial period, and had an average daily gain of 0.467 g/ day (Figure 2.1). 55 Co Ir x w zU \u00f6.

The statistical analysis was undertaken using General Analysis of Variance and proceeded through establishing linear and non-linear contrasts with time and other sources of variation, and was performed in two parts. For example, the sources of variation utilised in gut morphological analyses were diet, slaughter day (main-plot factor), gut region (sub-plot factor), and all two- and three-way interactions. The between treatment variation was first partitioned into Baseline versus the Rest (BVR) which is comparing the baseline animals (i. e. those slaughtered on day 0; n- 4) with the rest of the experimental animals (study InQ 16; studies 2,3, and 4 it - 32). The baseline animals were classified as receiving diet 0 which corresponds to sow milk in all studies. Secondly, the dietary effects were analysed by removing baseline values and comparing treatments. Latency period to first feed and water, and also final slaughter weight were included within the analysis as co-variates where appropriate. A summary of the sources of variation employed for the analyses of each study is presented below in table 2.5. 58 Ciiaptcr 2 Table 2.5 Summary of the number of experimental animals and sources of variation employed in studies 1-5 Study Number of Animals Number of diets Region Sample Site Faecal swabs Lymphocytes 1 20 2 3 0 N N 2 36 4 3 5 Y N 3 36 2 3 5 Y Y 4 36 2 3 5 Y Y 5 240 2 0 0 N N All two-way and three-way interactions, and means of all measurements for each individual pig were determined.

This can result in a high gastric p1l, which is detrimental to the pig because it allows the proliferation of deleterious microorganisms (i. e. E. cola which require a p11 of 6-8 for maximum rate of reproduction), and inhibits protein digestion. Consequently, reduced stomach efficiency may result in increased feed retention with subsequent reduced intake. The ABC of a compound feed may be defined as the quantity of mmol IICI required per 100 grammes of diet in order to reduce the phi to 4.0 (Spencer and Tilley, 1994). A number of factors have been shown to affect the ABC of diets including feed composition, principally; crude protein, fibre and mineral content. Ilowever, Jasaitis et a!. (1987) and Hardy (1992) have suggested that the most active element affecting the phenomenon of ABC is calcium. Evidence suggests that high calcium levels in pig starter diets can significantly reduce post-weaning growth performance (Hardy, 1992). Furthermore, restricting dietary calcium content has also been shown to prevent the hyper-proliferation of the stomach and gastrointestinal flora thus reducing the incidence of diarrhoea (Hardy, 1992). A further benefit of feeding low ABC diets is that a higher voluntary feed intake can be achieved as the stomach pit is maintained at or below 4 (Tilley, 1990). Once pII 4 and above has been attained in the stomach, the rates of proteolysis and digestion arc reduced, which in turns delays gastric emptying and reduces feed intake. Spencer and Tilley (1994) reported that the stomach of a 6.5.7.0 kg pig wcancd at 28 days of age produces the equivalent of 20 ml molar IICI per day. If the feed offered requires 35 ml per 100g to achieve a p11 of 4.0, the piglet can only cope with approximately 57g of that feed on the first day of feeding (Spencer and Tilley 1994). The authors further 61 Chapter 3 estimated that if the pig were to consume 100g (of a good quality, highly palatable) post- weaning diet, this would result in an overload of 43g of feed causing a subsequent increase in stomach p11 to well above the target of 4.0. This will have significant implications on digestion and absorption, and on gut micoflora load and composition. During the suckling period, lactobacilli proliferate, due to the high lactose content of milk, and produce high levels of lactic acid. This maintains a low stomach p11 but suppresses HCI secretion. At weaning it is therefore difficult for the weaned pig to maintain a low stomach p11 as lactobacilli numbers decline and it takes time for both the hindgut and the secretion of IICI to develop (Cranwcll, 1995). In addition to lactobacilli, the post-weaning feed (pre-pelleted) also contains 103 - 105 /g of various bacteria and fungi that can compromise the environment of the upper tract leading to both physiological and pathological problems. Furthermore, pepsin is required to initiate proteolysis of the \"novel\" proteins present in the feed, and to ensure their maximum digestion in the jejunum. In order to perform this effectively, the wcancr pig requires abundant IICI production in the stomach. Schnabel (1983) as cited by I3olduan (1988), reported that IICI secretion reaches 50% of the whole stomach acidity or 3-8 mmol/100 g digesta only at 3-4 weeks post-weaning. This lack of acidity is accompanied by a p11 increase post-weaning up to pH 4-5. Hence, the consequence of insufficient IICI production is that the consumed feed is insufficiently acidified in the stomach. As a result, microbes are not sufficiently activated and protein digestion is reduced. It is known that the enzyme pepsin, which breaks down proteins into peptides, has an optimum pH for activity of around 2. Following a meal, the feed determines the p1I value in the stomach for several hours and it has been suggested that such a pl I is not attained in piglets, even 6 hours after ad libituin feeding (Kamphucs, 1987 as cited by I3olduan 1988). The reduced protein digestion means that potentially pathogenic bacteria receive large quantities of undigested, readily available protein and starch as substrates that encourage their proliferation. The consequence is that there is a shift in the microorganisms colonising the gastrointestinal tract in favour of Gram-negative and often pathogenic bacteria (e. g. E. coli, Streptococci, Clostridia and Salmonella), which require a p11 of between 6 and 8. The gut microflora is thus extremely unstable after weaning and it is important to consider feed as both a nutrient / energy source for the host and as a bacterial substrate. Bolduan (1988) illustrated that the ABC of a diet can be reduced by the addition of organic acids. However, there are two main disadvantages of this course of 62 Chanter 3 action. Firstly, the amount of any acid is limited to less than 1% of the mass of the wcancr diet, since acid addition in excess of this reduces palatability and depresses feed intake. Secondly, adding small quantities of acid to feed of high ABC has a very limited and minimal effect on stomach p1l. Furthermore, the addition of organic acids may also alter the overall nutritional composition of the diet. Under the experimental conditions imposed in the current study, it was necessary for the 2 diets to be equal in all components except for ABC in order for a valid comparison between the control and treatment diets to be made. Therefore the aim is to provide suitable post-weaning diets so that the piglet can effectively digest the protein fraction in the upper and middle-gut, and the material entering the lower gut (i. e. where the majority of digestive tract microorganisms reside) will be of relatively low protein / appropriate energy concentration residue, ideal for the fermentation process which occurs there, necessary to encourage a microbial load with positive benefit for the animal. In this way the microorganisms rapidly achieve what is essentially a symbiotic relationship with the piglet. This is the \"stable microflora\" concept of the healthy piglet. Numerous workers have investigated the influence of dietary anion-cation balance on parameters such as acid-base status in a range of species, such as chickens (Mcllicrc and Forbes, 1966; Mongin, 1981), cattle (Ogilvie et a!. 1983), fish (Chiu el a!. 1984), pigs (Yen et a!. 1981), rabbits (Thacker, 1959) and rats (Feldman and Charncy, 1980). There would appear to have been no research studying the effects of dietary ABC on gut morphological parameters in piglets. 3.2 AIMS The exact mechanism by which high dietary ABC retards growth performance is largely unknown. However, alterations in the small intestinal morphology post\"wcaning arc thought to contribute to the post\"wcaning growth check. Accordingly, a preliminary 2x2 factorial experiment was designed to examine the effects of diet ABC on gut morphological characteristics such as villus height, width and crypt depth. Differences between regions of the small intestine were also analysed. Additionally, Heal digcsta pll was measured which is an independent factor influencing microflora colonisation. It was postulated that a low ABC diet would result in more rapid recovery of small intestinal 63 Cbaptcr3 structure post-weaning, with subsequent positive impacts on post-wcaning growth performancc. 3.3 METHODS 3.3.1 Animals and housing The experiment involved 20 newly weaned (commercial white hybrid) piglets (10 male and 10 female) of approximately 7 to 9 kg initial livc\"wcight, the criterion for selection being animals of similar weight, and good health status. Litters were weaned at 28 d\u00b1Id of age and delivered to the University on the day of weaning. Upon arrival on the experimental unit, piglets were individually wcighcd and randomly allocated to one of two groups (except for the 4 baseline animals, sec section 3.3.3; each subsequent group containing 4 male and 4 female piglets). The piglets were group housed in an environmentally controlled (27 \u00b0C) room in the Pig Metabolism Building (cxpcrimcntal unit). The piglets were group housed in 2 pens each with slatted floors, 2 feed and 1 water trough. Water was available ad libitum from the water trough, which was present in the pens at all times (changed 3 timcs/d at 08.00,13.30 and 17.00 h). Fccd was also available on an ad libitum basis with refusals being removed, weighed and discarded after each meal. Piglets were fed twice daily, at 08.00 h and 17.00 h with quantities offered being based on initial live-weight and calculated to exceed voluntary feed intake (Appendix 1). 3.3.2 Diets A single-stage trial diet programme was used based on Provimi Ltd 'Multiwcan' diet. kg and 230g crude protein (CP) / kg) and were based on (g / kg) cooked cereals 488.5, whcatfccd 27.2, soya products 232, fishmeal 82.7, milk products 123, soya oil 10 and a mincral/vitamin supplement 26. Dietary ABC was altered by the removal of limestone flour. The control diet contained 14.8g limestone flour / kg yielding an ABC of 77 mcq / kg, whilst the experimental diet contained 5g limestone flour / kg with an ABC of 62 mcq / kg. This difference in ABC was the maximum that was achievable with no significant alterations to the basal formulation. This reduced ABC was deemed to be large enough to exert a significant impact on the gut ecosystem (Varlcy, personal communication). The 64 Cl: uptcr 3 chemical composition has been described previously in section 2.3. The two dicts were as follows: Diet I- High ABC (Conventional starter diet) Diet 2- Low ABC (Treatment diet) Table 3.1: Diet specification (refer to Table 2.1 for chemical composition) inclusion (glkg) Ingredient Diet I Diet 2 Control Treatment Cooked Cereals 528 536 Soya-bean meals 232 Whey Products 120 Fish Products 84 Soya Oil 8 12 Limestone 16 4 Vitamins & Minerals 10 Amino Acids 2 3.3.3 Experimental procedure The experimental and slaughter procedure has been described previously in sections 2.4 and 2.5. The first 4 piglets (baseline) were slaughtered on day 0, which corresponds to both the weaning and arrival date of the piglets at the experimental unit. A total of 4 piglets were subsequently slaughtered on each of days 2,4,6 and 14; 2 piglets having been fed diet I (high ABC; conventional starter diet) and 2 diet 2 (low ABC). At slaughter, the ilcal digcsta contents were removed immediately and the plI measured directly using a digital p! I meter (Mettle Toledo 320; Fisher Scientific UK, Loughborough, Leics. ). The p1I meter was calibrated prior to pit measurement using pi I 4.0,7.0 and 9.2 buffering solutions in scction 2.6. No modifications to this proccdurc were made. 65 Chapter 3 3.4 STATISTICAL ANALYSES The statistical analyses have been described previously in section 2.12. ['his preliminary study utilised 20 piglets in total comprising 10 male and 10 female. Baseline animals (n 4) were slaughtered upon arrival at the experimental unit, 4 piglets of' each sex were subsequently offered I of each of'the diets I and 2. This essentially R rmcd 2 groups of animals each comprising 4 male and 4 female animals, group I were ollcrcd diet I (control), and group 2 were offered diet 2 (treatment). This experimental design is illustrated below: Figure 3.1: Diagrammatic representation ofthe experimental design utilised in this study As such in this preliminary study there was no strict dietary replication, since one group of animals was a replicate. It must, however, be emphasised that this was a preliminary study and all subsequent studies utilised animals housed on an individual basis. It was nevertheless considered worthwhile to employ individual animals as replicates to provide an initial assessment of diet. 66 Chanter 3 3.5 RESULTS A significant relationship between day and diet (P=<0.001: <0.001 (Q)) was evident with respect to villus height (Tables 3.2 and 3.3). Piglets offered the low ABC diet displayed more rapid recovery of villus height in the post-weaning period (P<0.001; Figure 3.2), and also maintained ilcal p11 at a more acid level. Moreover, there was a significant difference between intestinal region, with villi at the distal region being the shortest for both control and treatment animals (P<0.001). Villus height increased (after an initial degree of villus atrophy) significantly between day 0 and day 14 (P<0.001; <0.001 (L); <0.001 (Q)), and there was a significant correlation between BVR and day (11=0.029), but no significant difference between the baseline and the remainder of the animals was found (BVR). Although not significant (P=0.101), the relationship between BVR and diet is nonetheless interesting. Villus width followed a similar pattern; a significant relationship between day and diet was observed (P<0.001; 0.090 (L); Tables 3.4 and 3.5). Again there was a significant difference in relation to dietary treatment (P=0.006), with those animals offered the control diet (diet 1; high ABC) displaying the greatest overall average width. Villus width increased significantly throughout the experimental period (P<0.001; <0.001 (L); 0.014 (Q)), with the proximal villi possessing the greatest width (P<0.001). A significant correlation between BVR and day (P=0.033) was evident, but no significant differences due to BVR, or relationship between BVR and dietary treatment were determined. Analysis revealed a significant non-linear relationship (P<0.001; P<0.001 (Q)) between day and diet with respect to crypt depth (Tables 3.6 and 3.7). Crypt depth also increased temporally (P<0.001; <0.001 (L)), and the overall mean crypt depth was significantly greater for the treatment animals (low ABC; P=0.009). Furthermore, no significant differences were determined between intestinal region or BVR. Significant relationships between BVR and day, or BVR and diet were not evident. Villus height : crypt depth ratios were significantly different between intestinal region (P<0.001), and also between slaughter day (P=0.037; 0.088(Q); Tables 3.8 and 3.9). A significant relationship between day and diet (P=0.019), and IIVR and region (['<0.001), were also found. Strong trends towards significant differences between IIVR (P=0.087) and also a significant correlation between BVR and diet (P=0.066) were apparent. 67 Chaplcr 3 No significant differences between ilcal digesta pH with respect to dietary treatment were evident (Tables 3.10 and 3.11). However, a strong trend was observed towards significant differences between day (P=0.095 (Q)) and BVR (P=0.078). Diet p11 values were 5.94 and 5.94 for diets 1 (control; high ABC) and 2 (treatment; low ABC) respectively. Feed intake levels were similar for both dietary treatments, and there was no significant effect of dietary treatment on piglet daily live-weight gain (mean values = 0.121 and 0.170 for control (high ABC) and treatment (low ABC) diets respectively; P=0.437; s. e. d = 0.06). 68 a) \"Zi a) 00 Z cn C) N cd 'Cy O \"O U 4.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 01F RESULTS Factors common to all studies contained within this thesis are discussed in detail later in Chapter 6. The use of a low ABC diet for 14 days immediately post-weaning did improve gut morphology characteristics. The recovery of villus height occurred primarily between days 4 and 6 post-weaning, suggesting that the first 6 days post-weaning arc the most crucial for the piglet in terms of intestinal recovery and development. There were no differences in feed intake post-weaning therefore this cannot explain this improved recovery. This is in contrast to work reported by Kelly et al. (1984) and McCracken and Kelly (1984) who have suggested that low feed intake immediately post-weaning may be responsible for the changes in gut structure and function in the pig (such as villus atrophy, crypt hypcrplasia, changes in specific enzyme activity relating to the digestive and absorptive function of the gut). Specifically, several authors such as, llampson and Smith (1986) and Kelly el al. (1990) have proposed that villus atrophy and crypt hypcrplasia may be related to the withdrawal of ' intrinsic factors ', such as IgA, in sows' milk (and indeed other mammalian milks), which may also contain an array of biologically active peptides (e. g. epidermal growth factor) and compounds (e. g. polyamincs) that may stimulate protein and DNA synthesis and have functional roles in intestinal differentiation. This is supported by work conducted by Pluske et al. (1996b; c) where villus height and crypt depth could be maintained post-weaning by feeding a milk liquid diet (ewes' or cows' fresh milk) immediately after weaning, at two-hourly intervals in comparison to unweaned controls. It was suggested that the milk may have promoted the activity of enzymes, peptides and growth factors, and hence contributed to the integrity of the small intestine. The current data therefore suggest that the structure of the small intestine can recover more rapidly when a low ABC diet is given after weaning; this will increase the absorptive surface area in the gut and could lead to reductions in the growth check that is often observed after weaning. However, in the current study the improvements in gut morphology observed in animals fed diet 2 (low ABC) did not result in any positive effects on subsequent growth rate. This is in contrast to that reported by Spencer and Tilley (1994), where piglets fed a low ABC diet (as determined by the acid binding factor (ABF) of 17.3) displayed significantly reduced morbidity and mortality, and enhanced daily gains, compared to those fed the conventional (high ABF of 24) post-weaning diet. 75 Clrantcr 3 The post-weaning changes in digcsta p1I, albeit transitory and comparatively modest (and non-significant between diets), may have important implications for gut microflora load by inhibiting the proliferation of deleterious microorganisms which typically require a less acid p1I (i. e. E. colt, Streptococci, Clostridia and Salmonella). Furthermore, dietary ABC is an important parameter to control as it is likely to impact on the acid-base balance of biological fluids (Stewart, 1978). In addition, Kronfcld (1979) stated that acid-base balance has a higher physiological priority than growth, lactation or reproduction; hence any changes in acid-base balance are likely to affect animal performance. Diets formulated to possess a low ABC require a relatively low IICI secretion by the piglet's immature stomach in order to maintain a low p1I in the upper GIT. This subsequently results in adequate pepsin product i on/sccrction, enhanced protein digestion and utilisation, and an unfavourable environment for the proliferation of pathogens. Indeed, Spencer and Tillcy (1994) also reported that where such low ABC diets were utilised commercially, a marked reduction in the quantity of medication required to treat these pigs was reported by the veterinary surgeon. In summary, this preliminary study demonstrates that villus height can recover more rapidly if a low ABC diet is fed immediately post-weaning. In contrast, piglets offered a conventional, high ABC starter diet displayed villus atrophy and crypt hyperplasia for a prolonged period of time. The potential contribution of feeding low ABC diets to preserve gut structure and function and Bence reduce post-weaning growth check seems plausible, although further research in this area is required. Aspects of this preliminary study were incorporated and improved upon to form the basis of work in subsequent Chapters (4 and 5). 76 CHAPTER 4: EFFECTS O1\u00fd DIETARY ZINC AND ANTIBIOTIC AUDITION ON PERFORMANCE AND GUT IILAL'I'II CIIARACTERISTICS OF 1'OST- WLANED PIGLETS 4.1 INTRODUCTION Zinc oxide (ZnO) has been included in post\"wcaning piglet diets commercially, in an attempt to reduce the incidence of post-weaning diarrhoea associated with Eschcrichia co!!, and to promote growth. Evidence suggests that wcanling pigs exhibit increased growth performance when fed pharmacological concentrations of Zn as ZnO (llahn and Baker (1993) Hill el al. (1996), Smith et a!. (1997), Carlson et a!. (1999)), although there arc some reports in which no growth-promoting benefits were observed (Fryer et al. (1992), Tokach et a!. (1992), Schell and Kornegay (1996)). A possible explanation for this lack of response is that young, immature pigs may have a reduced capacity to clear excess Zn from the body, possibly resulting in high levels of Zn in the blood, thus preventing a ZnO-induccd response in weight gain (Icahn and Baker, 1993). It should be noted however, that the direct comparison of different studies is hampered by the fact that, in many reports in the literature, the diets also contain feed grade antibiotics. Furthermore, Ilahn and Baker (1993) reported improved feed intake and weight gain from feeding Zn from a ZnO source, but not from ZnSO4 or Zn-Met sources. Icahn and Baker (1993) relate this to the fact that the `coefficient of bioavailability' of Zn in ZnO is lower than that for other Zn sources such as ZnSO4 (Wedekind and Baker, 1990; Wedekind et al., 1992; Wedekind and Lewis, 1993). For example, Poulson and Larsen (1994) estimated the 'bioavailability' of Zn from ZnO to be 0.2 in basic pig diets comprising barley (467 g/kg), wheat (200 g/kg) and soybean meal (270 g/kg). Furthermore, the bioavailability of zinc obtained from the same source may differ due to the presence of contaminating materials such as lead, iron or calcium oxide (Poulson, 1995). A further factor affecting the bioavailability among ZnO sources are the processing methods and the resultant temperatures to which ZnO is exposed. For example, the Waclz process reaches 1,200\u00b0C (Edwards and Baker, 1999); any temperatures either below or above this will affect bioavailability. Moreover, in a study conducted by Mavromichalis et aL (2000) where only relatively small ZnO responses were observed, and the responses between 2 different ZnO sources were the same, it was suggested that this may be attributed 77 Chapter 4 to the variability inherent in trials initiated immediately alter weaning. Indeed, Carlson el a!. (1999) indicated that pigs need to be fed ZnO-supplemented diets for at least 2 weeks post- weaning for any growth-promoting effects to become apparent, further implying that at least a1 week priming (or preloading) period may be required for clear ZnO responses to become manifest (Mavromichalis ei al., 2000). The mode of action for the enhanced growth observed when wcanling piglets arc fed pharmacological concentrations of Zn has not yet been fully elucidated. One proposed mechanism concerns the protein metallothionein (MT), which is involved in maintaining Zn homeostasis (Richards and Cousins, 1975; Menard et al., 1981), and alteration of intestinal morphology (Hampson, 1986) that may enhance nutrient absorption. MT regulates dietary Zn absorption by binding dietary Zn in the intestine. Excess Zn-MT complex is not absorbed and is later sloughed off in the epithelial cells (Cousins, 1985). Zn transported into the plasma is deposited in the liver, where MT functions in its release and storage (Carlson el al., 1999). MT may operate in conjunction with zinc transporters but, at present, there is no evidence to support this. Furthermore, hepatic and intestinal MT synthesis is stimulated by dietary zinc supplementation (Krebs, 2000). Conversely, Evans et a!. (1979) concluded that Zn homeostasis is maintained by the secretion of Zn into the intestinal lumen rather than by the control of Zn absorption. MT was not considered an important regulator of the absorption process. However, Starchor el al. (1980) suggested that although conflicting data exists concerning the role of MT in Zn metabolism, MT does protect against heavy metal toxicity. Zinc is known to possess antimicrobial properties. ZnO-bascd ointments arc routinely used in human medicine and ZnO has been shown to enhance wound healing (Prasad, 1983), for example to treat and prevent footrot in sheep. In pigs, high dietary ZnO supplementation has been associated with reduced bacterial translocation from the small intestine to the ilcal mesenteric lymph node (Huang ct aL, 1999), and with improved homogeneity and stability in intestinal coliform populations (Katouli ct al., 1999). Furthermore, Gram-positive bacteria are most susceptible to ZnO, whereas Gram-negative bacteria and streptococci are not usually inhibited by high ZnO concentrations (Mavromichalis et a!., 2000). Katouli et a!. (1999) demonstrated that individual pigs carry a number of transient and resident coliforms. Furthermore, some of the resident phenotypes within an animal appeared 78 Chapter 4 during the first week of life, while others appeared at later stages of the suckling period. The majority of the resident coliforms were present in several pigs, suggesting that they possessed the ability to colonise the gut, and persist for a prolonged period within the intestine. Katouli et al. (1999), also demonstrated that coliform colonisation of pigs is both strain- and host- speciGc as very few pigs were colonised with the same resident strain. Additionally, Katouli el al. (1999) reported that the majority of resident coliforms in both control and ZnO- supplemented groups were not isolated in samples obtained immediately post-weaning (i. e. 2 days post-weaning), possibly because their numbers in the faecal samples were below detectable levels. This is supported by the fact that most of them appeared again in succeeding samples. The growth-promoting effect of dietary antibiotic supplementation is well documented (e. g. Visek, 1978). There is also substantial evidence within the literature implicating an involvement of the intestinal bacterial population in this growth promotion, and proposed mechanisms associated with antibiotic supplementation include; a) that pathogens responsible for mild and subclinical infections are suppressed, b) the bacterial production of growth-depressing toxins is reduced, c) that bacterial destruction and utilisation of essential nutrients is reduced (Francois, 1962; Visek, 1978) and d) a beneficial shift in intestinal bacteria metabolism is created (Visck, 1978; Vcrvacke et al.. 1979). Specifically, this beneficial shift is explained by the detoxification and / or excretion of metabolites. For example, the anaerobic bacterial degradation of tyrosine and tryptophan results in the production of several and (p-cresol). Based on the excreted form ofp-cresol (Spoelstra, 1978; Kao et al., 1979 as cited by Yokoyama et al., 1982), it is thought that the pig utilises uridinc diphosphatc-glucuronic acid (derived from glucose in the uronic acid pathway), to form the glucuronide conjugate of phenolics before their excretion. Therefore, a decrease in intestinal p-crcsol production by antibiotics would decrease the glucose and ATP necessary for the detoxification and excretion of this bacterial metabolite, thus allowing more energy to be directed towards growth by the host animal. 79 Chapter 4 4.2 AIMS To determine the effects of feeding 4 diets to piglets on gut physiology and microflora characteristics (numbers and ratios of specific species (including coliforms, and lactobacilli)), mineral status and performance characteristics between 7.5 and 20 kg live-weight; to evaluate the potential interactive or additive effects of growth-promotional levels of Zn and avilamycin on wcanling pig performance. It is hypothcsiscd that dietary Zn and/or antibiotic addition will beneficially effect small intestinal structure post-weaning, and enhance the population of lactobacilli. Such effects will result in enhanced growth performance post- weaning. 4.3 METHODS 4.3.1 Animals and housing Thirty-six entire male piglets (commercial hybrid white genotype) obtained from a local multiplier herd, weaned at 28 \u00b11 days of age (7.5 kg live-weight) were selected. The piglets were individually housed in pens with 1 m2 slatted floor space/pcn and partitions allowing visual, olfactory and limited tactile contact between adjacent pens. Four piglets were slaughtered on day 0 (weaning day), which corresponds to the start of the trial, and provide baseline data to compare with the remaining animals. 4.3.2 Diets A single-stage trial diet programme was used based on Provimi Ltd 'Multiwcan' diet. Diets are based upon identical formulations, but diets 2,3 and 4 contained the following supplemcnts: Diet I No supplement; Conventional Starter Diet Diet 2+ The basal diet contained 140 ppm Zn that meets the requirements for a pig of this age. Additionally, the above dietary supplements were not added to the basal ration at the expense of another constituent, but as a supplement to the basal ration. One of the four diets was fed 80 Chaptcr 4 to 8 piglets over an experimental period of 14 days. All 4 diets comprised the sane raw ingredients as shown in Table 4.1. Table 4.1: Diet specification (refer to table 2.1 for chemical composition) Ingredient Inclusion (g/kg) Cooked cereals 497.6 Oilseeds 173.0 Fish Products 87.0 Whey 215.5 Oils & Fats 12.0 Vitamins & Minerals 15.0 Amino Acids 2.9 4.3.3 Post-mortem procedure On the day of weaning (day 0; n= 4), and on days 2,4,6 and 14 (n = 8; 2 piglets from each of the 4 experimental diets), piglets were slaughtered and samples of the small intestine at sites proportionately 0.25,0.50 and 0.75 along the length of the small intestine were taken for subsequent histological examination. The slaughter, post-mortem procedure and preparation of small intestinal samples for measurement of villus height, width and crypt depth have been described previously in section 2.4. In addition, a peripheral blood sample was taken and frozen at -80 \u00b0C for subsequent blood urea nitrogen (BUN) analysis. The liver and kidney were also removed, weighed and frozen at -80 \u00b0C for subsequent mineral analysis. Digesta samples from the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, colon and rectum were immediately removed for microbiological enumeration and pH analysis of Heal digesta samples were untaken as described in sections 2.5 and 2.8 respectively. 81 Chapter 4 4.4 MICROBIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS Faccal swabs were collected from all pigs every second day throughout the experimental period. Coliform and lactobacilli counts were determined. Serial dilutions of digcsta samples were plated on selective media as given in section 2.8.5 and incubated appropriately. Following incubation, the colonies were identified and counted as described in section 2.8. 4.5 MINERAL ANALYSIS Tissue samples were analysed for zinc concentration by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS). Blood samples underwent analysis for urea nitrogen content (BUN) by use of a Sigma diagnostic kit combined with spcctrophotomctry (Appendix 3). 4.6 STATISTICAL ANALYSES Statistical analyses were undertaken as described previously in section 2.12. Tissue analyses for zinc concentration were also assessed using a2 factor completely randomised split-plot analysis of variance, with slaughter day as the main-plot factor and sample as the sub-plot factor. The following treatment structures were employed (where sample refers either to the liver or kidney sample): Zn*Ab*POL(Slaughtcr Day; 2)*Samplc BVR / (Zn*Ab*Slaughter Day*Samplc) BVR = Baseline versus the rest POL = Polynomial function 4.7. RESULTS 4.7.1 Gut morphology Gut morphology data obtained for baseline animals (animals slaughtered on day zero) are presented in table 4.2. Villus height (VII; P<0.001; s. e. d = 36.76), villus width (VW; P=0.006; s. e. d = 4.07) and crypt depth (CD; P=0.008; s. c. d 15.92) increased significantly with advancing distance along the small intestine from proportionately 0.25 to 0.50 from the gastric pylorus to the ileo-caccal valve. Measurements taken at 0.75 along the intestine were lower than those taken at 0.25 along the small intestine. A similar trend was also observed for days 2,4,6 and 14 across all dietary treatments. 82 CJ: aptrr 4 Analysis of variance established that ileal VII increased significantly over time for all dietary treatments; a significant linear effect was established even after the effect of slaughter weight was taken into account (P=0.184; 0.045 (L); Tables 4.3 and 4.4). No significant differences due to dietary antibiotic (avilamycin) or zinc were established. Mean VII at day 2 was lower than the mean baseline values (day 0= weaning) for all dietary treatments indicating that a degree of villus atrophy occurred between days 0 and 2. Although not significant, this villus atrophy continued until day 4 for those animals fed the control diet. Significant differences with respect to BVR (P=0.015) and region (P-<0.001) were also evident with VII generally declining with increasing distance along the small intestine from the gastric pylorus to the ileo-caecal valve. Although not significant, VW tended to increase over time for all dietary groups (P=O. 115 (Q); Tables 4.5 and 4.6). Analysis revealed no significant differences in relation to dietary treatment, intestinal region, or BVR. No significant relationships between diet and day, BVR and day, or BVR and diet were found. There was a strong trend (P=0.088) for CD to increase throughout the experimental period (Tables 4.7 and 4.8). The mean CD was similar for all 4 dietary treatments and no significant differences with respect to BVR were determined. No significant correlations between diet and day, or BVR and diet were observed. CD at a distance of 0.50 along the length of the intestine tended to be greater than those at 0.25 or 0.75 (P=0.019), indicating a significant quadratic effect over time (P=0.047). There was also a strong trend towards a correlation between BVR and day (P=0.077), with CD increasing over time in comparison to the mean baseline measurement of 1931tm. Analysis determined no significant differences between dietary treatment, or day, and no significant relationships between diet and day, IIVR and day or BVR and diet with respect to villus height to crypt depth (V11: CD) ratio (Tables 4.9 and 4.10). A significant difference between intestinal region (P<0.001) was found, with the V11: CD ratio at the proximal region of the small intestine (SI) being greatest (in terms of overall mean). Baseline animals also displayed VH: CD ratio values that were significantly different to the remainder of the experimental animals (P=0.045). 83 1- v It C 0 N ed 10 C O v O H H .. w N w a w a\u00fd oA O O 0 E 0 \u00fc N .G C\u00fd E\"9 Co iV O a I- \u00f6 . - \u00f6 O d ao \u00f6 0 > m \u00b0 1D 1n \u00fd`\" N tD O Yl 0. v ci c 1 0 0 0 0 > m a\u00ba co C! 11 Co -e d Yf a (D r- r, 4 ccoo Co a c\u00fd \u00f6 \u00f6 \u00f6 CL to 1- O 0 N O Co v- a \u00d6 \u00d6 \u00d6 \u00d6 G\u00fd \u00fd?

The mean baseline value of 8.5 cfu /g was higher than those obtained from the other experimental animals on most days (mean values; IIVR*day; P=0.003). No significant differences due to dietary treatment, or significant relationships between diet and day, or IIVR and diet were evident. Conversely, mean intestinal lactobacilli counts increased significantly (P=0.002) throughout the experimental period (Tables 4.14 and 4.1$). No significant differences due to diet, or significant diet and day interactions were determined. As observed with coliforms, the mean number of lactobacilli also increased significantly (P=<0.001) along the length of the intestine. The lactobacilli count for the baseline animals was higher (mean; 9.3 cfu / g; P-0.002) than those obtained from animals on day 2. A significant relationship between BVR and diet (P=0.001), but none between BVR and day was apparent. Intestinal lactobacilli to colifonm ratio increased throughout the experimental period for all treatment groups (P = 0.026; 0.013 (L); 0.062 (Q); Tables 4.16 and represents the increased lactobacilli and declining coliform counts throughout the 14-day experimental period. No significant differences due to diet, and sample site or their interactions were evident. There was however, a significant correlation between BVR and day (P = 0.011). As expected, faecal coliform counts followed a similar pattern to intestinal coliform numbers, and declined significantly throughout the experimental period (P=<0.001; Tables 4.18 and 4.19). The baseline value of 6.2 log cfu / swab was the highest number of coliforms obtained throughout the experiment (P=<O. 001). Significant diet and day (P=0.019), and BVR and day (P=<0.001) relationships, but no significant BVR and diet correlations were found. Faecal lactobacilli counts displayed minimal variation throughout the experimental period (P=0.272; Tables 4.20 and 4.21). Significant differences in relation to dietary treatment (P= 91 Chapter 4 0.029) were observed; those animals offered diet 2 (ZnO) achieved the lowest average count of 5.0 and the control diet (diet 1) the highest of 5.8 log cfu / swab. No significant diet and day, or BVR and day relationships were found. Baseline counts were significantly different (P=0.016) from the rest of the animals, and a significant correlation between BVR and diet (P=0.042) was also determined. Faecal lactobacilli to coliform ratios increased significantly (P=<0.001; <0.001 (L); 0.025 (Q)) over time (Tables 4.22 and 4.23). A significant relationship between antibiotic and day (P = <0.001; <0.001 (L)) was evident together with significant differences between BVR (P=0.003), and correlations between BVR and antibiotic (P=0.012), and BVR and day (P=<0.001). heal pll remained relatively constant throughout the experimental period with the range being p11 6.2 to 7.0 (Tables 4.24 and 4.25). No significant differences due to dietary treatment or BVR, or relationship between diet and day, BVR and day, or BVR and diet were determined.

Although highly variable, as expected, feed intake increased significantly throughout the experimental period (P=<0.001), and there was a significant relationship between diet and day (P=0.007 and 0.088 for avilamycin and ZnO respectively) in relation to DLWG. Feed conversion ratio (FCR; Table 4.28) was also variable throughout the experimental period, and was due in part, to the extremely low and often zero feed intakes immediately post-weaning. The times taken for each piglet to take food and water after weaning were also recorded (data not shown). There was huge variation between the 32 piglets, with time to first feed varying between 35 min to greater than 6 hours (2 piglets), and time to first water varying between 3h 15 min to greater than 6 hours (1 piglet). 4.7.4 Mineral analyses A significant temporal difference (P=0.005) with respect to tissue zinc concentrations was determined, with the concentration tending to increase over time (Tables 4.29 and 4.30). There was also a highly significant difference (P<0.001) between dietary treatment on Zn tissue concentration with diets 2 (ZnO) and 4 (ZnO and avilamycin) having the highest overall mean values of 311.2 and 247.9 pg /g for liver tissue respectively, compared to an average value of approximately 5.8 for diets I (control) and 3 (avilamycin). However, this response was not observed for the kidney. Although kidney Zn concentration did tend to increase over time, diet I had the highest values of 43.2 jig /g and diet 3 the lowest of 19.2 pg / g. Significant relationships between day and Zn (P=<0.001), BVR and day (P=0.002), and BVR and Zn (P-<0.001) were also determined with respect to tissue Zn concentration. Liver Zn concentrations were 9 and 8 fold greater than the baseline values for diets 2 (ZnO) and 4 (ZnO + avil) respectively on day 14.

Although there was no significant difference between the 4 dietary treatments, such a limited duration of villus atrophy is nonetheless interesting. Evidence suggests that villus atrophy commonly occurs for longer periods. For example, Ilampson (1986) observed that villus height decreased to 75% pre-weaning values within 24 hours of weaning at 21 days. Subsequent reductions in villus height were smaller but continued to decline until the fifth day post-weaning, at which point villus height at most sites along the gut was 50% of the initial weaning value. In the present study the maximum decline in villus height was 43% (in comparison to baseline values) and had occurred by day 2 post-weaning. Iiampson (1986) reported that this loss of villus height was most pronounced proximally, whilst enhanced crypt depth occurred greatest distally. This pattern was not replicated in the present study, since the greatest villus atrophy occurred medially, crypt deepening (after day 2) occurred principally in both the medial and distal regions (P=0.019). Furthermore, in the current study there was no significant effect of dietary treatment on crypt depth, although those fed diets 2, 3, and 4 displayed a similar pattern of a reduction in crypt depth between day 0 (baseline values) and day 2, followed by an increase in (deepening) crypt depth between days 2 and 4. This is supported by findings of Mavromichalis et al. (2000), who reported no consistent positive effect of dietary ZnO supplementation on villus height, width or crypt depth. Moreover, Mavromichalis et al. (2000) also concluded that ZnO supplementation does not appear to ameliorate the negative effects of post-weaning dry diets on intestinal structure. Carlson et al. (1999), suggested that the induction of metallothionein (MT) in erythrocytes might be responsible for the enhanced growth performance due to pharmacological concentrations of Zn. As MT is involved in zinc homeostasis at both the intestinal and systemic level, its expression is directly affected by dietary Zn concentration (Menard et a!., 1981; Cousins, 1985). As such, Carlson el a!. (1999) proposed that since Zn has a role in cell RNA and DNA proliferation, constantly elevated levels of Zn in the cntcrocytc as a consequence of up-regulation of MT (Starcher et a!., 1980) may improve intestinal health. However, such beneficial effects were not observed in the present study, nor in that of Mavromichalis et a!. (2000), suggesting that the ingestion of elevated dietary ZnO concentrations may therefore exert either luminal or systemic effects (Mavromichalis et a!., 106 C/: aptcr 4 2000). A further benefit proposed by Prasad (1983) from the ingestion of elevated dictary zinc concentrations is the prevention of liver damage by free radicals. Intestinal coliform numbers declined over time, but increased along the length of the small intestine from the duodenum through to the colon. As expected, this pattern was also displayed in the faecal swab enumerations. This is in agreement with findings of Katouli et al. (1999) who reported a high number of coliforms at the early stage of the suckling period (coliforms are among the earliest groups of bacteria colonising the gut after birth (Drasar and Barrow 1985)), but decreased as the animals aged. Furthermore, Katouli et al. (1999) also reported that dietary ZnO supplementation helped to maintain the stability of the intestinal microflora and the diversity of coliforms during the first two weeks post-weaning, however no effect on the coliform population size in post-weaned pigs was reported. A highly diverse bacterial flora is thought to be a major factor influencing the stability of the intestinal micro- ecosystem (Kuhn et al., 1993; Kuhn et al., 1996). Therefore, Katouli et al. (1999) concluded that ZnO supplementation helped to maintain the stability of the intestinal flora in weaned pigs, hence preserving the protective ability of the flora which would otherwise be lost at weaning. Furthermore, maintaining the high diversity of coliforms may enhance competition for colonisation sites with diarrhoegenic or pathogenic strains (Barrow, 1980; 1lentges, Kuhn et al., 1993; Katouli et al., 1994). Melin et al. (2001) conducted a study where piglets were weaned at 35 days of age and fed either a conventional or ZnO (2500 ppm) supplemented diet for 28 days post-weaning, and reported no differences between the groups in the of coliforms, entcrococci or Clostridiun: perfringens excreted /g decrease in diversity of the faccal flora post-weaning was more pronounced and of longer duration in the control animals compared with the ZnO treated pigs. This reduction in faecal coliform diversity displayed by the ZnO treated pigs indicates a positive effect on the stability of the enteric flora by supplementation with 2500 ppm ZnO from weaning. However, the authors reported that this effect was limited to the initial 2 weeks post-weaning, and there is also evidence of toxicity after oral exposure of high concentrations of ZnO (Jensen-Waern et al., 1998), which again limits the period for which ZnO supplemented diets should be fed). 107 Chapter 4 Conversely, lactobacilli numbers increased throughout the experimental period, and again there was no significant dietary effect, although numbers increased along the length of the intestine. Interestingly, faecal swabs enumerated for lactobacilli displayed no significant temporal effect, whilst there was a significant dietary effect with diet 2 (ZnO) achieving the lowest average lactobacilli count. Although faecal swab determinations are useful indicators of enteric microbial load, this is a somewhat retrospective technique, and conditions in the rectum are vastly different in comparison to other sectors of the intestine. Plausible explanations for this discrepancy between faecal and intestinal flora include the divergence of the ingesta and density of bacteria in different parts (and microenvironments) of the intestine. This is in contrast to that reported by Zone et al. (2001) who compared coliform populations collected from different sites of the intestinal tract and concluded that fingerprinting of the rectal flora is a relevant method to mirror enteric microflora since microbial diversity was similar in all intestinal segments investigated. This is also supported by Roberfroid et al. (1995). However, it should also be noted that the animals utilised in the study of Zoric ct al. (2001), were not weaned until 35 days of age and samples were collected and analysed at day 63 (28 days post-weaning). Hence, these animals were much older than those of the present study, and as such are more likely to contain a stable intestinal microflora. Furthermore, a study conducted by Hogberg ct al. (2001), employing grower pigs, demonstrated a high correlation between the rectal flora and the flora of the intestine, when a standard diet was fed. However, in the same study, Hogberg et al. (2001) reported that dietary manipulation (alteration of NSP content) rendered the diversity of enteric coliform flora in the rectum different from the flora at the ileo-caecal sampling site. This suggests limitations in the general use of rectal flora to describe the flora in the intestine close to modifications in dietary composition (Ilogberg et al., 2001). It is important to note that no correlation between bacterial counts and intestinal p1I was evident. One may expect to find lower coliform numbers at lower p1l values, whereas lactic acid bacteria being more p11 tolerant would be less affected. Treatment differences for DLWG were not significant, and as expected, the highest DLWGs were achieved on day 14. Several titration studies have indicated that pharmacological doses of ZnO stimulate growth rates in pigs. For example, Smith et al. (1995b), fed up to 4,000 mg Zn/kg from ZnO from d0 to 14 post-weaning, and observed a linear increase in weight gain. A positive growth response was also reported by Le Mieux et al. (1995) by feeding 3,000 to 108 Chapter 4 6,000 mg Zn/kg from ZnO. However, other researchers have reported maximum growth responses at inclusion levels below these. For example, Hill et al. (1999), performed a large- scale 28 d study comprising 1069 weaned pigs (11 to 25d of age) and reported a maximal growth performance response at 2,000 mg Zn/kg from ZnO. In the present study, the ZnO supplemented group also displayed the highest level of feed intake on day 14. However, this was not significant, so this enhanced feed intake cannot explain the increased DLWG. There is also evidence of a small (although non-significant) additive effect of ZnO and avilamycin on DLWG. Although the literature suggests that weight gain responses to ZnO supplementation are usually positive, feed intake and FCR responses have been variable. For example, Mavromichalis et a!. (2000), observed a stimulated feed intake and growth rate, but not FCR response to dietary ZnO supplementation, a finding that is in agreement with some studies (Hahn and Baker, 1993; Hill et a!., 1999), but not with others (Carlson, 1995; Poulsen, 1995; Smith et a!., 1997; Carlson et al., 1999). Growth promoting properties of Zn could be explained in part, by studies that concentrate on the impact of dietary Zn deficiency. The principal symptom of zinc deficiency is an inhibition of growth, which is manifested by reduced food intake (MacDonald, 2000). In a study with rats, Giugliano and Millward (1984) reported that reduced food intake and diminished growth occurs within 4-5 days of feeding a Zn-inadequate diet. This impaired growth could be explained by an energy deficit associated with poor feed intakes. However, a reduced energy intake is unlikely to be the factor which limits growth, as force-feeding a Zn-depleted diet to rats failed to improved growth and exacerbated the clinical symptoms of the deficiency (Park et al., 1986). Hence, food intake and growth appear to be regulated by Zn through independent, although well coordinated, mechanisms. When Zn is inadequate to maintain growth or cellular metabolism, reduced food intake may be a protective mechanism to allow survival. The failure to correct growth with increased food intake suggests that growth is the first limiting role for Zn. Thus, it appears logical to propose that supplementing the diet with Zn will promote growth. Evidence concerning the additive effects of mineral and antibiotic addition arc equivocal. For example, Stahly et al. (1980), demonstrated that single additions of copper, chlortetracycline (CTC) or virginamycin (VIR) improved (P<0.05) daily gains by and 17% respectively, and FCRs by 5.1,8.9 and 8.2% respectively compared to animals fed the unsupplemented, 109 Cliaptcr 4 control diets throughout the post-weaning period. Moreover, dietary inclusion of both copper and an antibiotic (CTC or VIR) further improved daily gains (P<0.05) by 10 to 11%, and FCRs by 2 to 5% compared with the single inclusion of each antimicrobial agent. This identifies an additive effect between copper and these antimicrobial agents. This work further signifies that the growth response observed with CTC and VIR-supplemented diets was a result of both an elevated feed intake, and improved efficiency of feed conversion (Stahly cl al., 1980). In contrast, the enhanced growth observed with copper supplemented diets alone appears to be merely a function of increased feed intake. The fact that these responses appeared to be additive regardless of whether a broad-spectrum antibiotic (CTC) or a Gram- positive antibiotic (VIR) is used suggests that: 1. Copper has a different bacterial spectrum from CTC or VIR or 2. Copper possesses a different mode of action than do the antibiotics used in this study (Stahly el al., 1980). Since no significant additive response was observed in the current study, it could be hypothesised that zinc and avilamycin possess similar modes of action. In the present study, average growth performance was enhanced by 31,42 and 39% for diets 2,3, and 4 respectively when compared to the control animals. FCR data should be interpreted with caution, due to the high variability in feed intake levels observed among individuals, the initial 2 days post-weaning are often accompanied by low or even zero feed intakes which can result in weight stasis or even loss. In the current study, there were no significant dietary effects on FCR. This is in contrast to findings of Yokoyama et a!. (1982) who reported enhanced growth performance in post-weaned pigs fed antibiotic supplemented diets. The authors postulated that intestinal p-cresol production may be responsible for a growth depressing effect in the weaner pig, and that dietary antibiotic supplementation could be promoting growth by inhibiting the bacterial production of this metabolite. A reduction in p-cresol production would conserve glucose and ATP that is utilised in the detoxification process prior to its excretion from the body (Yokoyama et al., 1982). Dilute p-crcsol solutions have been shown to inhibit the growth and metabolism of Lactobacillus acidophilus (Dreizen and Spies, 1948 as cited by Yokoyama et a!., 1982). This is supported by work conducted by Bernhart and Zilliken (1958) as cited by Yokoyama et al., (1982), who illustrated an inverse relationship between the urinary excretion of volatile phenols (i. e. 110 Chaptrr 4 phenol and p-cresol) and the weight gain of rats fed 10% tyrosine in a sucrose diet. Supplementing the diet with chlortetracycline or substituting lactose in place of sucrose decreased the urinary excretion of the volatile phenols and alleviated the growth depression. However, Wisman et al. (1957) and Schmidt et al. (1949) as cited by Yokoyama et a!. (1982), found no relationship between the production of volatile phenolic and aromatic metabolites and the growth promotion induced by dietary antibiotic supplementation. A further proposed effect of dietary antibiotic supplementation is an improvement in the efficiency of energy utilisation (Francois, 1962). For example, Vcrvackc et al. (1979) suggested that dietary antibiotics conserve glucose through reduced organic acid production by intestinal bacteria, enabling more energy to be partitioned towards growth. It has also been hypothesised that dietary antibiotics suppress the intestinal bacteria population, resulting in a reduced mass and turnover rate of the intestinal mucosal cells, thus conserving energy necessary to maintain the tissue Visek (1978). Alternatively dietary antibiotics may change the metabolism of intestinal microbes rather than the relative numbers of each species, although the exact mode of action will be specific to each class of antibiotic. O'Quinn et al. (1997) proposed that ZnO possessed no additive or synergistic actions with that of antimicrobial agents. This supports the findings of the present study. however, in the study of O'Quinn et al. (1997), the pigs were between 12 and 15 d of age, and reared under high health conditions, and evidence suggests that the greatest responses arc observed with animals produced in low health (or disease challenged) and low management environments. Furthermore, Mahan et al. (2000) reported synergistic growth responses to a combination of 1,500 mg Zn/kg from ZnO and the antimicrobial carbadox. Liver Zn concentrations reflected both dietary Zn supplementation and the duration that the Zn was fed. Tissue Zn concentrations increased over time with the highest concentrations being reached on day 14 for all dietary treatments. As expected the mean Zn concentration was highest for animals fed the ZnO (diet 2) and ZnO + avilamycin diets (diet 4). The mean liver Zn concentration for animals fed diet 2 was over 5 times greater than that for control animals. In contrast, mean kidney Zn concentration for animals fed diet 2 was 1.5 times greater than the control animals. This higher concentration of Zn in the liver is related to the fact that the liver acts as a storage organ for Zn (Carlson et al., 1999). Furthermore, Poulson and Larsen (1995) reported that the kidneys and (or) gastrointestinal tract are involved in Chanter 4 homeostatic regulation that is supported by findings of Carlson ct al, (1999). I'or example, Carlson et al. (1999) reported that in pigs fed 3000 ppm Zn for 28 days post-wcaning, tile kidney Zn concentration plateaued on approximately day 14 of the study representing a potential renal homeostatic role. The tissue Zn concentrations determined in this study were slightly higher than those obtained by Carlson et al. (1999). These authors reported an approximate 4-fold increase in liver Zn concentration in comparison to baseline animals and only a 1.4 fold increase for kidney concentrations. These differences could be due to a number of factors, for example, the study of Carlson et aL (1999) was conducted in the States, employing a different genotype of pig. Furthermore, the diets contained spray-dried animal plasma, fishmeal and dried skim milk all of which may contain significant amounts of Zn. For example, Hahn and Baker (1993) reported plasma zinc levels of between 0.85 and 1.29 mg /L for pigs fed the basal diet (containing 125 ppm Zn). In order to quantify these values somewhat, 3,000 ppm supplemental Zn achieved plasma Zn concentrations of between 1.30 and 2.78 from ZnO and ZnSO4 sources respectively. Additionally, dietary spray-dried animal plasma has been reported to enhance daily gains and efficiency of feed utilisation (Stahly, 1996). The piglets were also group housed. The kidney Zn concentrations determined for animals fed diets I and 3 (i. e. diets containing no supplemental Zn) are less than those obtained from animals fed the Zn-supplemented diets (diets 2 and 4). However, it is noteworthy, that they are of a relatively large magnitude in comparison to those from diets 2 and 4. Additionally, liver Zn concentrations obtained from animals fed diets 1 and 3 were almost identical and of a much lower order than those obtained from animals fed diets 2 and 4. These values are however, within the range of those reported by Carlson et a!. (1999); between 28.4 and 46.6 tg/g for traditionally- (24.5 d of age) and early-weaned (11.5 d of age) pigs respectively. Furthermore, in the study of Carlson et a!. (1999), mean kidney Zn concentrations were only modified to 17.4 and 25.6 tg/g for traditionally- and early-weaned pigs respectively after being fed 3,000 ppm supplemental Zn for a period of 2-weeks. Such modest changes in kidney Zn concentration arc also supported by data of Pejsak et al. (1998). In the current study, all samples were analysed in triplicate and in a randomised manner in order to minimise any effects due to experimental technique or contamination. That is, a single run contained samples from both liver and kidney tissues, from animals of different ages and diets. As expected, kidney Zn concentration increased throughout the experiment. This could be related to the increasing feed intake levels, which 112 Chaptcr 4 would also result in a greater intake of Zn. Since it is known that the kidney is involved in Zn homeostasis, it follows that any excess Zn that is to be eliminated from the body (via the urine and faeces) would have to pass through the kidneys that may account for the enhanced Zn concentrations reported. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels were not affected by dietary treatment nor did they change over time. Urea is the principal end product of nitrogen metabolism in mammals, and constitutes the largest fraction of the non-protein nitrogen component of the blood, and is produced in the liver and excreted through the kidneys in the urine. Consequently, the circulating levels of urea depend upon protein (and hence amino acid) intake, protein metabolism and kidney function. No dietary effects on BUN levels indicates that all 4 diets were providing adequate amino acids and hence protein to meet the piglets' requirements. This further suggests that all animals were achieving adequate total feed intake levels. In the present study, no incidence of scouring was observed in any treatment group. As such the effects of ZnO and/or antibiotic treatment on the incidence of scours could not be investigated. However, in a study conducted by Schell and Kornegay (1996), scouring was only observed in control pigs, and the authors suggested that the feeding of high concentrations of Zn (3,000 ppm ZnO) might reduce scouring in weanling pigs. In conclusion, very limited effects of ZnO and avilamycin supplementation were observed, with no significant modifications of intestinal morphology or the microflora species monitored post-weaning. It should however be noted that the gut ecosystem is extremely complex, containing at least 700 species, and effects on, or interactions with, other microf ora species are possible. Although supplemental ZnO may stimulate feed intake, any enhanced growth is not solely a function of increased voluntary feed intake (Carlson et al. 1999). Further research is required to elucidate the mechanism for any feed intake response; certainly it is difficult to identify cause and effect, and the growth-promoting efficacy of ZnO. Moreover, environmental aspects of spreading faeces with a high content of ZnO must also be considered. Proposed legislation is also suggesting a ban on the inclusion of zinc oxide at pharmacological levels (3.1 kg/tonne) in the diets of post-weaned piglets by 2006. 113 Chaptcr 4 4.9 FUTURE WORK/ IMPROVEMENTS Although the study reported in this chapter was conducted at the time using the most appropriate techniques and methods, the results from this study have highlighted a number of areas where further work or modifications to the protocol could be employed. An inverse relationship between absorption and dietary Zn intake has been reported in animal models (Jackson et al., 1981; Coppen and Davies, 1987). However, at extremely high intakes, absorption efficiency was found to be no longer affected and Zn homeostasis was regulated principally by excretion. Therefore, it would be interesting to measure the Zn content of faeces and/or urine. However, it must also be borne in mind that faeces and urine would also contain endogenously secreted Zn that has been excreted from the body. However, such as procedure would involve a balance study and the collection of faeces / urine may require a catheter which would be very difficult for weaner pigs due to their smaller size and the associated ethical implications. Although this would provide an indication as to the amount of dietary Zn being absorbed/retained, the endogenous Zn would still need to be quantified. Since considerable Zn can be stored in the bones, and it has been suggested that this pool can be mobilised (Hahn and Baker, 1993; Smith el al., 1995b; Carlson el al., 1999), it would be interesting to determine the Zn content of bones. Furthermore, the retention of mineral elements (i. e. Zn) in proportion to N retention may be an important indicator of physiological requirement, storage or deposition (Larsen and Poulson, 1994). Alkaline phosphatase activity also provides an indication of the physiological Zn status and can be easily determined. 114 CHAPTER 5A: TILE EFFECTS OF DIETARY YEAST-BASED NUCLEOTIDE SUPPLEMENTATION ON POST-WEANING PIGLETS 5A. 1 INTRODUCTION The post-weaning growth check still causes considerable economic losses in pig production. Some of the problems in susceptibility to disease have been associated with problems concerning immunoregulation. For example, immaturity of the neonatal immune system, stress-associated immunosupprcssion and pathogen-induced immunosuppression have all been linked to increased disease susceptibility throughout the post-weaning period. Thus there exists an inherent need to provide complementary or alternative therapeutic strategies to alleviate these problems. The removal of the 4 remaining in-feed antibiotics in 2006 within the European Union will further exacerbate the necessity for alternative therapies Modern pig production systems are such that the spread of infectious agents is both widespread and relatively straightforward. Consequently a high proportion of animals encounter both clinical and subclinical infections. Infections have a strong negative impact on growth performance even when they arc sub-clinical (Beisel, 1988), and reduction of infections, for example by specific pathogen free (SPF) conditions, have been reported to increase weight gains by 20 - 40% (Young cl al., 1959; Caldwell ct al., 1961). Since the deleterious effects of microorganisms arc regulated by the immune system, it follows that the host's immune capacity should form an important consideration when improving health and performance of pigs reared under conventional systems. Such modern systems generally result in the exposure of the animals to a number of infectious agents concurrently with other `stressors'. Such managerial `stressors' may include for example, weaning (and the associated mixing and moving etc. ), and transportation (particularly in multi-site production systems), which can affect the host's immune defence system. Weaning pigs at a young age can result in a number of problems, for example passive antibody-mediated immunity, derived from colostral immunoglobulins, reaches a maximum in the pig at 24 to 36 h of age and then decreases logarithmically to very low levels when approximately 3 weeks-old (Speer et a!. (1959) 115 Chaptcr SA Miller et al. (1962), Porter (1976)). This cmphasiscs the immunological vulnerability of the young pig at a time when it is exposed to a variety of different strcssors associated with weaning. Additionally, evidence suggests that a pig's decreased physiological maturity from the stress of weaning lowers antibody synthesis. A number of studies, such as Gwazdauskas et al. (1978), Hayc and Et (1979), Blccha and Kelley (1981) have provided evidence that weaning impairs antibody-mediated immunity and have suggested that weaning may compromise cellular immune function in young pigs. More specifically, Blecha et al. (1983) reported that, immediately post-weaning, piglets showed reduced ability to react to the lymphocyte mitogen PfIA administered either intradermally or when lymphocytes were cultured in vitro. Furthermore, in a study conducted by Blecha and Kelley (1981), the production of specific antibody was also reduced when sheep red blood cells were administered to piglets I day post-weaning compared to 2 weeks post- weaning. This apparent systemic immunosupprcssion has been suggested to be involved in the aetiology of post-weaning diarrhoea, since disease cannot be induced reliably in unweaned animals following a challenge by pathogenic organisms (Kcnworthy and Allen, 1966). At birth, the piglet has high cortisol levels due to the hormonal trigger for the induction of parturition, but these levels decline rapidly to normal adult levels within 5 days post- partum (McCauley and Hartmann, 1984). However, Dvorak (1972) reported high cortisol levels persisting for up to 60 days postpartum and suggested that the neonate is therefore immuno-compromised. High post-partum cortisol levels have been reported to cause reduced chemotactic and phagocytic responses in the neonatal calf (Pierce and Koster, 1980), but this has not been demonstrated in piglets. McCauley and Hartmann (1984) argued that leukocyte dynamics reflect a minimal suppression of the immune function of the newborn piglet as the neonate has a neutrophilia that persists longer than 48 hours. Furthermore, ncutrophilia of newborns is also observed in other species (Archer and Jeffcott, 1977). A colostral factor (La Motte and Eberhardt, 1976) has been identified which promotes neutrophilia in suckling calves, but this has not yet been demonstrated in sows' milk. Neutrophils are powerful effector cells in a cytotoxic response dependent on specific antibodies (antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity). The ncutrophilia observed shortly after birth, together with the specific antibody present in colostrums, may be important defence mechanisms (Zarkowcr ct al., 1982) for the unprimcd neonate. (Chcmoforma Ltd, ycast-bascd nuclcotide source, consists of a biologically active complex of metabolites of nucleotide metabolism with pyrimidines being the most important item among them. Ascogcn is completed by some additional products such as organic acids of the citric and aspartic acid cycle, vitamins and trace elements. Thcrmolyscd dried yeasts serve as a carrier of this complex (Adamck, 1994), which explains why this product is frequently referred to as a 'yeast-based nucleotide source'. Studies in both infants and animal models suggest that dietary nuclcotidcs have significant effects on the immune and gastrointestinal systems (sec Carver, 1999). It has been suggested that under conditions of limited nucleotide intake, rapid growth or certain disease challenges, dietary (or pre-formed) nucleotide may spare the cost of de novo nucleotide synthesis and optimise the metabolic function of rapidly dividing tissues such as those of the gastrointestinal and immune systems. Furthermore, in addition to serving as nucleic acid precursors, nucleotides play roles as intercellular and intracellular biological mediators (Carver, 1999). More specifically, in laboratory animal studies, supplemental dietary nucleosides and nucleotides have been shown to result in optimal growth and maturation of the gut (Nunez et A. 1990; Uauy et al., 1990), enhanced lymphocyte proliferation in response to mitogens (Rudolph et al., 1990) and improved host resistance to bacterial (Kulkarni et al., 1986; Adjci et al., 1992) and fungal (Fanslow ct al., 1988) infections. Many studies have investigated the role of dietary nucleosides and nucleotides in the maintenance of the cclluar immune system. For example, the addition of dietary nucleosides and nucleotides has been shown to increase DTII (dclaycd\"typc hypersensitivity) responses (Kulkarni el al., 1987) enhance host resistance to infection (Kulkarni ct al., 1986; Fanslow el al., 1988; Adjci et al., 1993), affected the number and function of T helper cells (Van Buren al., 1994) and enhanced the cytotoxic function of natural killer cells in BALB/c mice (Carver ct a!., 1990; Kulkarni ct al., 1994a). The role of dietary nucleotides in the functioning of the immune system has not yet been fully elucidated. However, immature lymphocytes arc not capable of synthesising purine and pyrimidinc bases required to produce nucleotides and must therefore rely on the dc novo synthesis of nucleotides by other organs such as the liver (Rudolph cl a!., 1990) or 117 Chapter SA an exogenous source such as the diet. Furthermore, evidence presented in the literature evaluating the effects of yeast-based nucleotide sources, or other immuno-potentiators in piglets, is extremely limited. Most research has concentrated on human, aquaculture and laboratory animal studies with some limited work performed with ducks. Accordingly, a study was designed to cxaminc the effects of one such immuno-potcntiator, Ascogcn, on a number of parameters as outlined below. 5A. 2 AIMS To determine the effects of feeding a conventional starter diet supplemented with a yeast- based nucleotide source (Ascogen; Chemoforma Ltd, Augst, Switzerland) to piglets on gut physiology (in terms of villus height, width and crypt depth) microllora characteristics (numbers and ratios of several coliforms, lactobacilli, and bifdobactcria), immune status (lymphocyte proliferation responses to mitogcns), and performance characteristics between 8 and 20 kg live-weight. It is postulated that dietary nucleotide- supplementation will improve small intestinal structure and enhance the ratio of beneficial microflora (lactobacilli and bifidobactcria) in the small intestine, and also enhance the host immune status post-weaning. 5A. 3 METHODS 5A. 3.1 Animals and housing Thirty-six entire male piglets (Section 2.2) were used to evaluate the experimental diets. Animals were individually housed as described previously (Section 2.2.1), and as in previous studies 4 piglets where slaughtered on day 0 (weaning day) to provide baseline data. 5A3.2 Diets A single-stage trial diet programme was used based on Provimi Ltd `Multiwcan' diet. Diets are based upon identical formulations but diet 2 was supplemented with 4g Ascogen / kg (according to the manufacturers recommended inclusion rate). Diet 1 No supplemcnt; Convcntional Startcr Diet (Control) Diet 2 Conventional Starter Diet +4g Ascogcn ! kg (Treatment) 118 Cliaplrr SA Each of the two diets was fed to 16 piglets over an experimental period of 14 days. Both diets comprised the same raw ingredients as shown in Table 5A. 1. The chemical composition of the diets used has been presented previously in Table 2.1 (section 2.3). Table 5A. 1: Diet specification Inclusion (g/kg) Ingredient Diet 1 Diet 2 Control Treatment Cooked cereals 469.8 & Fats 25.0 25.0 Vitamins & Minerals 8.1 8.1 Amino Acids 4.1 4.1 Skim Milk 10.0 10.0 Ascogen 0.0 4.0 5A. 3.3 Post-mortem procedure The experimental design has been described previously (section 2.4, and 2.5), and any modifications to this procedure are described below. On the day of weaning (day 0; n= 4), and on days 2,4,6 and 14 (n = 8; 4 piglets fed each of the experimental diets), piglets were slaughtered, and samples of small intestine taken for subsequent histological examination as described in Section 2.6. Digcsta samples were also removed for microbiological enumeration for lactobacilli, coliforms and bifidobactcria species (Section 2.8). Furthermore, a peripheral blood sample was removed for subsequent lymphocyte isolation (Section 2.9). In addition, the digcsta samples obtained from the jejunum, duodenum, ileum, colon and rectum (Sl-S5) underwent p11 analysis. 119 Chapicr 3A In addition to the faccal swabbing procedure that has been described previously (Section 2.8.2), all slaughter animals underwent faecal swabbing immediately prior to slaughter. This was to allow a comparison bctwccn intestinal and faecal microflora to be made. 5A. 4 Statistical analyses Statistical analyses were undertaken as described previously in Section 2.12. 5A. 5 RESULTS 5A. 5.1 Gut morphology Tables 5A. 2 and 5A. 3 represent villus height data. It can be clearly seen that a degree of villus atrophy occurs immediately post-weaning between days 0 and 2. Villus lengthening then occurs up to day 14 (P=<0.001; <0.001(L)), and there was also a significant correlation between BVR and day (P=<0.001). There was a significant region effect with the distal regions (0.75 proportion) of the small intestine being the shortest (P=<0.001; overall dietary mean). Significant interactions between dietary treatments over time or BVR and diet were not evident. No significant differences were determined between dietary treatment or baseline animals compared to the remainder. Determination of the percentage difference in villus height between villi isolated from baseline and the remainder of the experimental animals demonstrates that a greater degree of villus atrophy (i. e. severity and duration) occurred in animals offered the control compared with the treatment diet (Figure 5A. 1). The longer villi present in the proximal region of the small intestine decreased in height proportionately less than villi in the medial or distal domains of the gut (a decrease in height of the order 26-28% was apparent over the initial 4 days post-weaning). Villus width followed a similar pattern; there was a strong trend towards a reduction in VW between those animals slaughtered on day 0 (baseline) and the remainder of the animals (P=0.066; Tables 5A. 4 and 5A. 5). In fact, the baseline VW was only achieved by day 14 for those animals fed dietl (control) and it was never achieved by those fed diet 2 (treatment). Generally, VW increased throughout the experimental period (P=0.006; <0.001(L)), and there were significant relationships between diet and day (P=0.027; 0.074(L)), and BVR and day (P=0.01$). Villus width measurements were not significantly different with respect to diet, region of intestine or BVR diet interactions. 120 Chapter SA Small intestine crypt depth increased throughout the experimental period (112<0.001; 0.137(L); <0.001(Q)) for those animals fed diet 2 (treatment), with those fed diet I (control) following a similar pattern, but crypt depth declined between days 6 and 14 (Tables 5A. 6 and 5A. 7). As such there was a highly significant dietary effect (11=<0.001), and diet day (P=<0.001; <0.001(L); 0.003(Q)) interaction. Although not significant a trend was evident towards a region influence (P=0.093) with the medial (0.50 along the length of the small intestine) CD being deepest (overall mean) across all 3 groups (baseline, control and treatment groups). Measurements of crypt depth also determined a significant difference with respect to BVR (P=<0.001), BVR day (P=<0.001) and BVR diet (P=<0.001) interactions. Baseline animals displayed the greatest villus height to crypt depth ratio (P=<0.001; VH: CD; tables 5A. 8 and 5A. 9) Furthermore, V11: CD was greatest on day 14 for both dietary groups (P=<0.001; <0.001(L); <0.001(Q)) and those fed diet 1 (control) had a greater overall VH: CD than those fed diet 2 (treatment; P=<0.001). A significant relationship between diet and day was also evident (P=<0.001; <0.001(L); 0.001(Q)). 121 . - Itt cv II E T y r7 Q w+ it UC C G) {r r-+ U_ 10 4-r G r. + ua .C CO E-4 C E 9- M Co 0 M l N l E e e In LO (0 Co N N 9- \"- 0 N O md'ntto of N w Nc O `e O P- to 9 \u00d6 cN (0 4- co 1! ) r- 0 0 CL Ln ' 2 c )NO C) 1\".

I1). Animals offered diet 2 displayed significantly lower coliform counts (treatment; P=0.033), and total numbers decreased throughout the experimental period for both dietary groups (11=0.009; 0.002(L)). Evidence of a significant relationship between diet and day (P=0.067 (L)), IVR and day (11=0.008) and i3VR and diet (P=0.032) was also apparent. No significant differences between the baseline (n = 4) and remainder of the animals (n = 32) were identified. Intestinal lactobacilli counts were found to incrcasc between days 2 and 14 (P=0.007; 0.395 (L); 0.008 (Q); Tables 5A. 12 and 5A. 13). No significant differences with respect to baseline animals, dietary treatment or relationship between diet and day were found. Results also demonstrated enhanced lactobacilli counts along the length of the intestine (S1-S5; P=<0.001). Significant relationships between BVR and day (P=0.008) and BVR and diet (P=0.032) were also apparent. Bifdobactcria counts were similar for both dietary treatment groups and attained their numerical peak on slaughter day 4 (P=0.006; Tables SA. 14 and 5A. 15). A significant difference between the baseline and remainder of the animals (P=<0.001) was also detected, in addition to a significant correlation between BVR and day (P=0.024). No significant difference with respect to sample site or interactions between diet and day, and BVR and dict wcrc found. The lactobacilli to coliform ratio increased significantly bctwccn days 2 to 14 (P=0.005; <0.001 (L)) for those animals fed both diets 1 (control) and 2 (treatment; Tables 5A. 16 and 5A. 17). Conversely, this ratio declined with increasing distance along the intestine (S1-S5; P=<0.001). No significant influence of diet or 13VR or relationships between diet and day, or BVR and diet were found.

A strong trend towards enhanced faecal coliforms on day 14 was also evident (P=0.061; 0.055(L)). Significant relationships between diet and day (P=<0.001). BVR and day (P=<0.001) and finally BVR and diet (P=<0.001) were also demonstrated. A similar pattern was determined for faecal lactobacilli counts which increased significantly throughout the experimental period (1'=<0.001; <0.001(L); <0.001(Q); Tables 5A. 20 and 5A. 21). Furthermore, treatment animals displayed higher lactobacilli counts in comparison to those fed diet l (control; P=<0.001). Significant differences between BVR (P=<0.001), and significant relationships between diet and day (P<0.001), BVR and day (P=<0.001), and BVR and diet (P=<0.001) were evident. Faccal bifidobactcria counts were not significantly different with respect to dict or BVR diet interactions (Tables 5A. 22 and 5A. 23). They did howcvcr incrcasc significantly throughout the experimental period (P<0.001; <0.001(L); <0.001(Q)). Analysis also revealed a significant difference between IIVR (P=<0.001), and relationships between dict and BVR also dict, BVR or a I3VR and dict intcraction was found. A comparison bctwccn rectal and faccal samples illustrated highly significant differences in all 3 species of bacteria enumerated (P = 0.021; 0.009; <0.001 for bifidobactcria, coliforms respectively). In case of coliforms and lactobacilli, rectal samples displayed grcatcr counts. Convcrscly, in the case of bifidobactcria, faccal swabs displayed higher bacterial numbcrs.

A trend (('=0.073) was evident towards increased DLWG for animals offered diet I (control; average - 257g / d) in comparison to treatment animals (average = 147 g/ d). No significant difference between diets on feed intake (table 5A. 28) levels was determined, As expected, fccd intake increased over time (P=<0.001; <0.001(L)), and thcrc was a significant relationship between day and diet (P=0.008; 0.013(L); 0.039(Q)). The datasct for feed conversion ratio (FCR) clearly illustrates the poor FCR that is observed over the immediate post-weaning period (up to day 2) (Figure 5A. 3 and Table 5A. 29). This is linked to the low levels of feed intake combined with poor growth at this time. As expected, FCR improved over the duration of the experiment (P=<0.001; <0.001(L); <0.001(Q)). A significant relationship between day and diet (P=<0.001) was determined but there was no significant difference between dietary treatments. The time taken for each animal to take first fccd and water were also recorded. The earliest time to first feed was Ili 40 min with 8 piglets taking over 6 hours. Conversely, one piglet drank water immediately upon being placed in the pen, and 5 piglets took greater than 6 hours to drink water, with the remaining animals being in between these 2 time periods. 138 b a\u00fd v; \u00fdi 0 C (O )M) E)MiQ e6eJOAV Z.

There arc no data presented for baseline animals (slaughtered on day 0) due to insufficient lymphocyte isolation at slaughter, all subsequent individual PBL samples were pooled for treatment and slaughter day. A similar response was observed for both mitogcns at all 3 concentrations. The maximum uptake of methyl-[31 I]\"thymidine was achieved on day 4 for both mitogcns, both dietary treatments, and for all 3 mitogen concentrations. This enhanced uptake was relatively short-lived and declined by day 6. There was a highly significant temporal effect (P=0.001; 0.079(L); 0.091(Q)), and a significant relationship between diet and day (P=0.012; 0.007(L); 0.020(Q)). Analysis determined no significant difference between dietary treatments on lymphocyte proliferation responses. There was a highly significant difference between mitogen sources (P<0.001) with mitogen 2 (PIIA) achieving greater levels of uptake (3.134 and 3.476 (log cpm) for mitogcn 1 and 2 respectively). As expected, a significant difference between mitogen concentration (P=<0.001) was observed, with concentration 1 (10 pg/ml) achieving the highest level of uptake, and concentration 3 the lowest (I. 1 pg/ml). 143 T- NN 0000 rN '- N co ID cl \u00ab, c\u00fd N Q a 0 L O C. \u00fd 12 a E \u00ab. cd y >O ld ^ QO Q b \u00f6n E 0 J a w 0 c 0 w \u00f6 aO 0 q\u00f6 I 7U pA C Jo 144 T- T- NN rNrN 222 HI pO oOp tp \u00fdN\u00d6 a00 \u00fd\u00fdNQ MMMMM (wd3 601 ueaw) co Nr I- 0 0 C\u00fd b as cv E rA C v E cd N N 4. i+ O 0O w.

Intestinal coliform counts were significantly lower in treatment animals and intestinal bifdobactcria and lactobacilli counts were similar for both dietary treatment groups. This resulted in the intestinal lactobacilli to coliform ratio increasing significantly throughout the experimental period. Conversely, faecal coliform counts were greatest in treatment animals (due to faecal shedding, which demonstrates elimination from the host GIT) and again, no significant differences in either faecal bifidobactcria or lactobacilli counts were evident with respect to dietary treatment. There was no significant difference between dietary treatments on DLWG or FCR. Lymphocyte proliferation responses were similar for both treatment groups, although enhanced responses to the mitogcn PHA were observed in comparison to Con A. The findings of the current study suggest that supplementing piglet diets post-weaning with a yeast-based nucleotide source may exert some effects on the host. Although villus atrophy did occur post-weaning, this was somewhat limited, with recovery of villli height commencing after 2 days post-weaning. A significant reduction in intestinal coliform numbers may have important implications for the post-weaned piglet, since these bacteria arc thought to be non-beneficial and can be pathogenic. Possibly, the most important finding is the apparent stimulation of the immune system at a time when most piglets undergo a period of severe immuno-suppression (refer to chapter 6). Immunohistology determinations incorporating mucosal architecture (i. e. crypt cell production rate and mucosal mast cell enumeration) and intraepithelial lymphocyte enumeration can be used to quantify mucosal cell-mediated immune reactions (Mowat and Ferguson, 1982). Such reactions could possess important implications for the health and subsequent performance of the host animal. 148 CHAPTER 5I3: TILE EFFECTS OF DIETARY YEAST-BASED NUCLEOTIDE SUI'I'LEMENT ON PART 2: INFLUENCE 014 CREEP I4Ia: UING 513.1 INTRODUCTION It is well documented that Escherichla colt is among the earliest bacteria to colonise the gut in piglets (Drasar and Barrow, 1985) and thus frequently occur as commensals. However, these colonising E. cola strains must be able to compete for limiting nutrients and tolerate the prevailing conditions in order to grow and establish (Prcter et al., 1983). Pigs possess an extremely complex range of intestinal E. coli floras, and it has been suggested that some strains may be site specific (Thomlinson (1969), Hinton et al. (1985)). It is also well recognised that virtually all pigs carry pathogenic E. colt in their intestinal tracts and that, depending upon certain predisposing factors, these proliferate at weaning (Palmer and Hulland (1965), Svendsen et al. (1977) as cited by Miller et al. (1984)). Frequently, E. coil present in the environment can be the principal cause of diarrhoeal infections in piglets (Katouli et al. (1995), Sainsbury (1995)). E. coli diarrhoea occurs when these pathogenic serotypes significantly increase in number thus altering the ratio between pathogenic and non-pathogenic mircoorganisms. The major problems arise from E. coil that promotes enteric colibacillois where the microorganisms are responsible for the release of toxins. Such toxins can target intestinal cells or the cells of other organs and subsequent digestive disorders are often observed. A common strain of this group is the enterotoxigenic E. coil (ETEC) generally detected in faecal samples of piglets with and perhaps more importantly without diarrhoea (Nabuurs, 1998). It is thought that the small intestine becomes more susceptible to enterotoxins immediately post-weaning which is related to the immature digestive physiology of the piglet combined with the removal of protective factors present in sow milk. The diarrhoea that develops during the first week post-weaning is more commonly known as porcine post-weaning diarrhoea (PWD) and has been described by Hampson (1994), Such post-weaning colibacillosis is the most common cause of post-weaning mortality, killing between 1.5% - 2.0% of piglets weaned (Ilampson, 1994), and this 149 Charter SB combined with reduced growth rates in less severe cases is a major cause of economic loss to pig producers, and represents a health and welfare issue. The aetiology (Miniats and Roe (1968), McAllister et at (1979), Mainil et al. (1989)), epidemiology (Kuhn et at (1985), Nagy et at (1990), Osek and Trusszczynski (1992)), and pathogenesis (Wilson and Francis (1986), Rose et at (1987), Soderlind et at (1988), Fairbrother et at (1989)) of E. coli causing pre- and post-weaning diarrhoea have been the subject of many studies. For example, a study conducted by Katouli et at (1995) utilised biochemical fingerprinting to monitor the persistence and colonisation of intestinal E. coil isolated from the faeces of sows and their litters. The authors isolated several biochemical phenotypes (BPTs) of E. cola and illustrated that the intestinal colonisation consisted of successive waves of different E. cola BPTs, the tenure of which varied from a few days to 2 weeks. Moreover, the majority of these BPTs disappeared in the succeeding samples and were not recovered again from the same piglets (l. e. they were transient strains). This is in agreement with data presented by Craven and Barnum (1971) who also reported a similar pattern of successive colonisation of E. coil serogroups in healthy piglets throughout the suckling and early post-weaning periods. However, in the study of Katouli et at (1995), some E. col! strains, which colonised the piglets early in the suckling period, persisted for a long period and were referred to as resident BPTs. Each piglet carried more than one resident BPT (mean 2.4 BPTs per pig), some of which were also found in other piglets, indicating that both strain and host specificity are important for colonisation and persistence of E. coil in pigs (Katouli ct at, 1995). Furthermore, a huge similarity in E. coil floras between littermates throughout the suckling period was recorded, although each piglet developed a unique flora during post-weaning and fattening periods. Abrupt weaning in piglets has also been associated with a 100-fold drop in the numbers of lactobacilli in the intestine, and a 50-fold increase in the numbers of E. col! (liuis in't Veld and I lavenaar, 1993). At weaning, irrespective of age or incidence of PWD, a sudden increase in numbers of haemolytic E. coil throughout the small and large intestines is observed (Kcnworthy and Crabb (1963), Hinton et al. (1985)). Furthermore, it is uncommon to detect these bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract of suckling pigs, or in mature animals (Ilampson, 1994). However, l1ampson et al. (1987) illustrated that such bacteria must be present since they can be carried into a new unused weaner house by healthy suckling pigs. Furthermore, 11ampson et at. 150 Cbaptrr Sli (1987) also indicated that colonisation of weancr pigs can also occur following their exposure to the contaminated environment of wcaner houses that have previously contained pigs. It has been suggested that the physiological changes that occur post-weaning predispose piglets to develop diarrhoea (11ampson, 1994). For example, Schulman (1973) suggested that the gastric pH increases to non-bactericidal levels post-weaning, allowing ingested enterotoxigenic E. coil (ETEC) to and colonise the small intestine. Conversely, however, Iiampson e1 al. (1985) reported that weaned pigs tended to have both more acidic gastric contents and fewer viable coliform bacteria in the stomach than did unweaned animals. Moreover, Hampson (1994) stated that the initiation of disease is most likely to result from an increase in numbers of bacteria that have already colonised the intestines of piglets before weaning. This is most likely to be a consequence of the introduction of solid post-weaning diets, and the stress associated with weaning which commonly results in perturbation of the gut ecosystem. Changes in intestinal morphology such as villus atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, capacities combined with decreased brush-border enzyme activity in the small intestine (McCracken el a1., 1999) occur post-weaning. The precise aetiology of these changes remains to be fully elucidated, although several proposals have been made. For example, they have been suggested to be the result of hypersensitivity to dietary antigens (Miller et a!., 1984c), to be the action of viruses (Leece et al., 1983), to a lack of dietary intake ('luminal nutrition' concept) (Kelly et a!., 1984) or to be normal adaptive changes that are exaggerated by early weaning (11ampson (1983) as cited by Ilampson (1994), Kelly et a!. (1991a)). Whatever the exact causes these changes could predispose the piglets to post- weaning diarrhoea. A reduction in digestive and absorptive function of the small intestine would encourage the development of an osmotic diarrhoea, whilst unabsorbed dietary material might act as a substrate for ETEC in the gastrointestinal tract (Ilampson, 1994). Enterotoxigenic E. coli infections arc common contributing factors to post-weaning scours in pigs. Predisposing factors in such infections include the removal of protective levels of IgA and other beneficial factors present in sow's milk, inadequate feed and water intake, inadequate gastric acid secretion, unstable microbiota and expression of membrane and mucin glyconjugates that serve as binding sites for entcropathogens (Kelly, et a!. (1994), 151 Chapter 513 Thacker (1999), Kelly and Coutts (2000b), Kelly and King (2001 a), Kelly and King (20010). Post-weaning malnutrition predisposes to infection by compromising the barrier and immune functions of the gut. Concurrently, the infections adversely influence dietary intake, absorption and cause loss of endogenous nutrients (Calder and Jackson, 2000). Niewold e1 aL (2000) proposed that a fundamental predisposing factor to post-weaning diarrhoea is intestinal ischaemia. Intestinal blood supply may be unable to meet the metabolic demands of the rapidly growing intestine undergoing hyper-regenerative villus repair. It is suggested that the resulting ischaemia leads to intestinal acidosis and increased permeability for enterotoxigenie E. coli toxins (Niewold ei al., 2000). Pre-weaned pigs have small, underdeveloped large intestines, which rapidly increase in size and content following weaning at 3 weeks of age (1lampson, 1987). The large intestine is a principal site of water and electrolyte absorption in the weaned pig (Hamilton and Roc, 1977), and this activity is facilitated by the absorption of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) (Argenzio, 1982). Newly weaned pigs are immature in terms of their digestive physiology and their intestinal microflora is incompletely developed. Fermentation in the large intestine is therefore limited, so that water and electrolyte movement associated with absorption of VFAs may also be diminished (11ampson, 1987). Conversely, Etheridge et al. (1984) proposed that the consumption of poorly digestible diets by weaner pigs results in increased bacterial fermentation, with an increased lactic acid and VFA production, (the products of bacterial fermentation, along with undigested and unabsorbed food residues as well as minerals, increase the osmolarity of the intestinal contents, resulting in a lack of water reabsorption and a continued influx of water into the intestinal lumen) which in turn causes an osmotic diarrhoea. Evidence concerning the interaction between dietary intake, both pre- and post-weaning, and the occurrence of diarrhoea is equivocal. For example, Miller et aL (1984a) demonstrated that the consumption of small amounts of creep food before weaning may 'prime' intestinal hypersensitivity reactions to dietary antigens post-weaning, and exacerbate PWD. Miller et aL (1984a) demonstrated that piglets given a small amount of creep food as a 'priming' dose before weaning went on to show a significantly greater depression in their ability to absorb xylose 8 days post-weaning and suffered more diarrhoea than did other weaned pigs. 152 Chapter Sn Conversely, most authors have not been able to substantiate this. For example, Ilampson and Smith (1986), illustrated that all weaned pigs displayed a reduction in their ability to absorb xylose 1 week post-weaning, but that this was not influenced by the pattern of creep feeding before weaning. This protective effect of withholding creep food was associated with a low dietary intake after weaning with this regimen. Pigs which developed diarrhoea tended to be those that consumed more feed after weaning than their contemporaries. ilaemolytic enterotoxigenic E. coli and rotaviruses were present in the faeces of most pigs post-weaning, but in those animals that ate too much (hyper-alimentation) and developed diarrhoea, excretion of the E. coil continued for approximately twice as long as in animals that remained healthy. This is also supported by investigations of Hampson ea al. (1988), Kelly e1 al. (1990), Kelly (1990) and Sarmiento et al. (1990). Kelly (1990) regulated the intake of creep feed through gastric intubation throughout the suckling period and piglets were orally infected with 106 enteropathogenic E. coll. Although piglet response varied considerably, consumption of creep feed did not significantly affect the prevalence, duration or severity of experimentally-induced diarrhoea. Intake of creep feed is probably the most important factor in maximising weaning live-weight that subsequently reduces the susceptibility of developing PWD. Restriction of dietary intake after weaning alone, or in combination with an increased dietary fibre content, reduced both the proliferation of haemolytic E. coil and the occurrence of PWD (Smith and Halls, 1968). There is evidence to suggest that feeding liquid weaner diets can reduce the number of coliform bacteria within the intestinal tract and prevent both post-weaning growth check (Lcccc et al., 1979) and PWD. Kelley (1982) reported that when weaned piglets arc exposed to cold or fluctuating temperatures, their susceptibility to cntcrotoxigenic E. coil (ETEC) infections is increased. This reduction in resistance is probably due to changes in immune function caused by stress. Rotavirus has also been associated with PWD often in conjunction with haemolytic E. colt (Lcecc and King (1978), Leece et a1. (1983), Nabuurs et a1. (1993)). A marked increase in the number of hacmolytic E. colt has been reported to occur from 2 days post-weaning (Kenworthy and Crabb, 1963). Furthermore, Kcnworthy and Crabb (1963) also reported that haemolytic strains proliferate in the intestinal tract of healthy pigs post-weaning, although this population was smaller than in littermatcs that developed diarrhoea (Kcnworthy and Crabb, 1963). Thomlinson (1969) stated that abrupt dietary 153 Chaptcr SB change, often at weaning, movement of animals such as mixing litters, unrest and irregular feeding, inadequate drinking water supply and other so-called stress factors such as damp and cold housing, are just some of the factors responsible for the multiplication and dominance of E. coil serotypes in pigs. Miller et a!. (1984b) and Kelly (1990) reported an increased susceptibility of pigs to bacterial and toxin-mediated infections at weaning. The removal of immunologic factors present in sows milk may contribute to this susceptibility. However, the developmental process in the gut is accompanied by subtle changes in the microvillar membranes which may influence disease susceptibility. The maturity of the enterocyte influences its binding characteristics for lectins and this glycosylation shift might increase binding of bacteria to the mucosal surface (Etzler and Branstrator, 1979). King and Kelly (1990) in addition to Pang el a!. (1987), have provided conclusive evidence indicating that modification of carbohydrate moieties of the microvillar membrane occurs during development in the rat and pig. This may be reflected in the heightened susceptibility to infection (precocious shedding of E. coli in the faeces) observed with some of the animals weaned at 3 weeks old in the study conducted by Kelly (1990), perhaps involving changes in the expression and maturation of bacterial receptor sites on the mucosal surfaces. The susceptibility of rabbit intestine to colonisation by E. coil is temporally related to the appearance of receptors (Boedeker and Cheney, 1984). It is, therefore, suggested that the process of weaning encourages the expression of receptors including those that arc recognised by enteric pathogens. This possibility, considered in conjunction with physiological immaturity of the immune system of the young pig at 2 to 3 weeks old, may explain the high incidence of enteric infection associated with the practice of early weaning (Kelly, 1990). A series of changes in small intestinal structure and cnterocytc brush border enzyme activities after weaning has, as a net effect, a temporary reduction in intestinal digestive and absorptive function. This would facilitate the development of an osmotic diarrhoea, and unabsorbed dietary material could act as a potential substrate for cntcrotoxigcnic E. coll (ETEC) within the gastrointestinal tract which could result in PWD. It has been proposed that newly weaned pigs are susceptible to develop diarrhoea because they are immature in terms of their digestive physiology (Corring et a!., 1978), and their intestinal microlfora is incompletely developed. As such they arc ill equipped to cope with (digest) solid diets. 154 Chapter 513 Fcrmcntation is thcrcforc limited, so that water and electrolyte movement associatcd with absorption of VFAs may also be diminished (Ilampson, 1987). In a study conducted by Kelly (1990), the experimental strain of E. cola was consistently isolated from the faeces during bouts of diarrhoea, the total counts being in the range of 108 to 1010 organisms g\" of fresh faeces. Smith and Linggood (1971) have reported similar numbers. Shedding did not correlate with the severity of diarrhoea. This finding supports the observations of Sarmiento et al. (1988) who concluded that faecal shedding was not a reliable indicator of colonisation of the small intestine because of the uncertainty regarding the proliferative or pathogenic activity of these bacteria during transit in the small intestine and in the hind-gut. In the present study, an E. coil infection occurred, the source of which was later identified as the drinking water supply within the experimental unit. Once the infection became apparent, the header tank was immediately sanitised with VirkonT\"' (non-toxic disinfectant) that was drawn through the system via the nipple drinkers. Although this infection was not expected, the experimental protocol was immediately modified to incorporate E. coil identification and quantification. Furthermore, veterinary advice was sought, the animals examined instantly and antibiotic intervention was not deemed necessary by the veterinary surgeon. It should also be emphasised that no animal suffered any pathological effects in any way as a result of the infection. 513.2 AIMS To determine the effects of creep feeding and dietary immuno-potentiator supplementation on gut physiology, microflora characteristics and immunological parameters in post-weaned piglets. It is postulated that dietary nucleotide supplementation pre- and post-weaning will reduce the extent and duration of small intestinal damage associated with the weaning process. Such effects may also enhance growth performance post-weaning. 513.3 METHODS 511.3.1 Animals and housing Thirty-six entire male piglets (Section 4.3.1) were used to evaluate the experimental diets. Animals were offered the diets from 14 days pre-weaning whilst still suckling the sow (i. e. 155 Chapter 58 on a litter or group basis) in farrowing accommodation (up to day 0 (weaning)). At weaning, the animals were transferred to the experimental unit, individually housed as described previously (Section 4.3.1), and 4 piglets were slaughtered on day 0 (weaning day) to provide baseline data. The animals received the same diets pre- and post-weaning. 5133.2 Diets The same 2 diets were formulated as described for the previous study (section 5A3.2), and Ascogen was included at the same inclusion rate of 4g/kg. Both experimental diets were fed from 14 days pre-weaning (day -14; on the site of birth) through to 14 days post-weaning (day 14). For complete diet specification refer to Table 5A. 1. 583.3 Post-mortem procedure The post-mortem procedure has been described previously in sections 2.4, and 4.3.3. The only modification to this procedure was the investigation for signs of gastric ulceration. At slaughter, the stomach was removed, cut open and any gastric contents washed off with cold water. The stomach wall was then inspected for any signs of gastric ulceration and photographs taken for subsequent investigation. 5133.4 Microbiological analyses The microbiological analysis has been described previously in sections 2.8 and 5A3.3. Due to the E. coif outbreak during this study, faecal swabs were undertaken for E. coil determination from day 7 to 14 and from days 9 to 14 for lactobacilli and bifidobactcria species. In addition, digesta samples also underwent E. colt enumeration and identification throughout the experimental period (day 0 to 14). 5133.4.1 E. coil scrotypc isolation E. coil isolated from intestinal samples underwent scrotype isolation and determination. Serial dilutions were prepared in maximum recovery diluent (MRD, Oxoid). and coliforms were enumerated using coil Petri film (3M, MA, USA) that was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. 156 Chaplrr S! 1 5113.4.1.1 Maintenance of organisms E. coli, isolates were sub-cultured onto Luria I3crtani agar (Difco, USA) plates and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. Colonies (2-3) were then transferred to micro-bank bead tubes (Pro-Lab, Surrey, UK) according to the manufacture's instructions. The tubes were stored at -20\u00b0C until required for DNA fingerprint studies. Due to limited resources, faecal swabs were only performed in the study to monitor the E. coli load of the piglets once an E. colt infection had been established. As such, not all piglets employed in this study underwent faecal swabbing procedures. 5133.4.1.2 ERIC-DNA fingerprinting E. colt colonies on Luria 13ertani agar (Difco) at 37\u00b0C. Genomic DNA was recovered from the cells by using a modified method to that described by Polyzou et al. (2000). A colony was removed from the agar plate and was suspended in 0.2 ml TE buffer and placed in a boiling water bath for 10 min. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (13,000 xg for 10 min) and the supernatant containing the DNA decanted into a sterile eppendorf tube. The various DNA preparations were typed using ERIC-PCR (Vcrsalovic et a!. 1991). ERIC2 (reverse) 5'-AAGTAAGTGACTGGGGTGAGCG-3' The PCR reactions were carried out in a total reaction volume of 251l. A1 \u00b5l DNA sample was added to 24 pl master mix containing: 100 pM of each primer, IU of Taq DNA polymerase (Advanced Biotechnologies, Surrey, UK), Biotechnologies), and Buffer II (X10) (Boehringer Mannheim). The reactions were carried out in a Tcchnc thcrmocycler (Progene), at the following temperatures: one cycle for 3 min at 94\u00b0C, then 35 cycles comprising: 30 sec at 94\u00b0C, 1 min at 52\u00b0C, 4 min at 65\u00b0C. The final cycle was for 8 min at 65\u00b0C. 157 Cliaplcr SB The PCR product was mixed with 5 tl loading buffer and clcctrophorescd in a 2% ethidium bromide (0.5 \u00b5g/ml) in running buffer at 70 V for 2h. 5133.4.1.3 DNA fingerprint analysis Comparison of the DNA fingerprints was undertaken using Amersham Pharmacia, ImageMastert I D-Elitc gel analysis and database software (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, UK). Dendrograms were constructed using the Dice similarity coefficient (SD) and the UPGMA (unweighted pair group method Sneath, 1963). 5B3.5 Lymphocyte proliferation The immunological analyses have been described previously in section 2.9. In the current study all proliferation experiments were performed with fresh lymphocytes. 5113.6 Statistical analyses Statistical analyses were undertaken as described previously in section 2.12. The between- treatment variation was partitioned into Baseline versus the Rest (BVR) as described for previous studies; no modifications were made. Due to the nature of the study, i. e. the experimental dietary regimens were introduced as creep feeds from 14 days pre-weaning, the dietary effects were analysed by including the baseline values and comparing treatments of all 36 animals. In this instance the baseline animals were classified as receiving either diet 1 (control) or diet 2 (treatment; nuclcotidc supplementation) in accordance with the remainder of the experimental animals. Animals were blocked according to litter in all analyses. 513.4 RESULTS No evidence of gastric ulceration was observed in any of the animals at slaughter. 513.4.1 Gut morphology Generally, villus height (Table 513.2), villus width (Table 513.4) and crypt depth (Table 5B. 6) increased with increasing distance along the small intestine from proportionately 0.25 to 0.50 from the gastric pylorus to the ilco-caccal valve. Measurements taken at the region of 0.75 158 Chapter S13 were generally less than those at 0.25 along the small intestine. This trend was apparent across all 5-time points (d 0,2,4,6 & 14) for both dietary treatments. Analysis of variance established that intestinal villi changed height significantly throughout the experimental period for both dietary treatments (P=0.032; P=0.004 (L); Table 513.3). No significant difference with respect to diet and BVR, or relationships between diet and day, or BVR and diet were apparent. There was however, a significant difference in relation to intestinal region (P=<0.001), with villi at proportionately 0.50 along the intestine being tallest. There was also a significant correlation between BVR and day, with average VII being shorter on day 2, than day 0 and then increasing up to the tallest heights recorded on day 14. The percentage difference in villus height between the baseline and the remainder of the experimental animals demonstrated that, although villus atrophy occurred to a greater extent in control animals, it occurred for a greater period of time in treatment animals (Table 5B. 1). The animals (both control and treatment), which were slaughtered on the final day of the study (day 14), displayed the tallest villi in the distal region of the intestine. VW remained within relatively narrow limits throughout the experimental period (Table 5B. 5). There was however, a significant difference between regions of the intestine (P=0.039), with VW generally being greatest at proportionately 0.50 (medially) along the length of the small intestine. No significant differences were determined between diet, day, or BVR. Significant interactions between diet and day, BVR and day, and BVR and diet were not evident. Analysis of CD revealed a significant increase in depth throughout the experimental period (P=<0.001; <0.001(L); 0.054(Q); Table 5B. 7). A significant effect of region was demonstrated (P=0.017), with 0.75 being the most shallow when averaged over all 4-time points (days 2,4,6 and 14). No significant difference with respect to diet, BVR or IIVR and diet interaction was apparent. Significant relationships between diet and day (P=0.033(Q)) and BVR and day (P=<0.001) wert also demonstrated. 159 Chapter SB Vll: CD ratio differed significantly across region (P=0.007), and there was also a significant relationship between diet and day (P=0.025 (Q); Table 513.9). No significant differences were determined in relation to diet, day or IIVR. Additionally, no significant relationships between diet and day, BVR and day or BVR and diet were observed. 160 II O 0 I '\u00f6b cv cd E 00 II CJ 4_1 b 0 cri CO ti 0) d E 1Ln co w to R?

They also increased significantly (P=<0.001) along the length of the intestine (i. e. from the duodenum to the rectum). A significantly higher count was determined from the baseline (mean = 10.6 cfu / g), than the remainder of the animals (P=0.005). No significant differences between diet, or correlations between diet and day, or BVR and diet were evident. The relationship between BVR and day was however, significant (P=<0.001). No significant temporal or dietary differences were determined with respect to intestinal lactobacilli counts (Tables 58.12 and 5B. 13). Similarly, analysis revealed no significant relationships between diet and day, BVR and day or BVR and diet. A significant difference between baseline and the remainder of the animals (P=0.031) was apparent, with baseline values being higher. Lactobacilli counts also increased significantly along the length of the small intestine (P=<0.001). Bifidobacteria counts fluctuated over time (P=0.012), but were highest on days 2 and 4 for both treatment groups (Tables 5B. 14 and 5B. 15). A significant increase (P=0.020) in counts along the length of the intestine was also evident. Conversely, no significant differences in relation to dietary treatment, BVR, or correlations between diet and day, or BVR and day were demonstrated. There was however a significant relationship between BVR and day (P-0.012), with the mean baseline value being less than the overall means for both treatment groups over time. Total mean E. coil counts (log cfu / g) declined significantly throughout the experimental period (P=0.001; <0.001(L)), and in comparison to the baseline animals (P=0.005; Tables 513.16 and 58.17). No significant difference between dietary treatments or relationship between diet and day, or BVR and diet was demonstrated. E. coil counts increased significantly along the length of the intestine (P=<0.001), and there was a significant correlation between BVR and day (P=<0.001). The E. coil isolated from the water system was determined at the concentration of 106 organisms/ ml. The E. colt strain isolated from the water was also isolated from the intestines of the pigs. A total of 5 E. coil isolates were detected in the intestines of the experimental animals, with a similarity co-efficient of 0.95. 166 Chapter SB An example of a dendrogram illustrating some of the strains of E. coil isolated from the pigs is presented in Figure 5II. 3. Watery contents of the intestine were also evident at slaughter. Intestinal lactobacilli to coliform ratios increased significantly with respect to time (P=0.005; 0.001(L)) and following an inverse quadratic pattern/hyperbola across sample site (P=<0.001) i. e. decreased then increased (Tables 513.18 and 513.19). No significant differences between dietary treatment, IIVR or relationships between diet and day, and IIVR and diet were demonstrated. 167 4) a\u00fd c\u00fd a\u00fd b I N ci a\u00fd b E lO .a 0 oA U \u00fc 't \u00f6\u00f6 U ..

No significant differences between dietary treatment or relationships between diet and day were found for faecal coliform, lactobacilli and bifidobacteria counts. <0.001(Q)) throughout the experimental period (Tables 5B. 21 and 5B. 22)). Analysis of intestinal p1: 1 revealed no significant differences with respect to time or BVR (Tables 513.24 and 513.25). A significant difference (P=0.009) between dietary treatments was evident, with animals fed diet I (control) displaying lower digcsta p1l values. The p11 also differed significantly across sample site (P=c0.001), for both dietary treatments with Si (duodenum) being the most acidic and S3 (ileum) the least. A significant correlation between BVR and diet (P=0.008), but none with respect to diet and day, or BVR and day was determined.

Figure 513.4 illustrates the variability among animals, and the weight loss that commonly occurs in the immediate post-weaning period. No significant diet or diet and day interaction was found with respect to FCR (Figure 513.5 and Table 513.26). Figure 513.5 illustrates the poor FCR displayed at day 2, with the values increasing significantly over time (P=0.049; 0.012 (Q)) and becoming more consistent. The poor and often negative FCR observed for animals slaughtered on day 2 is due to the low and sometimes negligible feed intakes observed over the initial days post-weaning (Table 513.27). As expected, feed intake increased significantly over time (P=<0.001; <0.001(L); <0.001(Q)), and was highly variable over the early stages of the experimental period (refer to Appendix 2 for individual feed intake data). No significant differences between dietary treatment or relationships between diet and day were evident. 179 O .. ou C b O U U ed -rj 0 Vic, ri ^.

All lymphocyte proliferation cultures were performed using lymphocytes isolated from individual animals i. e. they were not pooled as for those used in study 3 (Figures 5A. 3-5A. 5). A similar shaped response was observed for all 3 mitogen concentrations and with both mitogens. The figures illustrate an enhanced uptake of methyl- [3H]-thymidine initially (between days 0 to 4) which then declines between days 4 and 14. As such there was a highly significant difference with respect to day (P=<0.001; <0.001(L); <0.001(Q)), and BVR (P=0.004). No significant relationships between BVR and diet, or dietary treatment alone were evident. Significant correlations between diet and day (P=0.021; 0.010(L)), and mitogen concentration (P=<0.001) were determined. As expected, significant differences between both mitogen (P<0.001) and mitogen concentration (P=<0.001) were also found. 183 1WNN 0 c3 C) \"- NN 33 33 f i O M 'b ry cd NE cd Of Co \u00d6 cD \u00fd 73 \"U CJ vo Mm in N i 0 LIM M cd N ry0~ N o \" Q% O O ' co >% C fC O QV tV TJ bA \u00f6 MmE NpM M ,)O r- -0 .0 cl o 1\u00fd p vi ed Gir 185 Q In o In (Ludo hol ueaw) auipiwALP-[HE]-I/c43aw1o aMLIdn O T co Co F- ID NO N T- O ti Y a I 0 d c 0 U 4I 3 ti E C v r .r v I- .1 N N w.

Concurrent with the observations of study 3, villus widening and crypt hyperplasia also occurred throughout the post-weaning period. However, in contrast to the results obtained in study 3, there were no significant differences between dietary treatments on any of the microbiological species (both intestinal and faecal samples) investigated (l. e. coliforms, E. coli, lactobacilli and bifdobacteria), or DLWG, feed intake levels or FCR. Treatment animals displayed more alkaline intestinal p1l than control animals. Proliferation responses of peripheral blood lymphocytes to mitogens exhibited no significant differences due to diet, although a significant relationship between day and diet was evident. These results suggest that the introduction of creep feed from 14 days prc-wcaning may exert a beneficial influence on the gut ecosystem (in terms of stabilisation of the microllora). Creep feeding pre-weaning allows a period of adaptation to occur to the diets before the stressful event of weaning occurs. Although those animals offered the treatment diets displayed more alkaline digesta pH values, any effects of this were not manifest on the gut microbial populations (the specific species investigated in the present study). The lymphocyte proliferative responses may indicate that the animals were experiencing some degree of hypersensitivity reaction in response to the dietary antigens, although there is also some suggestion that the observed response is age-dependent. It should also be borne in mind that the E. co!! infection encountered in the current study, would have affected the gut ecosystem and host immune status in some manner. Kelly (1990) stated that host predisposition to E. coil infection is considered a principal factor in the initiation of a sudden proliferation of cnteropathogenic strains of E. coil and in the subsequent onset of diarrhoea. The underlying factors which have been implicated include inflammatory metabolites of bacterial origin (Kenworthy, 1976), immune-mediated damage to the small intestine (Miller et at, 1983), damage mediated by rotavirus (Lccce et at, 1983) and genetic factors. Additionally, pigs are often immuno-suppressed at the time of weaning, which will further enhance their susceptibility to infection. Although the context of the current E. colt infection is somewhat different to that considered by Kelly (1990), the adverse changes in small intestinal structure observed in the current study, may nonetheless have facilitated the 188 Cliaptt r 3! 1 colonisation of these animals by the pathogen. A further important consideration highlighted in the study of Kelly (1990) was the individual variation observed in the response of pigs to the E. coli. In the study conducted by Kelly (1990), piglets were infected with pathogenic strains of E. coil, the onset and severity of the diarrhoea was not alleviated by prior exposure to a high level of creep feed pre-weaning. This contrasts with the findings of Miller e! aL (1985), that pigs encouraged to consume a tolerising dose of creep feed did not succumb to PWD (Miller et a!., 1984a; b). The failure to demonstrate prophylaxis against E. coli infection by high pre- weaning intakes at either 2 or 3 weeks of age (Kelly, 1985 as cited by Kelly, 1990 and Kelly et al., 1986) and the absence of a pre-weaning treatment effect on the morphology and function of the gut (Kelly et a!., 1986; Kelly et a!., 1990) arc inconsistent with the hypothesis of delayed hypersensitivity. The present results of Kelly et a!. (1986) support those of Hampson et al. (1988), who compared abruptly weaned pigs with animals with those fed low levels of creep feed (primed) and observed no differences in the susceptibility or severity of diarrhoea between the two groups. The E. colt counts obtained in the current study were slightly higher than those reported by Sasaki et al. (1987) for control animals, but were generally within the same range (Table 5B. 28). The current study also revealed that the ileum contained the highest E. coil load in comparison to the dudodenum and jejunum, which is also supported by findings of Sasaki et al. (1987). Furthermore, Sasaki et al. (1987) reported no significant differences between the intestinal E. cola counts observed from piglets 5 and 6 weeks of age. 189 Chapter 511 Table 513.29: E. coil counts obtained from intestinal samples for control animals in the current study at 6 and 14 days post-weaning mean E. coil count (log cfu g'1) Region of Intestine Age 31 d (d 6 p-w) Ago 39 d (d 14 p\"w) Diet I Diet 2 Diet I Diet 2 Duodenum 4.8 5.9 4.6 5.7 Jejunum 3.9 6.1 4.2 4.3 Ileum 9.7 3.6 6.6 11.1 Table 5B. 30: E. coil counts obtained from intestinal samples for control animals in the study of Sasaki et al.

(1987), 0 indicates <103.3 organisms, data shown for control animals only. Sasaki et al. (1987) also reported occasional diarrhoea, a reduction in live-weight gain and watery contents of the colon at slaughter. Faecal shedding and intestinal E. coil counts correlated reasonably well (r2 a 0.759) in the current study. Generally the mean intestinal count was slightly higher that the faecal count. This could be related to the fact that faecal E. coil load was enumerated via the technique of faecal swabs. As such, the faecal count was performed on a swab and not weight basis, thus rendering comparison between faecal and intestinal samples somewhat limited. Faccal grab samples could have been taken to provide enumeration on a fresh weight basis, although aerobic conditions and interaction with the environment can affect the results obtained. In the 190 Chapter SD study of Kelly (1990), shedding did not correlate with severity of diarrhoea, which supports the observations of Sarmiento et a!. (1988) who concluded that faccal shedding was not a reliable indicator of E. coli colonisation of the small intestine because of the uncertainty regarding the proliferative or pathogenic activity of these bacteria during transit in the small intestine and in the hind gut. 191 CIIAP I1ER 5C: THE EFFECT OF FEEDING A NUCLEO'I'IUI; -SUI'CLE11EN'I'EI) DIET ON PIG POST-WEANING PERFORMANCE 5C. 1 INTRODUCTION Previous work has demonstrated that the nucleotide source Ascogcn can have beneficial effects on the intestinal wall and can be associated with improved daily live-weiglht gain (Uauy et al., 1990). This study involved a total of 96 animals and was intended to investigate the effects, if any, of feeding Ascogen pre- / post-weaning on the growing / finishing performance of pigs. As such it was intended to monitor the performance of the pigs through to slaughter at 90 kg. Unfortunately, all animals were removed from the trial on day 26 post- weaning due to the incidence of severe enteric disease and the requirement for antibiotic therapy. Evidence suggests that growth rates achieved during the post-weaning period arc reflected in later life. For example, Tokach et aL (1992) and Azain (1993) reported that piglets achieving good growth rates (225-340 g/ d) during the 1`` week post-weaning reached much greater weights 10 to 28 days later when compared to piglets achieving poor growth (0-110 g/ d). Regardless of the age at weaning, piglets lose some 100 to 250g on the first day after weaning, but the loss of body weight (Bwt) is recovered 2 to 4d post-weaning (Lc Dividich and Seve, 2000). However, although reduced overall growth rates post-weaning arc observed this is not true for some individual body parts. Le Dividich et at. (1998) reported a 25% increased relative weight of the small intestine at 3-7 d post-weaning and a 52% increase at 10-14 days. Corresponding increases in the relative weight of the pancreas were 17 and 30% respectively. The increased weight of the GIT relative to Bwt occurs regardless of age at weaning and is caused by the change in the type of diet. This is demonstrated by the knowledge that gastrointestinal growth is, to some extent, dependent on the amount of feed intake during the immediate post-weaning period (Kelly et a!. (1991 b), Pluskc et a!. (1997)). Additionally, small intestinal growth is greater in piglets fed solid diet than those fed liquid milk substitutes (McCracken et a!., 1995). 192 Ciiuplrr SC 5C. 2 AIMS The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the performance of post-weaned pigs fed diets based on a standard Provimi Ltd feed programme between weaning and 25 days post- weaning when given Ascogen pre- and post-weaning under commercial conditions. It was hypothesised that animals fed ascogen both pre- and post-weaning would exhibit enhanced performance post-weaning. 5C. 3 METHODS 5C. 3.1 Animals and housing Ninety-six pigs were housed in groups of 6 piglets per pen (total - 16 groups) immediately after weaning (prior to weaning, all animals were housed on a litter basis with the sow in farrowing accommodation). All pigs were weighed pre-weaning and allocated to pens in such a way as to ensure that each pen contained either large (8-9 kg), medium (6-7 kg), or small (5 kg) piglets. The average weight at weaning was approximately 6.5 kg, and all animals were kept in the same groups from weaning through to slaughter. 5C3.2 Diets A single-stage trial diet programme was used based on Provimi Ltd Multiwcan (containing no zinc oxide or any other digestive enhancer). Animals fed prc-wcaning were offered the diets on a group (litter) basis whilst housed in farrowing accommodation (t. e. suckling the sow). The dietary treatments were as follows; Diet I Negative control; conventional starter diet (fed from weaning (d 0) to 25 days (d 25) post-wcaning) Diet 2+ Ascogcn; fed from 7 days pre-weaning to weaning Diet 3+ Ascogcn; to 25 days post-weaning Diet 4+ Ascogcn; fed from 7 days prc-wcaning to 25 days host- weaning Pigs were fed the starter diet for the duration of the trial up to 25 days post-weaning (day 25). Ascogcn was included at a rate of 4 kg/t where it was applied (diets 2,3 and 4). One of the 193 chapter sc four diets was fed to 4 groups of 6 piglets (i. e. 24 piglets in total). All 4 diets comprised of the same raw ingredients as shown below in Table 50.1 (rcfcr to Table 2.1 for dietary chcmical composition).

Feed intakes were also recorded throughout the trial on a pen (group) basis and food conversion data calculated. The trial was expected to conclude at slaughter at approximately 90 kg. Unfortunately, all animals were removed from the trial on day 26 post-weaning due to the incidence of severe enteric disease and the requirement for antibiotic therapy. 5C3.4 STATISTICAL ANALYSES Statistical analyses were undertaken as described previously in section 2.12. In this study conducted on a commercial unit, each group or pen of animals was one replicate (i. e. 4 pens per diet). A total of 96 animals were involved in the study, with 4 groups of animals (6 pigs per group) for each of the 4 dietary treatment (l. e. a total of 24 animals per dietary treatment). 194 Chapter JC 5C. 4 RESULTS Analysis revealed no significant differences with respect to dietary treatment on both daily feed intake and feed conversion ratio (Tables SC. 2,5C. 3 and SC. 4). As expected, daily Iced intake increased significantly throughout the experimental period (1'<0.00l; P<O. 001 (L)) and FCR also improved significantly over time (P<0.001; 11<0.001 (L)). There was no significant relationship between dietary treatment and day on daily feed intake, although a trend was observed for FCR (P=0.083). 195 (6)j) OM-la a6cio, , le M N V- .J n O V a v c0- O O id E cC O O \u00f6i! -w d_ n \u00e4_ X11 SC (per group; is -4 groups per diet; nw6 animals per group) Mot Food Intako FCR 1 8.8 1.42 2 9.75 1.12 3 9.63 1.36 4 10.0 0.90 Dict I- -7 to +25.

This suggests that the use of creep-feed from 7 days pre-weaning could be an important parameter in determining subsequent animal performance. This is most likely due to the fact that the introduction of creep-feed pre-weaning should result in a greater weight at weaning (although this is dependent on pre-weaning feed intake levels). Weaning weight is well established to correlate with performance later in life (1Voltcr and Ellis, 2001; Varlcy, personal communication). The dietary regimens that involved the introduction of creep feed pre- weaning (diets 2 and 4) also possess the additional benefit of allowing the piglets an adaptation period prior to weaning. As such weaning may not be such a stressful event (in comparison to those offered no creep feed pre-weaning), and the characteristic post-weaning anorexia (or low and variable levels of feed intake) may not have occurred. Although not significant (P=0.119), it is noteworthy that those animals on dietary regimen 2 and 4 (creep- fecd), exhibited higher levels of feed intake post-weaning than those not offered creep feed (dietary regimen 1 and 3). Since feed intake or more specifically luminal nutrition is known to be an important factor influencing digestive physiology post-weaning, any enhanced (or even modest) levels of feed intake over the initial 14 days post-weaning arc likely to exert some impact on the gut ecosystem of the host animal. Due to the disease outbreak and subsequent premature termination of the study, the effects of creep feeding on growing / finishing performance was unable to be investigated. 198 Chapter SC The introduction of crccp-fccd prc-wcaning may also cxcrt beneficial effects post-wcaning through the reduction of stress associated with weaning that may ultimately result in a decreased duration and severity in immuno-suppression, which commonly accompanies weaning. This supported by data gcncratcd in study 4 (Charter 513). 199 C11A1 IElt5: DISCUSSION Although a direct comparison between studies 5A and 513 cannot be made, thcrc arc nevertheless a number of common factors between the two. Ilowcvcr, such comparisons should be intcrprctatcd with caution as the studies were performed in isolation from one another, at different periods of time (involving distinct animal batches), and encountered differing disease environments / pathogenic challenge. It should also be noted however that the same source of animals of the same genotype were used in both studies. More specifically, seasonal changes in gut microflora could influence individual studies. For example, Millman (2001) demonstrated indications of seasonal changes in the populations of Lactobacillus spp, Bifidobacterium spp, coliform bacteria and Clostridfuun bacteria or Ilacteroides spp, in the colonic digcsta of pigs. Furthermore, Millman (2001) suggested that the effects of any attempt at gut manipulation may depend on the time of year at which it is applied. Hillman (2001) also suggested that this would be particularly true in the case of feed additives which include, or which arc intended to affect, coliform or lactic acid bacteria. These variations in the intestinal microflora, together with other known sources of variation such as animal age, herd and individual differences and dietary effects, would probably be entirely predictable if their causes were better understood. In particular, any immunorcgulatory or general immune system responses will depend upon a number of factors including the function and physiological status of the animals themselves. Currently, it is not possible to take account of these variabilities within animal studies (more importantly, in comparing data from different studies) because the effect of many of these sources of variation has yet to be fully investigated. It is, however, important to appreciate that replication of experimental studies will be influenced by all of these factors, and possibly by many other factors not yet identified. It is thus possible that two discrete studies investigating the effect of a feed additive or supplement on the growth of an animal species may yield different results, although both datascts would be valid within the current state of knowledge of all these variables (I lillman, 2001). 200 Chnptrr 5 Villus atrophy and crypt hypcrplasia arc phenomena that arc known to occur at the time of weaning (I'luskc ct al. (1997), van i3ccrs-Schrcurs el n1. (1998), McCracken el erl. (1999), Tang et at. (1999)). Although in the present studies villus atrophy only occurred immediately post-weaning, this is probably what would occur under normal production conditions since the responses of both control and treatment animals were similar. In a study conducted by Ilampson (1986), it was determined that villus height decreased to 75% prc-weaning values (940 to 694 hm) within 24 hours of weaning at 21 days. Subsequent reductions in villus Height were smaller but continued to decline until the f i(ih day post-weaning, at which point villus height at most sites along the gut was 50% of the initial weaning value. However in the current studies 5A and 513, villi were much shorter at the start of the experiment, and underwent less scvcrc atrophy post-weaning, with the maximum villus atrophy of 29% occurring in control animals in study 5A. A comparison between the percentage differences in villus height obtained in studies 5A and 513, clearly illustrates that in study 513, the severity of villus atrophy was less in comparison to that observed in study 5A. Since the same dietary specifications were utilised in both studies, this apparent alleviation of villus atrophy could be attributed to the creep feeding regimen (diets fed from 14 days pre-weaning in study 513). However, although the same dietary specifications were used, the actual batches of raw materials were different, and as such the dietary compositions may have differed slightly. In study 5A, the longer villi present in the proximal part of the small intestine decreased in height proportionately less than villi in the medial or distal part of the gut (a decrease in height of the order 26-28% was apparent). This is in contrast to results reported by Ccra ei at (1988) where the longer villi present in the proximal part of the small intestine decreased in height proportionately more than the villi towards the distal part of the gut. Conversely, the findings of study 5B arc not so clear since the largest extent of villus atrophy was recorded in the proximal and medial regions for those fed diet I and the proximal and distal regions of the intestine for those offered diet 2. Thcrc is a considcrablc amount of cvidcncc indicating that nuclcosidcs / nuclcotidcs arc csscntial for the growth and maturation of gut epithelial cells. For cxamplc, nuclcosidc supplementation has been shown to increase the rate of gastrointestinal maturation and growth in young rats as determined by mass, RNA, DNA, and protein concentrations and activity of brush border enzymes (Uauy et aL, 1990). Further, evidence also indicates that nucleotide supplementation has the capacity to restore the biochemical atrophy of the 201 Chapter 5 small intestine at proximal and distal sites, and improve intestinal development after chronic diarrhoea (Nunez et at. (1990), 13ucno ct al. (1994)). Additionally, Adjci ct al. (1994) observed that intrapcritoncal and oral (Adjci and Yamamoto, 1995) administration of nucleosides and nucleotides inhibited the incidence of endotoxin-induced bacterial translocation, enhanced survival, decreased intestinal injury (i. e. villus height, crypt depth and total wall thickness were more developed), and reduced the recovery of colony forming units of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive enteric and facultative microorganisms in protein-deficient mice. lijima cl al. (1993) also illustrated that supplementation of total parcntcral nutrition solutions with a nucleotide-nucleoside mixture prevented intestinal mucosal atrophic changes observed in non-supplemented rats, and that the effect was most evident in the ileum. A preliminary study conducted by Espinoza et at. (1992) indicated that a nucleotide-supplemented diet reduced the incidence of diarrhoea in young infants. Furthermore, Nunez ct a/. (1990) demonstrated that dietary nucleotides modulate the intestinal development after lactose-induced chronic diarrhoea in malnourished rats, and Uauy ct at. (1990) reported that diets free of nucleosides and nitrogenous bases may have adverse effects on the gut, further suggesting that dietary nucleotides and nucleosides may have an important implication in the growth and maturation of the small intestine. however, despite this body of evidence, the current studies 5A and 513 produced no significant effects of dietary treatment on gut morphology (in terms of VII and VW), although a significant CD (which was also manifested in the VII: CD ratio) effect was observed in study 5A. This lack of dietary effect could be associated with both the level and duration that the nuclcotide-supplemented diets were W. Ilowever, it should also be noted that there could be species differences since most studies investigating nucleotide supplementation focus on the laboratory rodent. The fact that the degree of villus atrophy was over a relatively short period, and that a similar response was observed for animals in both dietary groups (control and treatment) and in both studies (5A and 513), suggests that this may be related to the intake of feed. This is a well-established phenomenon; indeed Diamond and Karasov, (1983) stated that that the presence of food in the lumen or, in particular, nutrient flows along the gut is one of the most potent stimuli for proliferation of the gastrointestinal tract. Furthermore, in a review by Kelly ct al. (1992), it was stated that the structural and functional maintenance of the intestinal mucosa requires the intake of food through the oral cavity and the actual physical presence of the food within the gut. The luminal nutrition theory relates specifically to villus atrophy post-weaning. This is 202 Chapter 5 supported by data presented by other researchers, such as Kelly et al. (1984), McCracken and Kelly (1984), and van Bccrs-Schrcurs et al. (1998) who suggested that mucosal atrophy post-weaning might be related more to the lack of a continuous supply of substrate than to any antigcnicity in the dict or to inherently low levels of digestive enzyme activity. More specifically, McCracken el al. (1995), and Pluske (1996a; b) illustrated the interdependence between voluntary food intake and mucosal architecture. Pluske (1993) as cited by Pluske (2000) reasoned that if the nutritional stress of interrupted intake at weaning could be overcome, then the transition from sow's milk to solid food would be less traumatic and piglet growth would increase. Since an increase in food intake in the immediate post-weaning period is likely to exert potent stimulatory effects on mucosal growth and function, this may preserve the integrity of the small intestine and promote growth through an enhancement and (or) preservation of digestive and absorptive capacity (Pluske, 2000). Pluske et al. (1996a; c) demonstrated that piglets given cow milk ad libitum (2.5 times maintenance) possessed similar villus heights pre- and post-weaning. Furthermore, the provision of milk at the same level of energy intake as from ad libitum provision of a dry diet resulted in similar gut damage (in terms of villus atrophy and crypt hypcrplasia). This suggests that when food/encrgy intake is maintained after weaning, the typical villus atrophy at 4-5 days post-weaning can be avoided (Bruininx et al., 2001). Bruininx et al. (2001) also stated that the combination of damaged gut architecture and decline in digestive enzyme activity, which often occurs at weaning, is probably due to a decreased supply of nutrients and energy. hence it follows that the prevention of the reduction of nutrient intake is crucial for maintaining both gut integrity and digestive capacity. This is important for realising the optimum performance and health status of the weaned pig (Bruininx et al., 2001). Melin et al. (2001) stated that the gut is a dynamic ecosystem of major complexity, and gastrointestinal health can be defined as the ability to maintain a balance within this system. Furthermore, there is believed to be a positive correlation between environmental stability, high diversity and high community stability. Therefore, a flora with a high diversity is considered to reflect a stable microbial community with a higher colonisation resistance. Weaning introduces a number of factors that could be regarded as environmental instability, resulting in a decreased diversity of the enteric microflora. The bacterial composition of the intestine of mammalian species has been reviewed by a number of authors (e. g. Moughan et al., 1992; Maxwell and Stewart, 1994). 203 Chapter 5 A high diversity of the normal flora is believed to stabilise the intestinal microccosystcm (llcntgcs, 1983). If this stability is disturbed, e. g., stress induced by the process of weaning or by administration of antibiotics, the endogenous as well as exogenous bacteria may colonise the intestine and overgrow, resulting in a low diversity. Ilcncc Katouli ct al. (1994) stated that the evaluation of the diversity of the normal flora is useful for understanding the functional status of the intestine under conditions inducing bacterial translocation. Ilowcvcr, studying the diversity of a bacterial population by conventional methods requires cultural analysis of a large number of bacteria from each sample which is laborious and time consuming. Attempts were made to characterise, identify and enumerate certain microbial species throughout the intestine. It is however important to note that the intestinal microflora comprise an estimated 400 different bacterial species. Furthermore, several microhabitats exist within the intestines that exert a selective influence on the local composition and metabolic activity of the microflora. These micronichcs arc found in the proximal and distal intestine associated with the villus surface, crypts, epithelial associated mucins and luminal mucus (Kelly and King, 2001c). The existence of these microhabitats further complicates the ability to isolate a representative population of microbial species. In both studies 5A and 5\u00df, the total mean number of intestinal coliforms declined significantly throughout the experimental period, whilst also increasing along the length of the intestine. This decline is most likely an age-dependent effect, and is supported by data of Katouli ct al. (1999). Furthermore, Howe et al. (1976) reported that, during the suckling period, the population of coliform bacteria within the gut is rarely static as several bacteria of different scrotypcs (Howe et al., 1976), biotypcs (Minton et al., (1982), Minton ct al., (1985)) and genotypes (Nagy ct al., 1990) arc present at any one time. Katouli ct al. (1999) reported that the diversity of coliforms increased after birth, until at weaning when one dominant but unique coliform phenotype appeared within each pig. In the current studies, general coliform counts were determined but classification into individual scrotypcs was not possible. The current study 5A found that intestinal coliform load was responsive to dietary nuclcotidc-supplcmcntation, causing a dccline in numbcrs. This was not, howcvcr, observed in the animals from study 513. This could be explained by the dietary treatment regimen; from day 0 in study SA, and day -14 in study 513. An acclimatisation period for 204 Chapter 5 both the animal and its microflora to solid diets is considered necessary, and it appears plausible that the animals in study 5\u00df had adapted to the diets and as such possessed a more stable microflora. Additionally, the animals in study 513 underwent a period of E. coli infection that could also affect the dynamics of the gut ecosystem and consequently the resident microflora. An increase in the intestinal E. coil load would result in enhanced competition for energy and nutrients at the gut level, possibly to the detriment of other microbial species. In vitro studies suggest that dietary nucleotides arc capable of modifying the type and growth of the intestinal microflora In vivo. For example Tanaka and Mutai (1980), demonstrated enhanced growth of 13lfidobacteriunr when a basal medium was supplemented with nucleic acids (in addition Gil ct al., 1986a). Dietary nucleotide supplementation exerted a significant impact on faccal coliform numbers; in study 5A, treatment animals possessed higher faecal counts. This is in direct contrast to the intestinal coliform counts that were significantly lower in treatment animals and conflicts with the results documented by Gil et al. (1986a). however, the current results illustrate that treatment animals also exhibited greater numbers of faecal lactobacilli, which is in agreement with Gil et al. (1986a). Conversely the biiidobactcria counts were similar for both control and treatment groups which again conflict with findings of Gil et al. (1986a). Possible explanations for the differences reported between the 2 current studies and between those of Gil et a!. (1986a) could be due to the initial microbial and pathogenic load (both within the intestinal tract and surrounding environment) and consequently the immunological status of the experimental animals. Furthermore, since individual scrotypes were not identified within the current studies, there may have been differences at the scrotype level, which were not investigated. Although equivocal, results from the current studies highlight that dietary nucleotide addition may have several benefits for the development, maturation, and repair of the GIT and may also influence the gut microflora. However it must also be borne in mind that, within animal production, each herd (and indeed individual animals within a herd) will likely possess its own distinct microflora and pathogenic load, which will in turn hamper the establishment of a common dietary supplement which is universally beneficial to all pig production units. In direct contrast to intestinal coliforms, intestinal lactobacilli counts increased significantly throughout the experimental period and also along the length of the intestine in study 5A. This is consistent with findings of Pollmann et al. (1980). This latter pattcm 205 Chapter 5 was also observed in study S13, although the lactobacilli numbers remained relatively constant throughout the experimental period. These results arc in direct contrast to what one would expect, particularly in those animals employed in study SA which were weaned abruptly from a liquid milk diet to a solid post-weaning one. At weaning a large population of lactic-acid producing bacteria would be expected (to break down the lactose present in maternal milk), with this population declining throughout the post-weaning period due to the removal / reduction of the principal substrate lactose (present in large quantities in milk). Again, since the animals in study 513 had been exposed to solid diets for a period of time prior to weaning, both the animals (particularly the digestive system and the relevant enzymes) and their microflora would be expected to have adapted (to some extent) to solid diets. This may explain the relatively constant temporal lactobacilli numbers. Alternatively, the increase in intestinal lactobacilli counts may represent an inter-relationship between intestinal coliform and lactobacilli populations possibly through competition between the 2 species. Furthermore, colon lactobacilli counts were considerably lower in studies 5A and 513 than those presented by Khaddour el al. (1998). The results presented for study 5B (control and treatment diets fed pre-weaning) indicate that both the animals and their microflora had acclimatised to the diets. The temporal changes that were observed in intestinal coliform, and E. coil arc most likely to be age- dependent since it is well documented that coliforms and specifically commensal E. coli species are initial colonisers immediately after birth and numbers decline over time. Specifically, Katouli et al. (1995) reported a greater number of biochemical phenotypes (BPTs) of E. coli isolated from the faeces of sows than their offspring. This suggests that, during the suckling period, only a few phenotypes of E. coll colonise the gut, but the number of phenotypes increase as the piglet ages (Katouli et al., 1995). Moog (1979) and Okcrman (1987) postulated that this could be the result of rcdiffcrcntiation of the mucosal epithelium in piglets during the suckling period. Furthermore, the dietary changes associated with weaning significantly alter the intestinal environment, a consequence of which is modification of the composition of the indigenous flora. In a study conducted by Mclin et al. (1997), pigs at weaning (32 days of age) were exposed to a pathogenic strain of E. coll. No clinical signs of diarrhoea were reported, although the majority of the infected pigs shed the challenge strain for 6 days post- weaning (63% of animals excreted the challenge strain between days 3 and 5 post- weaning). Furthermore, a continuous decline in the number of excreted microorganisms 206 Chapter 5 per gram facccs (in terms of E. coli, cntcrococci and C. pcrfringcns) was also observed, which is consistent with observations in healthy piglets (Smith and Crabb, 1961; Kcnworthy and Crabb, 1963; Mclin et a!., 1997). This is also consistent with the findings of the current study 5B. Moreover, in the same study Mclin ct a!. (1997), observed a higher proliferative response during the 1\" week post-weaning by NILS isolated from E. coli infected pigs. Furthermore, it was suggested that although the E. coil infection was subclinical, it did affect the immune reactivity of the pigs. Indeed, cndotoxin is one of the most potent initiators of acute-phase responses inducing increased cytokine production, which has been demonstrated in various porcine models (Kramer et a!., 1993; Nakajima et a!., 1995). It has been suggested that piglets housed together develop similar coliform floras (Mclin et al., 1997). Although in the current studies the animals were housed individually, there was olfactory and limited tactile contact between animals which may have permitted some cross contamination to occur. An additional factor affecting the indigenous flora is the incidence of diarrhoea. Both diarrhoea and weaning are critical phases in terms of bacterial colonisation because high- level peristaltic movements accompanying diarrhoea and changes in nutritional status of the animal after weaning may greatly affect the physiological status of the gut and hence bacterial colonisation (Katouli et al., 1995). This is demonstrated in the study of Katouli et al. (1995) where most resident strains were not found in the samples taken during the diarrhoea outbreak and 1 week after weaning. It was suggested therefore that, during these periods, the resident phenotypes were present in small numbers in faecal samples and escaped detection. In the current study 513, the incidence of diarrhoea was slight, although the majority of animals displayed watery intestinal contents which may have exerted some influence on the gut ecosystem and more specifically bacterial populations and dynamics. Bifidobactcria (member of Actinomycctaccac family) are numerically abundant in the normal intestinal flora in comparison to lactic acid bacteria (Moore and lloldcman, 1974). This abundance is primarily due the metabolic production of acids (primarily acetate and lactate) and the subsequent reduction of gut pll to levels at which other bacteria arc unable to effectively compete (Tamura, 1983). However, in the current studies, no significant differences with respect to intestinal bifidobactcria counts were evident. The 207 Chapter 5 levels of bifidobactcria reported in the colon of the animals in the current studies are consistent with those reported by Khaddour cl al. (1998). In study 513, there was a significant dietary effect on intestinal p11 with control animals displaying more acidic p11 values. The bifidobacteria population cannot explain this reduction in p11 since no significant difference was reported between the 2 dietary groups. Intestinal bifidobactcria counts tended to fluctuate throughout the experimental period for both control and treatment groups in both studies. As such, it is extremely difficult to draw any firm conclusions from these data. Studies conducted by Gibson and Wang (1994) illustrated that various bifdobactcria species possess the capacity to secrete an anti-microbial substance with a broad spectrum of activity affecting species belonging to the genera Salmonella, Listeria, Campylobacter, Shigella and Vibrio cholerae. Specifically, Wang and Gibson (1993) reported that bifdobactcria grew at the expense of bacteriodes, clostridia and coliforms that were maintained at low levels or reduced. Although this could explain the reduction in coliform numbers throughout the experimental period which was observed in both studies 5A and 5\u00df this is unlikely due to the lack of a dietary response. It is however possible that the dietary treatments did exert some (although non-significant) effect on the intestinal microflora load, albeit somewhat transient and short-lived. This would explain the significant dietary response observed in study 5A (treatment animals displayed significantly lower coliform numbers), and no dietary effect in study 511. however, this temporal reduction in coliform population could also be an age-dependent effect (Katouli et al., 1999) rather than one related to the dietary treatments. Gil et al. (1986b) reported significantly higher faecal bifidobactcria counts in newborn infants (24 - 48 h after birth), suckled on maternal colostrum in comparison to milk formula. It is well documented that maternal colostrum and milk contain higher concentrations of nucleotides than formula milk; no difference was reported in terms of lactobacilli counts. Evidence suggests that nucleotides possess the ability to modify the type and growth of the intestinal microflora. For example, Gil et al. (1986a) observed that young infants fed nucleotide-supplemented formula had higher percentages of faecal bifidobactcria and lactobacilli, and lower percentage of Gram-negative cntcrics (such as cntcrobactcria) compared to formula-fed infants (in addition Tanaka and Mutai (1980)). However, these studies/data do not determine whether the decreased percentage of 208 Clidpirr 5 cntcrobactcria in the stools is duc to a dircct cffcct of nuclcotidcs or is a result of growth competition by the bifidobactcria. Lymphocytes are the key cells controlling the immune response and can be charactcriscd either by their surface proteins or the stimuli that trigger their division. The most important of these proteins arc lectins that bind to cell-surface glycoprotcins inducing subsequent division. These lectins arc commonly isolated from plants, with examples including phytohcmagglutinin (PIHA) obtained from the red kidney bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), concanavalin A (Con A) obtained from the jack bean (Canavalis ensiformts), and pokeweed mitogen (PWM) obtained from the americana). In studies 5A and 513, mitogcn-induced lymphocyte proliferation was used as an in vitro index of cellular immune function, as lymphocyte stimulation in the presence of mitogens is recommended for testing the capacity of cell mediated immunity (lioskinson et al., 1990; Becker and Misfcldt, 1993). It is assumed that greater proliferation in vitro indicates a more effective cell function (Cohen and Herbert, 1996). Lcctins specifically bind sugar residues on glycoprotcin side chains. For example, Con A binds a-mannose and a-glucose, and PIIA binds N-acetyl-gal actosaminc. However, not all lymphocytes respond equally well to all lcctins. Consequently, PIIA primarily stimulates T-cell division, although it has a slight effect on B-cells, Con A stimulates T-cells alone, whereas PWM acts on both T- and B-cells. Although the mechanisms of mitogcnicity arc unclear, the plant lcctins are known to open Cat' channels in the cell membrane with subsequent calcium influx into the cell (Tizard, 2000). Van Burcn et a!. (1983; 1985) provided evidence that any cffccts of nuclcotidc supplemention would be exerted on the T- and not the B-lymphocytes. Hence, the lymphocyte proliferative studies would be expected to detect any effects of dietary nucleotide-supplement. Furthermore, Kulkarni et a1. (1987) provided evidence of a down- regulation of the T-cell mediated response by a nucleotide-free diet. This has also been confirmed by in vivo functional activity studies (Kulkarni et a!., 1994a). In both lymphocyte proliferation experiments (studies 5A and 5B), the same general response was observed. In study 5A (diets fed from weaning (d 0) to d 14), the uptake of thymidinc peaked at day 4 post-weaning and declined thereafter. In study 5B (diets fed from d -14 pre-weaning through to d 14 post-weaning), the uptake of thymidinc was 209 Chanter 5 elevated from day 0 (weaning) until day 4. The pattern of thymidine uptake observed on day 14 in both studies was; (greatest first) PIIA diet 1, Con A diet 1, P11A diet 2 and Con A diet 2. The differential uptake of thymidinc, which was observed between the mitogens PHA and Con A, is explained by the response of different lymphocytes to these lectins. It appears logical therefore that the uptake of thymidine by P11A would be greater than that of Con A, since this mitogen targets a broader range of lymphocytes. Kanitz et al. (2002) reported that T-lymphocytes appear to be more affected by post-weaning stress than 13- lymphocytes (Wallgren et al. (1994), Dominguez-Gcrpc and Lctkovits (1996), Tuchscherer et al. (1998)), and as a result the activity of T-lymphocytcs is more suppressed. The results from studies 5A and 5B support this concept since the uptake of thymidinc was significantly less for the lymphocytes stimulated by Con A than MIA (P=<0.001). Con A stimulates T-cclls alone. Blecha and Kcllcy (1981), suggested that environmental stressors or adverse environments (such as cold), alter the capability of young pigs to mount an effective immune response (through the alteration of physiological control systems that regulate immunological events). Evidence also exists that stress and social events affect specific lymphocyte proliferation responses, (for example, Raab ct al. (1986), Hardy cl al. (1990), Laudenslager et al. (1990), Boccia et al. (1992), McGlone et al. (1993), llcssing et al. (1994), Barnard et al. (1996), Clarke et al. (1996)). This indicates that any immunosuppression could be related more to the stress associated with weaning rather than to any direct effect, such as abrupt dietary change. This is also supported by the fact that cortisol has been shown to affect lymphocyte function adversely, although results arc equivocal (Roth and Kacbcrlc (1982), Wcstly and Kcl Icy (1984)). The initial low uptake of thymidinc observed in study 5A at day 2 post-wcaning, could be related to the period of introduction and the duration that the diets were W. Additionally, the palatability of the diets may also exert some effect since this would influence feed intake levels. A period of adaptation to the solid diets is required (in terms of digestive system, enzymes and gut microflora) for feed intake levels to reach threshold and for the pool of dietary nucleotides to build up (in the case of animals offered diet 2). Although dietary treatment did not exert a significant effect in study SA, there was a trend towards enhanced thymidine uptake by the lymphocytes isolated from animals fed diet 1. This could be related to the degree of functional maturity, development and activity of the lymphocytes. For example, it is well documented that immunosuppression is associated 210 Chanter 5 with weaning (e. g. Blccha and Kelley (1981), 1 Iammcrbcrg el al. (1989), Puppe ct al. (1997), Wattrang et al. (1998)) and it has been suggested that this could be overcome in the presence of nucleotide supplementation. Klasing (1988) reported that changes in the immune response are often a consequence of a change in the availability of that nutrient for its structure or metabolic function in cells of the immune system. This suggests that immunosupression associated with weaning could be induced via low feed intakes or anorexia in the immediate post-weaning period. Although it is also possible that anorexia or feed deprivation could induce stress which could subsequently result in immunosupression. Blccha and Kelley (1981) and I3lecha et al. (1983; 1985) reported impaired antibody-mediated immunity and subsequent physiological modifications detrimental to cellular immune reactivity as a consequence of weaning. Such immunosuppression, could explain the low uptake of methyl-thymidinc immediately post- weaning which was observed in the current study. More specifically, Blccha ct al. (1983) conducted a study in which pigs were weaned at 2, 3,4 and 5 weeks of age; PWM and PIIA stimulated lymphocyte blastogcncsis was performed in comparison to unweaned controls at all 4 ages. The authors reported a suppressed in vivo and in vitro cellular immune response (manifested as lower lymphocyte blastogcnic and delayed-type hypersensitivity responses compared to non- weaned littcrmates) when pigs were weaned at less than 5 weeks of age. In particular, lymphocyte blastogcnic responses to PHA were decreased (P<0.01) in pigs weaned at 2 and 3 weeks of age. This is further supported by data of Kanitz ct aL (2002). In the current studies (5A and 5B), pigs were weaned at 25 days of age which is again consistent with published data reporting reduced immunological responses at this age. However Blecha et al. (1983) reported no significant effect of weaning on PIIA-induced blastogenesis in 5-weck-old pigs. This indicates that the post-weaning immunosuppression is age-dependent, and is perhaps evidence to suggest that piglets would benefit from a later weaning age. Indeed, this is soon to be the case, since legislation has recently been proposed for a minmium weaning age of 4 weeks (28 days). An earlier study conducted by Blccha and Kelley (1981) suggested that the onset of this post-weaning immunosuppression is rapid, occurring by 2 days post-weaning and that the duration of this immunosuppression is relatively short-lived (no immunosuppression reported in pigs weaned at 5 weeks of age). This is also supported by later data of Blccha et al. (1985). Furthermore, it has also been suggested that the capability of young pigs to 211 Cbaptcr 5 synthesise antigen-specific antibody increases with age (Brown (1961), Miller cl a!. (1962)). Since a non-significant response was observed for both control and treatment animals in study 5A (P = 0.097), the enhanced lymphocyte blastogcnic response observed at day 4 post-weaning, could be an age-dependent effect. However, if this were true, one would expect this elevated response to be maintained over a greater period of time (the response declined between days 4 and 6). Furthermore, indirect evidence suggests that weaning may compromise cellular immunity. For example, Osaba and Miller (1964) reported that mice lacking a functional cellular immune system could not synthesise antibodies to sheep erythrocytes. Additionally, Ilayc and Et (1979) demonstrated that pigs immunised at weaning (20 d old) displayed decreased antibody titers to sheep erythrocytes compared with pigs immunised 5d before weaning. This is consistent with findings of Blccha and Kelley (1981). The physiological and immunological mechanism(s) responsible for weaning-impaired cellular immunity are unknown. Data generated from murinc models indicate that glucocorticoids are involved in stress-induced suppression of cellular immune response to sheep erythrocytes (Blecha et al., 1982). Recent in vitro data have shown that physiological concentrations of cortisol added to porcine lymphocyte cultures caused suppression of mitogen-stimulated lymphocyte blastogencsis (Kelley et al., 1982). Worsaac and Schmidt (1980) reported that plasma cortisol concentrations were higher in early-weaned that in non-weaned controls. Moreover, Blccha et al. (1983) deduced that elevated plasma corticosteroid concentrations were responsible for the changes observed in cellular immune responses. However other factors, such as prostaglandins (Goodwin et al. 1981) scrotonin (Bliznakov, 1980) and sympathoadrenal ncurochcmical changes (Stanton and Mueller, 1976), might also have been involved in this weaning-induced immunosuppression. Hammerberg et al. (1989) demonstrated that conventionally raised piglets (wcancd between 4 and 5 weeks of age) exhibited a deficiency in their humoral response that extended from birth up to the fourth (generally the time of weaning in the EU) and sometimes sixth postnatal week. This was based on results from an in vivo inoculation with a low dose of lysozymc, a T-ccll-dcpcndcnt antigen, and in vitro PWM induction of immunoglobulin production in BMC (blood mononuclear cells). Moreover, at the same time (as this humoral deficiency) deficiency in the primary in vitro cellular proliferative 212 C/iaptcr 5 response to lysozyme was obscrvcd with i3MC. The authors suggcstcd that this represented a T-ccll deficient response in pigs up to 4 wccks of agc, as Schwartz ct a!. (1975) statcd that the in vitro proliferative response to aT ccll-dcpcndcnt antigen is attributed to the induction of T-ccll proliferation. Furthermore, Hammerberg et al. (1989) also illustrated that within the initial 4 weeks after birth, the porcine T- and B-cell components exhibited reduced responses to specific antigenic challenge exposure. The authors reasoned that this observation, particularly the decreased in vitro response of the T-cells to the antigen, combined with work conducted by Symons and Clarkson (1979; 1983) that B-cells from neonatal pigs arc fully competent, indicates a deficiency in the T-cell component attributable to either a lack of helper T-cells or to the presence of suppressor T-cells. Furthermore the ability of T-cells obtained from pigs during this age period, to respond to PIIA, suggests that these T-cells were fully competent, given the appropriate stimulant. The lack of fully functional T-cells in response to a low antigen dose could also be attributed to a low production of the lymphokine, IL-2. However, further analyses led Ilammcrberg et al. (1989) to conclude that the putative antigen-specific T-cell deficiency was probably due more to a subtle difference rather than a general lack of mature functional T-cells and probably was determined by the amount of antigen present to stimulate the T-cells from neonatal pigs. In both studies 5A and 5B, the uptake of thymidine declined with age, which is supported by data from other researchers. For example, Iloskinson et al. (1990) reported a high proliferation response of PBLs to mitogen stimulation in the newborn piglet, which declined rapidly with increasing age (proliferation response was 10-fold greater at approx. 3 days than at 6 wks of age). These differences could not be assay-related since each included piglets of different age groups. Similar age-related differences have been reported previously, such as Nielsen (1987) where PBL proliferation responses increased with increasing gestation in fetal piglets. The exact mechanism is unclear, although one suggestion is that PBLs from newborn piglets arc in an inactivated state. Alternatively, PBLs from newborn pigs could be in an immature state and may therefore possess an inherently greater capacity for proliferation. Becker and Misfcldt (1993) also demonstrated that numbers of leukocytes (P<0.08) and lymphocytes (P<0.006) increased with age (between d1 and 30), whereas numbers of neutrophils did not change. This is supported by work conducted by Blccha ct al. (1983), where in vitro lymphocyte blastogenesis showed a linear age effect (P<0.01) with younger pigs exhibiting greater 213 CYiaplcr 5 cellular immune responses, but those effects probably were not physiological and might have reflected the critical periods of incubation of lymphocyte cultures. 13lccha ct a!. (1983) also reported that it is likely that the optimal incubation period for lymphocyte cultures varies with animal age. Jensen and Christensen (1981) demonstrated that lymphocyte cultures from older pigs peaked later than did cultures from young pigs; it was concluded that it is, however, unlikely that the higher [311]-thymidinc incorporation in lymphocyte cultures from older pigs would alter the interpretation of data. Such an effect is not thought to be apparent in the current studies due to the relatively short-time scale involved (14 days). The studies of Jensen and Christensen (1981) and \u00a9lccha et al. (1983) investigated the effects on a weekly basis over a greater age range (from birth up to 5 weeks post-weaning) than the current studies. The E. coli infection encountered in study 5B would further alter the dynamics of the immune system. For example, such an infection could induce proliferation of the lymphocytes in vivo, although it is not clear whether such influences would be manifested over the relatively short experimental period (14 d). Although bacterial enumeration results demonstrate that E. colt colonisation occurred at weaning, clinical signs of disease were not observed until 6 days post-weaning. It is possible therefore that the low proliferation responses of lymphocytes isolated from day 6 and 14 could be due to the fact that these lymphocytes had already been stimulated in vivo by the E. colt pathogen. It should also be borne in mind that this is occurring concomitantly with the immunosuppression of the pigs associated with the process of weaning. Other factors influencing the immune system include the level of exposure of the animals to tile E. coli infection. The exposure level of the E. colt in the water was 106 cfu / ml. This would appear to be similar to levels used to experimentally induce E. coil infection (Kelly (1990), Melin et al. (2000)). Once the E. coli was detected in the drinking water system (day 6), it was immediately sanitised thus removing the infectious agent. In the animals that were offered the nucleotide-supplemented diet, it is possible that the T- cells had already achieved optimum development and activation (due to the supply of preformed pyrimidincs which arc required for the proper development and activation of T-cells (Kulkarni et al., 1994b). It seems plausible therefore that lymphocytes isolated from treatment animals could be at a more advanced stage of development and activation than those isolated from control animals. Consequently, such lymphocytes (from the treatment group) would possess a reduced capacity to develop and proliferate when 214 Chanter 5 compared to lymphocytes isolated from animals fcd non-nucleotide supplemented diets. This is further supported by data of Kulkarni et al. (1984), who demonstrated that feeding a nucleotide-free diet caused functional impairment ofT-lymphocytes in mice. This could be due to the defect in differentiation and maturation of T-lymphocytcs associated with immunodeficiency. However, this is unlikely to have occurred in the current studies since the diets may not have been fed for sufficient duration for this to be effective. This is further supported by findings of Becker and Misfcldt (1993) who suggested that low PBL proliferation responses could be affected by stress such as that of weaning and associated management practices. One would expect such responses to be relatively short-term and transient in nature. Furthermore, it is also noteworthy that the control diet was not specifically nucleotide-free merely not nucleotide-supplemented, and as such was formulated to meet the nutritional requirements of the animals and was not deficient in any manner. This may explain the non-significant dietary responses observed in the current studies, since all the animal's nutritional requirements were being met. Dritz et a!. (1995) indicated that immune activation could limit growth performance. If this phenomenon is true, the data from study 5A (but not study 513 where no significant dietary effects were reported) support this, since a trend (P=0.073) was observed towards an enhanced growth response for animals fed the control diet. This is further supported by the elevated growth performance commonly associated with segregated early-weaning production systems (as a consequence of reduced pathogen load). This enhanced performance (see Harris (1988) and Dritz et a!. (1995)) has been attributed to suppression or elimination of inflammatory cytokine production. The infectious load present in segregated production systems is less, hence it is postulated that the enhanced growth is a consequence of reduced pathogenic organism load and a subsequent reduction in immune system stimulation. This combination of reduced pathogenic load and immune stimulation result in lower inflammatory cytokinc production. Furthermore, studies conducted by Klasing et a!. (1987) and Blecha et a!. (1994) have demonstrated that increased levels of the inflammatory cytokinc interlcukin-1 have resulted in decreased growth performance. Furthermore, Klasing (2001) suggested that 6% of the net energy ingested is directed towards mounting an immune response. It is logical to assume that, immediately post- weaning, piglets possess enhanced requirements for energy and nucleotides (due to their involvement in protein synthesis and cell division) since the dietary supply has declined, because weaning is generally associated with a reduced feed intake. Antigenic challenge, which is common under regular weaning conditions, may further increase the demand for 215 C qpicr 5 nucleotides (Jyonouchi, 1994). However, this was not substantiated by the results of Sijbcn et al. (1998) who reported that the provision of dietary nucleotides did not reduce the piglets' energy demand. Furthermore, the same study demonstrated enhanced animal performance in terms of growth and energy retention in control compared to those fed nucleotide-supplemented (4 g/kg) diets. An explanation for these results could be that the availability of nucleotides in the control group in both the present study and that of Sijbcn et al. (1998) was adequate, so depletion did not occur. This appears possible since Jyonouchi (1994) demonstrated that a healthy human only utilises less than 5% of total dietary nucleotides. A second possible explanation for the enhanced performance of the control group could be that the dc novo synthesis of nucleotides in this group increased compared to the treatment group. However, this explanation was discredited in the study of Sijbcn et al. (1998) since, for this to occur, ME, (ME for maintenance) would be expected to be larger in the control animals because dc novo synthesis is considered energetically expensive (Jyonouchi, 1994). Sijben et al. (1998), indicated that MEm was in fact larger in treatment than control animals. Finally, a third possible explanation could be a negative effect of supplemental dietary nucleotides as a result of an overdose, which is known to be toxic. However, the concentration of supplemental nucleotides (4 g/kg) utilised in both the current study and that of Sijbcn et al. (1998), was according to the manufacturers recommendations and also below the maximum safety level, when this is converted from man to piglet expressed in metabolic weight, as recommended by the Protein-caloric advisory group (1975). Carver (1999) reported that dietary nucleotides play a role in the maintenance of the immune response. While the mechanism is unknown, data suggest that exogenous nucleotides supplied by the diet may contribute to the nucleotide pool available to stimulated leukocytes, which rapidly turn over and thus have increased nucleotide requirements. Furthermore, Perignon ct al. (1987) found a limited capacity of lymphocytes to salvage pyrimidines, while Marijnen et al. (1989) suggested that the nucleotide salvage pathway may not be capable of providing sufficient purine nucleotides for proliferating lymphocytes. Activation of lymphocytes causes a rapid increase in the synthesis of nucleotides, which arc required first for the increase in energy metabolism and later as precursors for nucleic acid synthesis. These studies suggest that proliferating lymphocytes require an exogenous supply of nucleotides for optimum function. Induction of lymphocyte proliferation is accompanied by a dramatic increase in intracellular 216 Chapter 5 nucleotide pools and the expression of large numbers of transmcmbranc nucleotide / nucicoside transporters (Carver and Walker, 1995). Wattrang et al. (1998) reported a significant (P<0.05) decrease in Con A-induced proliferation after weaning and again after transfer to the finishing unit. This supports the view that the proliferation response is reduced during periods of 'stress' such as weaning, and consequently that the piglets arc immuncompromised at such times. These data support the response observed in the present study (5A) where Con A-induced proliferation was reduccd/compromised at weaning. Additionally, in the study of Wattrang et al. (1998), the Con A-induced proliferation response increased between days 2 and 7 post-weaning and decreased slightly between days 17 and 21 post-weaning. In the present study (5A), the enhanced proliferation was only short-term since the response declined by day 6 post-weaning. Differences observed between the two studies may be due to the different temporal sampling pattern (present study; 0,2,4,6 and 14 days post- weaning; Wattrang et al. (1998); -6,0,3,7 and 21 days post-weaning). Other factors include the disease status of the animals, effect of transport (albeit a very short distance); in the study of Wattrang et al. (1998) the animals were group housed after weaning and retained on the same unit, compared to individually-housed and transported to the experimental unit in the present study. Suganuma et al. (1986) presented evidence that T-lymphocytes might suppress the differentiation of B lymphocytes into plasma cells in vivo; T-lymphocytes from suckling pigs were added to cultures of PBL from adult pigs and underwent mitogcn stimulation. Suppressor activity of T-lymphocytes was consistently demonstrated throughout the neonatal and suckling period, although this declined with age and disappeared at 5 weeks of age. Furthermore, the addition of adult T-lymphocytcs enhanced the differentiation of adult PBL more strongly than that of T-lymphocytes isolated from suckling pigs at 6 weeks of age. Moreover, this period of suppressor T-lymphocyte (up to 5 weeks of age) activity closely correlated to the period of poor antibody production. If suppression of B- lymphocyte differentiation were to occur, this could further enhance post-weaning immunosuppression with subsequent enhanced susceptibility to local infections. In study 5B, thymidine uptake was elevated at the time of wcaning (day 0), and remained so until day 4. Conversely, in study 3 the response was compromised at weaning but increased after 2 days post-weaning. Although no firm conclusions can be drawn from a 217 Chapter 5 comparison of studies 5A and 513, the response observed in study 513 could be a direct effect of the dietary regimen as both diets were fed from day 14 pre-weaning. No significant differences between dietary treatments were evident. This suggests that the response of PBL to mitogen stimulation could be a function of feed intake per se and not related to the actual dietary components (i. e. nucleotide addition). Additionally, it should be noted that in the study of Wattrang et al. (1998) pigs were creep fed from 7 days pre- weaning and weaned at 28 days of age and a reduced response to Con A post-weaning was observed. The mitogen induced responses may be related to the duration that creep feed was offered and the subsequent levels of feed intake. Unfortunately, creep feed intake levels are exceptionally difficult to record (piglets arc not housed individually pre- weaning, and feed is inevitably spilled and wasted) and were not recorded in either the current study or that of Wattrang et al. (1998). The average weaning weight was 6.50 and 8.89 kg for animals in studies 5A and 5B respectively. Since the animals in both studies were the same genotype and reared under the same management regimen, the enhanced weaning weight achieved in study 5B is most liklcy attributable to the intake of creep feed prc-wcaning. This suggests that in study 5B, the piglets were in fact consuming significant quantities of creep feed. This appears to be in contrast to findings of Pluske (1995) who stated that, generally, dry creep feeds have little or no effect on weaning weight due to low intake levels. It should also be noted that in study 513, the piglets were undergoing a disease challenge with E. coli which would stimulate the immune system resulting in more nutrients and energy being partitioned towards establishing the immune system throughout the immediate post-weaning period (thus exhibiting lower rates of growth for both control and treatment groups). It is however not possible to ascertain whether any enhanced feed intake in study 5B was attributable to the disease challenge or related to familarity of the piglets to the diet. Any enhanced feed intake is however likely to be related in part to the larger body size of the animals utilised in study 5B due to the intake of creep feed pre-weaning; it follows that a larger animal requires more nutrients for maintenance. Poor FCRs were recorded in both studies 5A and 5B throughout the initial post-weaning period. However, in study 5B only 4 animals displayed negative FCR (due to weight loss), compared to 6 in study 5A, which again is most likely attributed to the creep feed intake in study 5B. It should also be noted however that both fasting and excess feed intake have been demonstrated to contribute to immunosupression (Klasing, 1988). 218 Chanter 5 It may also be postulated in study 513 that, since the animals had undergone a 14 d period of adaptation to the diets (i. e. creep feed), the process of weaning may not have been as abrupt or as stressful an event compared to animals not offered creep feed (i. e. study 3). Thus, the severity of immunosuppression experienced by the piglets as a consequence of weaning may have been less. This is demonstrated by the elevated uptake of thymidine that was observed at day 0 (weaning) and is further supported by data presented from study 3, which has already been discussed. If this were a dietary effect per se, one would expect this to be a relatively transient response since the animals would adapt to the solid post-weaning diets, which indeed appeared to be the case in both studies. The PI3L proliferation responses to mitogen stimulation could be further explained by the `antigenicity' theory associated with post-weaning diets. Evidence concerning this issue is somewhat equivocal. For example, Miller el al. (1984a; c) stated that transient hypersensitivity to the antigenic components the wcanling diets may induce post- weaning diarrhoea (PWD) and effect modifications to both gut morphology and the immunological system. The authors reasoned that while the consumption of small amounts of creep feed (less than 100g) `primes' hypersensitivity and exacerbate PWD, adequate consumption of creep feed before weaning may protect pigs from reactions to dietary antigens post-weaning and eliminate PWD. It is possible therefore that the animals involved in study 5\u00df could have been experiencing or combating some degree of transient hypersensitivity due to low levels of creep feed intakes (although evidence suggests that the duration and severity of transient hypersensitivity would depend on the level of feed intake prc-wcaning) at the time of and immediately post-weaning. Miller et al. (1984a) reported that a prc-weaning intake of at least 400g of feed was necessary to prevent post-weaning diarrhoea. In study 5A, the diets were not introduced until day 0, hence such a hypersensitivity response could be somewhat delayed due to the incidence of anorexia immediately post-weaning. This is supported by findings of McCracken et al. (1999) (discussed above). Furthermore, malnutrition or nutritional deficiency (post-weaning anorexia) is reported to exert important and significant influences on cell-mediated immunity. Such effects of anorexia are more likely to occur in study 5A than 5\u00df since mean feed intake was greater in study 4 throughout the initial 6 days post-weaning. In a study conducted by Pizzini et al. (1990), the effects of protein malnutrition and starvation were tested in animals fed nuclcotide- free or yeast RNA-supplemented diets. In the protein malnutrition model the animals were fed the protein-free diet for 7 to 10 d and then offered protein-free, nucleotide-free, 219 Cfiaptrr S commercial diet or yeast-RNA diets. Poplitcal lymph node assays were performed and, although the nucleotide-free animals regained as much weight as the other groups (except protein-free), the nucleotide-free animals did not regain significant poplitcal lymph node reactivity. In the starvation study, PIIA- and Con A-stimulated blastogcncsis assays demonstrated that animals previously maintained on the ycast\"ItNA diet displayed a significantly higher response. These studies clearly demonstrate that in periods of nutritional stress dietary nucleotides, in addition to energy or protein alone, are required to restore and maintain the cellular immune system. Moreover, Hampson and Kidder (1986) observed that the intake of creep feed pre-weaning did not encourage greater intake in the initial 5 days post-weaning (however feed intake levels prc-wcaning fell well short of the 600g recommended by English (1980)). Stokes et al. (2001) postulated that a transient aberrant immune response to antigens in the post-weaning diet may predispose to bacterial infection and disease. Numerous researchers have suggested that immune responses to dietary antigen, especially those derived from soya protein, are an important cause of local inflammation and subsequent villus atrophy (Dunsford et a!. (1989), Li ct al. (1990), Li el a!. (1991), Bailey el a!. (1993), Miller et al. (1994)). McCracken et al. (1999) concluded that soya-induced inflammation, if present, is likely to compromise intestinal morphology due to local inflammation caused by anorexia in the immediate post-weaning period. Extensive research is required into the possible cellular mechanisms linking hypersensitivity and the shaping of the villus epithelium at weaning. Although hypersensitivity is a contentious issue, there are sound nutritional reasons why soya protein should not be used at too a high concentration in weaner diets; 2- to 3-week old pigs cannot utilise bean meal effectively because they lack adequate levels of the digestive enzyme systems needed to break down complex proteins and carbohydrates (although this is influenced by the degree of heat treatment to which the soya-beans are exposed) (Kelly and King, 2001b). In the current studies soya was included at a rate of less than 200 gfkg which is generally considered acceptable for piglets of this age to degrade. However, most workers have not been able to substantiate this suggestion of hypersensitivity (Ilampson and Smith (1986), Hampson et al. (1988), Kelly et al. (1990)). No PWD was obscrved in study 5A, and that cncountcrcd in study 5B was attributcd to E. coli infection. Stokes et al. (1987) reported increases in cntcrocytc turnover and villus atrophy in reponse to transient hypersensitivity reactions, with subsequent proliferation of 220 Chanter 5 E. coli and the induction of post-weaning diarrhoea. In study 513, the water system was identified as the source of E. coli infection. The conclusions of Stokes et al. (1987) do not however appear to be consistent with the findings of study 513, where the severity of villus atrophy (in comparison to study 5A) appeared to be less. It is however also possible that any beneficial effects in terms of gut morphology due to dietary treatment and regimen, could have been counterbalanced by consequences of hypersensitivity reactions. Miller et al. (1984b) suggested that E. coil is an opportunist rather than a primary pathogen. It has also been suggested that the negative influence of weaning itself on immune functions might contribute to the development of PWD (Bailey et al. (1992), Hessing et al. (1995), Wattrang et al. (1998)). This suggests that in study 513, the E. coli infection may have been exacerbated by the process of weaning and the occurrence of any hypersensitivity reactions. Furthermore, if soybeans have not been appropriately heat treated, the young piglet may be unable to digest fully the soya-bean protein resulting in undigested protein reaching the duodenum supporting more bacterial growth with subsequent gastrointestinal damage (Miller et al., 1984b). however in studies reported, transient hypersensitivity reactions were also accompanied by adverse effects on host performance. This cannot be ascertained from the current study since there was no negative control which was not offered creep feed pre-weaning. However in comparison to the animals in study 5A, the growth rates were slightly higher in study 513, although this is likely to be an effect of body size. The results of Li et al. (1990) support the hypothesis that orally administered antigens evoke a local immune response with subsequent inferior performance of pigs at 28 days of age. This is also supported by data of Barratt et al. (1978) and Klasing (1988). Furthermore, in the study of Klasing (1988) no proliferative responses of blood or intestinal lymphocytes to purified soya protein were reported indicating that antigenic proteins of soya proteins do not evoke cell-mediated immune responses. A number of mechanisms could explain the positive responses obtained from feeding supplementary dietary nucleotides reported in the literature; first, eliciting specific immune reactions could evoke the response. Second, a nucleotide-induced enhancement in growth could be the consequence of enhanced non-specific immunity. Third, because tolerance to oral antigens can be increased (Mowat (1987), Stokes et al. (1997) sec also Miller et al. (1984a; b; c)), including a dietary immuno-potentiator such as a nucleotide source post-weaning might alleviate soybean-induced delayed-type hypersensitivity by 221 Chapter S enhancing tolerance to soya-bean proteins. Finally, supplementary nucleotides could reduce inflammatory cytokine responses (Poutsiaka et al., 1993), thereby allowing energy and nutrients to be partitioned towards growth (Klasing cl al., 1987). Jyonouchi et al. (1994) suggested that exogenous nucleotide and nuclcosides can be rapidly incorporated into the tissue nucleotide pool and rapidly restore impaired T-hclpcr cell functions (i. e. accomplished in a relatively short period of time (8 days)). however, it should also be noted that in the studies of Jyonouchi et al. (1994), the dietary treatments were administered intraperitoneally ensuring more rapid absorption into the nucleotide pool than if administered in the feed. In the current studies, the nucleotide was incorporated into the diet and this combined with the low level of feed intake immediately post-weaning, indicates that nucleotide absorption would be somewhat slower than that in the study of Jyonouchi et al. (1994). As such, it follows that it may be more beneficial to feed the nucleotide-supplemented diets for a longer period of time than that employed in study 5A. It is further suggested that feeding nucleotide sources as a creep feed would yield optimum results, which would have the benefit of enhancing DLWG throughout the initial post-weaning period (due to increased feed intake) and reducing the impact of any potential transient hypersensitivity responses to the dietary components (if feed intakes of >100g can be achieved pre-weaning). Brown-Borg et al. (1993) reported that pigs with high baseline and stimulated cortisol concentrations expressed reduced lymphocyte proliferative responses to mitogens in vitro. Furthermore, weaning has been shown to increase serum cortisol concentration so it follows that such animals immediately post-weaning may have reduced proliferation responses. Brown-Borg et al. (1993) went on to suggest that neonatal pigs with low cortisol response to stress may have enhanced ability to respond immunologically and, therefore, may have a definite advantage over stress-prone pigs. As such it may be possible that, in the present studies, cortisol levels exerted some influence on the mitogen- induced proliferation reponses. In conclusion, the studies reported in this chapter have contributed to the limited knowledge of dietary nucleotide-supplementation in the post-weaned piglet. Furthermore, the studies were the first to investigate the effects of nucleotide-supplementation on aspects of gut health and function. The exact mechanism of dietary nucleotide effects on gut morphology and immunity arc unknown. Additional studies arc thus required to 222 Chapler 5 elucidate the complicated interactions between gut microflora, physiology, hormones, and immunity, and their contribution to post-weaning growth check in the newly weaned piglet. 223 CHAPTER 6 GENERAL DISCUSSION The studies detailed within this thesis investigated the contribution and significance of nutritional influences, on the complex and multi-factorial problem of post-weaning growth check in the piglet. Multi-disciplinary investigations focussed upon the relationship between post-weaning nutrition and the gut ecosystem with specific emphasis on gut physiology, immunity and microflora. This chapter encompasses all the main findings in this thesis, adopting a holistic perspective of the research and suggests possible studies for the future. Whilst the specific limitations and difficulties encountered during the current study arc detailed in individual chapters, common concerns include the availability and uniformity of the experimental animals used, i. e. physiological and immunological status and gut microflora population. Increases in animal numbers and treatment replicates, in addition to sampling frequency and microflora characterisation arc recommended. Further improvements involve the sampling of animals throughout the pre-weaning period, immunohistology and the refinement of key techniques, such as intestinal microflora recovery and enumeration. These recommendations should be incorporated into future studies. The pigs used in this study were raised under conventional conditions that exposed them to varying environmental factors and possibly to other unknown variables. Because of this, the subsequent conclusions only suggested a particular immunologic or physiologic tendency to such pigs. An attempt to limit genetic variability was made by using the same pigs which were from a multiplier breeding herd where genetic variability would be less than conventional commercial units, at the various times selected for testing. However, the relatively small number of pigs and litters might not have been sufficient to control all variables and thus placed limitations on the interpretation of the data. It is well established that, in post-weaned piglets, growth check is irrevocably linked to post-weaning feed intake and luminal nutrition, which consequently has a hypotrophic effect on epithelial growth, development and differentiation (Pluskc, 2000). The actual ingestion of food and its physical presence in the gut per se arc essential for the structural 224 Chapter 6 and functional maintenance of the intestinal mucosa (see Kelly et al., 1992). As such, the weaning transition is generally accompanied by adverse changes in intestinal morphology and reduced absorptive capacity (sec Pluske et al. (1997), van Beers-Schreurs ct al. (1998) McCracken et al. (1999), Tang et al. (1999)). Furthermore, perturbation of the gut ecosystem commonly occurs at the time of weaning, and is known to exert a major impact on subsequent growth and performance of the post-weaned piglet (see Kelly and King, 2001a). Despite this, a direct link between solid feed intake and gut physiology has not been established, in that an optimum or threshold level has not been determined below which adverse changes in intestinal morphology occur. However, Pluskc el al. (1996a; b) was able to preserve the structure and function of the small intestine post-weaning through the provision of a liquid milk diet throughout this period. Conversely, in the same study, piglets offered a dry starter diet displayed villus atrophy and crypt hypcrplasia. Indeed generally the current studies appear to limit the duration of villus atrophy post- weaning to the initial 6 days post-weaning. liampson (1986) demonstrated that villus atrophy occurred until the fifth day post-weaning which is further supported by findings of Cera et al. (1988) who reported a reduction in the microvilli length 3 to 7 days post- weaning. Generally, villus height begins to increase from 5 to 8 days post-weaning compared to unweaned pigs who experience only a slight reduction in villus height. Evidence suggests that such adverse changes only occur after weaning if there is continuous absence from the sow. Hampson (1983) as cited by Pluske (2001), conducted a study with pigs that were weaned for 2 days and then returned to the dam for 3 days. These pigs displayed crypt elongation, which was only equivalent to that of pigs weaned for 2 days. Furthermore, Hampson (1983) as cited by Pluskc (2001) also suggested that the consumption of food after weaning is necessary for crypt hyperplasia to occur, but a lack of intake may not be necessary for villus atrophy to occur. The preliminary study investigating the acid binding-capacity (ABC) of post-weaning solid diets (Chapter 3), demonstrated that it is possible to improve intestinal morphology characteristics. The ABC of the diet is thought to influence the stomach p11 with subsequent beneficial effects on digestion and creating an adverse environment for potentially pathogenic microorganisms. Despite the improvements in intestinal structure post-weaning, these effects were not manifested in increased performance, f. e. DLWG. The improvements in intestinal structure may not have been of significant magnitude to influence performance parameters. 225 Citapirr O The major finding of the ZnO study was the distinct positive rclationship between dietary ZnO supplementation and post-weaning growth performance (Chapter 4). This is consistent with findings of Mavromichalis ci al. (2000), however the mechanisms by which dietary ZnO exerts its effects arc poorly understood. Nevertheless, the current study did indicate a positive influence of dietary ZnO supplementation on feed intake levels that may account, in part, for the enhanced growth performance. This finding was not however manifested through modifications of intestinal morphology or the lactobacilli and coliform populations studied. It appears possible, however, that dietary ZnO exerts an effect either luminally or systemically (Carlson fit a!.. 1999). Further research is rcquircd to determine the mechanism responsible for the enhanced feed intake response. The current study highlights the complex nature of the growth promotant properties ofdictary ZnO supplementation, and the requirement for further research to investigate the multi- disciplinary and complex interactions responsible. The dietary nucleotide-supplemented studies (Chapter 5) demonstrated that modifications to the gut ecosystem in terms of intestinal morphology and microflora arc probably due to the dietary feed intake per se, and not the actual dietary composition. This theory has been demonstrated by a number of researchers, i. e. Kelly ct a!. (1984), McCracken and Kelly (1984), Kelly ct al. (1991b), Pluskc et a!. (1996c). Quantifying the possible contribution of food intake per so on intestinal morphological and biochemical modifications is onerous due to the necessity to measure feed intake. Kelly ct a!. (1984) and McCracken and Kelly (1984) overcame this through the adoption of gastric intubation in order to regulate feed consumption and thus minimise individual variation in feed intake post- wcaning. Voluntary feed intake throughout the initial {post-weaning period has been shown to be both low and highly variable. Indeed, many piglets ollen fail to consume adequate food to meet their maintenance energy requirement (Bark el al. (1986), Le Dividich and Sevc (2000)). however, a number of researchers have provided evidence that nucleotide supplementation has a direct effect on intestinal structure and function. Specifically, Uauy el al. (1990) reported enhanced mucosal protein, DNA, villus height and disaccharidasc activities in the intestine of wcanling rats fed a nuclcotidc- supplemented diet (8 g/kg). Additionally, other investigators report an accelerated intestinal recovery following food deprivation in rats fed nucleotide-supplemented diets (Ortega et a!., 1995). Pickering ct aL (1998) reported that infants fed nuclcotidc- supplemented formula had a significantly lower incidence of diarrhoea compared with infants fed unsupplcmented formula. 226 Chanlcr 6 A focal point for future research is both to identify and achieve the critical feed intake levels at which villus atrophy, crypt hyperplasia and associated reductions in digestive enzyme levels and activities do not occur. In essence, this is probably only achievable through the introduction of creep feeds prc-wcaning in order to attain sufficient levels of feed intake post-weaning without inducing hypersensitivity reactions. The introduction of creep feeds across the UK pig industry is most likely to occur in the near future due to CU legislation increasing the minimum weaning age to 4 weeks. The first current nucleotide study (5A) demonstrated a reduction in intestinal coliform count post-weaning in piglets offered the nucleotide-supplemented diet. This is considered beneficial to the host since these species are often considered detrimental to the health and well being of the host and are frequently pathogenic in nature. Such an effect was not demonstrated in the second nucleotide study (5\u00df), which may be attributable to the fact that the diets were offered from 14 days pre-weaning allowing the gut microflora to adapt and stabilise in response to the dietary change. Additionally, these animals were exposed to an E. coli challenge which may have exerted some influence on the gut microflora populations and may have resulted in the maintenance of the E. coli population which would otherwise have declined in response to both the dietary supplements and with advancing age of the host. Both factors arc likely to have exerted an influence. The findings of study 5A, also suggest that the piglets were immunosuprcsscd at the time of weaning. A number of authors (Blecha and Kelley, (1981), Hammerberg et al. (1989), Puppe et al. (1997)) have demonstrated this phenomenon. Conversely, in study 5B, no evidence of immunosuppression was indicated. This could be a direct effect of the creep feed both in terms of allowing the piglets a 14 day period to adapt to the diets prior to weaning, or it may represent a transient hypersensitivity reaction to either the dietary antigens as a consequence of low levels of feed intake pre-weaning or to the colonising E. coil bacteria. Makinde et al. (1997) suggested that dietary antigens might be responsible for inducing villus atrophy. Hence, any diminished growth may therefore be due to reduced digestive and absorptive capacities as a result of intestinal mucosal damage. This is unlikely to be a major influence in the current nucleotide studies since villus atrophy was only apparent in the initial few days post-weaning. Such concepts have been discussed previously in chapter 5. Study 5B suggests that creep feeding may be beneficial in terms of reducing the stress associated with abrupt weaning and its consequences, in 227 Cbnt'tcr 6 addition to enhancing fccd intake levels and DL\\VG throughout the post\"wcaning period. This latter benefit is supported by the results of study 5C where enhanced DLWO was observed in animals offered a nucleotide-supplemented diet from 7 days prc. wcaning through to 25 days post-weaning. It has also been suggested that adverse changes in intestinal morphology is a consequence of local immune responses (Atowat and Ferguson, 1982). Furthermore, these results reported by hiowat and Ferguson (1982) arc comparable with those which occurred within the intestine of weaned piglets (Kcnworthy and Allen, 1966; Kcnworthy ct at. 1967; Kcnworthy, 1976), an observation which has lead to the suggestion that the changes may have an immunological basis (Miller et at, 1984c). It has also been proposed by several authors e. g. I lampson and Smith (1986), Kclly (1990), Kelly ct al. (1990) that villus atrophy and crypt hypcrplasia may be related to the withdrawal of 'intrinsic factors', such as IgA, in sows' milk which may also contain an array of biologically active peptides (e. g. epidermal growth factor) and compounds (e. g. polyamines) that may stimulate protein and DNA synthesis and have functional roles in intestinal differentiation. The causes of morphology modifications arc mostly likely to be a combination of the factors discussed above. However, despite the vast research attention directed towards low feed intakes and anorexia post-weaning, over-consumption or hyper-alimentation also presents probicros. For example, Lcccc et a!. (1983) demonstrated that newly weaned pigs challenged with cnctcropathogcnic E. coli and rotavirus were more likely to develop prolonged diarrhoea if they were subjected to a dietary regimen involving a high nutrient intake fed 3 times a day. Conversely, a less severe response occurred if this daily total intake was divided into 24 portions and offered hourly, and the least severe response was observed in piglets fed one third of this total nutrient intake. The rationale, which explains this, is the knowledge that newly weaned pigs suffer alterations in digestive and absorptive capacity, thus a large nutrient intake may be insufficiently digested and absorbed and hence contribute an osmotic component to any pathogen-induced diarrhoea aller weaning. Indeed, this phenomenon has long been recognised by pig producers who often temporarily restrict dietary intakes in the period immediately after weaning. This is also supported by findings of l lampson and Smith (1986). Furthermore, Klasing (1988) also reported that over consumption of feed could result in impaired cellular immunity. 228 Chvrnrr 6 Hillman (2001) stated that reports concerning cffcctivc growth-promoting substances, which have included microbiological investigation of the gut microllora, show that improved gut health is linked to an increase in the numbers of lactic acid bacteria and/or a decrease in the numbers of coliform bacteria. As the coliform bacteria typically comprise about 1% of the total microbial population of the intestine, while Lactobacillus species account for more than 90% of the population (Khaddour ct al., 1998), it is not immediately apparent why a reduction in number of coliforms, or an increase in lactobacilli, should make much difference to the absorption of digested material by the gut. Hillman (2001) reasoned that the explanation for this might lie in both the formation of lactic acid by lactobacilli and the sugar-utilising qualities of coliforms. The principal product of metabolism of sugars by Lactobacillus spp. is lactic acid, which may be absorbed and used by the animal. The degradation of feed in the gut by lactobacilli, therefore, need not result in a great deal of energy loss to the animal. Alternatively, the coliform bacteria use oxygen, which is present at appreciable quantities in the piglet intestine (Hillman et al., 1993). The coliform bacteria have a complete set of tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes, so that the products of aerobic sugar breakdown by coliforms will be carbon dioxide and water, resulting in complete loss of the feed energy. In this scenario, any reduction in the numbers and/or activity of coliform bacteria would be beneficial to the animal. Additionally, any increase in lactic acid bacteria in relation to the total bacterial load could also prove beneficial, since these bacteria arc unable to extract more than a small fraction of the available energy from the feed. Acidification as a result of the activity of Lactobacillus spp. may also assist digestion by chemical hydrolysis of certain feed components, and would inhibit the activity of coliform pathogens. Hillman et al. (1994) developed an in vitro fcrmcntation systcm capable of maintaining at least part of the microbial population of the contents of the porcine ileum. The counts obtained from the fcrmcntcr at 50pmol/1 dissolved oxygen over the p11 range 6.0 - 8.0 approximated to the relative viable counts of the lactobacilli and coliforms reported In vivo in the posterior regions of the ileum (Smith and Jones, 1963). The numbers of coliforms arc generally around 103 - 105 in the anterior ileum of healthy pigs, and in this region of the gut the predominance of lactobacilli over coliforms in healthy animals may 229 Chapter 6 be 1 or 2 orders of magnitude (Pollmann cl al., 1980; Pollmann ct al., 1984). The coliform levels recorded in the ileum in the current studies (Chapters 4& 5) were slightly higher than those reported by (Pollmann cl al., 1980; Pollmann ct al., 1984), although this could be an age-related effect since coliform numbers decline with advancing age. The current results are however, consistent with those determined by Khaddour et al. (1998). I utther, this concept is supported by the findings of the current studies and also Katouli ct al. (1999). Lactobacilli counts followed a similar but opposite pattern, with numbers increasing both throughout the experimental period and along the length of the intestine. Again this is consistent with the investigations of (Pollmann cl al., 1980; Pollmann ct al., 1984). The pH of the small intestine and stomach is important as it affects the activity of enzymes (which function within an optimum range) and the ability of potentially pathogenic microorganisms to colonise these structures. However, in a study conducted by Hillman el at. (1994), it was observed that changes in pit over the range 6.0 - 8.5 had relatively little effect on the total numbers of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in the porcine ileum. Most studies have demonstrated a rise in pll in the small intestine, and in the caccum and colon, with pH values typically between 6.0 and 7.7 (Stewart et al., 1993). However, Vervaeke el al. (1973) recorded higher p11 values in animals between 3 and 7 weeks of age of 5.3 and 8.4 in the stomach and posterior small intestine respectively. Hillman (2001) reported alkaline pit values (typically pit 18.5 to 9.2) in sirrt in the caccum and colon. Both the pH values presented by Vcrvaeke ct al. (1973) and Millman (2001) are slightly more alkaline that those observed in studies 5A and 5B. Hillman (2001) also observed that the pH of the gut contents fell rapidly on withdrawal from the gut, which could account in part for the lower pH values reported by other investigators. Vervackc et al. (1973) also documented between 10' and 10\u00b0 anaerobes in the small intestine of piglets, which is further supported by findings of Hillman el al. (1994). The current studies suggest that dietary modification can influence significantly host intestinal health and performance. }lowever, this method of enhancing immune status and gut health is somewhat limited due to the impact of environmental factors such as pathogen load and physiological and subsequent physiological immune status of the animals at the time of weaning. 230 chyplrr d The current work has focussed upon nutritional influences on the gut ccosystcm, and has highlighted the complex nature of this. Furthermore, factors contributing to changes in intestinal structure and microflora load and their interactions have also been highlighted. In particular, the extensive influence of luminal nutrition on intestinal structure has been emphasised and certainly warrants further research. Due to the nature of the weaning process in commercial pig production, Pluske et al. (1997) quite rightly suggested that the interaction between dietary growth, `protective' factors and pathogenic microorganisms with the cell epithelium are likely to be important determinants of the way in which the weaned pig digests and absorbs consumed feed. A detailed examination within the immunobiology discipline, together with the interactions between cytokines and the mucosal immune system, will provide invaluable knowledge into the mechanisms controlling these factors. Other fundamental aspects of research should include the use of exogenous amines such as glutamine (Picrzynowski (Kelly et a!. (1991c), Bardocz el al. (2000)). Current molecular methods demonstrate that approximately 60% of the microflora associated with the porcine gut wall remains uncharacterised (Kelly and King, 2001b). Evidence is now emerging which emphasises the impact of the indigenous non-pathogenic flora on both innate and adaptive immunity. Within this gut microflora, diverse activities have been identified with substantial ramifications in relation to gut health and performance of pigs. The mechanisms of interaction between the gut mucosa and bacteria arc emerging as research areas of paramount importance in relation to both human and animal health. Unravelling the cellular and molecular basis of bacterial colonisation, host recognition and the modulatory effects of bacteria on intestinal cell signalling and gene expression will provide the platform for the development of safer, targeted therapeutics to prevent disease and promote intestinal health (Kelly and King, 2001b). Unfortunately, the development of therapeutic agents, which target specific pathogens, is somewhat limited as a consequence of the rapid reproduction cycle and evolutionary mechanisms of such microbial pathogens. In light of this, enhancing the immune status and defence mechanisms would afford a greater degree of protection and allow the acquisition of `natural' immunity. 231 k\u00fdr APPENDIX 1: DAILY LIVE WEICHT GAIN CALCULATION Genstat program used to calculate daily live weight gain The following is an example of the program used to calculate daily live weight gain (DLWG) and to determine differences between treatments.

The blood was then centrifuged at 2,000 xg for 12 minutes and the serum removed. The serum fraction was then centrifuged for a further 12 minutes at 3,000 xg and the serum removed once again and frozen for subsequent analysis. Serum urea nitrogen was dctcnnincd using a Sigma Diagnostics INFINITYThI 13UN Reagent kit. The diagnostic kit protocol was utilised where 1 ml aliquot of BUN reagent was added to a cuvcttc plus 10 microlitres of sample achieving a 1: 100 sample: reagent ratio. Once prepared, the sample was left to stand for 30 sec and the absorbance read (Al). The sample was then left for a further 60 sec and the second absorbance (A2) read and recorded.
