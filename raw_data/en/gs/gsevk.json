With a custom blend of several modalities and approaches, we ensure that our clients receive the customized care they need to lead long, healthy and fulfilling lives. What we believe Although we embrace a number of different medical approaches, a core set of beliefs guides our staff throughout all of our treatments and interactions with patients. They include: - Longevity, optimal health, and complete wellness is attainable - Always identify the underlying cause of the illness first - High-quality care involves both the patient and the physician - The body is one system and must be treated as such - Treat the patient - not the symptoms Schedule Consultation [Contact Us](/contact/) Our medical approaches Our team at Angel Longevity Medical Center blends a variety of techniques to help our patients achieve optimal health and wellbeing. Your care will be completely customized to your needs and circumstances, and may involve one, some, or all of the following approaches: Functional Functional medicine is a patient-centered approach to healing. It's about addressing the underlying cause of an individual's disease or illness - rather than focusing just on the symptoms - and considering the whole person when composing treatment plans. While conventional medicine often attempts to solve problems related to individual organs, functional medicine treats the body as one, cohesive system. Integrative Integrative medicine is another patient-centered philosophy. This approach involves ensuring optimal health by optimizing your physical, mental, and social wellbeing. Integrative care is highly personalized to meet the individual's condition, needs, and situation, and interventions are natural and less-invasive whenever possible. Holistic Holistic medicine considers the entire person - mind, body, and spirit - throughout treatment for symptoms, underlying conditions, chronic diseases, and more. The philosophy behind this approach is that patients can achieve optimal health and wellbeing by balancing all aspects of their bodies and lives. Like other approaches we embrace, holistic medicine views the body as one cohesive system - not multiple independent parts and organs. As such, holistic medicine believes that imbalances in one area will inevitably impact other aspects of your health. Anti-aging Anti-aging medicine is focused on diagnosing, treating and preventing diseases that are associated with growing older. It treats the underlying condition and strives to relieve related symptoms and ailments. The goal of this approach is to prolong the human life span with cutting-edge treatment modalities. Alternative Alternative medicine is a term that refers to a range of treatments that are outside mainstream medical therapies. Examples of alternative medicine include: - Acupuncture - Herbal medicine - Chiropractic medicine - Ayurvedic medicine - Energy therapies - Reiki - Magnetic field therapy At Angel Longevity Medical Center, we use these therapies in conjunction with a variety of other treatment modalities to address the underlying cause of your illness, restore wellness and vitality, and promote longevity.
