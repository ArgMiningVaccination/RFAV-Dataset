Blood. 1st Year MSTP, 1st Year Medical Student Abstract Lack of resources to target bacterial infection is a pervasive and ever -compounding problem as new antibacterial agents are developed infrequently and as evolution renders current strategies ineffective. My previous research in the laboratory of Prof. Lynette Cegelski focused on elucidating the fundamental chemistry responsible for the assembly of bacterial biofilms , with emphasis on clinically relevant uropathogenic E. coli strains. Specifically, I worked on developing solid- state NMR methodology to investigate amy loid- polysaccharide interactions that define the structure of the E. coli insoluble extracellular matrix; additionally, I studied the biogenesis of bacterial amyloids and the mechanism of inhibition of novel small molecules. In my future research, I am int erested in applying chemical and biophysical tools to interrogate intractable biological systems: I am fascinated by the physical properties and dynamism of cell membranes and membrane proteins, and I would like to pursue thesis work centered around these interests and their functions in cancer progression or immunological phenomena. Rohini G uin Advisor : TBA Status: 1st Year MSTP, 1st Year Medical Student Abstract/Interests I am primarily interested in applying immunomodulatory approaches to cancers, transplants, and infectious diseases. My most recent research experience at the NIH focused on evaluat ing the role of mTOR complexes in cancers and graft -versus -host disease (GVH D). My primary project focused on developing clonally -derived mTOR complex knockout lines in a human multiple myeloma model . I also worked to define a novel reciprocal regulatory pathway between the mTOR and Hippo signaling pathways in a lung cancer model. I supported ongoing efforts to determine the structure of mTOR Complex 3 using immmunoprecipitation assays and CryoEM. Further, I evaluated mTOR signaling in donor B-cel ls of allogeneic graft-recipient mice, and I studied mTOR Complex 3 activity in the development of oral GVHD. My undergraduate research at Emory University involved developing personalized therapeutic vaccines with metastatic tumor -specificity using a murine breast cancer (TNBC) model. I additionally supported senior colleagues on two addit ional projects . The first project aimed to evaluate the synergistic role of metformin and therapeutic vaccination, and the second project demonstrated the immunogenic potential of foreign peptides, such as fluorescent and luminescent markers, that are often used in research studies. I aim to synergize these experiences in my dissertation work, using preventive and treatment interventions to tune the immune system across disease contexts. Publications : Munoz L.E.

As an undergraduate at the University of Rochester, I first developed this interest while working in a nanomedicine lab where I created polymeric drug delivery systems to administer antibiotics. During my post -graduate years at the Sloan Kettering Institute, I synthesized small- molecule antibiotics and pioneered a high - throughput screening assay to examine their ability to penetrate bacterial membranes. At Stony Brook, I hope to continue pursuing research at the interface of chemistry , biology , and medicine with a particular focus on understanding and treating neurodegenerative diseases.

S pecifically, I would l ike to g ear my graduate research towards investigating tumor microenvironments and studying patterns in cell growth and division. At UCLA I worked in the Courey Lab where I investigated the role of small ubiquitin- related modi fiers (SUMO) in the Ras/MAPK pa e discovered pr eliminary evi dence that SUMO contributes to Ras activation throug h a non-covalent interaction at a non covalent SUMO- interacting mot if (SIM) and indirectly a ctivating Raf through S UMOylation of the protein phosphatase, PP2A, which activates Raf by dephosphorylation of a serine residue. Ras and Raf activation are essential for downstream Ras/MAPK signaling and the recruitment of transcription factors involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis. Shrey Thaker Advisor: TBA Status: 1st Year MSTP, 1st Year Medical Student Ab stract/Interests My current research interests ar e related to the gastrointestinal tract and its autoimmune diseases . Specifically, I would like to explore pathologies that have been increasingly diagnosed, such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease , and further elucidate their multifactorial causes. My previous research has been under the umbrella of colon cancer, particularly through the lens of racial health disparity between Caucasian Americans and African Americans in Dr. Jennie Williams lab at Stony Brook University . My focus had been at the in vitro level, incorporating novel African American patient -derived colon cancer cell lines to assess the molecular basis for differential tumorigenesis and chemotherapeutic response. I assessed microRNA -34a and p53 tumor suppressing pathways, impact of dietary micronutrients (e.g. Folic Acid) on these pathways, and, most recently, comparing the standard of care fluoropyrimidine 5- fluorouracil with a novel compound called F10. I am fascinated with the impact of dietary molecules and potential synergy with pharmacological intervention. As such, I began to study a compound known as Lupeol which demonstrated promising preliminary synergy with the novel fluoropyrimidine F10 in treating both CA and AA colon cancer cells - a result that could develop into a methodology to overcome the clinically observed racial health disparity. By the same token, I would like to add to my experience with the increasingly common diagnosis of IBD and lifestyle/environmental factors that may help prevent or mitigate its severity.

However, the mechanism of this mutation induction is not clear. APOBEC3B (A3B), a DNA cytosine deaminase, has been implicated as a somatic mutagenesis in a variety of solid cancer genomes and poor clinical outcomes. An upregulation of A3B in the HER2+ breast cancer subtype has been associated with an increased burden of mutations. Immunohistochemistry studies revealed that A3B, a predominantly nuclear protein, has increased expression in breast tumor tissue relative to normal breast tissue. Immunoblotting assays and quantitative PCR analyses were also performed for detection of A3B expression in cell lines adapted in acidic media, mimicking the high acid load in the tumor microenvironment. Hence, the dynamic A3B expression levels may be utilized as a predictive biomarker for breast canc er progression and treatment response.

During my undergraduate years, my research focused on the influence of epigenetics on pre- mRNA splicing. During my gap years , I developed a multi- omic approach to aid in the development of cancer immunotheraputics that target cancer -specific alternative splicing events . My most recent rotation was in Dr. Ramana Davuluri's lab where I focused on exploring somatic mutations that could disrupt specific genes, leading to aberrant expression in cancer. Using somatic mutation data from the GDC (TCGA -LUAD) to identify cancer -specific mutations, I processed, analyzed, and prepared the data for subsequent analysis using the lab's deep learning model, dnaBERT.

My previous research focused on developing novel platforms to quantify lung mechanics during development and investigate the role of mechanical forces and external stimuli on vascular morphogenesis. Specifically, I have focused on the applications of these tools to better understand development -related pathologies (CDH), which are known to exert deleterious effects on lung maturation, in part due to abnormalities in pulmonary vascular flow and functional lung mechanics . Over the summer, I rotated in the Rubin lab in the bioengineering department where I was primarily focused on investigating the multisystem effects of low intensity vibration (LIV) as a potential therapeutic strategy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). DMD is the leading genetic cause of death in males and is characterized by progressive muscle loss as well as multisystem decline affecting the bone, muscle, and nervous system. Current methods of treatment are associated with a wide range of side effects that are thought to exacerbate the progressive pathology of DMD, suggesting a beneficial role for non -pharmacologic therapies aimed at slowing the progression of disease. Exercise is known to promote the maintenance of muscle function in this population, b ut may not be feasible as patients decline and become more limited in mobility. Therefore, the goal is to implement LIV as a surrogate for exercise for DMD patients to slow the progression of multisystem decline. Using in vitro models of DMD, we have begun to investigate the effect of LIV on myoblast and oligodendrocyte cell maturation as an initial step in elucidating the potential of LIV to alter DMD muscle and brain pathology.

Hannun, MD, Department of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Stony Brook University Status : 3rd year MD/PhD, 1st year Biochemistry and Structural Biology PhD Graduate Student Abstract Ceramide is a bioactive lipid that regulates various cellular processes such as growth arrest, apoptosis, inflammation, cell survival and differentiation . A major sour ce of ceramide is the hydrolysis (nSMase2) is the m ajor neutral SMase in mammalian cells for stress -induced generation of ceramide . Although nSMase2 is widely expressed in the plasma membrane and Golgi apparatus of many mammalian cell types, its highest expression is in the brain . In particular, nSMase2 has been implicated in extracellular vesicle biogenesis as a critical regulator of exosomes that package and transfer pathogenic factors including metastasis -promoting microRNAs, tau protein and amyloid . Here we show that we have successfully purified active human nSMase2 from E. coli. Going forward, we plan to crystallize and char acterize effect of inhibitors on nSMase2 activity and study regulation by other phospholipids, including phosphoinositides.

We are specifically i nterested i n changes asso ciated with insulin -resistance, w hich causes a decrease in glucose availability, l eading to an ener gy de ficit that causes i nstability i n network function. Prior w ork in the lab has tied this instabi lity m ore cl osely t o insulin- depleti on - and subsequent energy lo ss - by de monstrating that the administrati on of k etones in humans stabilizes t he same net works. On- going work i n the l ab seeks to understand t hese effects at a single neuron level, where ketones a re administer ed to brain slices d uring electrophysiology ex periments. Based on the preliminary r esults from these experiments, as w ell as from p rior literature, w e hypothesize that effect o f ene rgy depl etion in the br ain are pr edominantly ca used by depleting the r eversal po tentials o f ions, particularly Na+, K+, and C a2+, as these rely on ATP -driven pumps t o maintain their r eversal po tentials acr oss the membrane. Wit h this in mind, w e built a whole -brain model o f connected neural masses, u tilizing the Larter -Breakspear model ( an ex tension of the M orris-Lecar e quations) , allowing us t o manipulate i on gradients at a l ocal m ass level in a way consistent w ith our single neur on results whil e retaining t he ability to generate whole -brain dyanmics . This pr esentati on focuses on probi m athematical st ructure of the Larter -Breakspear neu ral mass on gradient depl etion or hy perpolarization . We show t hat shifting t he reversal potentials of Na+, K+, and Ca2+ alter the dynamics o f the neural m ass in ways co nsistent w ith spiking o r burstin g neuron models, and that sp ecifically N a+ and Ca2+ ion dynamics lie in an i nteresting space between two codimension 1 bifurcations ( bifurcation, sp ecifically ), a feature has been demonstrated i n small neuron ensembles as w ell. A s this space contains i nherently ch aotic o rbits, albeit w ith predictable periodicity, w e then l everage t hese results to pr obe the synchronization between coupled oscillatory regions, analyzing t he transiti on between aperiodic and per iodic co upling. H aving bui lt this mathematical framework and tied it t o the under lying neu ronal dy namics, we can then extend it t o whole- brain modeling to der ive results on an E EG/fMRI sca le.

Timothy Maher The Role of D iet and Metabolism on Immunity A gainst C ancer Advisor: Semir Beyaz, Ph.D., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Status: 3rd Year MSTP, 1st Year Genetics Graduate Student Abstract Diet is one lifestyle factor that is known to play a significant role in the overall health and wellbeing of humans. Obesity increases the risk for many diseases and health complications, including some cancers. Our cells are constantly detecting changes in their environment and adapt to these signals, such as nutrients. The role of what specific diets that may lead to obesity and contribute to cancer incidence is unclear. Thus, our group has examined various high fat diets to understand the affect at the cellular and molecular level at steady state and in the context of cancer progression. Our lab has already been able to show high fat diet influences intestinal stem cells MHC -II expression, and thus alters immune cell response that contributes to increased intestinal tumorigenesis. Utilizing different high fat diets allows us to characterize the impact certain nutrients have on immune cells function in cancer immunity. In addition to in vivo models, our lab has also established various in vitro org anoid models to isolate these causal mechanisms. Ongoing experiments are allowing us to identify cell - state specific gene expression and metabolic program changes in response to diet . Understanding how these immune cells alter their pathways to diet has also revealed which adaptations are important for immunity against cancer , such as specific transcriptional programs. Overall, through dietary perturbations we hope to find specific mechanisms that can be therapeutically targeted to enhance immune response t o cancer.

Draft genome sequence of a from the of necrotizing enterocolitis Advisor: Helen Hsieh, MD, Ph D, Department of Surgery (Primary Mentor), Lonnie Wollmuth, PhD, Department of Neurobiology and Behavior (Co -Mentor) Department: Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology Status: 3rd Year MSTP; 1st Year Graduate Student Abstract Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) , a severe inflammatory gastrointestinal disease that commonly affects premature babies, is the leading cause of mortality in neonatal intensive care. Clinical findings with N EC include physical symptoms, such as hematochezia, emesis, and lethargy, as well as radiological findings, such as pneumatosis intestinalis, portal venous gas, and intestinal distension. NEC severity is graded with the Bell's classification system, from s tage I mild NEC to stage III severe NEC. Only 50% of infants with NEC survive, and those that do experience developmental delay and neurocognitive deficits, whose severity correlates with disease severity. How NEC affects brain development and the cellular mediators required for this process remain unclear. Current murine models use a range of methods to induce NEC, including hypoxia, hypothermia, and hyperosmolar feeds. These murine NEC models, however, fail to control the severity of the induced NEC and cannot emulate mild NEC, which constitutes most surviving patients. We took advantage of a recently developed NEC model, which uses the osmolar agent dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) to induce NEC in postnatal mice. Here, we establish a novel murine NEC model t hat replicates various NEC stages by using DSS in the following concentrations: 0% (control), 0.25%, 0.5%, 1%, and 2%. We measured graded NEC induction by evaluating gross intestinal characteristics, such as dilation, color, and friability, and by immunostaining intestinal tissue for cell behavior with Ki- 67 and cleaved caspase- 3. We expanded the protocol to measure relevant clinical information during our 60 -hour feed cycle, which included weight and behavior . Our NEC model demonstrated inflammatory cytokine (TNF) elevation, confirming an induced inflammatory response. Finally, we assessed the inflammatory cerebral response by qualifying microglia morphology; activated microglia were present even in the mildest NEC. Alt ogether, we demonstrate that our NEC m odel is crucial to understanding all NEC stages and advances our knowledge of mild NEC and importance of the gut -brain axis during disease progression. This tool will advance therapies to protect mild and severe NEC cases from further complications, signif icantly helping treatment of NEC in the NICU.

Neurology, Stony Brook University Status: 3rd Year MSTP, 1st Year Graduate Student Abstract Chronic neuropathic pain affects up to 60- 70% of people leaving with spinal cord injury (SCI). Recent work from our laboratory showed that the increased activity of T -type calcium channels induced by the injury is responsible for driving nociceptors' hyperexcitability and for promoting the development/maintenance of SCI -induced neuropathic pain (SCI -pain) Sep 16;40(38): 7229- 7240 ). Previous reports have shown that endocannabinoids inhibit calcium channels, raising the possibility that inhibition of T -type calcium channels in nociceptors by 2- arachidonoylglycerol (2- AG) and/or anandamide (AEA) may reduce nociceptors' hyperexcitability and SCI -pain. The goal of this work is to test the hypothesis that inhibition of endocannabinoid with subsequent elevation of 2- AG and AEA levels, respectively, will reduce the activity of T -type calcium channels in nociceptors and rescue SCI -pain. SD rats (300- 350 g) were used in this study. SCI was performed by a midline spinal cord contusion at T10 by using an Infinite Horizon Impactor (150 kilodynes, 1s dwelling time). The mechanical allodynia was assessed with the von Frey filaments by using the up -down method with the 50% threshold. The conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm was used to assess the spontaneous pain. The action potential clamp technique was used in dissociated dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons isolated from SCI and sham rats to measure the interspike T -type calcium charge (sensitive to 1 \u00b5M TTA -P2) from the afterhyperpolarization of the first action potential to - 50 mV before the second action potential. The 50% mechanical threshold dropped from 19.5\u00b18.2 g (pre- injury) to 13.6\u00b15.6 g ( post-SCI). Vehicle injection changed the 50% mechanical threshold to 15.2\u00b13.5 g. MJN110 (10 mg/kg, MAGL inhibitor) increased the 50% mechanical threshold to 37.7\u00b110.7 g at 1- hour post -injection and to 21.4\u00b14.7 g (n=6) at 3- hour post injection. PF3845 (10 mg/kg, FAAH inhibitor) increased the 50% mechanical threshold from 13.6\u00b15.6 g (post -SCI) to 27.7\u00b14.7 g at 1- hour post -injection and to 27.0\u00b14.8 g at 3 -hour post - injection. In voltage clamp experiments in nociceptors isolated from the same cohort of rats the interspike T- type calcium charge dropped from 75\u00b114 pC/pF (n=18) in control to 39\u00b113 pC/pF (n=14) 5 \u00b5M MJN110 and to 9\u00b12 pC/pF (n=12) in the presence of 5 \u00b5M PF3845. Taken together, our data suggest that inhibition of endocannabinoid catabolizing enzymes MAGL and/or FAAH reduces the activity of T -type calcium channels in SCI - nociceptors and rescues SCI -pain. Kyungyoon (Yoon) Yoo Characterization of Mitochondrial Changes Contributing to Age- Associated Ant ifungal Tolerance in C. neoformans Cells Advisor: Betti na Fries, MD, Professor of Medicine, M icrobiology and Immunology Status: 3 rd Year MSTP, 1st Year Microbiology & Immunology Graduate S tudent Abstract Cryptococcus neoformans is y east that i nfects immunocompromised individuals; especially A IDS patients and org an transplant r ecipients. It is spread by i nhalation of aerosolized spores, and upon infecting the host , it disseminates to the central nervous system, where it can cause meningoencephalitis. Even though t he co mbination of proper i mmune response and/or an tifungal therapies kills t he pathogen, so me C. neo formans cells ca n survive intracellularly i n macrophage, replicate and per sist for l ong periods, l eading to treatment f ailure. This process of replication where t he fungus goes through a se ries o f asymmetric m itotic divisions i s called replicative aging. In the course of these divisions, the aging mother cells increasingly m anifests p henotypic ch anges, with older ce lls bei ng more resistant to phagocytosis and antifungals. Because this resilient pheno type is se lected during chronic infection, our understanding of these old cells may help identify novel targets for treatment. Mitochondria produce the bulk of cellular ATP, and they are crucial in adapting to surrounding environments, maintaining dynamic communications with other organelles and orchestrate a range of cellular responses. In other fungi, there are age -associated mitochondrial changes that help the c ell adapt to various physiological stresses and promote antifungal resistance. I have characterized various changes that occur the mitochondria in old C. neoformans cells. 10 generation- old C. neoformans cells (when compared to 1 -3 generation- old cells), h ave decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, increased mitochondrial mass and produce more mitochondrial ROS. Additionally, while the mitochondria from young cells show a tubular morphology, the ones from old cells become clumped. Furthermore, these old cells have higher ATP levels, which is able to fuel drug efflux pumps and synthesis of ergosterol, the most important membrane sterol in fungal cells. This work highlights mitochondrial changes that could explain the enhanced resistance of old cells to antifungals.

Nevertheless, autologous CAR -T therapy remains a relatively inefficient process that is confounded by prohibitively long ex -vivo expansion periods and loss of effector function upon reintroduction to the patient . Thus, strategies which speed up the manufacturing process and help maintain T cell effector function would dramatically increase the speed and efficacy of CAR -T therapy. Mammalian cells have well-conserved mechano -sensing and mechanoresponse mechanisms, the aggregate of which provide an important regulatory component for a variety of cellular responses. Our lab has spent decades developing Low -Intensity Vibration (LIV) as a mechanical regime modeled after the physiologic, high- frequency muscle contractions generated during exercise. We have previously found that in Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) LIV promotes both proliferation and differentiation. Our lab and others have identified that LIV act s on MSCs through conserved cytoskeletal components (focal adhesions and LINC complex proteins) as well as through nearly ubiquitous cell signaling pathways (AKT- GSK3b pathway). In T cells, the AKT -GSK3b pathway plays a particularly important role as it is involved in CC28 co -stimulation and subsequent activation of the T cell. My preliminary results have shown that T cells are in fact mechanosensitive to vibration. We have demonstrated that LIV applied to in- vitro culture can increase T cell number by 30% over 5 days and alter the expression of activation- associated surface receptors such as CD62L, CD69, and PD -1. Furthermore, we found that the addition of an AKT inhibitor reduced the LIV mediated growth effects by more than 60%, indicating that the AKT - GSK3b pathway does play a role in T cell mechanosensitivity. Ultimately, this work would represent a novel method to manipulate the growth and functionality of T cells, which would have implications for improving both the speed of CAR -T manufacturing and the efficacy of treatment .

Development of non -invasive imaging predictors to identify patients most likely to benefit from chemo- immunotherapy would enable personalized management of SCLC. A cohort of extensive- stage SCLC patients treated with atezolizumab, carboplatin, and etoposide were identified, and pre -treatment CT scans were curated. The axial slice at the level of the carina was identified and center -cropped. 3D radiomic features were extracted for downstream analysis. After feature selection, the most discriminative radiomic feature was used to train and evaluate a random forest machine classifier for mortality prediction using leave- one-out cross -validation (LOOCV). A baseline classifier was also trained using clinical variables. LOOCV mortality probabilities were recorded for each patient and used to stratify patient risk. Overall survival analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazards modeling. Our results demonstrated that patient survival following chemo- immunotherapy in SCLC can be predicted using computational analysis of treatment- naive images . Studies of larger patient cohorts to further understand the relationship between imaging signatures and patient survival in SCLC could potentially leading to improved personalized disease management.

Of t he two major types o f lung cancer, non- small ce ll lung cancer ( NSCLC) i s the most common accounti ng for 80 -85% o f all cases. Althoug h treatment op tions for t his disease have improved, the 5 -year r elativ e survival rate remains l ow at 27 %, hi ghlighting the need for m ore target ed therapies. A substantial amount o f evidence over t he past deca de has v alidated numerous transcripti on factors as strong selective dependencies i n various ca ncers. In NSCLC, t he nucl ear factor er ythroid 2- related factor 2 ( NRF2) transcripti on factor, a m aster r egulator o f cellular ant ioxidant r esponse, has been established as one of t hese selective transcriptional dependencies and a pot ential candidate for f uture small molecul e targeting.

Common treatments include surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and hormone therapy, and each has as sociated toxicities. Survival prognosis is an important factor in determining the aggressiveness of treatment, but current methods for prognostication of survival in breas t cancer are insufficient for some patient subpopulations and disease subtypes. Without robust and generalizable methods for prognosis, personalized care of breast canc er will be greatly inhibited. Digital pathology has emerged as a rich data modality to characterize a patient's canc er. These images are the gold standard for cancer diagnosis and contain information at the patient-l evel, tissue-l evel, and cell-l evel. In parallel, deep learning has revolutionized image processing, and digital pathology images are the ideal data modality for deep learning algorithms. These methods, however, are prone to overfitting and learning spurious patterns. Multi-t ask learning has emerged as a way to attenuate overfitting and guide deep learning models to learn causal patterns in data. Despite this, multi-t ask deep learning has not been explored in the context of breast cancer survival. My PhD work tests the hypothesis that incorporating prediction of morphological and molecular characteristics into a deep learning algorithm will improve the performance and generalizability of survival predictions. This hypothesis will be addressed through the following Specific Aims. In the first aim, the effect of adding morphology characterization tasks to a surv ival prediction algorithm will be evaluated. In the second aim, the contribution of molecular characterization tasks in a s urviv al prediction algorithm will be evaluated. This project utilizes digital pathology images to predict a patient's surviv al, while cons training the model to jointly learn a repres entation of the pathology predictive of cell locations, cell types, commonly mutated genes, and hormone receptor status. This research is significant because (1) it is the first to propose using multi-t ask deep learning for breast cancer survival prognosis, (2) it addresses the lac k of reproducibility in deep learning algorithms applied to medical images, and (3) it will prov ide a solid groundwork for developing generalizable deep learning models for the prediction of cancer patient outcomes.

Todd Miller, P hD, Physiology and Biophysics, Stony B rook U niversity Status: 4th Year M STP, 2nd Year Graduate Student Abstract The Eph receptors are the largest family of receptor tyrosine kinases in mammals , with 9 EphA receptors and 5 EphB receptors . Our preliminary work on the EphB1 receptor has demonstrated loss- of-function mutations in colorectal cancer. T here has been relatively little biochemical work on the Eph family receptors. Two other Eph receptors (EphB2 and EphA3) can be expressed at high levels in E. coli. The Eph receptors can have either tumor suppressive or pro- oncogenic roles in cancer. There are a large number of cancer - associated mutations in Eph family receptors that have not been characterized with respect to activity or function. We will use E. coli expression to produce these mutant proteins and characterize their activity as compared to their wild -type counterparts. We will also test their ability to rewire downstream signaling .

Kim YY , the relationship between t he sy stemic response t o infection and tumor pr ogressi on in Brca1 breast cancer A dvisor : Camila dos Santos , PhD, Cancer Center , Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Status: 4th Year MSTP, 2nd Year Graduate student in Genetics Abstract Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common solid tumors in women and loss -of-function mutations in the DNA repair gene, BRCA1 , is among the most clinically relevant factors that increases BC incidence. Despite the link with B C, we cannot predict when and even if BRCA1 mutation carriers will develop BC. Therefore, identification of risk factors that initiate tumor development is needed. The dos Santos lab has found that whole body changes resulting from urinary tract infection (UTI) remodel the transcriptome of mammary epithelial cells (MECs) and the tissue microenvironment. Since UTI is one of the most common infections in women globally, it is likely that UTI and BC co -occur in millions of women. Considering the known link bet ween infection and tumor development in other cancer types (e.g. H. Pylori and gastric cancer), we hypothesize that UTI, and the systemic inflammatory response, can induce BC tumorigenesis. Indeed, experimental delivery of uropathogenic E. coli into the bladder of Brca1 deficient mice hastens tumor development. Analysis of pre - malignant mammary tissue from Brca1 deficient mice with ongoing UTI by single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) identified a Krt6a -expressing population of epithelial cells induced by UTI in Brca1 KO mice. In addition, we found that mammary non -epithelial cells are altered by Brca1 deficiency. Specifically, fibroblasts are enriched and further recruited to the mammary gland after UTI alongside a reduction in adaptive immune cells. In summ ary, this work may contribute a new appreciation of the role of infection in promoting BC and the interplay between tumor initiating epithelial cells and stromal and immune cells during tumor progression.

Some clinically approved TKIs have activity against MET (MET -TKIs); however, clinically -observed MET mutations promote resistance to certain MET -TKI subtypes that preferentially bind to active or inactive kinase conformations. Defining which TKIs should be used to treat patients presenting with specific MET mutations is a pressing clinical need. We recently demonstrated that combining as few as two or three kinase inhibitors with shared activity against a target of interest, it is possible to maximize on-target inhibition by diluting each inhibitor's off -target effects. In addition to maximizing therapeutic on- target effect, combinations of inhibitors with different binding modes could also decrease the probability of resistance emerging through further mutations. The objective of this study is to define selectivity profiles for clinically approved TKIs against clinically observed MET mutants, and calculate TKI combinations that would most selectively inhibit those mutants. The primary rationale for this work is that it will provide an actionable roadmap for MET mutation- specific targ eted TKI therapy in clinical cohorts. Combinations of two or three clinically approved TKIs with different binding modes that have been selected to maximize on- target activity represent an actionable strategy to increase therapeutic potential and decrease the probability of further TKI resistance emerging.

A major bottleneck in the discovery proc ess for anti -TB drugs is the identification and validation of a compound's targets, which is especially difficult when multiple targets underlie biological activity. Activity -based protein profiling (ABPP) can be used to simultaneously detect all potential targets of a compound. In previous work, our lab has demonstrated the potential of ABPP in the drug development pipeline. We leveraged phenotypic screening, competitive ABPP, morphological profiling, and a structure- activity series to generate a prioritized list of targets most likely to contribute to the mode of action of our identified inhibitor, AA692 (Li and Patel et al., 2021). To further demonstrate the applicability of ABPP in drug development, we will determine the contribution of the prioritized t argets to the mode of action of AA692. In this study, we focus on the target Rv3802c, an essential Mtb protein with a putative role in mycolic acid synthesis. We have generated autoluminescent reporter strains of Mycobacterium smegmatis with tunable Rv3802c expression and confirmed that Rv3802c complements the loss of the essential M. smegmatis homologue MSMEG_6394. To test whether Rv3802c inhibition contributes to the mode of action of AA692, we will determine how Rv3802c expression affects susceptibility to AA692. This work will provide insight into the mode of action of an inhibitor, but, more importantly, it will contribute to our understanding of how ABPP can be used in the development of novel drugs.

Lucia Yang Inducing exon skipping with ant isense oligonucleoti des t o treat di ffuse intrinsic pont ine glioma A dvisor : Adrian Krainer, Ph.D., Genetics, Stony Brook University/Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory S tatus: 4th Year MSTP, 2nd Year Genetics Graduate Student A bstract Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a deadly pediatric brain tumor for which no curative treatment option currently exists. Approximately 70- 80% of all DIPG tumors are m arked by a dominant heterozygous point mutation in H3F3A , which codes for the non- canonical histone H3.3. gain methionine (K27M), preventing trimethylation of lysine 27 (H3K27me3) and disrupting globa l di- and tri - methylation on histone proteins. This mutant H3.3 histone is predicted to be a major driver of tumorigenesis in H3K27M -mutated DIPG by disrupting normal neural differentiation. Thus, the mutant H3F3A mRNA is a promising target for therapeutics. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) offer a unique method to target mRNA through Watson- Crick base pairing with high specificity and low toxicity. For my thesis, I will develop a splice- switching ASO that reduces translation of mutant H3K27M RNA by inducing skipping of H3F3A exon 2, which contains the only in- frame start codon for H3F3A and the K27M mutation.

Acetylcholine Elevated in the Dorsal Striatum of SAPAP3- null Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Model Mice. Joshua Plotkin, PhD; Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, Stony 5th year MSTP; GS3 Program in Neuroscience Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a neuropsychiatric disease listed as top 10 and top 15 most disabling illnesses in women and men, respectively, and has a predicted prevalence of 2.3% in the United States. SAP90/PSD95 -associated protein 3 (SAPAP3) is a postsynaptic scaffold protein which is enriched at corticostriatal synapses and has been linked to OCD. The deletion of SAPAP3 in mice recapitulates aspects of OCD with biological validity (striatum hyperactivity) , behavioral validity (anxiety -like behaviors and compulsive grooming), and treatment validity (reduction in compulsive behavior by chronic course of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor). Here we show that acetylcholine (ACh) release is dysregulated in the dorsal striatum of interneuron (CIN) soma and axonal punctae are increased in density in the dorsal striatum of SAPAP3- null mice, as determined by immunohistochemical choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and vesicular ACh transporter (VAChT). Electrophysiological recordings in ex vivo brain slices demonstrate that the firing rate of CINs is also increased in SAPAP3 -null mice. Consistent with these findings, we found that evoked release of striatal ACh is also elevated in the dorsal striatum of Sapap3 -null mice, as measured in acute brain slices using a genetically -encoded fluorescent ACh sensor. We further hypothesize that dysregulated release of ACh by CINs may shape striatal circuit dysfunctions and promote compulsive motor behaviors in SAPAP3- null mice.

Wollmuth, PhD, Neurobiology and Behavior, Stony Brook University Status: 5th Year MSTP, 3rd Year Molecular & Cellular Pharmacology Graduate Student (GS3) Abstract Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that affects nearly 1.5 million Americans, disproportionately women and minorities. Up to 50% of patients with SLE experience neuropsychiatric symptoms clinically referred to as Neuropsychiatric Lupus (NPSLE) and colloquially referred to as \"brain fog\". These symptoms vary greatly from patient to patient and can range from subtle (amnesia, cognitive fatigue, and impa ired concentration) to severe (seizures and psychosis). The basis for this diversity is unknown, but recent studies have focused on the contributions of a subset of autoantibodies that cross react with NMDA receptors (NMDARs). These autoantibodies (DNRAbs) are identified by their affinity for dsDNA and DWEYS, a pentapeptide amino acid motif within the amino terminal domain of NMDARs. DNRAbs bind to NMDARs containing GluN2A and/or GluN2B subunits, but we recently demonstrated that G11, monoclonal DNRAb, preferentially NMDARs as modulator (PAM). The PAM action of G11 increases NMDAR response to agonist and may underlie hippocampal neuron losses, microglial activation, loss of dendritic complexity and loss of spatial memory associated with DNRAbs in vivo. Other patient derived monoclonal and polyclonal DNRAbs enhance NMDAR -mediated currents suggesting they also have PAM action on NMDARs, but each has slightly different binding affinity for NMDARs. I hypothesize that different DNRAbs have different binding affinities for NMDARs, potentiating NMDARs to varying degrees, thus contributing to the wide variation in neuropathology seen in the clinic. To test this hypothesis I will use 3 patient derived monoclonal antibodies to (i) quantify DNRAb mediated differences in positive allostery of NMDARs in vitro, (ii) analyze diverse DNRAb mediated differences in neuropathology in vivo, and (iii) utilize novel NMDAR NAMs to pharmacologically oppose PAM action of NMDARs to prevent development of neuropathology. This work will enable a greater understanding of the diversity of DNRAb contributions to NPSLE. Thomas Kim Activity -dependent neurogenesis and functional neurovascular coupling in Alzheimer's disease mice Ad visor: Shaoyu Ge, PhD , Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, Stony Brook University St atus: 5th year MSTP, 3nd Year Graduate Student Ab stract Al zheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, typically presenting with progressive and irreversible neurodegeneration. Memory loss, an early symptom of AD, usually manifests as difficulty in remembering recent events or conversations. Memo ry loss is often due to damage in the hippocampus, which plays a very important role in day -to-day memory. It has been shown that atrophy of hippocampal areas occurs in the presence of AD. This explains the early memory impairment, especially the formation of new memories, seen in AD patients. An important aspect of structural neuroplasticity in the hippocampus is neurogenesis, the addition of newly generated neurons to existing circuits. While the occurrence, regulation, and importance of hippocampal neuro genesis in young adults have been extensively tested, very little is known about hippocampal neurogenesis in AD brains. A r ecent study in our laboratory reported that microvascular blood flow rate is tightly regulated by interneuronal activity in adult mi ce. Several lines of evidence in AD rodent models and patients have also shown impaired vascular dynamics , especially decreased cerebral blood flow , which is essential for brain energy homeostasis. Decreased blood flow is thought to reflect neuronal dysfunction and synaptic failure, with the latter considered to be the best correlate of cognitive decline in AD. However, it is unclear which types of interneurons are affected to initiate these changes in AD. Moreover, it is unknown whether it is possible to ameliorate the declined neurogenesis via correcting interneuron activity and whether this regulation is dependent on the neurovascular pathway in AD. Therefore, I hope to determine the mechanisms underlying the declined hippocampal neurogenesis in AD, focus ing on analyzing the functional neurovascular coupling (NVC), an increase in local cerebral blood flow due to an increase in local neural activity, in AD mouse models .

Deficiency of microRNA miR -34a expands cell fate potential In Cancer Ad visor: Allen Tannenbaum , Ph.D., Dept. of Biomedical Informatics, SBU Status: 5th year year Biomedical Informatics Graduate Student (GS3) A bstract Protein- protein interaction (PPI) networks describe how individual proteins in the cell interact with one another, thereby providing a network structure to capture the numerous interactions in a given cell. These PPI networks in turn allow one to analyze high dimensional gene expression (RNA -seq) data with respect to an underlying structure in the data, considering the relationships of each gene with other interacting genes to provide richer analysis. In fact, network -based approaches have indicated network entropy (a statistical measure of \"randomness\") to be an indicator of pluripotency (differentiation capacity) in stem cells and cancer. Our research seeks to pivot from the statistical quantity of entropy to geometric properties on these interaction networks, in order to define more descriptive analysis with applications in pathway analysis and predictive modeling. Results in differential geometry directly relate the value of Ricci curvature (a geometric measure of flatness) to entropy, which in turn is also related to robustness. Based on this link, we extend the results from network entropy by applying Ricci curvature, which indeed reveals curvature can function as an indicator of pluripotency in stem cells, similarly to entropy. Further, we consider Ricci curvature in local pathway analysis in the context of melanoma data, demonstrating that known oncogenic pathways increase in curvature in tumors compared to normal tissue (i.e. increase in robustness), while conversely known tumor suppressor pathways decrease in curvature. This indicates Ricci curvature could serve as a valuable measure for assessing local network properties and pathways implicated in disease.

Dillon Voss Targeting pyr tocellular carcinoma Advisor: Adrian Krainer, P hD., C old Spring H arbor Labo ratory Status: 5th Year M STP, 3rd Graduate S tudent S tony B rook Genetics Program Abstract Mutually exclusive alternative splicing of exons 9 and 10 in the pyruvate kinase gene (PKM) catalyzes generating pyruvate and ATP. PKM1 and PKM2 differ in their ability to catalyze this reaction: PKM1 is constitutively active, whereas PKM2 is allosterically regulated. Interestingly, nearly all cancer types preferentially express the less active PKM2 isozyme. It is thought that reduced PK activity allows accumulation of upstream glycolytic intermediates that are shunted to macromolecule synthesis pathways (e.g., nucleotide and amino acid synthesis) to sustain cancer -cell proliferation. Importantly, there is also evidence of PKM2 exhibiting noncanonical functions in cancer by recruiting transcription factors to oncogenes. Our goal is to improve the understanding of PKM isozyme function in tumorigenesis, while also developing therapeutic strategies that alter isozyme expression in various cancer types. To this end, our lab utilizes antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that bind splicing -regulatory sequences in PKM pre- mRNA and redirect alternative splicing, leading to increased PKM1 and decreased PKM2 expression. These ASOs increase PKM1 expression, as well as pyruvate kinase activity, which induces cell - cycle arrest in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells in vitro, and significantly limits tumor growth in vivo. Stable- isotope tracing and LC -MS analysis of cells revealed decreased of glycolytic intermediates and purine synthesis pathways, suggesting a metabolically -dependent response. Follow -up studies to confirm the metabolic link between ASO -based PKM splice- switching and reduced growth in HCC can aid in identifying synergistic therapies. We are also testing whether PKM2 mutants lacking catalytic activity or nuclear localization can rescue the cell -cycle arrest phenotype in ASO -treated HCC cells, to determine if non- canonical functions of PKM2 are necessary for HCC cell growth. We have focused on HCC because ASOs preferentially accumulate in the liver when subcutaneously injected into mice. However, given that PKM2 is upregulated in many cancer types, this work provides a precedent for the use of PKM -targeting ASOs in other cancers with upregulated PKM2 and/or known sensitivity to PKM2- modulating interventions.

Colitis mouse models display a similar heterogeneity histologically. As such, spatial context may be particularly important for studying colitis mouse models, due to this simultaneous presence of colonic regions that are involved or uninvolved with disease. These regions can be identified on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) - stained colonic tissue slides based on the presence of abnormal or normal histology. However, detection of such regions requires expert interpretation by pathologists. C onvolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown much promise in biomedical image classification. As CNNs learn to associate visual patterns with human- defined labels, they are well- suited for application in histopathology. As such, we have trained a ResNet -34-based model to detect 'Involved' and 'Uninvolved' histological regions across three mouse models of colitis. This computational approach allows extraction of these image regions across our dataset to cluster and identify patch classes. We have found that the per -mouse proportions of these histological patch classes can be utilized to train subsequent machine learning classifiers to predict mouse model and c linical score bins in a prospectively treated cohort of mice. Reliable detection and quantification of histological findings is an important first step towards histologically grounded analysis across mouse models. Molecular approaches and mechanistic studies focusing on pathophysiology could be linked to similar and dissimilar presence of types of histological findings across different murine colitis phenotypes For a future direction, we plan to build upon these H&E outputs using serially sectioned slides that are immunohistochemically stained for immune markers. After registering these sections to the H&E, we plan to tie immune and molecular characteristics to the histological patch classes we have identified. We will evaluate the potential for histological immune marker localization to 'Involved' and 'Uninvolved' regions to identify protective and deleterious populations. Additionally, with the hypothesis that immune cell type presence can be mapped to regional contexts defined by presence of or without specific pathologies, we will train a classifier to infer functional immune population presence from H&E alone.

Joshua Kogan Cortical plasticity underlying gustatory perceptual learning in behaving mice Advisor : Alfredo Fontanini , MD PhD, Neurobiology and Behavior, Stony Brook University Status: 6th Year MSTP, 4th Year Graduate Student Abstract To adapt and survive, animals must learn to discriminate overlapping stimuli predicting different outcomes. This phenomenon, known as perceptual learning (PL), has been well described in the visual, auditory, s omatosensory, and olfactory systems. Specifically, improved performance on PL tasks is associated with plasticity of both sensory representations and decision related neural signals. However, few studies have addressed PL in the gustatory system. The primary sensory cortex for taste, known as the gustatory insular cortex, is known to encode both sensory and decision- related information. However, the ways that these representations might change with PL remains unknown. To address this question, we have designed a taste- based PL task modeled on a two alternative forced choice (2AFC) . Mice first learn a sucrose (100mM) vs NaCl (100mM) discrimination, in which sucrose presentation at a central spout is associated with reward at one lateral spout and NaCl with reward at the other. They are then trained to discriminate between increasingly similar pairs of mixtures: 75/25 vs 25/75, 65/35 vs 35/65 and 60/40 vs 40/60 (%sucrose/%NaCl). Before and after learning, mice are tested on a battery of mixtures to establish ps ychometric curves. After learning, performance increased for all mixture pairs, indicating an improvement in discrimination. To assess GC plasticity, ensemble activity is monitored with two photon calcium imaging. Single neuron and population- level analysis are used to identify changes in both sensory and decision- related neural responses that occur with PL. These analyses suggest that learning is mostly associated with enhanced decision- related activity rather than shifts in sensory representations. Ongoing studies using optogenetic inhibition of GC activity will test the requirement of this activity for performance of the discrimination task .

Craig Marshall Dysregulation of Transposable Elements in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Advisor : Dr. Molly Hammell, PhD, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories Status: 6th Year MSTP, 4th Year Genetics Graduate Student Abstract Transposable elements (TEs) are autonomously replicating DNA sequences that reside within the genomes of all eukaryotes. These TEs are present in multiple copies, such that they represent highly repetitive genomic elements. The vast majority of TEs have lost their ability to replicate within the genome due to the accumulation of mutations. In addition, the host organism devotes significant resources to silencing the remaining elements. Regardless of their activity, TEs encompass a significant portion of the human genome, and dysregulation can lead to increased nascent transcription, movement of TEs throughout the genome, and genome wide instability. Human cells use a variety of mechanisms to keep these TEs dormant including histone modifications, DNA methylation, and post - transcriptional RNA degradation. TAR DNA Binding Protein 43 (TDP -43) plays many general roles in gene regulation, and additionally plays a substantial role in the silencing of TEs. TDP -43 is also known for its propensity to aggregate within the motor neurons of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting the upper and lower motor neurons of the motor cortex and spinal cord. While some familial mutations in ALS -associated genes have been identified, the vast majority of cases are sporadic with no known mutation or family history of disease. TDP -43 aggregates are seen in motor neurons from nearly all ALS patients, yet the role of these aggregates and associated TDP -43 dysfunction is still being defined. Dr. Molly Hammell's lab recently showed that ALS patient cortex samples can be grouped into three distinct and robust clusters of patients whose transcriptome profiles nominate three dominant pathways altered in the disease: retrotransposon activation, oxidative activation. of TDP -43 has shown that TDP- 43 loss of function in vitro leads to retrotransposon activation, mimicking the pathways seen altered in a subset of ALS patient cortex samples. Together, this leaves open several questions regarding the interplay between TDP-43, transposon silencing complexes, and ALS pathology. My research will be to elucidate the mechanism by which TDP -43 represses TEs, with a clear focus on correlations to the molecular alterations seen in ALS patient tissues.

Moresco Characterizing the F ormation of t T C ell Excluding CX CL12 C oat Advisor: Douglas Fearon, MD Cancer Center, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Status: 6th Year MSTP, 4nd Year Graduate Student Abstract The CXCL12 \"coat\" is a extracellular compartment that mediates the exclusion of T cells from cancer cell nests, rendering carcinomas such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), colorectal cancer , and likely breast cancer, resistant to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) . This coat is formed by the covalent coupling of CXCL12 to KRT19, which is catalyzed by the isopeptide bond forming enzyme TGM2. Our lab has shown that blocking the interaction between CXCL12 and CXCR4, the receptor of CXCL12, with a small molecule inhibitor of CXCR4, or CRISPR- mediated mutagenesis of cancer cell derived KRT19 or TGM2, renders mouse models of PDA susceptible to ICB. However, how the CXCL12 coat forms at a cell biological and biochemical level remains unknown but elucidating these mechanisms will provide the foundation to identify additional means to block its formation. KRT19 is a classically intracellular cytoskeleton protein, and how it remains cell associated to capture extracellular CXCL12 is unknown. Using surface protein biotinylation of two human breast cancer cell lines I have shown that cancer cells externalize KRT19 along with its basic keratin binding partner KRT8. To expand upon this observation, I used live cell imaging and three-d imensional reconstruction to show for the first time that keratins assemble into intermediate filament networks on the surface of cells, reminiscent to their classic intracellular structure. Importantly, by using a combination of live cell imaging and co- immunoprecipitation I have shown that this filamentous KRT19 containing network extracellular CXCL12 vivo , mediates T exclusion from cancer cell nests. Therefore, the CXCL12-K RT19 complex remains cell associated by incorporating into a keratin network on the surface of cells.

Median survival time remains at 16 -20 months despite multimodal treatment with surgical resection, radiation, temozolomide and tumor -treating fields therapy. After genotoxic stress glioma cells initiate cytoprotective autophagy, which contributes to treatment resistance, limiting the efficacy of these therapies and providing an avenue for glioma recurrence. Antagonism of autophagy steps has recently gained attention as it may enhance the efficacy of classical chemotherapies and newer immune- stimulating therapies. The modulation of autophagy in the clinic is limited by the low potency of common autophagy inhibitors and the inability of newer ones to cross the blood- brain barrier. Herein, we leverage lucanthone, an anti -schistosomal agent which crosses the blood- brain barrier and was recently reported to act as an autophagy inhibitor in breast cancer cells. Our studies show that lucanthone was toxic to glioma cells by inhibiting autophagy. It enhanced anti-glioma temozolomide (TMZ) efficacy at sub -cytotoxic concentrations, and suppressed the growth of stem -like glioma cells and temozolomide -resistant glioma stem cells. slowed tumor reduced numbers of Olig2+ glioma cells, normalized tumor vasculature, and reduced tumor hypoxia. We propose that lucanthone may serve to perturb a mechanism of temozolomide resistance and allow for successful treatment of TMZ- resistant glioblastoma.

Rangwala Resistance to Kinase Inhibition through Shortened Target Engagement Advisor : Markus A. Seeliger , PhD, P harmacological S ciences , Stony Brook Status: 6th year M STP, 4th year M olecular and Cellular B iology graduate s tudent Abstract Protein kinase inhibitors are selective chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) by 80%, but 22-41% of patient s acquire imatinib resistance. Mutations within the Bcr -Abl kinase domain (KD) are the most common cause for relapse. Some mutations are located near the imatinib -binding site and cause resistance through altered interactions with the drug. However, many resistance mutations are located far from the drug -binding site, and it remains unclear how these mutations confer resistance. Additionally, earlier studies on small sets of patient -derived imatinib resistance mutations indicated that some of these mutant proteins were in fact sensitive to imatinib in cellular and biochemical assays. These assays were performed at constant drug concentrations; however, the plasma drug concentration of patients fluctuates over time due to drug pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. Therefore, dissection of the equilibrium binding constant Kd, the standard measure of a compound's efficacy, into the rate constants for drug binding to the target (k on) and dissociation from the target ( koff) may be more relevant for non- equilibrium in vivo systems. Residence time, the reciprocal of the drug dissociation rate constant, describes the lifetime of the drug -target complex and has been shown to be a superior predictor of in vivo potency in several systems. We hypothesized a novel general mechanism that mutations could cause resistance not by altering the equilibrium binding affinity but rather by increasing drug dissociation rates, thereby decreasing imatinib's residence time and reducing target inhibition in the non-equilibrium environment of the cell. We tested how 94 patient -derived and resistance- associated Abl mutants affected imatinib and dasatinib affinity and binding kinetics in live cells. We found that two- thirds of the tested clinically observed imatinib resistance mutations in Abl kinase significantly reduce drug affinity, whereas one -third bind imatinib with similar or tighter affinity than Abl wild - type (WT). We identified three imatinib resistance mutations, N368S, V299L, and that have WT but increased imatinib dissociation rates. This workflow represents the first broad- spectrum analysis of the target engagement characteristics of the full range of mutations in a clinically -relevant kinase. Mutations at these sites are present ubiquitously throughout the kinome, which suggests that kinetic resistance to structurally -selective kinase inhibitors may be a widespread mechanism. Such kinetic mutations may not be detectable in assays with constant drug concentration, and their resistance phenotype may vary from patient to patient by other pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic parameters. Importantly, kinetic resistance mechanisms may be circumvented by altering the treatment schedule, for example, from a single dai ly dose to multiple doses. We envision that this study will serve as a paradigm for further investigation of analogous mutations in other kinases such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and uncover a broader role for binding kinetics in drug re sistance.

J Neurosci 2017, 37, Richard Moffitt , PhD, Stony Brook Universit y Status : 6th Year MSTP, 4th Year Biomedical Informatics Graduate Student Abstract Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive disease for which potent therapies have limited efficacy. Several studies have described the transcriptomic landscape of PDAC tumors , seeking to provide insight into potentially actionable gene expression signatures to improve patient outcom es. Despite centralization efforts from multiple organizations and increased transparency requirements from funding agencies and publishers, analysis of public PDAC data remains difficult. Bioinformatic pitfalls litter public transcriptomic data, such as subtle inclusion of low - purity and non- adenocarcinoma cases. These pitfalls can introduce non- specificity to gene signatures without appropriate data curation, which can negatively impact findings. We here seek to address two aspects of subtyping in PDAC. First, we evaluate the tumor specificity of existing signatures and facilitate community exploration through the compilation, curation, and analysis of existing datasets ; as well as the development of a point -and-click webtool to streamline serialized analyses . We then seek to expand molecular subtyping to Whole Slide Image (WSI) analysis by leveraging deep learning algorithms to predict transcriptomic subtypes from histology alone. We demonstrate the effect of inappropriate sample inclusion by analyzing molecular subtype signatures in matched sample analysis, wherein scores are calculated for primary tumor samples and then again from either a matched metastasis or a cell line derived from the primary patient (PACA -AU dataset). We identified complete signature loss of the Bailey ADEX, Bailey Immunogenic, and Collison Exocrine signatures in cell lines and metastases. We then scored their expression in a variety of normal tissues (Moffitt dataset) , and identified elevated PDAC sig nature expression for those same gene signatures in normal pancreas, liver, lung, and spleen/lymph nodes. To limit these issues in future analyses, we have created pdacR (http://pdacR.bmi.stonybrook.edu, github.com/ rmoffitt /pdacR), an web- tool with annotated datasets from landmark studies and an interface for user -friendly analysis in clustering, differential expression, survival, and dimensionality reduction. Following our characterization of existing signatures, we sought to train an algorithm that could extract interpretable features from WSIs of PDAC. Specifically, we implemented the DINO Visual transformer (ViT) to perform Self supervised learning (SSL) on 300+ PDAC WSI from two different public datasets (TCGA and CPTAC3). Once features were extracted, we trained an ElasticNet logistic regression classifier using 15- fold cross -validation and were able to generate a model that predicts basal -like vs classical with an Area Under the Receiver -Operator Characteristic (AUROC) of 0.91 on previously unseen WSI and an F1 score of 0.9.

Its inherently pleiotropic nature make miRNAs strong candidates for the development of cancer therapeutics, yet despite its potential, there remains a challenge to deliver nucleic acid- based therapies into cancer cells. We developed a novel approach to modify miRNAs by replacing the uracil bases with 5 -fluorouracil (5- FU) in the guide strand of tumor suppressor miRNAs, thereby combining the therapeutic effect of 5 -FU with tumor suppressive effect of miRNAs to create a potent, multi- targeted therapeutic molecule without altering its native RNA interference (RNAi) function. To demonstrate the general applicability of this approach to other tumor suppressive miRNAs, we screened a panel of 12 novel miRNA mimetics in several cancer types including leukemia, breast, gastric, lung, and pancreatic cancer. Our results show that 5 -FU-modified miRNA mimetics have increased potency (low nM range) in inhibiting cancer cell proliferation and that these mimetics can be delivered into cancer cells without delivery vehicle both in vitro and in vivo, thus representing significant advancements in the development of therapeutic miRNAs for cancer. This work demonstrates the potential of fluoropyrimidine modifications that can be broadly applicable and may serve as a platform technology for future miRNA and nucleic acid -based therapeutics.

The larges t isoform, Dp427, connects the extracellular matrix to the actin cytoskeleton in muscle. In the brain, smaller isoforms such as Dp140 and Dp71 are more abundant, and mutations affecting the transcription of these isoforms are predicted to have worse neurological deficits. Using the mdx (lacks Dp427) and mdx4cv (lacks Dp427, Dp260 and mouse models, we examined oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) production and proliferation in the postnatal ventricular/subventricular zone (VZ -SVZ) and oligodendrogenesis in the corpus callosum. In the mdx mouse, at P21, there is a reduction in the density and proliferation of OPCs in both the VZ- SVZ and corpus callosum. In the mdx4cv, there is a reduction in proliferating OPCs at P8 and P21 in the VZ- SVZ and P14 in the corpus callosum. Interestingly there is a reduction in oligodendrocytes in the mdx mouse at P21 but no reduction in oligodendrocyte density in the mdx4cv mouse at any of the examined time points. These results support our previous work demonstrating myelination abnormalities in the mdx mouse and support the hypothesis that the widespread diffusion tensor imaging changes seen in patients with DMD may be indeed due to a white matter abnormality.

Alex Larkin Understanding the mechanisms of cell extravasation using a zebrafish xenograft model Adv isor: Benjamin Martin Department : Pharmacology/Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Stony Brook University Status : 7th Year MSTP, 5 th Year Grad Student Ab stract Canc er cell metastasis from solid tumors is a major cause of death in cancer patients. The precise way in which cancer cells leave the primary tumor, travel through the circulatory and lymphatic systems, and then invade into distant organs to grow new tumors, is still being understood. In contrast to intravasation, the process of extravasation is still mysterious. Recent studies have shown that cell cycle state may be an important factor for invasion of cancer cells through the endothelial layer 1. Another factor is the role that macrophages play within the blood stream to aid in extravasation since they play a large role in intravasation2,3. One boundary to understanding this process is the difficulty of observing it in vivo . Using the zebrafish xenograft model overcomes this barrier by allowing high power microscopy, live cell imaging immediately after xenograft, and delayed adaptive immune system, preventing rejection. To better understand the mechanisms of metastasis I will inject breast cancer cells into the circulation of zebrafish and assess the effect of cell cycle state on extravasation as well as the relationship of circulating macrophages on this process. In this proposal I wish to increase our understanding of the different mechanisms o f cancer cell extravasation. These new insights could potentially lead to new drug targets and better patient outcomes. Publications: Mondal, C., Gacha- Garay, M. J., Larkin, KA ., Adikes, R., Di Martino, J., Chien, C.

M atus, Ph.D., D epartment of B iochemistry and Cell B iology, S tony Brook University S tatus: 7th Year MSTP, 5th Year M olecular and Cellular P harmacology G raduate Student Abstract We previously identified that cell invasion and cell proliferation are mutually exclusive behaviors. To elucidate how this dichotomy between proliferation and invasion is programmed, we study the proximal stochastic fates of the C. elegans somatic gonad: the invasive, post -mitotic anchor cell (AC) and the proliferative ventral uterine (VU) cell. Following the Notch -mediated stochastic AC/VU decision, the AC invades the underlying basement membrane , initiating the uterine- vulval co nnection. The AC must be arrested in the G0 phase of the cell cycle to invade, which is controlled by an extensive gene regulatory network. To investigate how G0 is established in the AC, we examined CDK activity and the levels of the CDK -2 binding partner, CYE- 1/Cyclin E , and the p21/p27 homolog, CKI -1. Our results reveal that while there is no initial difference in CDK activity, levels of CYE -1 and CKI -1 are distinct. To determine if these levels are functionally important, we ectopically expressed CKI -1 during the AC/VU decision, biasing both cells to adopt an AC fate. These results suggests that the stochastic decision that specifies AC fate is dependent on cell -cycle state. Research from multiple metazoans suggests that redundant mechanisms are in place to maintain a post -mitotic state. We find here that the G0 state of the AC is also maintained in a redundant fashion, as loss of single negative cell- cycle regulators failed to trigger AC cell- cycle entry. However, depletion of CKI -1 in null mutant backgrounds of other negative G1/S -phase regulators ( cki-2 and fzr- 1) triggered a robust cycling AC phenotype. Together, our results delineate how initiation and maintenance of a robust cell cycle- arrested state is required for the invasive cell fate, with important clinical implications for the treatment of invasive pathologies such as cancer metastasis.

Growing evidence supports the existence of highly conserved, D icer- independent pathways that are involved in chromatin remodeling and DNA repair. We have observed significant fitness defects in Dicer1 mutants in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) that are independent of microRNA production. Strikingly, mutations in Dicer1 are observed across cancer types and numerous studies have suggested a correlation between poor clinical outcome and low DICER1 expression. In parallel, fragments derived from the 3' end of mature tRNAs (3' - tRFs) are also highly abundant in cancer cell lines and may play a similar role as DICER1 in maintaining genome stability by inhibiting long- terminal repeat (LTR) -retrotransposons which use full-length tRNAs to prime reverse transcription. 3' -tRFs potentially protect many cell types in eukaryotes but are processed from full -length tRNAs under yet unknown conditions. While canonical miRNA misregulation is well -characterized in human disease, there is an urgent need to study these lesser known, non- canonical small RNA pathways and the perturbations t hat may occur. The significance of this project is two- fold: (i) enhancers of the Dicer1 fitness defect may constitute novel therapeutic targets, and (ii) identification of triggers for 3' -tRF production may inform strategies against infectious LTR- retrovi ruses, including HIV and HTLV -1, that are also primed by tRNAs. We view these highly conserved, ancient functions of RNAi as an exciting field that remains largely unexplored but holds tremendous therapeutic potential.

John Williams Medial Prefrontal Cortex Dysfunction Mediates Working Memory Deficits in Schizophrenia Advisor : Anissa Abi -Dargham, MD and Jared Van Snellenberg, PhD Department : Psychiatry and Behavioral Health, Stony Brook University Status : 7th Year MSTP, 6th Year Biomedical Engineering Graduate Student Abstract Schizophrenia (SCZ) is marked by deficits in working memory (WM), which predict poor functional outcome. While most functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of WM in SCZ focus on dorsolateral prefrontal role for medial PFC (mPFC) in these WM deficits. We aimed to determine whether task -evoked mPFC deactivation magnitude is associated with WM performance, and whether it mediates defici ts in SCZ. Additionally, we investigated associations between mPFC deactivation and cortical dopamine release in both SCZ and healthy controls (HC). Patients with SCZ (N=41) and HC (N=40) performed a visual object n- back task during fMRI. Dopamine release capacity in mPFC was quantified with [11C]FLB457 in a subset of participants (9 SCZ, 14 HC) using an amphetamine challenge. Correlations between task -evoked deactivation and performance were assessed in mPFC and dlPFC masks, and was further examined for relationships with diagnosis and dopamine release. Deactivation was associated with WM task performance in mPFC, but no association was observed in dlPFC. Deactivation in mPFC was reduced in SCZ relative to HC and mediated the relationship between diagnosis and WM performance. Additionally, mPFC deactivation was significantly and inversely associated with dopamine release capacity across all PET participants, as well as in HCs alone, but not in unmedicated patients with SCZ. Reduced WM task -evoked mPFC deactivation is a mediator of, and potential substrate for, WM impairment in SCZ; this reduction may be due to impairments either in elements of cognition generally related to task engagement rather or to WM specifically. We further present preliminary evidence of an inverse association between deactivation during WM tasks and dopamine release capacity in mPFC.

For this reason, it has become increasingly important to be able to study tumor immunology. Hematoxylin and eosin- stained (H&E) tissue sections are routinely obtained for a great majority of cancer patients. H&E whole slide images can be analyzed to generate maps that characterize tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) distribution. We employed our tumor detection and TIL detection algorithms to generate tumor -TIL composite maps that clearly outline the whole tissue sample, highlighting tumor, TILs, and areas of overlap, giving a birds -eye-view of TIL distribution. We defined human- interpretable features analogous to the semantic features employed in Radiomics that could be identified at -a- glance. These spatial features, inspired by ecological concepts, include TIL forests (aggregates of TILs within tumor landscape), TIL deserts (large areas of tumor void of TILs), and lymphoid aggregates (clusters of lymphocytes outside tumor boundary); we also included scores of the degree of TIL infiltration, distinguishing between intratumoral and peritumoral TIL strength (within the tumor and around the tumor edge, respectively). We then assessed the clinical significance of these features in two independent studies. We carried out analysis of whole slide images from the TCGA breast cancer cohort and the Carolina Breast Cancer Study to explore the predictive value of quantification of TIL infiltration and of TIL semantic features. We found that TIL forests, lymphoid aggregates, and increased peritumoral TILs are protective, while TIL deserts are hazardous. Herein we provide evidence that TIL infiltration pattern is significant to patient risk assessment, and that assessing infiltration features may be a less time -consuming alternative to assessing degree of infiltration.

Kathryn Hill Use of Fu lly Quantitative PET to R elate Biology to B ehavior A dvisor : Ramin Parsey, MD, PhD, Department of Psychiatry, Stony Brook University Status: 6th Year MSTP, 3RD Year Medical Student Abstract The goal of my thesis work was to advance the use of quantitative positron emission tomography (PET) towards clinically impactful tools for diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric and neurological disorders. I assessed individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) to determine if 2 -[18F] -fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET, measuring glucose metabolism, could be used as a predictor of antidepressant treatment outcome. However, FDG -PET was not shown to be a predictive marker. One explanation for this could be the broad heterogeneity of symptoms and biological factors associated with MDD. I subsequently assessed mu opioid receptor dynamics through PET imaging in healthy young adults in relation to three factors associated with development of psychiatric disorders: childhood maltreatment, alcohol use, and rejection sensitivity. Assessment of young adults prior to psychiatric disorder development is critical to isolate the relationship between factors and opioidergic dynamics without including potentially confounding biological impacts of psychiatric disorders. While rejection sensitivity and childhood maltreatment were not significantly related to opioid dynamics in our cohort, increased alcohol use, specifically, binge drinking, was related to decreased mu opioid receptor density. Future investigation is needed to assess if this decreased mu opioid receptor density predicts alcohol use disorder among those with increased binge drinking. I hope to continue similar brain imaging bas ed research as a clinician scientist in the future.

Despite this, we and others have established tumor and stroma subtypes with prognostic significance. However, the interaction of underlying signals driving distinct immune and stromal landscapes is still unclear. Here we integrate 92 single cell RNA -seq samples from seven independent studies to build a reproducible PDAC atlas with a focus on tumor -TME interdependence. Patients with activated stroma are synonymous with higher myofibroblastic and immunogenic fibroblasts, and furthermore show increased M2- like macrophages and regulatory T- cells. Contrastingly, patients with 'normal' stroma showed M1 recruitment, elevated effector and exhausted T -cells. To aid interoperability of future studies, we provide a pretrained cell type classifier and an atlas of subtype- based signaling factors that we also validate in mouse data. Ult imately, this work leverages the heterogeneity among single- cell studies to create a comprehensive view of the orchestra of signaling interactions governing PDAC.

Shea, Ph.D., Neuroscience, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Status: 8th Year MSTP, 3rd Year Medical Student Abstract Rett Syndrome (RTT) is a pervasive neurodevelopmental disorder affecting females. RTT res ults from loss of function mutations in the X -linked gene Methyl CpG Binding Protein 2 (MeCP2*). MeCP2 encodes for the eponymously named protein, a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor critical for neuronal development and mature synapse maintenance. However, this pathogenesis is complicated by unequal mutation distribution; heterozygous mosaicism, one X -chromosome in each cell in lionized, results in a patchwork pattern of protein expression. Differences in the number, type, and location of MeCP2 -deficient cells likely underlies the phenotype spectrum among the RTT patients. Whether some cells are more dependent on MeCP2, and therefore contribute more to clinical symptomatology or severity, is unknown. Here we explore that hypothesis in the context of impaired perceptive communication. We used Cre- lox genetic mouse lines to examine the consequences of cell -type restricted Mecp2 mutation to perception of naturally produced ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs). We employed infant pup retrieval behavior as a learned and ecologically relevant readout of auditory perception. Adult rodents naturally learn this behavior in response to pup USVs. We collected electrophysiology recordings and conducted calcium imaging to identify single neuron firing and neuronal population activity patterns in the auditory cortex during retrieval behavior and during passive playback of USVs. Cortical cell type identity dictated MeCP2 dependence for supporting auditory processing. Mecp2 mutation restricted to parvalbumin positive (PV) inhibitory interneurons (IN) impaired pup retrieval behavior. mutation restricted to somatostatin- or vasoactive- intestinal -peptide- positi ve IN had no such effect. The inability of PV -Mecp2 mutants to response behaviorally to USVs resulted from degraded stimulus -driven neuronal activity in the auditory cortex, both at the single unit and population levels. That is, PV -restricted Mecp2 mutation impaired inhibitory cortical plasticity. These findings expand our understanding of neurotypical processes of audition and the contributions of various cortical subtype populations to those processes.

Journal of Human Brain Mapping. 39(2):1043- 1055.1 Margaret Shevik Egeblad , PhD, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory S tatus: 7th Year MSTP, 3rd Year Medical Student Abstract Formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) is linked with COVID -19 disease severity. The causes of elevated NET formation in COVID -19 are likely multifactorial, but here I extend on previous reports showing that the SARS -CoV-2 Spike (S)p rotein can induce NET formation in human neutrophils. Intriguingly, I found that whereas the S protein induced NETs in neutrophils isolated from unvaccinated donors, neutrophils isolated from the same donors after COVID -19 vaccination no longer formed NETs. Similarly, neutrophils isolated from individuals before administration of a booster vaccination formed NETs, whereas they did not form NETs when isolated after booster administration. In contrast, NET formation in response to the chemical inducer PMA was unaffected by vaccination or booster status of the donors. Using a pa nel o f c hemical inhibitors, I showed that SARS -CoV-2 S protein induced- NET formation required several classical signaling molecules, including peptidylarginine deimininase 4, gasdermin D, and caspase -1. Additionally, I show that neutrophil - associated prote ases and NETs can cleave the SARS -CoV-2 S protein in vivo and in vitro . Altogether, these data help elucidate the interactions occurring between the SARS -CoV-2 S protein and neutrophils during COVID -19 infection and how they contribute to disease pathophys iology.

In most cases, ALS progresses rapidly, and available treatments offer only minimal life extension. Biomarkers are urgently needed to shorten the diagnostic window and allow for patient stratification and drug engagement monitoring during clinical trials. As disruptions in RNA metabolism are observed in patients with ALS and in models of the disease, we profiled extracellular RNAs within cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of ALS patients and compared them to age -matched neurologically normal controls. We identified more than 36 RNAs of multiple subtypes, differentially expressed in ALS CSF. Ferritin light chain (FTL) and ferritin heavy chain (FTH1), genes coding for the two subunits of the protein ferritin, were increased in ALS -CSF. Numerous groups have reported that elevations in ferritin at the protein level correlate with ALS. We describe elevations in 17 di fferent transcripts coding for ribosomal proteins, many of which have been reported as elevated in transcriptomic studies of blood from ALS patients. This was notable as ribosomal proteins are known to be loaded into extracellular vesicles (EVs), suggestin g EVs may be an important source of extracellular CSF RNAs. We used two RT -qPCR -based approaches to attempt to validate RNA -sequencing findings, first in the same cohort of samples used for RNA -sequencing and second in an independent cohort of ALS and cont rol CSF. These findings provide rationale for further investigation into the utility of extracellular RNAs as biomarkers for ALS.

Adviser: Nissim Hay ( University o f Illinois -Chicago) Year: M STP9-MS4 During matrix detachment, tumor cells grow as multicellula r clusters, and metabolism in this setting more readily recapitulates in vivo tumor meta bolism . It was previously found that detached cells activate AMPK to inhibit fatty acid synthesis and induce fatty acid oxidation, which raises the question of how clustered cells maintain the integrity and biogenesis of membrane lipids. Here, we show that the fatty acid transporter CD36 is robustly induced in a p38 - and AMPK - dependent manner during detachment. Pr eceding CD36 induction, ER stress is induced, which decreases the level of SCD1, an ER -resident desaturase that converts saturated fatty acids (SFAs) into acids (M UFAs). As a result, SFAs accumula te during matrix detachment, creating an imbalance in the fatty acid saturation index . The accumulated SFAs further activate AMPK and inhibit ACC to repress fatty acid synthesis while also exacerbating ER stress. However, the induction of CD36 maintain s the fatty acid saturation index by preferentially importing MUFA s. Thus, CD36 is required t o maintain lipid homeostasis and diminish ER stress during matrix detachment. Consistently, in a mouse model of breast cancer, CD36 -deficiency induces ER -stress and prevents the pro -tumorigenic effect of HFD. Our results suggest that CD36 is a selective MUFA- transporter required to curb the toxicity of SFA s during tumor progression in the context "}
