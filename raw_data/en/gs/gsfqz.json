Cannabidiol, better known as Hemp oil, is a natural remedy that can be used for a number of common ailments from pain and inflammation to anxiety and depression. But did you know that Hemp oil works more effectively when combined with curcumin and vitamin D? Curcumin from turmeric and vitamin D-3 also play a role in inflammation and pain. By combining Hemp oil, curcumin and vitamin D-3, you will experience a supercharged combination that works diligently to help provide your body with relief. Hemp oil, curcumin and vitamin D-3 can results in several health benefits including: - Reduce Inflammation and Pain - Promote Bone Health - Fight Depression and Anxiety What is Hemp Oil? If you didn't already know, Hemp is actually a naturally occurring compound known as a cannabinoid which is found in the cannabis or marijuana plant. Even though it is extracted from a cannabis or hemp plant doesn't mean that you'll get high from Hemp oil. Hemp oil is actually made by extracting Hemp from the cannabis plant then diluting it with a carrier oil like hemp oil or coconut oil. But, here's the main difference between Hemp and marijuana: Hemp doesn't tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main compound found in cannabis that produces the associated \"high\". That means that you get all the benefits that medical marijuana users experience without the high feeling. Hemp oil is used solely for helping your body achieve homeostasis. Hemp oil is gaining massively in popularity in treating conditions such as chronic pain and anxiety as well as providing numerous other benefits and for good reason. How does Hemp Oil Help Your Body? Hemp oil is thought to affect you by interacting with the body's endocannabinoid system. This is a biological system that interacts to external cannabinoids such as Hemp . The main responsibility of the [endocannabinoid system](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17369778) is to maintain homeostasis. This means its primary purpose is to keep the body's cells at an optimum level for survival. [What is the Endocannabinoid System, and What Does it Do?](https://sunwarrior.com/blogs/health-hub/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system-and-what-does-it-do) By keeping your body at homeostasis, you'll feel better, have less inflammation, and even feel calmer and more balanced. That's why if you have acne or a chronic knee injury, Hemp can be a great way to naturally lessen inflammation. Why Curcumin and Vitamin D-3? Like Hemp oil, curcumin is also known for its [anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3918523/) properties. Though curcumin isn't always the most well-known by name, many people use it. It's actually found in the spice turmeric. In India, turmeric has long been used in [Ayurvedic medicine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5443238/) to treat skin conditions, aches and pains, and digestive issues. [11 Health Benefits of Curcumin Turmeric's Secret Weapon](https://sunwarrior.com/blogs/health-hub/11-health-benefits-of-curcumin-turmerics-secret-weapon) Now vitamin D is a little different. Vitamin D doesn't deal with calming inflammation in the body. Instead, vitamin D actually supports and promotes a healthy immune system. Vitamin D is also sometimes called the \"sunshine vitamin\" as it's released naturally in your skin in response to sunlight. So, if it is cloudy and cold where you live during the winter, you may need to take a vitamin D supplement. You can see how getting no sun on your body could be a problem overtime. That's probably why Vitamin D deficiency is very common throughout the world with an estimated [one billion people](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4143492/) living with low levels of the vitamin. A vitamin D deficiency can lead to frequent infections, tiredness, bone and back pain, and depression. This is probably why people get sick more easily during the winter months. Those cold winter days also effect your mood. Have you ever heard of seasonal depression? Well those cloudy days when you don't see the sun for months lead to less vitamin D in your body. But vitamin D is more than just a single vitamin, it's a family of nutrients that act in a similar way including vitamin D1, D2, and D3. They differ depending on where they have come from. [Studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22552031) have shown that vitamin D3 is more effective than vitamin D2 at raising levels of calcifediol. So, what does Calcifediol have to do with vitamin D levels? Calcifediol actually is the indicator of the vitamin D levels in your body. So, the more calcifediol in your body, the more vitamin D you have in your body. As you can see, supplementing Hemp oil with curcumin and vitamin D-3 gives you an additional boost and health benefits. Try these together to experience numerous health benefits and feel your best. What are the Benefits of Hemp Oil, Curcumin and Vitamin D-3? Reduce Inflammation and Pain Hemp oil may be an effective and natural treatment for chronic inflammation and pain. Several [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25699191) have been carried out showing that a combination of Hemp and THC is effective in treating pain related to multiple sclerosis and arthritis. [Studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5922297/) have shown that Hemp may help to reduce chronic pain by impacting the endocannabinoid system helping to reduce inflammation. Hemp may also help to reduce symptoms of cancer treatment such as pain, nausea, and vomiting. One [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19896326) looking at cancer-related pain found that those treated with a combination of THC and Hemp reported significant reductions in pain compared to those who only received THC. Inflammation is very important when it comes to disease. [Scientists](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12490959) now believe that chronic, low-levels of inflammation play a major role in almost every long-term, Western disease. Curcumin is also a natural and powerful anti-inflammatory compound. It's so strong that it has actually [matched the effectiveness](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19594223) of some anti-inflammatory drugs without the side effects. Promote Bone Health Vitamin D is absolutely essential for good bone health. Without vitamin D, the body can't absorb calcium effectively, which is crucial for building and maintaining strong bones. Your bones contain [98% of the total amount of calcium](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK56060/) in your body. Vitamin D essentially helps your intestines absorb the calcium from your food. So, be sure to get enough vitamin D so that you absorb the calcium you eat in your diet. Plant-based sources of calcium include hemp milk, almonds, tofu, and fruit. Losing bone density may take place as you age. But, there are certain factors that put you at greater risk for developing osteoporosis such as gender, heavy smoking and drinking, and long-term use of high-dose oral corticosteroids. It can be beneficial to take a vitamin D supplement to help with bone degeneration. Fight Depression and Anxiety Hemp , curcumin and vitamin D-3 may all play a role in helping to fight against depression. Curcumin has shown promise in this treatment area. One [controlled trial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23832433) of 60 people with depression were split into three groups. One group took Prozac, the other curcumin and the third both curcumin and Prozac. After six weeks, they found that the curcumin group had similar results to the Prozac group. This suggests that curcumin is as effective as an antidepressant. Like curcumin, Hemp oil has been found to reduce both anxiety and depression. One [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3079847/) looking at people with social anxiety disorders found that after taking 600mg of Hemp before publicly speaking, they experienced less anxiety and discomfort during their speech. Research has also shown that vitamin D could play a major role in depression and regulating mood. In one [study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2796.2008.02008.x), scientists found that people who suffered from depression experienced improvements in their symptoms after taking a vitamin D supplement. The extraordinary health benefits of curcumin as a potent anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant have been well studied. Combined with Hemp oil and vitamin D-3, incorporating these into your routine can help to give you the boost you need, reduce inflammation and pain and promote healthy bones. Sunwarrior's Hemp Oil Hemp oil is a promising natural treatment for numerous health concerns. Research into the uses of Hemp and the impact it has on the body is a popular area of study that is only set to grow, meaning the list of potential benefits may increase. The endocannabinoid system is a huge part of the human body and research is just beginning to scrape the surface of the effects Hemp oil has on it. Sunwarrior's Hemp oil blend already has curcumin and vitamin D-3. This creates a unique blend that combines the power of Hemp oil with vitamin D's immune boost and curcumin's anti-inflammatory benefits. Vitamin D-3 works to turn on key peptides in your immune system that spark an anti-microbial response. Essentially, this works to strengthen your immune system. The anti-inflammatory effects of curcumin complement Hemp oil's natural pain relief effects by reducing inflammation. If you're thinking of incorporating Hemp oil into your diet and lifestyle, start off with smaller amounts, follow the product guidelines and always consult a medical professional if you have any concerns.
