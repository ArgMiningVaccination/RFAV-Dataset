He offers acupuncture and Chinese Medicine services to his patients in addition to allopathic western medicine services. He has been working with a wide range of patients including cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiation; patients with neurological disorders and with many suffering from pain-related and chronic conditions. These patients have been very pleased with the outcomes - acupuncture and Chinese Medicine have accelerated their healing process and improved their health. One patient, who wished to stay anonymous, was so grateful that made a generous donation to UW Medicine, to specifically support integrative medicine and acupuncture in areas such as providing charitable care to cancer patients whose insurance would not cover such services. Dr. Majd is planning to expand the acupuncture services and integrated medicine services to other UWNC clinics to serve a larger group of patients. Patients have continuously voiced that having more access to acupuncture would be very helpful to them. "}
