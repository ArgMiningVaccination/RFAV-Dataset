Be a Light to transmute and illuminate the darkness. To transmute fully requires a diving in, a facing, and a dealing with the darkness. Know yourself-beyond all darkness-as Light and Love. Mind-Body Services houses TriYoga hOMe Philadelphia and Dr. Citrin Devi's healing practices. Dr. Devi offers an integrative blend of practices promoting optimal wellness and health: psychotherapy, yoga therapy, reiki and energy healing, spiritual consultation, trauma healing, and support for healthy lifestyle choices, mindset, and self-inquiry (svdhyya). These practices can be used individually or in a holistic, combined manner. Mind-Body Services and TriYoga hOMe seek to promote transformation, connection, and balance. We promote well-being, explore the connections between mind-body-spirit, explore relational and collective connections, and address healing and stress-related concerns. TriYoga hOMe offers yoga classes in yogaflow (postures), breathing practices, and meditation for all levels, teacher trainings, private and semi-private instruction, and workshops with Citrin, a TriYoga senior-level teacher. Dr. Devi welcomes clients interested in integrating yoga or meditation practices with other healing modalities.
