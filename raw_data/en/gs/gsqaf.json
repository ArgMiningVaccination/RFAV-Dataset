Ayurveda is a healing art and science of life. Ayurveda's concern is alleviating both bodily and mental diseases and promoting physical, psychological, and spiritual well-being. It includes eating, living, and moving with the seasons and the 5 elements, balanced self-care, healthy relationships, and balanced living. It includes learning how to be proactive in one's own health and life. In its fullest form, Ayurveda is also a path of awakening to wholeness and integration with all of life.

Statement of Understanding Regarding Ayurveda: To be clear about what Ayurveda is and how it functions, please note that the practice of Ayurveda does not include any type of medical diagnosis or medical treatment and is not a substitute for medical care. Ayurveda is currently a form of complementary and alternative healthcare and lifestyle support in the United States. All services and treatments provided at Midwest Dharma Wheel are complementary or alternative to healthcare services provided by your own licensed medical doctors. Ayurveda is complementary and supportive of traditional western medicine as practiced in the United States and is not a replacement for care by a licensed medical doctor. She teaches how to prepare food and cook in a healthful way according to the season. Many of her students have become excellent cooks-all based on Ayurveda's unchanging wisdom. Her students learn how to take care of themselves & strengthen their life-force energy. For the past 25 years Cary has been teaching how to live in accordance with the shifting seasons, how to nourish oneself with whole foods to heal and strengthen the body, and self-care practices that promote health and longevity. All of these based on the 5,000 year old wisdom of Ayurveda. The Healing Power of Nature She takes people into nature, and teaches them the power of being in relationship with the natural world. Meditation & Contemplation They learn how to respect and connect to the natural world, from which many of us have become disconnected, and begin to understand how good health depends on this relationship being nurtured. On these adventures, they learn how to draw on the healing power of the 5 elements and to restore health to their body, minds, and inner life. Cary teaches the power of meditation, contemplation, and connection to the Inner Sacred Source. In classes and retreats, we learn to become aware of how we use our senses. We are educated on how the cause of many health problems arises from the misuse of our senses. Ayurveda teaches that when we abuse the senses we lose connection to the source of health. We learn how to use them consciously, restoring our senses to a state of healthful relationship with the world we live in. On a residential retreat at early morning practice, we are learning how to start our day caring for the sense organs. Through this they are learning how to draw on the healing power of awareness.

In the Ayurvedic tradition, these specific therapies are used to heal and bring balance. Shirodhara: Oil Therapy Through the methodic dripping of warm oil infused with herbs and essential oils specific to the individual's constitution, the body's inherent healing mechanism is awakened. As the oil pours over the brow point continuously for half an hour or more the Shakti Prana (creative life force) and the cellular memory are nourished. This treatment is specific for anyone experiencing headaches, stress, loss of hair or hearing, inflammation in the body, poor digestion, menopause, eating disorders, or following any trauma. During any time of change or uncertainty, it is deeply soothing and grounding. This treatment is recommended during the junctures of the seasons to assist in the transition. Marma: Point Therapy Marmas, junctures of prana, are vital points where muscles, ligaments, and tendons meet. Through a specific massage technique, the marmas and circulatory channels are stimulated. Marma therapy, one of the most ancient techniques for relieving pain, acts directly on the blood, nerves, and lymph circulatory systems. Stimulating these points, especially when performed with warm oil or specific herbs prepared for the individual constitution and condition at hand, serves to cleanse and revitalize the body. This therapy is recommended for any condition or as periodic therapy to keep the tissues clean and vital. Abhyangam: Oil Massage Abhyangam is an Ayurveda way of oil massage with Marma therapy. Marma points are vital points of the body which contain Prana energy. Gentle pressure on Marma while doing massage provides Prana energy to the body and mind which gives ultimate healing. In Abhyangam, special herb-infused Ayurvedic oils are slowly warmed up and gently massaged into the skin. This massage is deeply relaxing, harmonizes, detoxifies, strengthens, and revitalizes the entire body. This massage also improves lymph flow and stimulates the immune system. It simultaneously calms and strengthens the nervous system. In this way, Abhyangam massage is a protector, preserver, and rejuvenator. Women's Therapy This is a special treatment specifically for supporting a woman's health and well-being. In this treatment, you will receive an Ayurvedic Abhyanga of the belly, breasts, and hips and a Marma treatment of the hands, feet, and face. This is a very special therapy that gives care to areas of the body that are not treated regularly in traditional western massage. Vashpaswedanam: Medicated Steam Bath This treatment is helpful to eliminate impurities from the body, reduce fat, and also helps in healing skin diseases. It is a unique therapy in which leaves of medicinal plants are boiled as the body rests in a tent filled with herbal steam. Deeply relaxing and rejuvenating. Nasyam: Nasal Therapy The administration of herbal oil through the nose is called Nasya. Nasya is particularly useful in the treatment of diseases occurring in the sense organs of the head and the mind. It promotes functions of the sensory and motor organs and specifically provides strength to the head, nose, and neck. Indirectly it works on the whole body by improving the functioning of the endocrine glands. It will prevent premature wrinkling, graying, and falling of the hair. It is helpful in sinus conditions and with allergies. Nasya is deeply calming and balancing for the mind. Tarpana: Rejuvenation This treatment aims to provide optimum rejuvenation to the joints or specific areas of the body. A special dough is put around the area to create a dam. Herbal ghee is put in this groove to lubricate, warm, and soothe the sounding areas which will be kept warm for 30 - 35 minutes. This helps to improve the flow of prana, circulation, tissue and joint health. Udvartanam: Therapy for Cellulite Management The whole body is gently massaged with medicated powders prepared with various herbs. This helps to reduce fat and cellulite, tones the muscles, improves blood circulation, and eases joint pain. Regular Udvartanam is good for not only cellulite, but it helps weight loss by increasing the basal metabolic rate. This is followed by the application of specific herbal formulas created to reduce cellulite and support new collagen formation. "}
