It is the productof a collaborative effort between the National Forum on Education Statistics and the Association of SchoolBusiness Officials International (ASBO \u00ae). It was conceptualized and developed by the School Facilities Maintenance Task Force of the National Forum on Education Statistics. Roger Young (Haverhill, MA, Public Schools) served as the chairperson of the School Facilities Maintenance Task Force. He also initiated and promoted the partnership between the task force sponsors: the National Forum on Education Statistics and the Association of School Business Officials International (ASBO). Without Mr. Young's leadership, this project and the resulting publication of this Planning Guide would never have mate rialized. Mr. Young was assisted by project consultant Tom Szuba, who was responsible for the day-to-day progress of task force activities, including much of the research and writing of this Planning Guide . Mr. Szuba also managed the final preparation of the manuscript for publication, including overseeing editorial and designtasks. Lee Hoffman of NCES shared her expertise as both a task force member and project advocate. Her contributions were invaluable to the success of the undertaking and cannot be overstated. Oona Cheung of theCouncil of Chief State School Officers also assisted with the overall management of this project. The task force also wishes to acknowledge the efforts of many other organizations and individuals who contributed to the development of this Planning Guide . These include Massachusetts ASBO, Michigan ASBO, Pennsylvania ASBO, Texas ASBO, and the National Clearinghouse for Educational Facilities. Bethann Canada of the Virginia Department of Education served as the chairperson of the National Education Statistics AgendaCommittee, which was the task force's sponsor within the National Forum on Education Statistics. Students inKaty, Texas, deserve recognition for volunteering their creative skills to draw \"maintenance eagle\" logos for thePlanning Guide . The submission by Alex Fosnaugh, a student at Mayde Creek High School in Katy, Texas, was selected for inclusion in the Planning Guide . Marty Taylor edited the document, and The Creative Shop provided layout and design services. Finally, the task force would like to express its gratitude to the more than 65 maintenance, operations, educa- tion, and other professionals who volunteered their time to review early drafts of the document. These reviewsand site visits provided a \"reality check\" from users with a broad range of training, expertise, and responsibilities.Many reviewers contributed their real-world experience from both the school building and school district environments, representing education organizations from urban and rural, large and small, and geographicallydisparate localities. Other reviewers, including facilities maintenance vendors and service providers, represented the private sector. Still others represented professional organizations with an interest in improving school facilitiesacross the nation. Contributions from the reviewers were constructive and substantial. The document wasimproved considerably after the task force incorporated feedback gathered during the public review process.

Facilities issues arise atall educational levels, from prekindergarten through postsecondary, and at allsites, from classrooms to administrative offices. Challenges arise in new andold facilities alike, although the types of concerns may differ. Because routine and unexpected maintenance demands are bound to arise, every education organization must proactively develop and implementa plan for dealing with these inevitabilities. A sound facilities maintenanceplan helps to ensure that school facilities are, and will be, cared for appropri-ately. Negligent facilities maintenance planning can result in real problems.Large capital investments can be squandered when buildings and equipment deteriorate or warranties are invalidated. Failure to maintain school facilitiesadequately also discourages future investment in the public education system. However, school facilities maintenance is concerned about more than just resource management. It is about providing clean and safe environmentsfor children. It is also about creating a physical setting that is appropriate andadequate for learning. A classroom with broken windows and cold draftsdoesn't foster effective learning. But neither does an apparently state-of-the-art school that is plagued with uncontrollable swings in indoor temperature. This Planning Guide is designed for staff at the local school district level, where most facility maintenance is planned, managed, and carried out. Thisaudience includes school business officials, school board members, superin-tendents, principals, facilities maintenance planners, maintenance staff, andcustodial staff. The document is also relevant to the school facilities interestsof state education agency staff, community groups, vendors, and regulatoryagencies. The Planning Guide has been developed to help readers better understand why and how to develop, implement, and evaluate a facilitiesmaintenance plan. It focuses on: school facility maintenance as a vital task in the responsible management of an education organization the needs of an education audience strategies and procedures for planning, implementing, and evaluating effective maintenance programs a process to be followed, rather than a canned set of \"one size fits all\" solutions recommendations based on \"best practices,\" rather than mandates The document offers recommendations on the following important issues, which serve as chapter headings: Introduction to School Facilities Maintenance Planning Planning for School Facilities MaintenanceFacilities problems affect teaching and learning, student and staffhealth, day-to-day buildingoperations, and the long-rangefiscal health of the entire education organization. To some people's surprise, facilities problems are less a function of geography orsocioeconomics and more directlyrelated to staff levels, training, and practices\u2014all of which canbe controlled by the organization.Thus, every school district shouldplan to meet the challenges ofeffective facilities maintenance. It is simply too big and too important of a job to beaddressed haphazardly.xii PLANNING GUIDE FOR MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIES Facilities Audits (Knowing What You Have) Providing a Safe Environment for Learning Maintaining School Facilities and Grounds Effectively Managing Staff and Contractors Evaluating Facilities Maintenance Efforts The Planning Guide for Maintaining School Facilities is the product of the National Cooperative Education Statistics System and the collaborationof the National Forum on Education Statistics (http://nces.ed.gov/forum) and the Association of School Business Officials International (ASBO \u00ae) (http://www.asbointl.org).

EXPERIENCE AT THE LOCAL, STATE, AND NATIONAL LEVELS SUGGESTS THAT EFFECTIVE SCHOOL FACILITY MAINTENANCE PLA NNING CAN: contribute to an organization's instructional effectiveness and financial well-being improve the cleanliness, orderliness, and safety of an organization's facilities reduce the operational costs and life-cycle cost of a building help staff identify facilities priorities proactively rather than reactively extend the useful life of buildings increase energy efficiency and thereby help the environment PREFACE xiiiPREFACE: ABOUT THIS PLANNING GUIDE The National Center for Education Statistics, the National Forum on Education Statistics, and the Association of School Business Officials International(ASBO \u00ae) are pleased to provide this Planning Guide to education administra- tors, facilities staff, community members, and other individuals who are inter-ested in the responsible management of our nation's school facilities. We believe that investing in the proper maintenance of school facilities is both a sound business and wise pedagogical decision. A primary objective of this Planning Guide is to provide effective and practical recommendations for school facility maintenance planning in auser-friendly format. Thus, each chapter includes: Table of Contents - to provide an overview and simplify navigation within the chapter Chapter Goals - to state the major purposes of the chapter Best Practice Recommendations - to describe how to accomplish the goals Vignettes - to show how maintenance issues can play out in the real world Commonly Asked Questions - to address anticipated concerns of readers Checklists - to summarize recommendations Additional Resources - to point readers to related information While it is hoped that all of the information in this Planning Guide is valuable to facilities maintenance planners, some points stand out as beingparticularly important. To better emphasize these points, a few symbols areused throughout the document: A \"little birdie\" the \"maintenance eagle\" is...The \"maintenance eagle\" signifies a vignette that illustrates how good facilities maintenance (or a lack thereof) can play out in the real world. \"Key\" points... The ring of keys (which can sometimes be seen hanging from the belt of school facilities maintenance workers) signifies especially important, or \"key,\" points. \"On the road\" to the Web... The school bus points to additional valuable resources that are available in print or on the World Wide Web.USE THIS PLANNING GUIDE!

CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION TO SCHOOL FACILITIES MAINTENANCE PLANNING When maintaining a school, we pay not only for bricks and mortar, but also student and staff well-being. Effective school maintenance protects capital investment, ensures the health and safety of our children, and supports educational performance.Table of Contents: Why Does Facilities Maintenance Matter? ................1 Who Should Read This Document? ....................................4 In a Nutshell... ................................5Planning Guide Framework........7In Every Chapter...........................8Commonly Asked Questions ......8Additional Resources ....................9 Introductory Facilities Maintenance Checklist ................11GOALS: To explain how clean, orderly, safe, cost-effective, and instructionally supportive school facilities enhance education To introduce the purpose, structure, and format of the Planning Guide CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION TO SCHOOL FACILITIES MAINTENANCE PLANNING 1WHY DOES FACILITIES MAINTENANCE MATTER? As America's school buildings age, we face the growing challenge of main- taining sc hool facilities at a level that enables our teachers to meet the needs of 21st century learners. While the construction of new school facilities supports this task, many older buildings have developed modularly over time. A 1920s-era school may have gotten an addition in 1950, which in turn got an addition in 1970, and yet another addition in 1990. The task of caring forthese old school buildings, some of which are historically or architecturally significant, at a level that supports contemporary instructional practices is substantial. At the same time, maintaining the finely tuned workings of new,more technologically advanced facilities also demands considerable expertiseand commitment. Thus, it is perhaps not surprising that facilities issues arise at all educational levels, prekindergarten through post-secondary, and all sites, both school buildings and administrative offices alike. Challenges arise in both new and old facilities, although the types of concerns may differ. For example, even a brand-new building may have prob-lems with inadequate air circu lation, which can lead to indoor air quality (IAQ) problems unless remedied. Older buildings, on the other hand, morefrequently face age-related issues such as inefficient energy systems that can lead to uncomfortable indoor cli mate and high utility bills. What causes facilities problems? Certainly extreme environmental conditions and a lack of maintenance funding contribute to building deterioration. Butmany facilities problems are not a function of geography or socioeconomicfactors but are, instead, related to maintenance staffing levels, training, andmanagement practices.Table of Contents: Why Does Facilities Maintenance Matter? ................1 Who Should Read This Document? ....................................2 In a Nutshell... ................................4Planning Guide Framework ........5 In Every Chapter ............................7Commonly Asked Questions ......7Additional Resources ....................9 Introductory Facilities Maintenance Checklist ................112 PLANNING GUIDE FOR MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIESBecause we know that routine and unexpected maintenance demands are bound to arise, every education organization must proactively develop and implement a plan for dealing with these inevitabilities. Thus, an organization must plan to meet the challenges of effective facilities maintenance. It is sim-ply too big of a job to be addressed in a haphazard fashion. After all, the con- sequences affect teaching and learning, student and staff health, day-to-daybuilding operations, and the long-range fiscal outlook of the organization. A sound facilities maintenance plan serves as evidence that school facilities are, and will be, cared for appropriately. On the other hand, negligent facilities maintenance planning can cause real problems. Large capital investment can be squandered when buildings and equipment deteriorate or warranties become invalidated. Failing to maintainschool facilities adequately also discourages future public investment in the edu-cation system. However, school facilities maintenance is concerned about more than just resource management. It is about providing clean and safe environmentsfor children. It is also about creating a physical setting that is appropriate andadequate for learning. A classroom with broken windows and cold draftsdoesn't foster effective student learning. However, neither does an apparentlystate-of-the-art classroom that is plagued with uncontrollable swings inindoor temperature, which can negatively affect student and instructor alertness,attendance, and even health. School facilities maintenance affects the physical, educational, and financial foundation of the school organization and should, therefore, be a focus of both its day-to-day operations and long-range management priorities. WHO SHOULD READ THIS DOCUMENT? Meeting legal standards with regard to facilities maintenance is the bare minimum for responsible school management. Planners must also strive tomeet the spirit of the laws and the long-term needs of the organization. Because facilities maintenance planning is constrained by real world budgets, planners must often think in terms of trade-offs. Thus, they mustweigh routine tasks against preventive maintenance that pays off only overPAY ME N OW OR PAY ME LATER \"Pay me now or pay me later,\" barked the man on the TV commercial for car oil filters. The underlying message in the ad was clear: If you spent a few dollars now to change the filter in your car, you couldavoid more expensive repairs in the future. This is \"preventive maintenance\" in its simplest form\u2014spending a little money now to perform regular inspections and maintenance in order to minimizefuture big-ticket costs and prolong the functional lifetime of buildings and equipment. -Frank Norwood, Director of Maintenance & Operations, Katy (TX), Independent School District (Adapted with permission from the Texas Association of School Business Officials) Effective facilities maintenance extends the life of older facilities and maximizes the useful life of newer facilities.CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION TO SCHOOL FACILITIES MAINTENANCE PLANNING 3the long run, while always needing to be prepared for emergency responses to broken air conditioners, cracked pipes, and severe snow storms. The diffi-cult job of planning for facilities maintenance is most effective when it reliesupon up-to-date information about the condition and use of buildings, cam-puses, equipment, and personnel. Thus, staff who are intimately involved inthe day-to-day assessment, repair, and maintenance of school facilities mustalso play an active role in the facilities maintenance planning process. Yetfacilities maintenance planning is not solely the responsibility of the facilitiesdepartment. Effective planning requires coordination of resources and com-mitment at all levels of the education organization. Our vision for this Planning Guide for Maintaining School Facilities is to encourage information-based decision-making in this crucial, yet often overlooked, aspect of schools management. Because no two school districts face precisely the same c hallenges, this Planning Guide does not attempt to provide a single template for an all-inclusive facilities maintenance plan. Rather it focuses on best practicesthat can be undertaken to develop a plan that meets the unique needs of an education organization. GOOD FACILITIES MAINTENANCE COSTS MONEY... There is no question about it. But unlike many other investments, the return on the expenditure may not result in increased revenues. Instead, facilitiesmaintenance produces savings by: 1. decreasing equipment replacement costs over time 2. decreasing renovation costs because fewer large-scale repair jobs are needed 3. decreasing overhead costs (such as utility bills) because of increased system efficiencySchool facilities maintenance affects the physical, educational,and financial foundation of theschool organization and should,therefore, be a focus of both its day-to-day operations andlong-range management priorities.4 PLANNING GUIDE FOR MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIESIN A NUTSHELL... Experience at the local, state, and national levels suggests that effective school facility maintenance planning can: contribute to an organization's instructional effectiveness and financialwell-being improve the cleanliness, orderliness, and safety of an education organization's facilities reduce the operational costs and life cycle cost of a building help staff deal with limited resources by identifying facilities prioritiesproactively rather than reactively extend the useful life of buildings increase energy efficiency and help the environment The Planning Guide does the following: argues that school facility maintenance is a vital component in the responsible management of an education organization focuses specifically on the needs of an education audience (i.e., it iswritten specifically for education administrators and staff at thebuilding, campus, district, and state levels) stresses strategies and procedures for planning, implementing, andevaluating effective maintenance programs describes a process, not a canned set of \"one size fits all\" solutions includes \"best practice\" recommendations, not mandates supports recommendations from another National Forum onEducation Statistics publication, Facilities Information Management: A Guide for State and Local School Districts(http://nces.ed.gov/forum/publications.asp) This Planning Guide is not: a how-to manual of maintenance procedures and instructions an attempt to dictate policy-making in local and state education agencies (although it can and should serve as a guide to policy-makersas they consider their options and needs)Facilities maintenance planning is not solely the responsibility of the facilities depart ment. Effective planning requires coordination of resources andcommitment at all levels of the education organization.PURPOSE OF THIS PLANNING GUIDE This Planning Guide is intended to help school administrators, staff, and community members better understand why and how to develop, implement, and evaluate a facilities maintenance plan. AUDIENCE FOR THIS PLANNING GUIDE The primary audience of this Planning Guide is staff at the local school district level, where most facilities maintenance is planned, managed, and carried out. This includes board members, superintendents, business officials, principals, facilities managers, maintenance personnel, and custodians. Secondary audiences include state education agency staff, community members, vendors, regulatory agencies, and students in education administration courses.CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION TO SCHOOL FACILITIES MAINTENANCE PLANNING 5Planning Guide Framework This Planning Guide includes the following chapters and information: Chapter 1: Introduction to School Facilities Maintenance Planning describes the purpose, scope, intended audience, and organization of this publication. Chapter 2: Planning for School Facilities Maintenance discusses the vital role that facilities maintenance planning plays in the management of an effectivelearning environment. It also presents a process for developing a vision statement, justifying planning from a budgetary perspective, using data toinform decision-making, and identifying the components of a good facilities maintenance plan. Chapter 3: Facility Audits: Knowing What You Have focuses on the necessary, but sometimes overlooked, step of inventorying school buildings and grounds. It also describes how to collect, manage, and use data from a facilities audit. Chapter 4. Providing a Safe Environment for Learning highlights many safety- related issues that demand the absolute attention of both facilities maintenanceplanners and staff who are responsible for the operation of a school building. Chapter 5. Maintaining School Facilities and Grounds details \"best practice\" strategies for maintaining facilities and grounds. It also reminds readers that anounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Chapter 6. Effectively Managing Staff and Contractors outlines \"best practice\" strategies for managing employees and outside contractors. It also emphasizesthe importance of sound human resources management as a precondition foreffective facilities maintenance. Chapter 7. Evaluating Facilities Maintenance Efforts recommends ongoing evaluation of an education organization's facility maintenance program and presents various approaches for accomplishing this vital task.

A facilities maintenance plan details an organization's strategy for proactivelymaintaining its facilities. Effective maintenance plans reflect the vision andmission of the organization, include an accurate assessment of existing facilities,incorporate the perspectives of various stakeholder groups, and focus onpreventive measures that ensure that capital investment is managed responsibly. As with any successful management endeavor, good facilities maintenanceplans integrate best practices of planning, implementation, and evaluation.An education organization must plan to meet the challenges of effective facilities maintenance. It is simply toobig (and important) of a job to be addressed haphazardly.8 PLANNING GUIDE FOR MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIESHow will a maintenance plan make our schools better? Learning does not occur in a vacuum. Students and staff thrive in an orderly, clean, and safe environment. Classrooms that are well ventilated, suitably lighted, and properly maintained actually facilitate learning. Poorair quality, on the other hand, negatively affects alertness and results inincreased student and teacher absences, which can have a correspondingimpact on student achievement. Moreover, appropriate facilities mainte-nance extends the life span of older facilities and maximizes the useful life of newer facilities. Thus, a facilities maintenance plan contributes toboth the instructional and financial well-being of an education organiza- tion and its community. Why should our school district rethink the facilities plan that we wrote five years ago?Facilities plans, like buildings, don't age well unless they are maintained on an ongoing basis. For starters, maintenance strategies depend on the conditionof facilities, which changes over time. If the condition of your buildings,grounds, and equipment have changed in the past five years (which theyPlanning for school facilities maintenance helps to ensure that school buildings are: Clean, Orderly, Safe, Cost-effective and Instructionally supportive.FACILITIES RESOURCES ...

Why do I need this Planning Guide to tell me how to keep our schools and grounds in good condition? Your organization may already be keeping its schools and grounds in good condition. If so, spending a few hours reviewing the recommendations in thisPlanning Guide is a small investment relative to the amount of energy you already put into your facilities maintenance efforts\u2014especially if there's achance (and there is) that you may find something new and useful in this publication. If your organization doesn't keep its schools and grounds as well as it might, then read on.

The school board was happy, the community was proud, and the students were ecstatic. The high school had finally invested in a gymnasium that would meet the needs of the physical education department, the athletic department, and communityorganizations alike. After only four years of use, the facility looked to be in great shape, so ever yone was shocked to find th at school had been canceled on a Monday morning so that the maintenance staff could combat a flood that had gushed acrossthe gym floor and into the main building. What had happened? A $12 gasket had failed\u2014but it happened to be the one that sealed the 40,000 gallon backup water tank that lay adjacent to the gymnasium. To make matters worse, the tank's emergency drain was covered with boxes of books (in a misguided attempt to increase the building's storage space). The unfortunate result: school was canceled for two days, the emer - gency response cost $26,000, and the gymnasium was closed for five weeks while $160,000 worth of repair work was performed. How could this problem have been avoided? In truth, there were several things that could have saved the district from its woes: Acceptable Maintenance - Regular equipment inspections of the backup water tank might have identified a defective gasket and prevented the flood. Proper Planning - The water tank should have been placed in a more appropriate location than next to the gymnasium. Appropriate Operations - Someone should have realized that covering an emergency drain with boxes wasn't an acceptable storage system!

A properly implemented plan provides school administrators comfort and confidence when contemplating thefuture of their campuses. EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT STARTS WITH PLANNING Unless facilities maintenance planning is a component of a greaterorganiza tional management plan, it is doomed to failure. After all, how else can maintenance planners be certain that other policy-makers sharetheir priorities? Or that funds will be available to achieve their goals? Andhow else can they learn about demographic and enrollment projectionsand the ensuing changes in building demand? Thus, facilities mainte-nance planning must be an element of the overall organizational strategy\u2014part of the \"master plan.\" The master plan is the \"blueprint\" for daily decision- making throughout a school district. It provides concrete documentation about the organization's needs and intentions. Moreover, it is a formal way of communicating the district's priorities, and establishes necessary documentation for funding authorities and other approving organizations. Good plans include short- and long-term objectives, budgets, and timelines, all of whichdemonstrate organizational commitment to facilities maintenance.Effective planning also requires that planners evaluate both the organi-zation's overarching goals and the day-to-day details needed to meetthose targets. Thus, a comprehensive plan serves both as a blueprintfor the here and now and a road map to the future!14 PLANNING GUIDE FOR MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIESHaving said this, however, planners must also accept that the future is not now (despite the adage that suggests differently). In other words, change takes time,and improvements in organization-wide endeavors most often occur in steps. If a school district finds itself in need of a major overhaul in its facilities mainte-nance management system, it cannot expect to jump to the head of the field inone or two years. Instead, planners must institute improvements over longertime frames and accept that progress is measured relative to the organization'sstarting point rather than by comparisons with other organizations that may ormay not be working under comparable circumstances. WHY COLLABORATE DURING PLANNING (AND WITH WHOM)? In many ways, the process of planning is more important than the outcome. The process of formulating a plan establishes a forum through which interested parties have a chance to voice their opinions about the future of the organization. This opportunity, and the dialogue (and even debate) that ensues, is an effective way of infus-ing fresh ideas and new perspectives into school management. Collaborativeplanning also helps stakeholders feel that their views are respected and val-ued. In turn, this atmosphere of respect often fosters staff and communitysupport for the decisions being made about the future direction of the organ-ization (and, perhaps more importantly, the day-to-day steps that must betaken to achieve these goals). GOOD INTENTIONS DON'T KEEP SCHOOLS RU NNING The school facilities belonged to Ted, or so you'd think from the devoted way in which he cared for them. He was the head of the facilities maintenance department and took great pride in the condition of the school district's buildings and grounds. He' d done a fabulous job for nearly 30 years and knew the needs of the district like the back of his hand. But the long-time superin - tendent had recently retired, and there was a new sheriff in town. Ted had briefed the newly hired superintendent on the statusand future of the facilities she had inherited and listened politely when she told him about her own five-year plan. Ted hadn'tagreed completely with her assessment of the future, but thought that he'd give her a year or two to learn on the job. Six months later, Ted was tremendously upset when he found out that the district was closing his favorite old elementary school. He'd never thought the superintendent would actually do it and had repeatedly ignored her warnings\u2014choosinginstead to revamp the facility for 21st century instruction so that he could make a case for keeping the beautiful old buildingwhen the time came. When news of the building's impending demise arrived, he went straight to the superintendent to tellher that it was a bad decision, but to no avail. She explained to him that demographic reports showed that the schoolwould n't be able to meet the needs of the growing population. Moreover, funds had already been allocated for a new build- ing. The school supervisors were on board, she was on board, and it was time for Ted to get on board. Ted took a deepbreath, swallowed his pride, and realized that the team had a new boss\u2014and if he was going to be a team player, he had to align his work with her goals. Their efforts had to be coordinated. It was as simple as that.\"Planning\" is the formulation of a strategy for getting anorganization from the here and now to the future. As circumstances change over time,strategies for achieving tomorrow'ssuccesses often change as w ell. Good planners are always mindful of the need to review,and even revise, plans to meetthe changing needs of theorganization.CHAPTER 2: PLANNING FOR SCHOOL FACILITIES MAINTENANCE 15Who is involved in the planning process? Ideally, stakehold- ers include anyone who has a \"sense of ownership\" in facilities decision-making, even though they might not have any legal rights (or even expectations) to make decisions about school facilities and property. As the list of stakeholders grows larger, it often makes sense to include representatives of stakeholder groups (rather than every individual) as long as the selection process is conducted fairly and equitably. Steps for effectively engaging stakeholders in the planning process include: identifying all stakeholders determining appropriate ways to invite stakeholders to share their opinions during the planning process (e.g., newspaper ads, websites, or direct mail) contacting stakeholders well in advance of the planning meetings entering a dialogue that truly welcomes stakeholders' opinions inviting stakeholders to share unique skills and expertise they bringto the process (e.g., you may have engineers, architects, or landscapers in the PTA who could lend their expertise) fostering a consensus-building atmosphere recognizing dissent as necessary, but not allowing it to derail consensus building including stakeholders in follow-up documentation and implementation effortsDEVELOPING A FACILITIES MAINTENANCE PLAN REQUIRES: involving stakeholders in the planning process identifying needs (e.g., improving cleanliness and safety, correcting deficiencies, addressing deferred projects, increasing efficiency, decreasing utility bills) establishing priorities and targets collecting and using supporting data to inform decision-making sharing the plan to garner support from management and key stakeholders allocating funds to pay for planned activities training staff to implement planned activities implementing the plan being patient while awaiting cost savings or other results evaluating the plan systematically refining efforts based on evaluation findings reviewing and revising the plan periodically (e.g., every three years) Why include stakeholders in the planning process? to hear new ideas and perspectives to demonstrate that planners value stakeholder opinions to increase the likelihood that stakeholders will \"buy in\" tothe planCREATING A UNIFIED ORGANIZATIONAL VISION the act or power of seeing; unusual discernment or foresight. After planners (including stakeholders) have been identified, the first and most important step in the planning process is achieving agreement on the desiredoutcome of the organization's efforts\u2014that is, what is the group hoping that theplans will lead to in the future? A good way of clarifying and specifying theseexpectations is by developing a vision statement that affirms how an entitywants to see itself in the future. An individual can have a vision statement, ascan a department, group, or even an entire organization. The purpose of avision statement is to develop a shared image of the future, which means gain-ing consensus about priorities. Thus, if an individual or department in an organi-zation has a vision for its future, it cannot conflict with the vision of the largerorganization within which they work. The vision for the facilities maintenancedepartment, for example, must be driven by, and aligned with, the mission andgoals of the district it serves; otherwise, the facilities manager and school super-intendent will come into conflict\u2014which is not good for the school district andcertainly not good for the facilities manager! Some administrators might argue that the goal of the maintenance department is simply that of the greater district it serves. However, itbecomes difficult to operationalize such a \"vision\" that is not closely related to the day-to-day operations of the department. Thus, it is good practice forthe facilities department to collaborate with representatives of the rest of theorganization when generating consensus about its vision but, at the sametime, to create a vision that directly relates to its day-to-day activities. A vision statement should be a living document, but not short-lived. Otherwise, it can't inform long-term decision-making and investment. All the same, a vision statement must be reviewed regularly to ensure that itremains relevant to the potentially changing needs of the organization.Investing time in creating a vision statement can save energy in the long run by reminding staff of their priorities, but it is not an answer in itself\u2014the workof maintaining a building still needs to get done. The vision statement merely 16 PLANNING GUIDE FOR MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIESOPINIONS WELCOME: STAKEHOLDERS AND THE PLANNING P ROCESS Potential stakeholders in the planning process include, but are not limited to: maintenance staff/contractors parents students custodial staff/contractors PTA representatives community groups/userssuperintendent(s) taxpayers foundation representativesprincipals school board members public safety officials/regulatorsteachers school business officials city/county plannersdepartment of education staff partners (in joint-use facilities) dept. of environmental quality staffagainsters* other government officials expert consultants (architects, engineers, demographers, attorneys) * Againsters are people who make a habit of opposing any kind of change. To minimize the likelihood of last-minute delay tactics, planners must include these stakeholders in the decision-making process from the onset. A vision statement is a proclamation of how an organiza- tion, department, group, or individual wants to see itself in the future.What does your community value? The appearance of your community's school buildingssays a lot about its values.Some communities have goneone step further and activelyplanned for their schools toreflect greater community values. For example, one school district in Utah requires that artmuseums and climbing wallsbe included in all new schoolconstruction to reflect the community's belief in theimportance of art, exercise, and nature. eCHAPTER 2: PLANNING FOR SCHOOL FACILITIES MAINTENANCE 17(but not unimportantly) sets the goal against which policies, practices, and efforts will be evaluated. For this reason, a vision statement should besupported by measurable objectives. The National School Boards Association's online toolkit for \"Creating a Vision\" (http://www.nsba.org/sbot/toolkit/cav.html) recommends that when creating a vision statement, it helps to: describe an ideal future for the organization think about the organization's best interests and not individual or department interests stretch one's thinking be open to change (even substantial change if that is deemed necessary) be positive and inspiring be clear Moreover, when creating a vision statement, it is important to avoid: closed-mindedness parochialism selfishness disrespect short-term thinking partisanship For more information about creating a vision, visit the following web pages: \"Creating a Vision\" (National School Boards Association) at http://www.nsba.org/sbot/toolkit/cav.html; \"A Visioning Process for Designing Responsive Schools\" (National Clearinghouse for Educational Facilities) at http://www.edfacilities.org/pubs/sanoffvision.pdf; and \"Community Participation in Planning\" (National Clearinghouse for Educational Facilities) at http://www.edfacilities.org/rl/community_participation.cfm.complacency infighting fear of c hange apathy \"reality\" (\"we don't have the budget for that anyway\") EXAMPLES OF UNCLEAR AND CLEAR VISION STATEMENTS Unclear: The Facilities Maintenance Department will contribute to the school district's mission of educating our children to meet the intellectual, physical, and emotional demands of the 21st century. While commendable, this vision statement provides little direction for day-to-day decision-making about the operations of the department. Clear: The Facilities Maintenance Department will provide a clean, orderly, safe, cost-effective, and instructionally supportive school environment that contributes to the school district's mission of educating our children to meet theintellectual, physical, and emotional demands of the 21st century. This vision statement clearly and succinctly describes the department's role in the district's overall mission, and provides a target that can direct the department's day-to-day activities.Creating a \"vision\" should take place in a atmosphere.Brainstorming, free-thinking, and open-mindedness areessential aspects of an honestassessment of an organization'sdesired future. Although a vision statement should be of a lasting nature, it must be revisited periodically to verify its continued relevance in an ever-changing world.LINKS TO BUDGETING AND PLANNING This is not a capital planning guide, but any responsible examination of school facilities planning warrants some discussion about the linksbetween facilities maintenance and facilities construction and renovation. Capital outlay for school construction is generally a more palatable proposition for taxpayers and public officials when a school districtdemonstrates that appropriate care and maintenance has been given to existing facilities. Responsible facilities maintenance planning demands that attention be given to a wide range of other issues that influence organizational budgeting, includ-ing insurance coverage, land acquisition, equipment purchases, and buildingconstruction and renovation. While a detailed discussion of these issues isoutside the scope of this Planning Guide , links to other resources that address these and other budgeting topics can be found at the end of this chapter. For more information about maintenance costs and budgeting, visit the following web pages: \"Budgeting for Facilities Maintenance and Repair Activities\" athttp://www.nap.edu/books/NI000085/html/index.html and \"Maintenance & Operations Costs\" at http://www.edfacilities.org/rl/mo_costs.cfm. WHAT A SHARED VISION CAN ACCOMPLISH An elementary school created a vision statement that emphasized each child learning how to read. The development process included comprehensive input from staff, students, and community members. Moreover, planners went togreat efforts to publicize the vision within the school and community. Several days after the kick-off ceremony for theschool's Vision for the 21st Century, the principal noticed that labels had appeared on objects throughout the school.The water fountains were marked \"water fountain,\" fire extinguishers were \"fire extinguisher,\" and the smokedetectors were marked \"smoke detector.\" When the principal inquired about the phenomenon, the school custodian admit-ted that he had posted the labels as his contribution to helping the children learn how to read\u2014and the principal immediatelyknew that the team approach to developing and publicizing the school's vision statement had been a success. 18 PLANNING GUIDE FOR MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIESFACILITIES MANAGERS, GOOD ACCO UNTANTS, AND COMMON SENSE WILL TELL YOU THAT: The maintenance and operations budget is for existing facilities and equipment. Capital project funding - including staff time devoted to capital projects - mustcome from other sources. Otherwise, existing facilities will be neglected whenev-er there is a construction or renovation project because the maintenance staffwill be drafted into service to work on capital improvements.CHAPTER 2: PLANNING FOR SCHOOL FACILITIES MAINTENANCE 19DATA FOR INFORMED DECISION-MAKING Good data are necessary to inform good decision-making. It is as simple as that. Thus, facilities maintenance plans should be based on a foundation of high-quality data about all school facilities. Otherwise, planners are forced to work without context, and strategic planning becomes strategic guesswork. Planners must know whatfacilities exist, where they are located, how old they are, and their status/con- dition. Are equipment and facilities working as designed? As they should? As they need to be? Additionally, planners must consider projected needs for the future. For example, demographers can provide important estimates of the projectedgrowth of student populations\u2014that is, how many school-age children will be in each neighborhood over the next decade. The only way to ensure that planners have the information they need to make effective decisions is to collect data in a regular, timely, and consistent manner. Data collection is a time-consuming (and ongoing) task that cannot be overlooked. Forefficiency's sake, an education organization may partner with other entities that share their interest in school facilities data\u2014for example, the localChamber of Commerce, the state government, or even local real estate companies. Chapter 3 of this Planning Guide discusses facilities audits (i.e., data collections), which are an important area of focus for responsiblefacilities managers. The National Forum on Education Statistics hasdeveloped a companion publication, Facilities Information Management: A Guide for State and Local School Districts, to help address these issues. It can be downloaded at http://nces.ed.gov/forum/publications.asp.EXPER TS IN RESIDENCE: MAX IMIZING COMMUNITY RESOURCES The facilities management planning team at Valley School District had worked very hard to devise a strategy that would ensure a sound future for the small district's grounds and buildings. Three parents, two teachers, a vice principal, an assistant superintendent, a school board member, the PTA president, the mayor's assistant, the facilities manager, hisassistant, and a custodian all came to a consensus regarding the major points of the plan. When the document was presented to the superintendent, she said that the plan sounded very good but that she wanted to have it reviewedby some construction and insurance specialists. The facilities manager politely interrupted her, \"Excuse me, ma'am,but I don't think we need to do that.\" The superintendent looked at him with surprise. \"Why, Edward, I'm not doubt-ing the planning team's abilities, but it's my professional opinion that the plan should be reviewed by experts outsidethe field of facilities management.\" \"Oh, I agree,\" Edward responded, \"I just wanted to let you know that we'vealready gotten input from an insurance agent and a developer, and we didn't need to pay for it either. You see, Mr.Jackson, who has a child in the high school, is a developer, and Mrs. Ramirez, the PTA president, is a commercialreal estate agent. What's more, Mrs. Allen, who is also a parent, is an accountant, and she's verified that all of ourfinancial projections are sound.\" The superintendent looked at the group, \"My goodness, you've done a thoroughjob. And efficient too.\" She looked to the community volunteers in particular, \"We owe you thanks not only for your time, but also for your expertise.\" The facilities manager smiled, knowing that he and his team had done agood job and maximized their community's resources to benefit the district. The project would go on without delayor additional expense. Informed decision-making requires ready access to high-quality data that describethe status of the organization'sfacilities, its needs, and capabilities.COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS Why plan for school facilities maintenance? Facilities maintenance doesn't occur in a vacuum. After all, grounds and buildings belong to school districts, not maintenance departments. Themaintenance department's job is to ensure that facilities and grounds are inadequate condition to support the mission of the district. Thus, day-to-daymaintenance activities must be guided by a school facilities maintenance planthat is informed by, and aligned with, a larger organizational plan. Without acoordinated plan, it is impossible to know whether day-to-day maintenanceoperations support current and future organizational priorities. Why should an organization go to the trouble of including stakeholders in facilities maintenance planning? Stakeholder feedback provides new perspectives and fresh ideas to theplanning process. Moreover, when stakeholders participate in organizational planning, they are more likely to buy into the strategies that they have helpedto establish. \"Buy-in\" becomes especially significant when one recognizes that likely stakeholders in the facilities maintenance planning process includemaintenance and custodial staff, teachers, parents, students, superintendents,principals, board members, school business officials, and community groups.\"\"PHRASES FROM MODEL SCHOOL FACILITIES MAINTENANCE VISION STATEMENTS maintain a healthy school environment ensure the appropriate use of school space for educational practicesmaximize facility use (e.g., nights and weekends) to optimize investmentguarantee equitable allocation of educational resourcescreate and maintain a physical environment that supports the needs of the academic program, staff, students, other users, and visitors who use the campus operate, maintain, and promote quality facilities, grounds, and services to efficiently and effectively support the instructional and service programs provide the physical environment, utilities, and support services necessary to promote educational activities maintain buildings, grounds, and equipment that are fundamental to a healthy academic environment provide an atmosphere that allows students, faculty, and staff to meet or exceed their personal and departmental goals in support of the academic mission of the schools supply appropriate environmental services in the most efficient and economical manner promote a safe, clean, and aesthetically pleasing campus environmentrespond to the environmental needs and requirements of the school districtprovide an optimum learning, teaching, and working environment for all students, faculty, and staff within the school community sustain the integrity and appearance of the campus environment while supporting the pursuit of the educational process Q &A 20 PLANNING GUIDE FOR MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIESFacility planners need to consider data collection and use as avaluable tool in the planning process. Having \"the facts\" (i.e., good data) is always agood starting place for makinggood decisions.CHAPTER 2: PLANNING FOR SCHOOL FACILITIES MAINTENANCE 21Why should an organization bother to develop a \"vision statement\" for facilities maintenance? A vision statement helps to focus facilities maintenance policies, procedures,and day-to-day operations on the needs of the larger organization. Without avision statement (the target), management risks inefficient use of resources bysquandering time, money, and effort on activities that are not consistent withthe long-term needs of the organization. Moreover, a well-publicized visionstatement reminds staff at all levels of the overarching purpose of their work. Who reads a vision statement? Hopefully, lots of people, but that is a function of how well the organizationdisseminates the vision statement. A vision statement only has impact whenit is read. Thus, it should be shared with everyone who maintains, supports,or uses school facilities. If stakeholders are aware of the organization's visionfor its future, they can align their own long- and short-term plans to directday-to-day activities in support of that vision.

OR MAYBE IT'S BETTER THAT WE DON'T The audit team pulled into the parking lot at the high school. As the maintenance supervisor and a local structural engineer were on their way into the building, the building principal pointed their attention to a well-worn sill on a bank of win-dows outside the gymnasium. \"We'll have to put that window sill on the list asbeing in need of painting,\" he noted perfunctorily. \"Actually,\" the maintenancesupervisor replied, \"that job is going to require scraping and maybe even power-washing. It's more than just a simple maintenance job, so we'll mark it as 30 feetof a $10-per-foot improvement project.\" The structural engineer looked criticallyat the roof above the window sill. \"In my opinion, we've got to consider the possi-bility of a failed lintel due to a damaged roof truss and undersized roof drain.We'll need to look at it more closely to be sure.\" The principal scratched his head, \"You know, I was really only concerned about how it looked.\" The maintenancesupervisor nodded, \"And I was only worried about what it would cost to fix.\" Thestructural engineer was quick to interrupt him, \"You might very well be correctwith your assessment, but the only way to be certain is to check that truss anddrain.\" \"Well,\" the principal smiled, \"I guess that three sets of eyes are betterthan one.\" \"Especially when each sees the world from a different perspective,\"laughed the maintenance supervisor. \"That's right,\" the engineer agreed, \"I'm the theorist.\" He looked at the maintenance supervisor, \"You're the realist. And you, Mr. Principal, represent the bottom line.\"26 PLANNING GUIDE FOR MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIESWHY AUDIT YOUR FACILITIES? Things change. It is a fact of life and of school facilities maintenance plan- ning. The luster of new buildings and equipment are sure to fade over time.And as facilities age, their condition changes as well. But change isn't alwaysa bad thing. For example, a two-year-old air-handling system might performbetter than a new system because its operators have had 24 months to learn how to use it and \"get out the kinks.\" Of course, this assumes that the opera-tors have maintained the equipment responsibly along the way\u2014changing filtersand belts as needed. If, however, the same air handler is operating well after 10 years of service, it is safe to assume that more extensive maintenance effortshave been undertaken\u2014valves and gaskets will have been replaced and thecompressor pump serviced (probably more than once). Because the definition of what constitutes \"proper maintenance\" changes over the life of the equipment or building, knowing the age and conditionof a facility or piece of equipment is a prerequisite for maintaining it properly. Otherwise, maintenance efforts are a hit-or-miss situation\u2014some things only get fixed when they break while others get \"maintained\" on a routine basiswhether they need it or not. When an education organization knows the statusof its facilities and equipment, the need for maintenance, repairs, and upgradesbecomes much clearer\u2014after all, it is tough to argue against good data! A facility audit (or inventory) is a comprehensive review of a facility's assets. F acility audits are a standard method for establishing baseline infor- mation about the components, policies, and procedures of a new or existingfacility. An audit is a way of determining the \"status\" of the facility at a giventime\u2014that is, it provides a snapshot of how the various systems and compo-nents are operating. A primary objective of a facility audit is to measure thevalue of an aging asset relative to the cost of replacing that asset. Thus,facilities audits are a tool for projecting future maintenance costs. Facilities audits are accomplished by assessing buildings, grounds, and equipment, documenting the findings, and recommending service options to KNOWING THE CONDITION OF YOUR FACILITIES Facility audits are important because they: Help planners, managers, and staff know what they have, its condition, service history, maintenance needs, and location Provide facts, not guesswork, to inform plans for maintaining and improving school facilities Establish a baseline for measuring facilities maintenance progress Allow in-depth analysis of product life cycles to occur on a routine basis (i.e., measuring actual life versus expected life)The definition of what constitutes \"proper maintenance\" changes over the life of the equipment and building. Thus, knowing the age and status of one's facilities is a prerequisite for maintaining them properly.e CHAPTER 3: FACILITY AUDITS: KNOWING WHAT YOU HAVE 27increase efficiency, reduce waste, and save money. Thus, an audit provides the landscape against which all facilities maintenance efforts and planning occur. Facility audits should be a routine part of the facilities maintenance program. However, they are often precipitated by the information needs ofupper management, taxpayers and voters, and legislative or regulatorybodies. By integrating the findings of annual audits over time, planners can ascertain realized (versus expected) product life cycles, the impact ofvarious maintenance strategies and efforts on product life cycles, and thefuture demands the aging process might place on the infrastructure of aschool district. This information can be used to increase the efficiency andcost-effectiveness of facility use and maintenance efforts in the future. HOW TO CONDUCT FACILITY AUDITS data \\dat- \\ n: factual information (as measurements, observations, or statistics) used as a basis for reasoning, decision-making, or calculation. A facility audit is a data collection process, pure and simple. The aim of the audit is to conduct a comprehensive inventory that meets the needs of the entire district management effort - i.e., facilities, technology, and curriculum planners - in a coor- dinated manner and thereby avoids the need for redundant collection efforts. Who Collects the Data? The first step in the auditing process is to determine whose perspective will guide the audit. Auditors may be school district staff or outside consultants.Resources play a large role in this decision. Small districts may not be able to afford an audit specialist whereas larger organizations might employ several.Above all, auditors must possess a thorough understanding of facility mainte-nance and operations and have enough time to perform the task properly.Intangible characteristics of a good auditor include an inquisitive nature,devotion to details, and the patience to do the job thoroughly. Finally, auditors and auditing teams should understand how facilities are used forinstructional purposes on a daily basis.The terms \"audit\" and \"inventory\" are often usedinterchangeably\u2014the former referring to the \"act of inspecting\" and the latter to the \"act ofrecording.\" This Planning Guide uses the term \"audit\" to refer to both activities:inspecting and recording.RANGE OF EXPECTED EQUIPMENT SERVICE LIFE Equipment Expected Years Actual Years* A/C window unit 10 - 15 ?Steel water-tube boiler 24 - 30 ?Wood cooling tower 20 - 25 ? Lighting ballasts 7 - 10 ?Emergency battery 5 - 7 ?Carpet 12 - 15 ? *The third column cannot be completed without an audit.Note that factors such as location (in or out of direct sunlight), environmental conditions (humid or dry air),and actual use (as opposed to recommended use) can greatly affect the expected service life of equipment. LIFE-CYCLE COSTS: MORE THAN JUST THE STICKER PRICE FINANCING 14% ALTERATIONS 25% CONSTR UCTION 11%OPERATIONS 50%The initial cost to construct a building typically represents only a small portion of the actual cost to own the facility over its lifetime. Source: HVAC Applications (1999) American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning, Atlanta, GA.Regardless of the size of the school district and the organizational affiliation of the auditors, facility audits are best carried out by teams of two or morepeople rather than by an individual. Although the auditor should understandthe general workings of a school facility, he or she should be accompanied bysomeone who is intimately familiar with the facility being studied (e.g., a custo-dian, maintenance staff member, or school principal who works in the facilityon a regular basis). The team approach promotes several desirable outcomes:encouraging multiple perspectives (e.g., instructional, technical, financial, andcultural) on the condition of facilities; sharing expertise when making difficultjudgment calls; corroborating and confirming decision-making; and cross-training staff for future audit and facility management responsibilities. What Data Need to Be Collected? After deciding upon an audit team, the next step in planning for a facilities audit is to define the scope of work\u2014that is, what information needs to begathered and how detailed and comprehensive should it be? The simpleanswer is \"very comprehensive.\" It should include data on all facilities, infra-structure, grounds, maintenance staff (e.g., specialized training courses attended),and equipment (including boilers, HVAC systems), floor finishes, plumbingfixtures, electrical distribution systems, heating and air conditioning con-trols, roof types, flooring, furniture, lighting, ceilings, fire alarms, doors and hardware, windows, technology, parking lots, athletic fields/structures, play-ground equipment and landscaping, and the building envelope. Other issuesto consider during an audit include accessibility (does a facility meet therequirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA?), clean air, asbestos, fire, occupant safety, energy efficiency, susceptibility to vandalism, and instructional efficiency (e.g., alignment with state and local classroom standards). HIGH-QUALITY FACILITIES DATA CAN BE USED TO: determine the state and condition of the facility - because without collecting information, assessing an entity's condition is simply guesswork. establish a baseline for measuring change - such trend analysis (are things getting better or worse?) is only possible if the assessor has information about how things used to work at a previous point in time. assess progress - after all, \"progress\" is a relative term that has meaning only in the context of baseline measurements. predict and model the impact of modifications - so that systems analysis can be extended to predictions of future performance when based on quality data and sound modeling methods. assist in decision-making for repairs, renovation, or abandonment - because nothing \"informs\" sound decision-makinglike good \"information.\" report district information in state and federal data collections and assessments - which often provide funds to helpmeet reporting requirements. populate Geographic Information Systems (GIS) - and inform new school site selection and other planning decisions. justify a bond initiative - which is simply a special type of decision-making process (and nothing strengthens an argument like supporting facts based on objective data). 28 PLANNING GUIDE FOR MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIESGood auditors are inquisitive, detail-oriented, and methodical.They possess a thorough understanding of facility maintenance and operations,and have adequate time to perform the task properly.CHAPTER 3: FACILITY AUDITS: KNOWING WHAT YOU HAVE 29More specifically, building components include, but are not limited to: rooms interior walls interior doors floors plumbing electrical systems HVAC systems kitchens hardware egresses communications equipment (audio, video, and data) exterior envelope (walls and windows) roof and roofing materials foundations and basements Grounds include, but are not limited to: courtyards unimproved fields athletic fields playgrounds parking lots Equipment includes, but is not limited to: fixed equipment (motors, compressors, telephones, computers) tools (lawn mowers, snow blowers, leaf blowers, drills) vehicle fleets (buses, vans, trucks, cars) supplies (motor oil, cleaning agents, pesticides, and other chemicals)campus roads signage traffic patterns trees and shrubs landscaping WHO DO YOU CALL WHEN YOU NEED A FACILITIES AUDIT? User assessments are helpful, but most users lack expertise. Maintenance staff reviews are good, but employees may lack the time to take on this \"extra\" responsibility. Expert facilities consultants are usually very reliable, but can be expensive.Vision = What you hope Plans = What you expect Data = What you knowOne can of gum and graffiti remover (a class 4 flammable) stored at a school site probablydoesn't present much of a hazard. However, 10 cases in asingle room is a different story.Planners must get enough detail from an audit to tell thedifference!Facilities audits should also include a review of facility records and reports so that potential problems can be identified before they turn into full-blown problems (e.g., records indicating that filters have not been changedfor nine months might suggest that indoor air quality problems are on thehorizon). Furthermore, a comprehensive audit should also look at theunder lying practices and processes that support the maintenance of facilities. Doing so can help to ensure that \"standard operating practices\" are not onlyin the plans, but being implemented on a daily basis. Moreover, becausesome types of record keeping are regulated (such as boiler maintenancerecords, amount and type of fuel used, operation of emergency generators, and use of pesticides), an audit should verify that required records are beingmaintained. Energy use should also be included in a facilities audit\u2014meaning that all elements of the building's structure and operation must be evaluated withrespect to energy use. Energy audits typically include computer-basedmodel ing of the building. Once a base model is developed to match existing building conditions, modifications can be introduced to evaluate the impactof potential system upgrades on annual energy use. In this way, an audit andenergy model can be used to predict the impact of lighting upgrades on abuilding's heating and cooling systems.THE CASE OF THE \"RED HOT\" CLASSROOMS Eileen, the school facilities manager, had a problem. Most of the classrooms in the district's new science and technology magnet school were, to put it simply, hot. Eileen and her top-notch staff were stumped. They had verified that the chiller andcomponents of the HVAC system were in working order, but the system kept getting overworked and the rooms kept gettinguncomfortably warm. Eileen studied the building specs time and time again, but to no avail. The data made sense: the HVACsystem fit the square footage and 200-student capacity of the building. What was wrong? Did she have bad data? What elsecould it be? Once again she logged into the classroom inventory database: 16 students per room, one teacher, one aide, twodoors, six windows, tile floors, six electrical sockets, eight computers\u2014and the light bulb finally went off! \"That's it!\" sheyelled aloud to her assistant. \"The computers\u2014they give off heat too, and that means that each classroom has the equivalentof 26 people in it, not 18. That's the extra load.\" Sure enough, Eileen's follow-up research on the Internet verified that the\"average\" child and \"average\" computer and monitor both occupied about 30 ft 2and emitted 300 btu per hour. Her data were sound after all, and she had solved the mystery of the \"red hot\" classrooms! THINK COMPREHENSIVELY... \"Buildings\" include not only schools, but athletic facilities, tool sheds, and remote sites. \"Grounds\" include not only unpaved surfaces (e.g., fields) and paved surfaces (e.g., parking lots), but also pedestrian and vehicular traffic that typify them.Grounds also incorporate landscaping, which affects not only the aesthetic pres-entation of school property, but also water flow, energy use, and even personal safety. \"Equipment\" includes all vehicle fleets\u2014from lawn mowers to school buses and district-owned automobiles.Facilities data can include operational data and costs of a system. Even if overall operations are sound, dataanalysis can identify areas for improvement. Analysis of data may also reveal cluesto impending problems that no one is even looking for! 30 PLANNING GUIDE FOR MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIESCHAPTER 3: FACILITY AUDITS: KNOWING WHAT YOU HAVE 31How audit findings get recorded depends on the data collection system being used in the organization. Options range from high-end software with electronic pick lists on palm pilots (or laptop computers) to low-end stenopads and pencils. Regardless of the recording mechanism, all data musteventually be converted into an electronic format. If the data are collectedelectronically at the outset, they can be exported easily into a database orspreadsheet. If the data are collected manually, they will need to be keyed into a database or spreadsheet\u2014introducing a significant source of possible errors.Re-keying data is also an inefficient use of staff time. However, if portable electronic equipment is not available for the data collection, it may be a necessary step in the audit process. Once the annual audit is accomplished, facilities staff should review the findings for accuracy. Moreover, every subsequent modification, upgrade, andrenovation should be integrated into the audit records. Maintaining thesedata in an orderly and consistent fashion ensures that planners and repairpeople alike know the most current status of the facilities as they make their day-to-day and long-term decisions. When Should Data Be Collected? The ideal time to initiate a facility audit for the first time is when the organization undertakes major construction or renovation activities. However, if major work is not scheduled, a facility auditing program should be established just the same. Once initi- ated, audits must be performed on a regular basis (e.g., annually) becauseconditions are constantly changing. If facility audits are an ongoing featureof maintenance management, each year's data can inform the next year'saudit and make the task much easier. AT A MINIMUM, AN AUDIT SHOULD RECORD THE FOLLOWING: what (brand name, model num- bers, serial numbers, etc.) quantity and product size (e.g., size 4 or \"medium\") where agecondition working as purchased/designed? working as it should be? working as it needs to be to meetthe needs of the users? repair historyspecialized upkeep requirements (e.g., oil and filter types) evidence of future needs recommended service estimated remaining useful life A PICTURE IS WORTH A THOUSAND WORDS Videotaping of sites can be a powerful data collection and documentation tool. Videos can be taken with digital cameras or converted to digital format withoutmuch trouble. They then provide a record of facility conditions\u2014showingimprove ments already made or deficiencies that must be remedied. Videos can also serve as evidence of ownership, for example, when filing an insurance claimfor items lost in a fire.Regardless of the recording mechanism, all data eventuallyneed to be converted into anelectronic format so they can bemanaged, analyzed, and storedmore efficiently. Data shouldalso be recorded consistently sothat comparisons can be madeover time (a task known as \"trending\" or \"benchmarking\").DATA MANAGEMENT Most school facility managers are extremely competent and have served their districts well for many years. They are ingenious problem solvers with plentyof common sense. However, the roles and responsibilities of a facility manag-er have changed greatly in recent years. Their duties range from asbestosmanagement to contract procurement, from high-tech computer operationsto refitting a 50-year-old coal boiler. Some of these tasks leave little room forerror. Thus, facility managers must be expert collectors, organizers, and asses-sors of facilities data if a school district is to have safe and well-maintainedschool buildings. But data collection is not an end in itself. Rather, data collection should be motivated by and geared toward providing information that results in bet- ter management of the organization. Which data are collected may be drivenby diverse information needs: the boss's monthly report, the school board'squarterly report, the state's annual collection of facilities data, and regulatoryrequirements, to name a few. If these reports are not submitted in a timelymanner, someone is going to come looking for them. However, collectingmeaningless data and submitting an equally meaningless report is unlikely tobe of much value to the planning process. On the other hand, collecting and reporting good data for use in analysis, trending, and planning is a vital steptoward good organizational management. The facility operations budget typically represents about 10 percent of a school district's entire spending (not including capital funding for majorconstruction and renovation projects). Thus, facilities warrant the attention of an education organization's top management, who should appreciate thatinvesting resources in facilities data collection and information systems is anintegral part of any district-wide management plan. These systems do nothave to be expensive, although effective facilities data management is wortha substantial investment. In fact, trying to manage a school district withoutsuch an effective audit system is by far the most expensive solution of all,because other resources (human, capital, and operational) might be squan- dered if they are not being directed by management plans based on accurateand timely data. GOOD DATA COLLECTION AND USE: A FRIEND TO STUDE NTS AND AD MINISTRATORS ALIKE Good data collection and use can be as simple as a log or notation system on a building's floor-plan diagram. For example, Cheryl, the school nurse at Homer Elementary, decided to identify every accident incident that was reported in her school building. When she marked a third fall in the same location on her f loor plan, she told the principal who, in turn, initiated a more detailed investigation. It turned out that a newly hiredcustodian was over-applying buffing oil on his dry mop and leaving an extremely slippery residue on the floor. The custodian was immediately retrained on how to apply the buffing agent correctly, and the train- ing sheet for new staff was updated to discourage similar mistakes. Thanks to Cheryl's simple (and inexpensive)data collection tool, the school probably avoided additional injuries to students. 32 PLANNING GUIDE FOR MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIESCHAPTER 3: FACILITY AUDITS: KNOWING WHAT YOU HAVE 33Because facilities data are so valuable, they should be regard- ed as an organizational asset that must be considered in any risk management planning\u2014in other words, these data must be maintained securely. Backup data files should be stored in multiple safe sites (referred to as \" distributed storage\") to decrease the likelihood of accidental loss or damage. Many organizations, including some schools, con- tract with outside service providers to store backup files at remote locations. Similarly, original facility drawings (as-designed and as-built) are irreplaceable, and should be treated as such. They should be time- anddate- stamped, scanned, archived (redundantly), and loaned out only under a strictly enforced chain of custody. The facilities department needs toserve as the custodian of all facilities records or verify that someone else is handling the job responsibly. Data exchange and the ability to move data to upgraded software systems are two issues that school districts are increasingly encountering. Thus, facili-ties maintenance data must be stored in a computer database that is robustenough to allow for easy data import and export. At the very least, the datashould be stored using a standard spreadsheet format with each column rep-resenting a data field (or element) and each row representing a data record. Images stored in standard formats (such as TIFF and JPEG) are also easily manipulated between systems. In recent years, document imaging software and supporting computer equipment have become more affordable. Thus, manyschool districts are investing in document imaging systems to reclaim office space taken up by large storage cabinets. These systems can be use d to scan documents (blueprints, contracts, manuals, purchase orders, etc.) and storethe images on computer hard disks or CDs. The images can be indexed bykeywords for fast searching and retrieval. Some document imaging systemshave optical character recognition (OCR) capabilities that enable imageretrieval based on user queries. FEATURES COMMON TO GOOD DATA COLLECTION SYSTEMS FOR FACILITIES AUDITS I NCLUDE: The element list includes all buildings, grounds, and equipment at all sites. The element list is comprehensive for all rooms and spaces in all buildings. The element list reflects both permanent features (structures) and temporary features (e.g., traffic patterns, snow buildup areas). Data collections are element driven and do not include fields for long narratives (i.e., the data must be able to fit into a spreadsheet format). Data are collected on an element-by-element basis so that records are maintained about each individual component (e.g., for each window a record is kept of its precise location, year of installation, brand of replacement parts, servicedates and descriptions, etc.). The data are recorded electronically in a format that can be exported into a database or spreadsheet without rekeying(saving time and reducing clerical errors). The data are reviewed for accuracy and completeness by the facility management and maintenance team. This team prioritizes the findings and modifies the scope of the data collection as new issues are identified. How does your organization collect and use facilities data? If you don't know, your organization may need a more systematic approach to data management.34 PLANNING GUIDE FOR MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIESAlthough many schools and school districts have automated their data collection and record-keeping systems, smaller organizations may not haveeither the need or the resources to do so. However, a computerized mainte-nance management system ( CMM S) is necessary when staff are responsible for managing more than about 500,000 square feet of facilities. At that point,facilities, assets, staff, and scheduling become complex enough to warrant aninvestment in CMMS software, equipment, and staff training. Moving to a CMMS requires resources, manpower and, above all, support from manage- ment at all levels of the organization. Good CMMS pac kages should be compatible with the district's other operating systems and software and inte-grate a wide range of facilities management components\u2014including facilities(structures and spaces including grounds and equipment), staff, users, workorders, scheduling, and compliance and regulatory issues. More specifically,asset management software should track building components, furniture, andequipment by their age and life cycle, and report preventive maintenancemeasures necessary for effective resource management. DATA USE Facilities data are not only useful, but also a necessary component of responsible facilities management\u2014which, for most people, is the only justification forincur ring the costs associated with collecting and storing data. In a general sense, data from facility audits assist decision-making with respect to repairs,renovations, or abandonment of a building. More specifically, however, somefacilities data must be readily accessible in the case of emergency (e.g., build-ing blueprints may be important when fighting a fire). Other data are neces-sary for long-term planning (e.g., expiration dates on roof warranties). Finally, some information is needed on a day-to-day basis (e.g., fuel requirements andload capacities on a fleet of buses). In all cases, effective school managementrequires that facilities data be accessible in a timely manner. Facilities data are facilities history.

COMMISSIONING: A SPECIAL TYPE OF FACILITIES AUDIT Even the best-trained auditors are unlikely to know whether systems are operating as designed and intended just by looking at them (because \"systems\" can not be evaluated as easily as components can). For this reason,new and renovated facilities must be commissioned, re-commissioned, orretro-commissioned. \"Commissioning\" is a specific type of facilities audit intended to verify (and document) that a facility will operate as designed and meet the demands of its intended use. Commissioning focuses not on individual elements in a building, but rather on system per- formance within a facility. A third party (who is not beholden to either theeducation organization or the construction contractor) generally carries outcommissioning before site responsibility is transferred from the contractor to the school district. Commissioning typically occurs upon completion of a construction or renovation project; however, pre-commissioning canoccur as early as the design phase, at which time impartial experts review WHEN A BAND-AID CAN SAVE YOU MONEY\u2014EVEN IN THE LONG RUN! The school board meeting was about to get ugly. The PTA was as hot as the east wing of the elementary school. They want- ed that cooling tower repaired\u2014and repaired properly! Hadn't it broken down last September too? The board presidentturned to Ted, the new school facilities manager, for an explanation. Ted began to explain, \"Well, we patched several rustspots last summer, but the tower is really on its last legs.\" He was interrupted by the board president: \"We were very clearabout our expectations for the repair of capital equipment before you were hired. We will not tolerate a Band-Aid approachto maintenance in this school district. Is that understood?\" Ted handed a spreadsheet to the board president before answer-ing, \"Yes sir, a Band-Aid approach is a waste of money 99 percent of the time, but the cooling tower in question is anexception. You see, it's 19 years old,\" he said, pointing to an entry on the spreadsheet, \"and only has a 20-year expectedservice lifetime. So it doesn't make sense to invest in a complete overhaul when the school will be getting a brand-newpiece of equipment next year. It's not a good use of our maintenance budget.\" The board president realized that Ted wasright. He had the data in hand to prove it. RISK MANAGEMENT ENTAILS PROTECTING FACILITIES DATA Developing a data storage and security plan for an education organization is a substantial task in its own right. The National Forum on Education Statistics pro vides guidance in Safeguarding Your Technology: Practical Guidelines for Electronic Education Information Security , available at http://nces.ed.gov/pubsearch/ pubsinfo.asp?pubid=98297.blueprints and building specifications for adherence to building codes, HVAC requirements, and other performance criteria. Commissioning should be included in all construction and renovation contracts as a standard requirement prior to the transfer of liability from thecontractor to the school district. Although initial commissioning can occuras early as the design phase of a project, and more likely upon the comple-tion of construction activities, additional tests should be required throughoutthe first year of building use so that components can be examined during therange of seasonal conditions (e.g., hot and cold, wet and dry). When formu-lating the details of a commissioning effort, district representatives shouldidentify all systems to be studied or controlled, the design logic that supports the approach, applicable industry standards, and the acceptablerange of system output (which varies with seasonal conditions). Re-commissioning (the act of \"commissioning again\") should occur any time a building is renovated or substantially modified (e.g., a classroom ischanged into a computer lab) or, in the absence of renovation and modifica- tion, on a five-year cycle to ensure that systems are performing appropriatelyover time. Re-commissioning involves retesting systems relative, at least inpart, to baselines established during the original commissioning. By adoptingthis approach to facility auditing, the status of systems can be measured andassessed relative to their \"as-new\" condition. Retro-commissioning is performed on existing buildings that were never commissioned. Although a school district may not be able to hold contrac-tors responsible for failing or missing systems identified during retro-commis-sioning, the data can be useful in establishing baselines and identifying system deficiencies. This is especially valuable information for facilities thathave been upgraded or otherwise modified since original construction.

Print out a copy of the blueprints while I e-mail him an electronic copy.\" Within three minutes of receivingthe call, Jerry was speeding toward the high school with a copy of the blueprints in hand to supplement the electron-ic copy already sent to the chief. The rest of the day's events would be out of his control, but Jerry's planning hadensured that the maintenance office had done everything it could do to help. 36 PLANNING GUIDE FOR MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIESCommissioning focuses not on individual building elements,but on system performancewithin a facility. It is tantamount to a \"stress test\" in which major building components are systematicallytested to ensure they meetrequired specifications.CHAPTER 3: FACILITY AUDITS: KNOWING WHAT YOU HAVE 37COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS Why is a facility audit considered to be a data collection? A facility audit is an element-by-element assessment, or inventory, of an orga-nization's buildings, grounds, and equipment. If the large amounts of collecteddata (what, where, age, condition, maintenance needs, etc.) are not organizedin a usable format, they will not meet the information needs of users. Thus,facility audits must be treated as data collections, and managed as such. How can facilities data inform decision-making? Facilities data can, and should, inform both short- and long-term policy making decisions. Moreover, the data also help with day-to-day operations and decision-making. For example, suppose a high school's ice machine breaks down and the estimate to repair it is one-third of the cost for a newmachine. The repair-or-replace decision should be based on facilities data\u2014 that is, the age and expected life of the ice machine. What information needs to be collected during a facility audit? Data should be collected on all buildings, grounds, and equipment at all sites,buildings, rooms, and spaces. It should include both permanent features(structures) and temporary features (e.g., traffic patterns and snow buildupareas). Each element should be described by: what, where, size, number, age, condition, whether it is working as purchased or designed (as well aswhether it is working sufficiently well to meet the needs of users), repairhistory, sizes and specifications for replacement parts (e.g., oil type and filter sizes), evidence of future needs, recommended servicing, and estimatedremaining useful life. MAJOR STEPS IN THE COMMISSIONING PROCESS INCLUDE: Establish expected outcomes, such as how building systems should perform, what occupants need, and acceptable costs. Test building systems and equipment to make sure they work correctly and meet design and operational specifications. Measure or predict the basic energy efficiency and thermal/environmental performance of the building's energy systems (automatic heating, air conditioning,refrigeration, lighting). Decide whether upgrades and modifications to the as-built facility are necessary to meet the stated needs of school leaders, teachers, and students. Verify that building and system operators have received appropriate training. Provide building system documentation for future operations and maintenance so that the facility will continue to perform reliably and reap the expected savings. Store the findings of the commissioning effort (i.e., the data) in a secure manner. Adapted from the Energy Smart Schools web site (http://www.eren.doe.gov/ energy-smar tschools/building_maintaining.html). Q &ACOMMI SSIONING HAS ITS REWARDS! The accountant overseeing the school renovation project had been against commissioning from the start. \"Even if it does cost less than one percent of the project, that's more money than I'd like to spend... I meanfor that price, we could upgrade the landscape in front of the building,\" he had argued to Carl, the mainte-nance manager who had insisted on the commissioning. Carl always had the same reply, \"I know Howard,but the commissioning will pay for itself, just wait and see. Don't you know that fifteen percent of all com-pleted buildings are missing components that they have paid for?\" In the end, Carl got his way and thethird-party commissioning was performed by a local general contractor. When Carl got the results, hewalked straight into Howard's office and personally placed them in the accountant's hands. \"See, Howard.I told you commissioning would pay for itself. It uncovered over $3,000 worth of equipment that we paidfor but is still missing.\" Howard looked at the report. \"Yes, Carl,\" he paused to study the findings a bitlonger, \"but do you see that the report shows that the current configuration of the HVAC system is not fullyefficient?\" Carl interjected, \"But it's good that we find that out now, Howard.\" Howard interrupted him,\"That's not good, Carl. It's fantastic. Why, fixing that alone will save us the cost of that commissioning injust two years. You know, Carl, this commissioning report doesn't just save us money now, it saves usmoney in the future when we're running the building too.\" Carl rolled his eyes, knowing that he had beenright all along, but pleased that Howard had finally seen his point, \"Is that so, Howard?\"ADDITIONAL RESOURCES Every effort has been made to verify the accuracy of all URLs listed in this Guide at the time of publication.

One way of determining functional ability is through the use of benchmarking, which is the act of charting and comparing activities, standards, levels of performance, and other factors against a facility's history, similar facilities (its peers), or independent build ing usage data (as can be found in trade publications).Some types of data management may be mandated by state and local regulations (e.g., maintenance records on the boiler, amounts andtypes of fuel used, the operationof emergency generators, and pesticide use).Facilities Information Management: A Guide for State and Local School Districtshttp://nces.ed.gov/forum/publications.aspA publication that defines a set of data elements that are critical to answeringbasic policy questions related to elementary and secondary school facilitymanagement.

As important as cleanliness, orderliness, and instructional support may be to facilities planners, occupant safety must always be the top priority. Thus, while it may be dif-ficult to define what, precisely, constitutes a \"safe\" environment, it is fair to say that ensuring safe conditions is a major component of effective school facility management. The role of facilities managers in ensuring building safety has changed in recent years. One of their chief responsibilities now is to supervise theimplementation of numerous environmental regulations governing schoolfacilities and grounds and to verify compliance with a host of regulationsand laws. Thus, the successful management of a school environment hasgrown well beyond the capabilities of a single person. Environmental regulations designed to protect people or the environ- ment are many and varied, and may seem overwhelming to the uninitiatedreader. Yet most environmental safety regulations require only minimal monitoring and compliance efforts unless a problem is identified. The first step in complying with environmental regula tions is to become aware of their existence, intent, applicability, and requirements. Most of this information is available from regulatory agencies, professional associations, and on-the-job training. Getting this information may notalways be expensive, but it does demand considerable expertise, eitherhired or developed. In any case, compliance with environmental safety rules pays off relative to the alternative\u2014the possi ble occurrence of CHAPTER 4: PROVIDING A SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR LEARNING 43The primary responsibility of school facility planners is to ensure environmental safety in school facilities.significant indoor air problems, underground storage tank leaks, contaminated drinking water, or other serious environment-related safety or health incidents. THE \"FOUR HORSEMEN\" OF SCHOOL FACILITIES MAINTENANCE Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) IAQ encompasses almost anything and everything that affects the air in a building, including radon gas, paint odors, mold, construction dust, asbestos,and stack emissions. Moreover, as allergens and irritants (such as perfumesand hair sprays) proliferate, school district maintenance staff must becomeknowledgeable about these issues as well. One of the best resources availableis the \"Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) Tools for Schools\" action kit developed bythe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (http://www.epa.gov/iaq/schools/), which provides investigative checklists and hints for problem solving, as well asadditional resources for guiding efforts to assess and improve indoor air quality. Poor indoor air quality can affect student and teacher performance by causing eye, nose, and throat irritation, fatigue, headache, nausea, sinusproblems, and other minor or serious illnesses. Thus, steps must be taken to ensure that IAQ causes neither actual nor perceived illness in facilityoccupants. Reasonable actions might include the following recommendations,although official standards may vary from state to state and locality to locality: Ventilate occupied areas at a minimum rate of 15 cubic feet per minute (cfm). Maintain indoor carbon dioxide (CO2) between 800 and 1,000 parts per million (ppm).Catastrophic incidents are not the preferred method oflearning about environmentalregulations. School districts need to be proactive in learningabout their responsibilities from regulatory agencies, statedepartments of education, and professional associations. WOULD YOU WANT TO D RINK THE WATER? The water inspection team showed up at the school at 7:00 a.m. sharp. Samples from the first fountain showed lead levels just below the maximum allowed by the EPA. When the second and third fountains showed lead levels above the legalstandards, Phil, the chief inspector, went straight to the principal's office to explain the situation. Mr. Jackson shook hishead incredulously, \"Phil, that can't be right! We had a water inspection team in here just yesterday and everything wasfine.\" He showed Phil the paperwork to prove it. \"Well,\" Phil replied, \"we obviously need to revise our work order system because you shouldn't have been inspected twice in the same week\u2014but even so, I can't disregard the results of the tests we just did.\" \"No you can't,\" Mr. Jackson agreed,\"but you can retest them just to make sure.\" Phil nodded and went back to the fountains, retested, and got the sameresults. Mr. Jackson looked perplexed, but said, \"Okay, Phil, we'll shut down the bad fountains until we can figure outwhat's going on.\" After several days of additional testing, Phil determined that the drinking water failed to meet EPArequirements each day until the water had been allowed to run long enough to flush out the system. Phil and Mr. Jacksonagreed that the water fountains needed new pipes. After all, it was their legal and ethical responsibility to make sure thestudents weren't drinking contaminated water. 44 PLANNING GUIDE FOR MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIESCHAPTER 4: PROVIDING A SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR LEARNING 45Install both fresh air supply and exhaust ventilation systems in occupied areas. Avoid recirculating previously exhausted contaminants when ventilating. Ensure adequate make-up air in boilers to minimize backfires and carbon monoxide (CO) contamination. Maintain indoor air relative humidity below 70 percent. Maintain indoor air temperature at comfortable levels (68-72\u00b0F whenthe room is being heated and 70-78\u00b0F when the room is being cooled). Inspect for water damage and eliminate standing water and elevated humidity. Clean, dry, or remove water-damaged materials within 72 hours ofwetting. Change filters and clean drip pans according to manufacturer's instruc-tions. (Filters in high-pollution areas may require more frequent service.) Seal construction/renovation from occupied areas to minimize airexchange. Minimize use of volatile chemicals (in cleaning agents and pesticides),especially while the building is occupied. Replace toxic and noxious chemicals with less harmful products as available. Store toxic and noxious supplies in areas with adequate exhaust systems. Situate vehicle-idling areas away from occupied buildings and ventila-tion inlets. Dispose of used cleaning supplies and water-damaged materials imme-diately and properly (double-bagged in 6-mil polyethylene plastic). Balance all HVAC, air handling, and ventilation systems every five years. Periodically test air samples for CO2(a sign of poor ventilation), CO (a sign of incomplete combustion), relative humidity (a sign of leaksand moisture problems), and air temperature. Sample for microbial growth (e.g., mold) when an IAQ problem issuspected. Most districts that find themselves with IAQ troubles get into this predicament because they fail to respond to warning signs. Many IAQ issues may not be preventable, but can be \"fixed\" when monitoring, well-trained staff, and adequate resources allow the problem to be identified and addressed in a timely manner. Indoor air always starts as one thing\u2014outdoor air. Unfortunately, outdoor air may itself be of poor quality. Today's requirements for fresh-air exchangein schools mean that any impurities in the outdoor air will be brought indoors. Thus someone who is susceptible to hay fever may be able to find relief in their tightly sealed home, but they won't find it in a school classroom. School staff who ignore IAQ warning signs may end upreading about their problems in the local newspaper.Indoor air actually begins as outside air!46 PLANNING GUIDE FOR MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIESGood IAQ plans strive for problem solving through systematic investiga- tion and, when all else fails, professional help. District staff must be encouragedto investigate all complaints thoroughly and promptly. Individual complaintsmay indicate either an isolated problem in a secluded area or the intolerance of a single individual to a contaminant. Repeated or multiple complaints mayindicate larger or growing problems. While the details of IAQ work can be\"scientific\" and difficult to understand, more frequently they are straightfor-ward and reflect common sense. For example, IAQ investigations often pointto expected sources such as a classroom's pet hamster, sprays and perfumesworn by students and staff, reactions to foods or food supplements, or evenallergic reactions to the aloe in tissues and hand soaps. Investigators shouldkeep in mind that elementary-school students may have allergies that havenot yet been identified by their parents or physicians. If there is reason to suspect biological contamination (e.g., molds and microbes), the lab testing portion of an IAQ investigation begins with a study of the molds, bioaerosols, and other \"natural contaminants\" in the outside air for use as a control against which indoor air can be compared.Usually, HVAC filtration purifies the outdoor air so that indoor air has lower quantities of the same impurities. When indoor air tests reveal impurities thatdo not exist in the outdoor control, it suggests that something is \"growing\"inside. If investigators suspect that the problem is chemical in nature (e.g.,fumes from cleaning agents stored within a facility), then volatile organicsampling may be undertaken. Common indoor air pollutants include (but are not limited to): IAQ - SOMETIMES A MYSTERY FOR THE EVEN THE BEST OF DETECTIVES Terry, the facilities director, and his staff had done everything they could think of to solve an IAQ complaint from a student's parent, but to no avail. Finally, they hired a consulting company to assess the problem. The HVAC system wasexamined from its intake vents, through the ductwork, and into the classroom\u2014and all proved to be in good working order.Indoor air speciation lab tests revealed no concerns, and outdoor air control samples were all within proper tolerances.Pollutants from building and housekeeping sources were checked, as were air temperature and humidity. The roof was inspected for leaks and mold, but nothing could be found. Meanwhile, the child's parents notified every authority theycould find, and soon the local media were on to the story. A medical doctor had verified that the child was, indeed, react-ing to something in the school that was making him ill. In fact, when the student transferred to another school, all symp-toms immediately cleared up. Finally, after weeks of investigative work, one of Terry's staff saw a teacher's aide spraying an insecticide (\"but only lightl y\") in the student's former classroom because she had seen ants in the area. The student was subsequently diagnosed as being hypersensitive to the pesticide. Terry was able to have the classroom thoroughly cleaned (and the teaching staff trained) so the student could return to his class. tobacco smoke formaldehyde volatile organic compounds (VOCs) nitrogen oxidescarbon monoxide carbon dioxide allergens pathogens radondust lead pesticides (used in or near buildings)CHAPTER 4: PROVIDING A SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR LEARNING 47While this list is far from exhaustive, each of these contaminants needs to be understood and properly managed. Many of these compounds arecommon outdoor air pollutants as well, and all can be routinely linked tobuildings and air-handling equipment. Potential sources of IAQ contaminants include (but are not limited to): \"fresh\" air odors from dumpsters lab and workshop emissions cleaning process emissions insects and other pests insecticides and pesticides furnaces and fuel lines building occupants (e.g., perfumes) underground sources (e.g., sewer lines and radon gas) HVAC equipment (which is often a path of distribution) Building administrators also need to be concerned about creating air quality problems. For example, landscaping \"environmental\" areas is a popular and worthwhile school revitalization project. However, if notproperly handled, such initiatives can introduce moisture and mold problems(e.g., from mulch laid outside air-intake vents), lead to fire-exit violations(e.g., if access to exits are obstructed or impeded), and invite bees and bitinginsects (e.g., if pollen-releasing flowers are planted). The answer is not to forbid landscape initiatives, but to make sure that projects are carried out withproper foresight. The right questions - addressing issues such as plot location,intended use, and potential impact on health and safety - must be asked (andanswered) prior to granting permission for any improvement projects. For more information about indoor air quality management, visit the National Clearinghouse for Educational Facilities' IAQ resource list athttp://www.edfacilities.org/rl/iaq.cfm, which provides list of links, books, and journal articles addressing indoor air quality issues in K-12 school buildings, including building materials, maintenance practices, renovation procedures and ventilation systems.Most IAQ problems result from inadequate air handlingand ventilation. Low levels of contaminants rarely accumulate to dangerous levels if the building is properlyventilated. MOLD, MILDEW, AND MOISTURE Mold is a particularly prominent and pernicious IAQ problem. Mold spores occur almost everywhere in the air we breathe, and almost any building surface cansupport and nourish mold growth. However, the key factor in enabling mold togrow and reproduce is the presence of moisture\u2014from leaks or elsewhere. Thus,moisture control is the primary mechanism for reducing mold growth. Even roomhumidifiers, which may be brought in by staff to make a classroom more comfort-able, may introduce excess moisture into the building and thus have a net effectthat is harmful.48 PLANNING GUIDE FOR MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIES Asbestos Asbestos is a naturally occurring mineral found in certain rock formations. When mined and processed, asbestos fibers can be mixed with a bindingmaterial for use in a variety of products. Asbestos products are strong, fire-resistant, corrosion-resistant, and good insulators. In schools, asbestos wascommonly used in building materials and has been found in floor and ceilingtiles, cement pipes, pipe and boiler insulation, and spray-applied fireproofing.While the presence of asbestos-containing materials does not in itself pose animmediate health threat, it is well known that asbestos becomes hazardouswhen the microscopic fibers are released into the air, as can occur as a resultof damage or deterioration. The type and amount of asbestos in a product varies depend- ing upon application. The condition, location, and exposure of the material to air are factors in determining the proper response. Asbestos fibers are so small and light that they can remain airborne for many hours (increasing the chance for inhalation) if they are disturbedand released into the air. Preventing the release of asbestos fibers into the airshould be a school district's primary concern. COMMU NICATING NOT JUST WHAT, BUT WHY: CREATING MOISTURE AT DEW POINT Mary Jane, the principal of Big River Elementary School, was in her second year in the newly built, fully air-conditioned building. The previous summer, she had had to deal with mold growth in a few areas of the building during the humiddays of August, and she was determined to avoid the problem this year. Mary Jane had reported the incident to the maintenance department, and the ensuing investigation revealed that three HVAC units were not operating as designed in the air-conditioning mode. The HVAC systems were repaired and had beendouble-checked at the end of the school year. However, John, the head of maintenance, felt that more preventive workwas warranted, as he suspected that the rooms' thermostats were being set so low as to create \"cold spots\" that werereaching dew point. He left voice-mail messages with Mary Jane and the building's head custodian to make sure all thethermostat controls were set no lower than 75 to 78 degrees during the summer break. When the first big heat wave hit in late June, Mary Jane asked Pete, the head custodian, to set the thermostats lower. The custodian reminded her of John's instructions, to which Mary Jane responded, \"I'm all for energy conservation too, butpeople can't work in this heat.\" After a few weeks of end-of-the-year cleanup, the school was locked for the rest of thesummer with the thermostats set at 65 degrees. When the first teachers arrived in August to begin preparations for the upcoming academic year, they discovered mold growing in their classrooms. Upon further inspection, Mary Jane found mold throughout the building. She called John, who immediately recognized that the problem was beyond the expertise of his maintenance staff, and notified thesuperin tendent that a major cleanup and air testing project would have to be initiated. As John pursued his investigation, he noticed how cool many of the rooms were and confirmed that thermostats were set much lower than 75 degrees. \"Well yes,\" Mary Jane said, \"but it was so hot in June.\" \"But Mary Jane,\" John explained, \"Our HVAC equipment is sized forbuilding occupancy, which means that it cools a room based on an assumption that 24 children and a teacher will be inthat room giving off body heat. When a classroom thermostat is set at 65 degrees without occupants, the room tempera-ture reaches the thermostat setting so quickly that there isn't time to dehumidify the air completely. As a result, watervapor condenses out in the cool spots, which might reach 60 degrees along the floor and metal surfaces. And once there is standing water, mold is sure to follow.\" Both Pete and Mary Jane wished that John had explained this all to them before summer break. As it was, it would take $25,000 to test and clean the rooms and HVAC equipment before school could reopen. Federal law requires that school organizations conductasbestos inspections every threeyears and perform semiannual surveillance.In 1986, the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act (AHERA) was signed into federal law to regulate the management of asbestos-containingmaterials in public and private schools. AHERA regulations apply only to inte-rior building materials and those under covered walkways, patios, and porticos. AHERA requires local education agencies to: designate and train an asbestos coordinator identify friable (i.e., easily crumbled or ground) and nonfriable asbestos-containing materials develop and implement an asbestos management plan that reflectsongoing surveillance, inspections, and response actions develop and implement a responsible operations and maintenanceprogram conduct inspections for asbestos-containing materials every three years perform semiannual surveillance activities implement response actions in a timely fashion provide adequate staff training and meet certification requirements notify all occupants (and parents/guardians) about the status ofasbestos-containing materials each year. In other words, school districts must know where asbestos materials are located in their buildings, inform occupants, and train their staff how to work in affected areas. EPA officials conduct random checks and audit district records for asbestos monitoring and reporting. For more information about asbestos and asbestos management, visit the National Clearinghouse for Educational Facilities' Asbestos resource list athttp://www.edfacilities.org/rl/asbestos.cfm, which provides lists of links, books, and journal articles on how asbestos abatement and management is conducted in school buildings, and how schools can comply with federal regulations. Water Management Public water supplies are generally categorized as either \"community water systems\" or \"non-community water systems.\" If a school district gets its waterfrom a local city authority, it is likely on a \"community water system.\" If a CHAPTER 4: PROVIDING A SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR LEARNING 49Asbestos abatement projects (i.e., removal or encapsulation)are usually undertaken by outside contractors. Districtstaff who get involved inasbestos removal must betrained, certified and, in some instances, have theirhealth monitored.Why is it so important that all asbestos-containing materials be identified in school facilities? Because this information guides day-to-day maintenance and operations. For example, if there isasbestos in a building's floor tiles, staff must know not to use thebuffer/sander to clean the area or else hazardous fibers could bereleased into the air.school district uses its own wells as its water source, it would be classified as a \"non-community system.\" In 1976, the U.S. Congress passed the Safe WaterDrinking Act, which authorized the U.S. EPA to set standards for maximumcontaminant levels (MCLs) for specified substances in water. Most statedepartments of environmental protection also have regulations addressingwater-testing procedures. To ensure compliance with applicable water man-agement regulations, school districts should: review pertinent federal, state, and local regulations develop a sampling, monitoring, and reporting plan that is commensuratewith applicable regulatory guidance verify sampling methods used for testing and monitoring water quality address all water quality and systems operation deficiencies identifiedby the compliance plan incorporate water management guidelines into future construction andrenovation initiatives. Lead in drinking water has been shown to have a substantially detrimen- tal impact on human health. The U.S. EPA requires that schools take ade-quate measures to ensure that lead-lined water coolers are repaired, removed,or replaced. Schools are also required to test and remove lead contaminationfrom all sources of drinking water. If a school district receives its water from a community system, water- testing requirements may be the responsibility of the local water authority. If, however, a school district has its own wells, it may have to comply withnumerous water-testing requirements (such as for nitrates, chlorination, andturbidity), although state and local requirements vary. In some areas, schools face water shortages. Moreover, once an adequate water source is identified, storage levels must be properly maintained,monitored, and treated. Because schools normally operate in peak-usetime frames, water treatment equipment has to be sized to handle peak demand. Water-related considerations may affect the size of the boiler roomas well as space for storing service equipment and chemicals. Effective watersystems management requires a well-trained staff or a professional firm hiredto perform the monitoring and testing. In many states, certificates and permitsare required to perform these services. Waste Management Waste management is a catch-all term that includes trash removal, recycling, and the disposal of hazardous waste. Trash removal is probably the mosthigh-profile aspect of waste management in a school setting. In many juris-dictions, it is illegal to dump, burn, or otherwise dispose of solid waste (e.g., paper, wood, aluminum, trash) without a permit. Thus, school districtsmust be aware of applicable local and state laws and regulations concerningsolid waste disposal. Recycling may also play an important role in an education organization's waste management plan. Many townships and cities require recycling. Inother areas, school districts may have to choose between the environmentaland social benefits of recycling and the incremental costs incurred to recycle. THE THREE R'S OF 21 st-CENTURY EDUCATION Caring for the environ- ment is consistent with the aims of 21st-centuryeducation: Reading = R= Reduce WRiting = R= Reuse ARithmetic = R= Recycle 50 PLANNING GUIDE FOR MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIESIn any case, both solid waste and recyclables should be removed from occupied areas as soon as possible after being collected. Storage facilities(even temporary storage areas) must be located away from occupied areas to minimize the risk of fire and infestation. The Right-to-Know Act (http://es.epa.gov/techinfo/facts/pro-act6.html) requires planning and assessment for a range of hazardous waste materials\u2014from small-engine machine shop oil to science laboratory chemicals. Chemicals used by maintenance and custodial personnel may need to benoted on a material safety data sheet (MSDS) to verify that proper proce-dures for their use, storage, and disposal have been followed. No potentiallyhazardous material should be brought into a school facility without beingproperly labeled and having an MSDS on file. Staff must recognize thepotential volatility of chemical agents that can enter breathable air when theyare handled improperly. For example, many people know that when the roofleaks, wood can get wet and mold can grow. Fewer people know that thebleach used to clean mold stains may itself have serious health ramificationsif the space is not properly ventilated during use. Thus, the ongoing reviewof systems, monitoring, and testing is critical to the recognition and handlingof potentially hazardous materials. Certain hazardous waste materials, including asbestos, also require that the organization sign a waste manifest for the receiving dump or waste site.For example, the dumping of soil contaminated by leaking fuel oil during a tank removal project may require the district to sign a waste manifest beforethe solid waste management facility will accept the contaminated dirt. Thismanifest may assign ownership and potential liability to the district in theevent of a future site-cleanup mandate. In some cases, storage facilities mayoffer (for an additional cost) to burn the material, thereby avoiding the wastemanifest procedure and negating potential future liabilities. These decisionsrequire forethought, due diligence, and disclosure\u2014and may warrant theadvice of the district's legal counsel. The disposal of medical waste, including blood-borne pathogens (BBPs), requires additional supervision and planning. \"Universal precautions\" is anapproach to infection control that requires all human blood and certain bodilyfluids to be handled as though they were infectious. Thus, all persons who clean, or otherwise come in contact with, bodily fluids should routinely takeappropriate barrier precautions to prevent skin and membrane exposure. Thisincludes wearing gloves, masks, protective eyewear, gowns, and mouthpieces(e.g., during resuscitation). The disposal of needles and sharp instruments alsorequires special care (e.g., used needles should never be recapped or broken byhand). All building surfaces exposed to bodily fluids should be decontaminatedby cleaning with a bleach/water solution at a 1:10 ratio or another EPA-approved tuberculocidal cleaning agent. All cleaning tools should be disposed of immediately after use (and double-sealed in 6-mil polyethylene plastic bags).It is advisable for decision-makers to refer to local hospitals, clinics, and doctoroffices for guidance in this area. Procedures for handling medical waste from thenurse's office and athletic training facilities should be clearly written, and all staffinvolved in cleanup and transport of such waste must be adequately trained.Storage and transportation of such materials is regulated, and disposal mayrequire the services of certified or licensed individuals or firms. CHAPTER 4: PROVIDING A SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR LEARNING 51Most states and many localities have laws that restrict the disposal of certain types ofwaste in public disposal facilities.For example, M assachusetts restricts the placement of cathode ray tubes (CRTs), computer screens, televisions,fluorescent bulbs, and lithiumbatteries in the trash because of the presence of mercury intheir components. Plannersmust consult with authoritiesabout specific waste guidelinesapplicable in their area. \"Universal precautions\" is anapproach to infection controlthat requires all human bloodand certain bodily fluids to behandled as though they wereinfectious. Thus, all personswho clean, or otherwise comeinto contact with, bodily fluidsshould take appropriate barrierprecautions to prevent skin andmembrane exposure.An issue that further complicates proper cleaning practices is that janitor- ial staff are advised to wear latex gloves when handling hazardous materials(and even general cleaning agents), although some individuals may havesevere allergies to latex gloves. Therefore, employees must be monitored forskin or respiratory reactions when wearing latex gloves. If the use of latexgloves by students is warranted (e.g., in chemistry labs), such procedures also require monitoring, and may justify parental notification. Wastewater management (sewage plants) is another topic that some schools may need to be concerned about. Whether wastewater goes to a local community waste plant, an in-house waste treatment plant, or an on-sitedrainage field, school staff should have a thorough understanding of their waste-water management responsibilities. Regardless of ownership, water treatmentfacilities must be managed and run by certified operators. District-owned facili-ties face special operational concerns that stem from the great fluctuations indemand placed on the system due to the variability of the school schedule. On a daily basis, facilities must handle peak flow during school hours (andeven more specifically during windows between class periods). Weekends andholidays, on the other hand, present intervals of very low demand. Prolongeddormancy associated with summer vacation pose additional start-up issueseach fall. Therefore, staff must be prepared to schedule equipment use, mainte-nance, and testing accordingly. Care of on-site systems should include annualinspections, pumping, and regular maintenance as needed. Kitchens should havegrease traps to prevent grease from being transported to drainage beds in thesystem. The drainage beds themselves should be well marked. Wastewaterfrom science labs and maintenance shops (both potentially carrying hazardousmaterials) must be managed from their source all the way to the treatmentfacility. These pipes must also be protected from accidental damage (on more than one occasion a local school organization has placed playground equipmentright on top of a sewer bed or driven equipment poles through a drainage pipe).TRAINING STAFF TO RECOGNIZE ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS While not every member of the maintenance staff needs to be an expert at remedying all the environmental hazards that can arise in school facilities, all maintenance workers should be trained to identify the signs of common environmental problemsthey may encounter. For example, recognizing suspicious materials, vulnerable conditions, and potential dangers enablesthem to take the first step (alerting others) toward protecting themselves, other building occupants, and the facility in gener al. It also ensures that most potential problems will be remedied before they become full-fledged catastrophes. Many states have programs to provide schools with on-site assistance in complying with occupational health and safety regulations. Check with your StateDepartment of Labor (or Public Health) or contact http://www.osha.gov/html/ consultation.html for more information. Most on-site consultation programs are free of charge but recipients may be obligated to remedy serious health andsafety problems identified during the visit. The company that provides yourorganization's worker compensation insurance may also be willing to helpassess your facilities for dangerous or unhealthy conditions. 52 PLANNING GUIDE FOR MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIESOTHER MAJOR SAFETY CONCERNS The list below denotes several prominent environmental safety issues that can occur in schools: chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) emergency power systems hazardous materials integrated pest management lead paint mercury A brief description of each of these potential environmental problem areas follows. Additional information can be found at the U.S. EPA's mainindex page at http://www.epa.gov/ebtpages/alphabet.html. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) - The release of ozone-depleting compounds - such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons(HCFCs), which are found in air conditioning and refrigeration equipment -should be minimized. School districts should ensure that all personnel servicing refrigerants are certified to do so and are using proper tools andequipment. Moreover, systems must be designed to include redundant valvesettings as necessary to minimize the release of CFCs and HCFCs duringroutine maintenance. Emergency Power Systems - Failure to protect the supply of power to school buildings can have both short- and long-term consequences\u2014from damage tocomputers to school cancellations. One strategy for dealing with the possibil-ity of power interruption is the installation of backup energy and power sys-tems. This may mean installing large, multipurpose, on-site power generatorsfor general use or smaller, portable uninterruptible power supplies (UPSs) forespecially valuable equipment. Hazardous Materials - The use and storage of hazardous materials is an important school facility management issue. Long-term exposure to chemicals(e.g., cleaning agents or reactants in c hemistry labs) can cause serious health problems. Chemicals can also be fire hazards. Thus, all hazardous materialsmust be identified and catalogued for proper management (e.g., assigning dis-posal and storage responsibilities). The Emergency Planning and CommunityRight-to-Know Act of 1986 (EPCRA), sometimes referred to as SARA TitleIII, does not place limits on which chemicals can be stored, used, released, disposed, or transferred at a facility, but it does require the facility to document,notify, and report relevant information to occupants. Right-to-Know require- ments affecting a school district include: emergency planning community Right-to-Know reporting requirements emergency release notification toxic chemical release inventory reporting CHAPTER 4: PROVIDING A SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR LEARNING 53Products that generate CFCs are no longer permitted to beproduced or sold in the UnitedStates. HCFC production will be phased out in 2003. For more information about the Right-to-Know Act, visit http://es.epa.gov/techinfo/facts/pro-act6.html.personal protective equipment polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) radon storm water runoff underground storage tanks (USTs)Whether chemicals are being used to meet custodial or instructional needs, decision-makers should investigate whether alternative, less toxic, supplies can be used. For example, \"green experiments\" and \"microexperi ments\" (see http://www.epa.gov/greenchemistry/ and http://www.seattle.battelle.org/services/e&s/P2LabMan/) can be substituted for traditional science lab experiments. In any case, hazardous materials must be handled with care (using gloves and goggles, as appropriate), ordered in quantities that minimize the accumulation of excess stock, and stored inflame-resistant, lockable, safety cabinets. In addition to storing hazardous materi- als safely, they must be disposed of in a way that is consistent with commonsense and applicable local, state, and federal regulations. This decision is some-times complicated by the degradation of certain hazardous materials, which canbecome an especially serious problem. (In one school in New England, the local bomb squad had to be called in to remove old, degraded ether from a chemistry lab.) Good record keeping of hazardous material use and supplies can minimizethese types of occurrences. For more information about hazardous materials management, visit the National Clearinghouse for Educational Facilities' Hazardous Materials resource list athttp://www.edfacilities.org/rl/hazardous_materials.cfm, which provides a list of links, books, and journal articles about the identification, treatment, storage and removal of hazardous materi-als found in school buildings and grounds. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) - Nearly every school will occasionally experience problems with pest infestation. An IPM program has the goal ofeliminating or drastically reducing both pests and the use of toxic pesticides inschools. IPM is based on prevention, monitoring, and nontoxic pest controlmethods such as sanitation improvements, structural repairs, and mechanical,biological, behavioral, or other nonchemical initiatives. Rather than focusingon pesticide use, IPM aims to identify the conditions that foster pest problemsand devise ways to change those conditions to prevent or discourage pestactivity. These methods include modifying the environment to inhibit pestbreeding, feeding, or habitat and using pest-resistant or pest-free varieties ofseeds, plants, and trees. IPM strategies may also include changing the behav-ior of a building's occupants to help prevent problems\u2014for example, occupanteducation that leads to decreased food waste and litter, improved cleaningpractices, pest-proof waste disposal, and preventive structural maintenance. The identification and use of \"least toxic pesticides\" becomes necessary when nontoxic methods of pest control have not completely addressed pestconcerns. \"Least PLANNING GUIDE FOR MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIESPolicy-makers should expressly prohibit the use of some materials in schools. For example, explosives and knownor suspected carcinogens shouldnever be permitted in a schoolenvironment. Pesticides are often temporary fixes that are ineffective overthe long term. Sound IPMensures that pest buildups aredetected and suppressed beforemajor outbreaks occur. \"Hazardous\" can be a relative term\u2014that is, something that poses a hazard to one person may not necessarily be haz- ardous to others. For example, latex gloves are innocuous to the vast majority of people, but can be deadly to a personwith a severe latex allergy. To avoid potential problems from allergens, many states have developed registry programs to identify students with severe allergies. School districts should encourage allergy-prone students, parents, and staff toregister with these valuable resources where they are available. diatomaceous earth nonvolatile insect and rodent baits in tamper-resistant containers (or for crack and crevice treatment only) microbe-based pesticides pesticides made with essential oils (not including synthetic pyrethroids)and without toxic synergists materials for which the inert ingredients are nontoxic and disclosed The term \"least toxic pesticides\" does notinclude any pesticide that: is determined by the U.S. EPA to be a possible, probable, or known carcinogen, mutagen, teratogen, reproductive toxin, developmental neu-rotoxin, endocrine disrupter, or immune system toxin; is in EPA's toxicity category I or II; or is applied using a broadcast spray, dusting, tenting, fogging, or base-board spraying Whenever a chemical agent (even a \"least toxic pesticide\") is used, staff should be instructed to apply it according to the instructions on the labelwithout deviation. In some states, the axiom \"the label is the law\" applies. Good practices for pesticide use include: requiring that all persons who apply pesticides and other pest control agents be licensed by the state or locality requiring that all persons who apply pesticides and other pest controlagents renew their certification every three years to keep abreast ofevolving technologies and standards notifying students, parents, and school staff prior to the application ofpesticides in and around schools maintaining records of pesticide application for at least three years (more for longer-lasting agents such as termiticides). Records shouldinclude the application date, application site (be as specific as possible),pesticide brand name, pesticide formulation, EPA registration number,total application amount (strength, rate, and duration), and the name andidentification number of the certified individual applying the pesticide. Schools that choose to have their own staff apply pesticides should obtain a business license, which documents applicable local and state requirements for the certification of personnel and insurance protection. For more information about pesticides and integrated pest management, visit www.beyondpesticides.org for summaries of the 33 state laws governing integrated pest management, pesticide restrictions, and right-to-know. Also, visit the National Clearinghouse for Educational Facilities' IPM resource list athttp://www.edfacilities.org/rl/pests.cfm, which provides a list of links, books, and journal articles about the use of pesticides, integrated pest management guidelines, specifications, training, implementation and management in school buildings and grounds. CHAPTER 4: PROVIDING A SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR LEARNING 55A school district is responsible for ensuring that its contractorstake appropriate measures toensure compliance with allsafety regulations.56 PLANNING GUIDE FOR MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIESLead Paint - Lead has been shown to have a detrimental impact on human health. Lead-based paint poses numerous health risks during its application,deterioration, and subsequent release into the air and water. When assessinga building for lead exposure, considerations include building age, facility use,and occupant age and activity. Results from dust, soil, and air sampling arealso necessary for designing control strategies. Abatement options includethe removal and replacement of affected parts (e.g., windows and doors covered with lead-based paints), stripping of paint (which, because of theassociated health risks, must be performed by hazardous waste removal specialists), encapsulation, and enclosure. Actions must also be taken toensure the appropriate handling and disposal of hazardous materials generated by lead-based paint removal. Mercury - Mercury is a silver-colored heavy metal that is liquid at room tem- perature. A person can be exposed to mercury by breathing contaminatedair, swallowing or eating contaminated water or food, or having skin contactwith mercury. When liquid mercury is exposed to the atmosphere, it emitsvapors that are dangerous to human health. At high doses, mercury exposurecan cause a range of nervous system problems, including tremors, inability towalk, convulsions, and even death. At levels more commonly seen in theUnited States, the effects of mercury exposure are usually more subtle,although still potentially serious, and include damage to the senses and brain. School organizations must be aware of their use of mercury and mercu- ry-containing products and develop policies to ensure that students, staff, andSIX ESSENTIAL FEATURES OF AN IPM PROGRAM Monitoring This includes regular site inspections and pest trapping to determine the types and infestation levels of pests at each site. Record-Keeping A record-keeping system is essential for determining trends and patterns in pest activity. Information recorded during each inspection or treatment includes pest identification, population estimates/distribution, and plans for future prevention. Action Levels Pests are rarely eradicated. An \"action level\" is the population size that triggers remediation efforts. Action levels are based on health, economic, or aesthetic risk. Prevention Preventive measures are introduced into all existing structures and all designs for future structures. Prevention is the primary means of pest control in an effective pest management program. Tactics Criteria Chemicals should be used only as a last resort, but when needed, the least-toxic agents should be applied in a way that minimizes exposure to humans and all nontarget organisms. Evaluation A regular evaluation program is necessary for determining the success of current pest management strategies and plans for future IPM strategies. Adapted from Beyond Pesticides/National Coalition Against the Misuse of Pesticides 701 E Street, SE Washington DC 20003 202-543-5450 www .beyondpesticides.org Lead paint must be identified so that it isn't disturbed (e.g.,by sanding or scraping). Once lead paint is disturbed, it mustbe remedied at considerableexpense. If it is not disturbed,it can be safely encapsulated by simply painting over it.other building occupants are protected from mercury exposure and mercury- related health risks. At a minimum, all mercury-containing equipment (e.g.,fluorescent lights, mercury vapor lamps, metal halide lamps, high-pressure sodium lamps, neon lamps, light switches, relays, thermostat probes, ther-mometers, and laboratory solutions) should be handled according to universalhazardous waste protocols, including during disposal. Moreover, as mercury-containing equipment reaches the end of its useful life, it should be replaced with mercury-free alternatives. Most environmental experts recommend thatschools adopt mercury-free purchasing policies, conduct mercury audits, andtrain teachers and staff to respond appropriately in the event of a mercuryspill. Deficiencies in an employer's mercury management and training programthat contribute to potential exposure can be cited by environmental andwork place authorities. For more information about mercury, visit the EPA's mercury site at http://www.epa.gov/mercury/index.html. Personal Protective Equipment - The personal protective equipment (PPE) program, as initiated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration(OSHA), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and manystates, is intended to protect employees from the risk of injury and illness bycreating a barrier against workplace hazards. In general terms, PPE requiresemployers to conduct an assessment of their workplace to identify environ-mental or safety hazards to which employees are exposed that require theuse of protective equipment. Employers should have a written program toevaluate hazards, indicate appropriate control measures, provide (and payfor) protective equipment, train staff to use protective equipment properly, certify that such training has occurred, and hold yearly inspections and reviewsto determine whether these efforts are preventing employee injury and illness.Deficiencies in personal protective equipment programs that lead to exposure,physical harm, or death can result in citations and monetary penalties. For a more detailed description of PPE requirements, visit the OSHA PPE site at http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/personalprotectiveequipment/ or the CDC PPE site at http://www.cdc.gov/od/ohs/manual/pprotect.htm. Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) - PCBs discharged into the environment pose a risk to humans and wildlife. In schools, PCB sources may includeleaking fluorescent lights and electrical transformers. The use of PCB trans-formers near food or feed sources, or in commercial buildings (includingschools), should be prohibited. Surveys must be performed to identify andremedy all potential sources of PCBs. Radon - Radon is a naturally occurring gas that poses a danger to people if it accumulates in unventilated areas and is inhaled for long periods of time (poten-tially causing lung cancer). Airborne levels greater than 4 pCi/L are considered\"high\" and must be remedied. As part of a school's indoor air quality manage-ment, radon levels should be tested on a regular basis. Moreover, base levels forradon must be established for all buildings. Radon testers must be certified. For more information about radon, visit the EPA's Radon resource list at http://www.epa.gov/iaq/radon. CHAPTER 4: PROVIDING A SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR LEARNING 57If maintenance problems arise that potentially affect thehealth or safety of occupants(e.g., indoor air quality concerns or fire escape issues),the best policy is to addressthem immediately and disclosethem as appropriate. Knowingthat someone is in dangerwithout warning them is atbest unethical, and perhapseven legally negligent. Parents,students, and staff have a legal\"right-to-know\" if they are being exposed to hazardousmaterials or unsafe conditions.58 PLANNING GUIDE FOR MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIESENSURING SCHOOL SAFETY REQUIRES AVOIDI NG \"THE DIRTY DOZEN\" OF PLAYGROUND SAFETY 1. Improper protective surfacing - The surface or ground under and around playground equipment should be soft enough to cushion a fall. Improper surfacing material under playground equipment isthe leading cause of playground-related injuries. Hard surfaces such as concrete, blacktop, packedearth, or grass are not acceptable in fall zones. In fact, a fall onto one of these hard surfaces could belife-threatening. Acceptable surfaces include hardwood fiber, mulch, sand, and pea gravel. These sur-faces must be maintained at a depth of 12 inches, kept free of standing water and debris, and pre-vented from becoming compacted through routine maintenance efforts. Synthetic or rubber tiles andmats also are appropriate for use under play equipment. 2. Inadequate fall zone - A \"fall zone\" or \"use zone\" is the area around and beneath playground equipment where a child might fall. A fall zone should be covered with protective surfacing materialand extend a minimum of 6 feet in all directions from the edge of stationary play equipment such asclimbers and chin-up bars. The fall zone at the bottom or exit area of a slide should extend a mini-mum of 6 feet from the end of the slide for slides 4 feet or less in height. For slides higher than 4 feet,add 4 feet to the entrance height of the slide to determine how far the surfacing should extend fromthe end of the slide. Swings require a much larger fall zone. It should extend twice the height of thepivot or swing hanger in front of and behind the swings' seats. It should also extend 6 feet to the sideof the support structure. 3. Protrusion and entanglement hazards - A protrusion hazard is a piece of hardware that might be capable of impaling or cutting a child if a child should fall against it. Some protrusions also are capa- ble of catching strings or items of clothing, causing entanglement that could result in strangulation.Examples of protrusion and entanglement hazards include bolt ends that extend more than twothreads beyond the face of the nut, hardware configurations that form a hook or leave a gap or spacebetween components, and open \"S\"-type hooks. Rungs or handholds that protrude outward from asupport structure may be capable of causing eye injury. Special attention should be paid to the area atthe top of slides and sliding devices. Ropes should be anchored securely at both ends and not becapable of forming a loop or a noose. 4. Entrapment in openings - Enclosed openings on playground equipment must be checked for head entrapment hazards. Children often enter openings feet first and attempt to slide through the opening.If the opening is not large enough it may allow the body to pass through the opening and trap thehead. Thus, no openings on playground equipment should measure between 3 1/2 inches and 9 inch-es in diameter. 5. Insufficient equipment spacing - Improper spacing between pieces of play equipment can cause overcrowding of a play area, which may create hazards. Fall zones for equipment that is higher than24 inches above the ground cannot overlap. Therefore, there should be a minimum of 12 feet between two play structures to provide room for children to circulate and prevent the possibility of achild falling off one structure and striking another. Swings and other pieces of moving equipmentshould be located in an area away from other structures. 6. Trip hazards - Tripping hazards are created by play structure components (or other items) on the playground. Exposed concrete footings, abrupt changes in surface elevations, containmentborders, tree roots, tree stumps, and rocks are all common tripping hazards that are found in ornear play equipment.CHAPTER 4: PROVIDING A SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR LEARNING 597. Lack of supervision - Playground supervision directly relates to the overall safety of the environ- ment. A play area should be designed so that it is easy for a caregiver to observe children at play. 8. Age-inappropriate activities - Children's developmental needs vary greatly from age 2 to age 12. In an effort to provide a challenging and safe play environment for all ages, playground equipment mustbe appropriate for the age of the intended user. Areas for preschool-age children should be separatefrom areas intended for school-age children. 9. Lack of maintenance - A systematic preventive maintenance program is required to keep play- grounds in \"safe\" condition. There should not be missing, broken, or worn-out components, and allhardware should be secure. The wood, metal, or plastic should not show signs of fatigue or deteriora-tion. All parts should be stable, without apparent signs of loosening. The surfacing material also mustbe maintained, and signs of vandalism should be noted, remedied, and subsequently monitored. 10. Pinch, crush, shearing, and sharp-edge hazards - Components in the play equipment should be inspected to make sure there are no sharp edges or points that could cut skin. Moving componentssuch as suspension bridges, track rides, merry-go-rounds, seesaws, and some swings should bechecked to make sure that there are no moving parts or mechanisms that might crush or pinch achild's finger. 11. Platforms without guardrails - Elevated surfaces such as platforms, ramps, and bridgeways should have guardrails that will prevent accidental falls. Equipment intended for preschool-age childrenshould have guardrails on any elevated surface higher than 20 inches. Equipment intended for school-age children should have guardrails on elevated surfaces higher than 30 inches. 12. Equipment not recommended for the public - Accidents associated with the following equipment have resulted in the Consumer Product Safety Commission recommending that they not be used inplaygrounds: heavy swings (such as animal-figure swings) and multiple-occupancy glider-type swings; free-swinging ropes that may fray or form a loop; swinging exercise rings and trapeze bars that are considered to be athletic equipment and,therefore, are not recommended for public playgrounds. Overhead hanging rings withshort chains (generally four to eight rings) are acceptable on public playground equip-ment. To receive a copy of \"The Dirty Dozen\" brochure, send a request, along with a self-addressed, stamped envelope, to the National Playground Safety Institute, 22377 Belmont Ridge Road, Ashburn,VA 20148. * Pressure-treated wood is another important concern for outdoor facilities. While it lasts longer than untreated wood, it can release chemical contaminants (including arsenic) that make the area dan-gerous for children and adults. Thus, the use of treated wood should be phased out in the schoolsetting.

Storm-W ater Runoff - Storm-water runoff is water from rain or snow that runs off of streets, parking lots, construction sites, and residential or commercialproperty. It can carry sediment, oil, grease, toxics, pesticides, pathogens, andother pollutants into nearby streams and waterways. Once this pollutedrunoff enters the sewer system, it is discharged into local streams and water-ways, creating a major threat to drinking water and recreational waters. To minimize such contamination, storm-water runoff standards have been established by the U.S. EPA, state, and local authorities. For more information about storm water runoff, visit the EPA's Storm-Water Runoff regulations site at http://www.epa.gov/fedsite/cd/stormwater.html. Underground Storage Tanks (USTs) - USTs have been a particularly high-pro- file environmental issue during the past few decades. Leaking USTs can con-taminate groundwater and lead to the accumulation of potentially explosivegases. If USTs contain hazardous materials, both people and the environmentcan be threatened. Although each state defines USTs somewhat differently(e.g., some states consider commercial heating-oil tanks to be USTs), recom-mended practices for the use and disposal of any UST include: surveying for groundwater channels and reservoirs before selecting asite for UST installation considering UST abandonment strategies prior to finalizing installationdecisions adjusting levels of scrutiny according to the type of liquid or gas to bestored (e.g., hazardous materials demand extra caution) instituting a precautionary testing program for all USTs (includingtightness-testing, visual inspection by a certified inspector, and soil andgroundwater surveying in the vicinity) maintaining original UST construction and installation records (andbackup copies) maintaining detailed inventory records (e.g., percent filled, filling dates,and amounts) maintaining detailed records of testing and inspection results requiring product suppliers to notify the maintenance manager whennew delivery people will be filling the UST so that their work can bereviewed for quality keeping a spill response kit on the premises at all times removing or sealing the UST according to applicable regulatory standards upon abandonment or discontinued useCHAPTER 4: PROVIDING A SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR LEARNING 61Environmental health and safety is regulated by several authorities, including federal regulations, state laws, local laws, dis trict policies, and good, old fashioned, common sense. While these guidelines cite several relevant federal laws, they cannot detailthe wide range of individual state, local, and district-level regulations, many of which vary considerably between jurisdiction s.

However, this assumption is no longer valid. School buildingsand budgets can benefit immensely from the \"green\" concept when properlyapplied. This goal is best accomplished by emphasizing long-term, sustain-able systems, including the concept of building life-cycle costs (i.e., the totalcost of acquisition and ownership of a building or system over its useful life,including capital costs, energy costs, and maintenance and operating costs). The sustainable high-performance school concept seeks to introduce a comprehensive environmental approach to all aspects of school design,construction, operations, and maintenance. The benefits include: improved occupant health, motivation, and productivity improved flexibility when designing facilities reduced energy use, water use, maintenance costs, insurance costs, and operation costs The U.S. Green Building Council (http://www.usgbc.org) provides eval- uation tools through the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design(LEED) initiative. LEED is an assessment system designed for rating newand existing buildings. It evaluates environmental performance from a \"whole GOOD FACILITIES MANAGEM ENT ALLEVIATES BOTH HEALTH AND FINANC IAL CONCERNS The county's newly renovated middle school was only four years old when staff in the lower level of the new addition began complaining about curling book pages, musty smells, and the onset of respiratory ailments. An initial evaluation of the building showed the appearance of a variety of molds\u2014not a good sign! Over the next two years, tens of thousands of dollars were spent on testing, consultants, cleaning, and carpet replacement. It wasn't until investigators reviewed the facility's \"as-built\" drawings that a cause was discovered. It seems the buildingcontractor had run into a clerical snafu during HVAC installation and had received a univent system that was larger thanordered. Since the mistake was on the part of the manufacturer, the contractor went ahead and installed the larger compo-nent. Unfortunately, the oversized cooling coils in the system moved air so quickly that it was being cooled without beingdehumidified\u2014and the excess water vapor that was left in the air was free to condense throughout the building, causingpaper to yellow, mold to grow, and occupants to get sick. Because the school board had relieved the building contractor of liability upon completion of the renovation, several board members were reluctant to consent to the project to replace and downsize the univents and install power exhaust fans. Butthe fact that students and staff alike were falling ill meant that they had no choice but to deal with the hundred thousanddollar problem!62 PLANNING GUIDE FOR MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIESWEB SITES DESIGNED TO HELP WITH THE DEVELOPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION OF HIGH PERFORMANCE SCHOOLS INCLUDE: The National Best Practices Manual for Building High Performance Schools http://www.eren.doe.gov/energysmartschools/order.html Energy Design Guidelines for High Performance Schools http://www.eren.doe.gov/energysmartschools/order.html High Performance School Buildings http://www.edfacilities.org/rl/high_performance.cfm building\" perspective over the building's entire life cycle, and provides a definitive standard for what constitutes a \"green\" building.

SECURING SCHOOL FACILITIES security \\si-'kyur- t-e\\ n: freedom from danger; freedom from fear or anxiety; measures taken to guard against crime or attack. \"Securing\" a facility refers to ensuring the physical security of both a facility and its occupants\u2014and requires a comprehensive approach to planning. At a minimum, planners must consider the following issues: Locking systems Install locks on doors and windows as appropriate. Maintain locking devices responsibly so that keys and combinations are protected. Change locks that get compromised. Assign locking responsibilities to individuals and perform spot-checksto ensure the job is being handled properly. Prohibit manipulation of locks and entries (e.g., propping doors open). Equipment protection Secure particularly valuable equipment (e.g., computers) with heavy- duty cables and locks. Keep an up-to-date log of all valuable equipment, including equipment location, brand, model, and serial number. Label equipment in a visible way to deter theft (e.g., with fluorescent paint, permanent markers, or engraving equipment). Simultaneously label equipment in an unobtrusive way (e.g., labels hidden inside the computer case so they are less likely to be noticedand removed by thieves) so that items can be identified if they arestolen and later recovered. Never leave expensive portable equipment unattended (e.g., don't leave a laptop computer on the desk in an unlocked office).Securing school facilities relies mostly on common sense. Lockscan be installed, but entranceswill remain security breaches if people insist on proppingdoors open. eVisibility Keep vehicle routes clear in terms of the field of view (e.g., trim hedges and branches around intersections, stoplights, and signs). Keep pedestrian paths clear in terms of the field of view (e.g., trim hedges and branches along sidewalks). Keep pedestrian paths well lighted. Install security lighting and motion detector lighting outside of back windows and doors. Police/security facilities Train security personnel to behave professionally at all times. Install metal detectors at building entries as necessary. Install surveillance cameras in otherwise unobservable parts of the buildings as necessary. Fire protection Maximize structural fire protection by building full-height walls and fireproof ceilings. Install fire-response equipment as appropriate (e.g., automatic sprin-klers and well-marked manual fire extinguishers). Communications systems Provide administrators (or all staff) with wireless handsets equipped with 911 panic buttons. Develop and practice an emergency communications action plan for contacting local fire, police, and medical authorities in an emergency. Crisis management/disaster planning Perform a risk assessment to identify potential threats and risks facing the organization. Convene top-level managers to determine appropriate crisis and disaster response for the organization. Include staff from throughout the organization in disaster-responseefforts. Include representatives from outside the organization as necessary for coordinating response with police, fire safety, and emergency services. Write a disaster-response plan that can be understood by staff members who will be expected to implement it. Practices crisis-management and disaster-response activities.

COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS Does the school environment really affect student learning? Yes. Any factor that affects student health is likely to influence student atten- dance and alertness as well. For example, if a classroom has poor indoor airquality, the likelihood of students suffering from respiratory illness increasessubstantially\u2014which results in higher absenteeism rates. Moreover, whenteaching staff are exposed to unhealthy environmental conditions, they aremore likely to miss school more often as well, resulting in more substituteteachers and disrupted instructional programs. How does a school district become better informed about the regulations and laws with which they must comply? Numerous federal, state, and local laws that are intended to protect both our children and the environment must be complied with (and, in someinstances, followed to the letter) when managing school facilities. Schooldistricts can request assistance from both federal and state regulatoryagencies in ensuring that existing regulations are understood and are being properly implemented. Districts might also contact peer organizations toexchange information and ideas about compliance strategies. How does an organization know when it has met its obligation to provide safe, healthy, and environmentally friendly facilities? There is no way to confirm 100-percent effectiveness on these fronts. However, a district that makes the effort to learn about the issues and laws, proactively complies with the regulations, trains staff thoroughly, andperforms self-evaluations regularly should feel confident that it is doingeverything it can to ensure occupant health and safety and to preserve theenvironment. On the other hand, ignoring or otherwise neglecting these serious issues (in other words, hoping for the best) is not an acceptablemanagement strategy from the perspective of either the public or the regulatoryagencies charged with protecting the public.

According toreports I've received, you have a school-wide \"turn-off-the-lights program,\"you insist on \"energy saver\" mode on all resting computers, and you maintain strict climate control on a year-round basis. Because your students and staff have done so much to conserve energy and protect theenvironment, I am pleased to issue your school a check for $2,000 out ofthe money you saved the district this year in utility bills. Please earmark the funds for student field trips and assemblies.\" What Jenny chose not to mention was that the school's utility bill had decreased by more than$6,000 that year for a variety of reasons, including considerable forethoughton her part while planning a major renovation to the building. Still, the building staff had motivated the kids to do their part as well, and for that, they deserved the reward!PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE: AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION IS WORTH A POUND OF CURE Under the guise of \"saving money,\" many school districts (and other organiza- tions for that matter) practice what is known as \"breakdown maintenance\"\u2014amaintenance program in which nothing is done to a piece of equipment until itbreaks down. And then, after the equipment breaks, the least expensive repair option is used to return the equipment to service. While this may sound likea cost-saving approach to maintenance, precisely the opposite is true. Breakdown maintenance defers repairs and allows damage to accumu late, compounding an organization's problems. On the other hand, regularly scheduled equipment maintenance not only prevents sudden and unexpected equipment failure, but also reduces the overall life-cycle cost of the building. Maintenance entails much more than just fixing broken equipment. In fact, a well-designed facility management system generally encompasses four cate-gories of maintenance: emergency (or response) maintenance, routine mainte-nance, preventive maintenance, and predictive maintenance. The one everyonedreads is emergency maintenance (the air conditioner fails on the warmest day of the year or the main water line breaks and floods the lunchroom). When the pencil sharpener in Room 12 finally needs to be replaced, that is routine maintenance . Preventive maintenance is the scheduled mainte nance of a piece of equipment (such as the replacement of air conditioner filters every 10 weeksor the semiannual inspection of the water fountains). Finally, the cutting edge of facility management is now predictive maintenance , which uses sophisticated computer software to forecast the failure of equipment based on age, userdemand, and performance measures. A FOCUS ON PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE A good maintenance program is built on a foundation of preventive maintenance. It begins with an audit of the buildings, grounds, and equip-ment (see Chapter 3). Once facilities data have b een assembled, structural items and pieces of equipment can be selected for preventive maintenance. When designing a preventive maintenance program, heating and cooling systems are always a good place to start, but planners should think creativelybecause there may be other components that would be good candidates for preventive maintenance. Once the items (structures, equipment, and systems) that should receive preventive maintenance have been identified, planners must decide on the 74 PLANNING GUIDE FOR MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIES\"Breakdown maintenance\" is not in the best interest of the taxpayer, the maintenancedepartment, or students and staff. Good preventive maintenance practices interrupt the cycles that perpetuate high energy use and short equipment life cycles. OVERALL EFFICIENCYTHE MAINTENANCE SPECTRUMfrequency and type of inspections. Manufacturers' manuals are a good place to start when developing this schedule; they usually provide guidelines aboutthe frequency of preventive service, as well as a complete list of items thatmust be maintained. Many manufacturers will assist customers in setting uppreventive maintenance systems (if for no other reason than they get theadditional business of selling replacement parts). Once the information is assembled, it must be formatted so that preven- tive maintenance tasks can be scheduled easily. Ideally, scheduling is handled by a computerized maintenance management program (see Chapter 3).However, a district that does not have such a system can accomplish the taskwith a stack of 3\" x 5\" index cards and a dozen manila folders (one for eachmonth). One side of the index card should contain information about theequipment and the services that need to be performed. The back side of thecard is used to record the date on which service is performed, the name ofthe technician, and the cost of materials. After each inspection, the card getsplaced in the manila folder assigned to the month of the next inspection. Forexample, if the initial inspection is in February and the inspection is a semi-annual, the card would be returned to the August folder. This simple systemshould meet the needs of a smaller school district. However, larger districtsshould invest in a computerized maintenance management system designedspecifically for school districts. For more information about preventive maintenance, visit the National Clearinghouse for Educational Facilities' Maintenance Page at http://www.edfacilities.org/rl/maintenance.cfm, which provides list of links, books, and journal articles on how to maximize the useful life of school buildings through preventive maintenance, including periodic inspection and seasonal care. MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS ISSUES A number of specific maintenance topics are addressed in the following paragraphs. Every school organization in the nation may not encounter everyone of these issues since school facilities and circumstances facing school districts vary enormously. Additional information about relevant environmentaltopics can be found at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Web index page at http://www.epa.gov/ebtpages/alphabet.html. Access Controls - Keys and key control are a major concern for all districts. For example, who has the authority to issue keys? A great grand master keying system - a pyramid system that allows several doors to be opened byone master key - is well worth the investment. (All major manufacturers of CHAPTER 5: MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIES AND GROUNDS 75Record keeping is important for many reasons, includingjustifying costs associated with prev entive maintenance. A computerized maintenancemanagement system (see Chapter3) is designed to track preventive(and other) maintenance costs.Districts that don't have automated systems should trackcosts manually.When planning preventive maintenance, decision-makers should consider how to most efficiently schedule the work\u2014 i.e., concurrently with academic breaks or other planned work. For example, preventive maintenance work such as boil-er pipe replacements can be conducted while the boiler is out of commission for routine maintenance (such as whencleaning the scale and mud from inside the boiler or cleaning the manhole and handhold plates). Whereas emergencyevents demand immediate attention whenever they occur, preventive maintenance activities can be scheduled at a convenient time. Because a rigorous preventive maintenance system results in fewer emergency events, it tends toreduce disruptions to the school schedule.lock systems produce great grand master keys.) Also, the concept of a \"key\" has changed rather dramatically over the past decade or so. Electronic locksthat open by card, code, or password are now being used in many schools.Some systems record the time and identification number of each person whoopens a door. Whether traditional metal keys or electronic \"keys\" are used,top-level school managers and the school board should establish a clear andconcise \"key policy.\" Boilers - Boilers, which can be used to generate hot water for domestic use (e.g., kitchens, showers, and bathrooms) or for heating buildings, shoulddefinitely be included in an organization's preventive maintenance program.Most large boilers are subject to state or local inspection laws, which typical-ly require that the boiler be maintained on a regular basis (at least annually)and that maintenance records be kept on-site. Records of hours of operationand fuel use must also be maintained on-site and made available to inspec-tors. Moreover, permits may be required for boilers that generate more than10,000,000 btu/hour. Energy-saving techniques include equipping boilerswith hot-water temperature resets (which adjust the temperature of the hotwater being produced based on the outside temperature) and using boilereconomizers to capture and recycle heat that would otherwise be lost in the stacks. Electrical Systems - Electrical equipment must be maintained like any other piece of equipment, whether it is a distribution pole with transformers or abreaker box for controlling a classroom's electrical power. Professional engi-neers and electricians should help to determine preventive maintenance tasksand schedules for electrical components. Thermographic scanning, whichidentifies overheating in connections, motors, bearings, and other electricalswitchgear, can be an important tool for determining the condition of electricalgear (the principle behind the test is that a loose connection, bad bearing, or bad breaker bars will produce more heat than a proper connection).Thermographic scanning devices are not expensive and should be part of every district's standard maintenance toolkit. Another new technology,motor current analysis, checks the line current going to a motor and can be used to identify unacceptably high resistance and other defective parts in a motor before it fails. With the widespread use of computers, the propermaintenance of electrical systems is more important than ever in 21st-centuryschools. Reliance upon extension cords and an excessive number of power 76 PLANNING GUIDE FOR MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIESKeys are only one of many methods for controlling buildingaccess. People who are authorized to be in a district facility should be clearly identifiable, even from a distance. Thus, it is wise torequire maintenance and operations staff to wear district-issued uniforms whenworking at school sites. (Even aT-shirt with \"Evergreen School District Maintenance Staff\"silk-screened across the frontcan serve as an \"official\" uniform when worn withkhaki work pants and boots.Identification badges with an individual's picture are anothereffective means for identifying individuals who are authorizedto enter a school.A good maintenance plan is preventive\u2014i.e., preventivework orders outnumber emergency work orders.poles is an indication that permanent upgrades to the electrical system are needed. However, upgrading existing electrical systems in old buildings mustbe carefully managed. Building codes vary by locality, but whatever procedures, standards, and inspection requirements exist are designed for standard ization and safety and must be carefully followed by school personnel. Energy Management - The cost of energy is a major item in any school budg- et. Thus, school planners should embrace ideas that can lead to reducedenergy costs. Energy Management Systems are computer-controlled systemsthat operate HVAC units. They can automatically turn on and off air condi-tioning, lights, and boilers according to pre-programmed instructions enteredby facilities staff. Investment in Energy Management Systems will generallybe recouped within a few years. The following guidelines will help a school district to accomplish more efficient energy management: Establish an energy policy with specific goals and objectives. Assign someone to be responsible for the district's energy managementprogram, and give this energy manager access to top-level administrators. Monitor each building's energy use. Conduct energy audits in all buildings to identify energy-inefficient units. Institute performance contracting (i.e., contracts requiring desiredresults rather than simply a list of needed products) when replacingolder, energy-inefficient equipment. Reward schools that decrease their energy use. Install energy-efficient equipment, including power factor correction units, electronic ballast, high-efficient lamps, night setbacks, and variable-speed drives for large motors and pumps. Install motion detectors that turn lights on when a room is occupied(and off when the room is unoccupied). CHAPTER 5: MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIES AND GROUNDS 77Some schools save energy by closing at 5 p.m. one night aweek\u2014meaning no after-school clubs, athletic events, or com-munity use for that evening.The inconvenience to users is minimal compared to thesubstantial savings, whichinclude not only lower utilitybills but also improved staffsanity since it is the one night a week everyone will go homeat a reasonable hour!FOCUS ON ENERGY EFFICIENCY Direct Digital Controls (DDCs): DDCs are a state-of-the-art method of controlling temperature with sensors and computers. Thermostats are replaced by a sensor that transmits the current room temperature to a computer, which has been programmed with a desired \"target\" temperature and signals the controller to raise or lower the room temperature asneeded to reach the target. DDCs are not yet standard with most Energy Management Systems, but they can be purchasedas an upgrade or retrofitted to existing systems. Two-Pipe and Four-Pipe HVAC Systems: HVAC water systems heat and cool buildings by transferring hot or cold water through a system of pipes. One method of moving the water through a building uses a \" two-pipe\" system, in which onepipe is used to supply the water to the point of use and the other is used to return the water to its source. Because onlytwo pipes need to be installed, it is initially less expensive than a \"four-pipe\" system. The drawback is that chilled and hot water can't both be supplied at the same time. In other words, a building is either being heated or being cooled in itsentirety at any given time. If, for example, the south face of a building heats up faster than the shaded north face, thereis no way to heat one part of the building while another part is being cooled. In contrast, a four-pipe system (which is basically a dual two-pipe system) allows both chilled and hot water to be sent to different parts of a building at the same time. Because four-pipe systems minimize the need for unnecessary heatingor cooling, they are recommended in all new building construction and renovation. Although they cost more to install,their operational savings will quickly recoup the costs and lead to substantial energy savings over a building's life.For more information about energy management, visit the National Clearinghouse for Educational Facilities' Energy Page at http://www.edfacilities.org/rl/energy.cfm, which provides list of links, books, and journal articles on various methods of heating, cooling,and maintaining new and retrofitted K-12 school buildings and grounds. Fire Alarms - Fire drills should be held on a monthly basis both to test fire alarms and practice occupant response to fire emergencies. During school breaks when buildings are not occu- pied, detailed inspections of all fire alarms should be performed. This includes testing all pull stations, smoke detectors, and heat detectors located in building ductwork. (Note that the installation of smoke and heat detectors in HVAC ducts is a recent, but important, revision to many build-ing codes.) Some states require that a licensed contractor perform fire alarminspections. Floor Coverings - Selecting appropriate floor coverings for a school is an important issue that planners must address during renovation and new con-struction. Often lunchrooms, main halls, and secondary halls are covered interrazzo, vinyl composition tile (VCT), or quarry tile. These coverings havehard surfaces that are easily cleaned and do not collect dirt. In classroomswhere noise control is important, carpets with an impermeable backing,which prevents the passage of water or dirt and are easily cleaned, may beused. Carpets can also be purchased with adhesives already attached to thebacking, which helps to ensure complete adhesion without the emission ofvolatile organic compounds (VOCs). Some primary schools use area rugs 78 PLANNING GUIDE FOR MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIESExperienced facilities managers recommend that all grout be in earth tones (or on the dark sideof the color spectrum) becauselight-colored grout tends tostain and discolor over time,often to the point that it is difficult to restore or repair. FOCUS ON FLOORS: A COMMON CUSTODIAL TASK A large part of custodial responsibilities in a school building involves the cleaning of various types of flooring. In heavy-traffic areas such as corridors, classrooms, and cafeterias, an effective cleaning regimen might be: CARPETS HARD SURFACES Shake floor mats in entryways Shake floor mats in entryways Vacuum daily Dry-mop daily Apply spot remover as needed Apply spot remover as needed Deep-clean prior to start of school year Wet-mop three times/week Deep-clean during holiday break Spray-burnish every other week Scrub-clean twice yearly Strip and finish yearly Although carpets help to protect floors, they are difficult to keep clean. They collect dirt and pesticides, and incubate fungi and bacteria when moisture gets trapped. Adhesive backing can also give off harmful fumes. (Some new schoolbuildings are being constructed without carpets to alleviate these health concerns.) If, however, the floor-covering inventoryincludes carpet, then provisions must be made for proper cleaning. A hot-water ex tractor should be available at each school and used weekly to remove stains and dirt. Carpets should be steam-cleaned annually with a professional-quality steamcleaner that generates water at least 140\u00baF and an extraction capability of 60 pounds per square inch. Note, however, thatcarpets must be dried within 24 hours of wet-cleaning to prevent mold from growing. Carpet bonnets, which attach over a buffer wheel, should never be used because they damage carpets. Larger districts should have in-house staff who arecapable of repairing buffers, vacuum cleaners, and other types of carpet-cleaning equipment. Equipment manufacturers will advise customers about training repair people and obtaining replacement parts. For more information about recommended carpet and rug care, visit the Carpet and Rug Institute (CRI) at http://www.carpet-rug.com/. The CRI also has a site that focuses on carpet use in schools, including such topics as indoor air quality, allergies, and carpet selec tion, installation, and care at http://www.carpet-schools.com/.rather than carpets because they can be easily removed and cleaned at the end of the school year or as needed. Periodic cleaning of both carpets andrugs is necessary to minimize the likelihood of dirt and other contaminantscausing indoor air quality problems. Ceramic floor tile is an excellent surfacematerial for bathrooms or other areas with high exposure to water. Goodspecifications for a high-performance, soft-surface floor covering include: nylon type 6.6 face weight no greater than 20 ounces 100 stitches per square inch vinyl pre-coated as primary backing close-cell vinyl cushion permanently fused to tufting blanket no moisture penetration after 10,000 impacts no backing or seam degradation after 50,000 cycles from Phillips ChairCaster Test factory-applied non-wet, low-VOC adhesive with no off-gassing(required) permanent chemically welded seams warranty non-prorated for 20 years against zippering, delamination,edge ravel, excessive surface wear, and loss of resiliency For more information about floor care, visit the National Clearinghouse for Educational Facilities' Floor Care Page at http://www.edfacilities.org/rl/floor_care.cfm, which provides list of links, books, and journal articles on the maintenance of a variety of floorcoverings in K-12 school classrooms, gymnasiums, science labs, hallways and stairs. Gym Floors - Gym floors are generally constructed with vinyl composition tile (VCT), one of several grades of maple flooring, sheet rubber, or othersynthetic materials. Regardless, all floor types must be kept clean and proper-ly maintained. VCT floors must be periodically stripped and re-waxed toensure a safe surface. Wood floors require annual screening and resealingwith a water-based sealant. They should also be sanded, re-marked, andresealed in their entirety every 10 years. Synthetic floors (including sheet rubberbut excluding asbestos tile) require monthly cleaning and scrubbing with buffers. Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HV AC) Systems - All schools require HVAC systems to control indoor climate if they are to provide an environ-ment that is conducive to learning. In fact, oftentimes a district's ability toconvene classes depends on acceptable climate control. If the air condition-ing is broken on a 90\u00baF day or the heating system is malfunctioning on a30\u00baF day, school gets canceled. It's as simple as that. Different regions of thecountry may place emphasis on different elements of the HVAC system, butthe bottom line is the same: HVAC components must be maintained on atimely and routine basis. This preventive maintenance will ensure reliability,reduce operating costs, and increase the life expectancy of the equipment. CHAPTER 5: MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIES AND GROUNDS 79Two effective ways to improve HVAC performance are through air balanc- ing and water balancing. Air balancing ensures that the desired amount of air reaches each space in the building, as specified in the mechanical plans.Water balancing ensures that the flow of water from the chiller and boiler is in accordance with the mechanical plans. Water balancing is normally per-formed before air balancing. Balancing is usually conducted upon installationof new equipment and at 5- to 8-year intervals. Balancing should also be conducted when building space is substantially modified or room use ischanged dramatically. For more information about HVAC systems, visit the National Clearinghouse for Educational Facilities' HVAC Page at http://www.edfacilities.org/rl/hvac.cfm, which provides list of links, books, and journal articles on HVAC systems, including geothermalheating systems, in school buildings. Hot W ater Heaters - Hot water heaters in schools range in size from small 10-gallon heaters to the larger 100- to 300-gallon units. Preventive maintenanceprograms must be established for each hot water heater. At a minimum, maintenance should include inspection for failing safety devices and leaks (especially if fired by natural gas). Kitchens - Kitchens present special problems for school districts: not only must equipment be maintained properly to ensure reliability, but 1) a highstate of cleanliness must be maintained in all food preparation areas; 2) theuse of certain cleaning agents may be discouraged in food preparation areas;and 3) ovens and stoves pose special fire safety concerns. Floor surfaces arealso of particular concern in kitchens since they must be easy to clean yetslip-resistant. Recommended floor surfaces for kitchens include terrazzo,vinyl composition tile (VCT), quarry tile, and sealed concrete. Kitchen equip-ment is a prime candidate for inclusion in a preventive maintenance program. Painting - Painting should be done on a regular schedule that is published well in advance of work dates to minimize inconvenience to building occu-pants. Painting needs will be determined largely by the type of surface, thetype of paint applied previously, and surface use (e.g., a window pane may beexpected to receive less wear than a chair rail). A wall constructed of concretemasonry units (CMU) and painted with a two-part epoxy can last 8 or 10years whereas drywall will require painting every 5 or 6 years. Bathrooms,special education areas, and other high-traffic areas will require painting on amore frequent schedule. A durable, cleanable (i.e., able to be cleaned by thecustodial staff with their standard tools), paint from a major manufacturershould be used for indoor areas. Water-based latex paints are a good choicebecause they are low in volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and do not pro- duce noticeable odors. Surfaces must be properly prepared for painting, whichmay require the use of a primer to cover stains and discolored patches. Plumbing - Like other major building components, plumbing should be included in the preventive maintenance program. Sprinkler systems, waterfountains, sump pumps, lift pumps, steam traps, expansion joints, and drainsare likely targets for preventive maintenance. Standing water must be avoidedat all costs since it damages building materials and can lead to mold concernsthat affect indoor air quality. 80 PLANNING GUIDE FOR MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIESPublic Address Systems and Intercoms - These communications tools are vital to the management of school buildings and, in an emergency, the safety ofbuilding occupants. Public address (PA) systems must be connected to theemergency power system to ensure uninterrupted communications in theevent of a power failure. Public address systems and intercoms should betested on a daily basis during the broadcast of a school's morning announce-ments. If broadcast systems fail to perform properly, they must be repairedimmediately. Roof Repairs - Roofs should be included in a preventive maintenance program and inspected on a regular schedule. The key to maintaining goodroofs is the timely removal of water from the surface and substructure of theroof. Thus, all leaks and damaged tiles must be repaired as soon as possibleto prevent water damage and mold growth. On composition built-up roofs,hot tar is the only appropriate repair method. Single-ply and modified roofsshould be repaired in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Staffshould read carefully all warranties issued with new roofs to ensure thatrequired maintenance is conducted according to specification so as to avoidinvalidating the warranty protections. For example, failing to inspect or repaira roof on an annual basis (and document such efforts) may be considered justification for a manufacturer invalidating a warranty. The facility manager must verify the annual assessment of each roof within the district, recording the date of installation, type of roof, type andthickness of insulation, type of drainage, and type and frequency of repairwork. Detailed drawings or photographs that show the location of repairsshould be maintained, as should contact information for the installing con-tractor. This information is extremely important in the event of a major roof-ing problem or an insurance or warranty claim. Whatever type of roof isselected, it should be installed by a reputable (and bonded) roofer and shouldinclude a non-prorated warranty. For more information about roof repairs, visit the National Clearinghouse for Educational Facilities' Roof Repair Page at http://www.edfacilities.org/rl/roof_maintenance.cfm, which provides list of links, books, and journal articles discussing maximizing the life cycle performance of school roofs, as well as roof inspection strategies, scheduling, documentation, and repair resources. Water Softeners - Water softeners are often used in hot water lines in those regions of the country where the water has a high concentrate of calcium.Water softeners remove the calcium from the water, which prolongs the life of dishwashers and other kitchen equipment. CHAPTER 5: MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIES AND GROUNDS 81Schools are subject to federal regulations, state law, local law, district policy and, hopefully, good, old-fashioned common sense. While these guidelines cite relevant federal regulations they cannot fully describe the wide range ofindividual state, local, and district-level regulations, many of which vary considerably between jurisdictions. For moreinformation about federal and state regulations, visit the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Links to EPA RegionalOffice and State Environmental Departments web page at http://www.epa.gov/epapages/statelocal/envrolst.htm. CUSTODIAL ACTIVITIES The first step toward establishing an effective custodial program is to deter- mine the district's expectations of its custodial services. This requires inputfrom both the school board (who ultimately will fund the program) and thebuilding administration (who will live with the results of the program).Facilities managers must then determine how to staff and support custodial efforts to meet these expectations. Managers must also determine the chain of command for custodial staff. In smaller districts, the head custodian oftenreports to the school principal. In larger districts, the custodial staff generallywork directly for a central administrator who is trained in custodial operationsand has ultimate responsibility for the cleanliness of the district's buildings. Another management decision concerns the type of custodial cleaning to be used: area cleaning or team cleaning. Area cleaning is a traditionalapproach to custodial work, still commonly used in small districts, in which a custodian is responsible for all aspects of cleaning (e.g., vacuuming, dusting,trash removal) in a specific area. By contrast, team cleaning relies on specialists,with one person handling all the vacuuming, one person washing all thechalkb oards, one person cleaning all the bathrooms, etc. In theory, team cleaning is more efficient than area cleaning: thus, a four-person team can be expected to clean more than four times the squarefootage of a \"generalist\" custodian in the same time period. This approach isalso equipment-efficient\u2014each team of four needs only one vacuum cleaner; 82 PLANNING GUIDE FOR MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIESESTABLISHING EXPECTATIONS FOR CUSTODIAL EFFORTS Planners, administrators, and community members must agree on what constitutes \"cleanliness.\" While there is not a nationwide standard for describing standards of cleanliness, a five-tiered system of expectations is emerging to helpguide decision-making: Level 1 cleaning results in a \"spotless\" building, as might normally be found in a hospital environment or cor- porate suite. At this level, a custodian with proper supplies and tools can clean approximately 10,000 to 11,000square feet in an 8-hour period. Level 2 cleaning is the uppermost standard for most school cleaning, and is generally reserved for restrooms, special education areas, kindergarten areas, or food service areas. A custodian can clean approximately 18,000to 20,000 square feet in an 8-hour shift. Level 3 cleaning is the norm for most school facilities. It is acceptable to most stakeholders and does not pose any health issues. A custodian can clean approximately 28,000 to 31,000 square feet in 8 hours. Level 4 cleaning is not normally acceptable in a school environment. Classrooms would be cleaned every other day, carpets would be vacuumed every third day, and dusting would occur once a month. At this level, a custo-dian can clean 45,000 to 50,000 square feet in 8 hours. Level 5 cleaning can very rapidly lead to an unhealthy situation. Trash cans might be emptied and carpets vacu- umed on a weekly basis. One custodian can clean 85,000 to 90,000 square feet in an 8-hour period. The figures above are estimates. The actual number of square feet per shift a custodian can clean will depend on additional variables, including the type of flooring, wall covers, and number of windows, all of which must be taken into account when determining workload expectations. Area cleaning is the traditional approach in which a single custodian is responsible for allaspects of cleaning (vacuuming,dusting, trash removal, etc.) ina specific area. T eam cleaningis performed by a team of specialists where one uses thevacuum, another a dust mop, and yet another empties wastebaskets or cleans thechalkboards.whereas each \"generalist\" custodian needs his or her own vacuum, mop, broom, and floor waxer. On the down side, a specialist who vacuums foreight hours at a time may burn out more quickly than a custodian who hasmore varied duties (although this can be minimized by \"rotating\" team members'cleaning duties). Team cleaning also tends to inhibit the personal inter action between custodians and faculty that is characteristic of area cleaning. Many districts have used both approaches to cleaning successfully. The key variable is the degree of cleanliness the district desires relative to its willingnessto incur increased personnel and equipment costs. In general, area cleaningresults in cleaner facilities because a single custodian is responsible for an entirearea, allowing him or her to become intimately familiar with the specific needsof the area. Team cleaning, however, tends to be somewhat less expensive. For more information about custodial activities, visit the National Clearinghouse for Educational Facilities' Cleaning Page at http://www.edfacilities.org/rl/cleaning.cfm, which provides list of links, books, and journal articles on custodial standards and procedures,equipment, safety, and product directories for the cleaning and maintenance of schoolsand colleges. GROUNDS MANAGEMENT The entire school grounds must be properly maintained on a routine and preventive basis. School grounds can be defined as the full extent (i.e., cornerpin to corner pin) of all school property, including school sites, the central office,and other administrative or support facilities. This includes, but is not limited, to: courtyards exterior lighting and signage outdoor learning equipment pools museums bike trails modular facilities paved surfaces (e.g., sidewalks, parking lots, and roads) athletic fields (including synthetic surfaces such as Astroturf) vacant property owned by the district CHAPTER 5: MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIES AND GROUNDS 83Properly maintained athletic turf, physical education fields,and playgrounds can help toimprove student health andsafety. Specifically, well-rooted,flat, and divot-free surfacesreduce the occurrence of leg and foot injuries.SHOULD CUSTODIANS PERFORM LIGHT MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES? In many large school districts, job overlap is frowned upon\u2014both from the perspective of \"time off-task\" and union agreements. In smaller districts, it wouldn't be realistic to expect a maintenance person to drive out from central officejust to change a light bulb or replace a fuse, especially when there is an on-site custodian who is perfectly capable ofdoing the job. Small organizations will argue that this is plain common sense. Big districts may claim that it upsets theorganizational chart. There's no right answer: local decision-making depends on local circumstances.Some school districts have responsibility for managing areas of special concern, including (believe it or not): wetlands caves mine shafts sinkholes sewage treatment plants historically significant sites other environmentally sensitive areas Other grounds-related factors that demand consideration include: use of fertilizers/herbicides watering and sprinkler systems use of recycled water (gray water) for plumbing, watering fields, etc. drainage scheduling \"rest\" time (e.g., time for new grass to grow after the football season) weighing the aesthetic benefits of flower beds versus the health costs of increased allergy events and bee stings use of the grounds as a classroom (e.g., \"science\" courtyards and field labs) Planners must determine the frequency and level of maintenance service desired for grounds and outdoor equipment. For example, should the grass be cut once or twice a week? Is this schedule modified during peak and low growing seasons? Is a grassy area's use taken into consideration when deter-mining its maintenance needs? Clearly, fields used for gym classes require less attention than the varsity baseball infield. For more information about managing grounds, visit the National Clearinghouse for Educational Facilities' Grounds Maintenance Page athttp://www.edfacilities.org/rl/grounds_maintenance.cfm, which provides list of links, books, and journal articles on managing and maintaining K-12 schooland college campus grounds and athletic fields. 84 PLANNING GUIDE FOR MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIESLarger education organizations may want to have someone on the grounds crew who is certified in the application ofpesticides and herbicides. Formore information about thisissue, see the discussion aboutIntegrated Pest Management (IPM) in Chapter 4.KEEPING A SCHOOL CLEAN ISN'T ONLY THE CUSTODIAN'S RESPONSIBILITY Some schools have adopted the \"30-second rule\" in which everyone in the building stops what they are doing and cleans the room they are in during the last 30 seconds of the day. (Most parents seem to approve of their kids gettingused to cleaning up their space at the end of each day!) In other schools, the student council is hired (via a donation from the maintenance department) to make sure that trash stays off of the floor. Another approach is to give a \"Golden Trash-Can Award\" to the homeroom that is kept the cleanest during the week\u2014with the winners earning a pizza party from the maintenance department at the end of the month.DEPARTMENTAL ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT The ideal organization of the maintenance and operations department depends on the size of the school district\u2014in square miles and the numberand distribution of campuses. Large districts often use the \"area support management concept,\" in which the district is divided into two or moreareas, each with its own direct-support team that provides comprehensivemaintenance. Each team would include skilled craftsmen such as painters,plumbers, electricians, HVAC repairmen, general maintenance personnel, and grounds personnel. Other tasks for which there is less demand - such askitchen equipment specialists, small-engine specialists, cabinetmakers, roofers,and locksmiths - are supported from a central location. An alternativeapproach is to group staff according to their skill or craft - for example, all electricians work for the lead electrician, all plumbers work for the leadplumber, and so on. Both approaches to maintenance and operations organization are valid provided the chosen system supports current districtneeds and can adapt to future growth. Because local circumstances vary so greatly, there is no national staffing standard for determining the number of plumbers, roofers, or electricians needed by a district. However, severalprofessional organizations offer guidelines based on the amount of buildingsquare footage that needs to be maintained. Other factors that must be considered include the size of the district in miles, the age of the buildings,the maintenance history of the buildings, funds available for maintenanceactivities, and the expectations of the community and school administration. CHAPTER 5: MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIES AND GROUNDS 85RECOMMENDED LEVELS OF SERVICE FOR BASIC GROUNDS CARE: Acceptable = staff 1:20 acres Standard = staff 1:18 acresHigh = staff 1:15 acres RECOMMENDED LEVELS OF SERVICE FOR ATHLETIC FIELD AERATION: Acceptable = once (1)/year High = five (5) times/year These recommendations must be modified to accommodate local circumstances. For example, a school district that is responsible for managing five acres of wetlands would need to adjust staffing levels to ensure the preservation of this property. MARKETING MAINTENANCE Few people notice when facilities are clean and working properly (although the opposite is far from true!). Facilities staff are often uncomfortable calling attention to their own good work, but they shouldn't be. After all, top-leveladministrators should occasionally be reminded of the important role that well-maintained facilities play in the effective operation of an education institution.Maintenance and Operations Manuals Every maintenance and operations department should have a policies and procedures manual that governs its day-to-day operations. The manualshould be readily accessible (perhaps via an Intranet or the Internet), andwritten at a level consistent with the reading ability of department members.At a minimum, the manual should contain: mission statement personnel policies purchasing regulations accountability measures asbestos procedures Managing Facilities \"Partners\" Schools belong to their communities. Individuals and groups in a community often take \"ownership\" in their schools' facilities in the sense that they initiateefforts to improve building condition, technological capabilities, and recre-ational equipment. This is a good thing\u2014certainly parent-teacher associations,booster clubs, and business circles are all friends of our school systems. Having said this, facilities managers must supervise any activities undertakenby these organizations to upgrade or otherwise modify school facilities. Forexample, internet cabling installed by parents and community members mustbe coordinated with the rest of the building's electrical system and recorded on wiring diagrams. Similarly, all upgrades to playground structures, whetherinstalled by maintenance staff or \"amateurs,\" must meet safety requirements.Thus, facilities managers must be proactive in their communications with community groups so that all well-intentioned aid to our schools proves tobe a benefit to student learning, recreation, health, and safety. Work Order Systems Work order systems help school districts register and acknowledge work requests, assign tasks to staff, confirm that work was done, and track the costof parts and labor. At the simple end of the spectrum, a work order systemcan be a manual, paper-based, tracking tool. On the more complex, but perhapsmore efficient (depending on the size of the organization) side, work order systems come in the form of computerized maintenance management systems(CMMS as discussed in Chapter 3). Such systems have become increasingly affordable and easy to use. Their purpose is to manage work requests as efficiently as possible and meet the basic information needs of the district.CMMS software must also be user friendly so that it can be implemented with minimal training (although training needs are inevitable and should notbe overlooked). Many CMMS systems offer \"bells and whistles\" that are not needed for accomplishing primary maintenance management tasks and, infact, often unnecessarily complicate the user interface. 86 PLANNING GUIDE FOR MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIESMaintaining schools also entails maintaining corollaryand special-needs facilities such as trailers and modularbuildings. These facilitiesdemand all the supportrequired by \"regular\" buildings, and usually merit additionalattention because of their construction limitations.Modified management standards may be required(e.g., they may fill up with carbon monoxide or lose heatmore quickly). Even the fieldhouse at the football stadiumwhere the PTA sets up its hotdog stand is a special-needsfacility because it is used forfood preparation and, therefore,must meet high standards of cleanliness. repair standards vehicle use guidelines security standards work order procedures \"Jury-rig\" is not a synonym for \"repair.\" To repair equipment means to return it to its original operating state.The CMMS should be network- or Web-based, be compatible with standard operating systems, have add-on modules (such as incorporating the use ofhand-held computers), and be able to track assets and key systems. Sourcecodes must be accessible so that authorized district staff are able to customizethe system to fit their needs as is necessary. In terms of utility, a good CMMSprogram will: acknowledge the receipt of a work order allow the maintenance department to establish work priorities allow the requesting party to track work order progress through completion allow the requesting party to provide feedback on the quality and timeliness of the work allow preventive maintenance work orders to be included allow labor and parts costs to be captured on a per-building basis (or, even better, on a per-task basis) At a minimum, work order systems should account for: the date the request was received the date the request was approved a job tracking number job status (received, assigned, ongoing, or completed) CHAPTER 5: MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIES AND GROUNDS 87GOOD INTENTIONS AND A PRIME EXAMPLE OF HOW NOT TO SAVE MONEY Each year the parents at Central Elementary School raised funds for much-needed playground equipment, which they installed themselves. Jim was proud of their efforts, but he knew it was his responsibility to supervise their work. So Jimmet with the PTA president and school principal on a Friday afternoon in May to discuss the installation of a new swing set.He had reviewed the city's map of the building site for gas lines, water pipes, and telephone connectors and had carefullyselected the spot for the equipment. \"I am sorry I can't be here with you tomorrow,\" he apologized, \"but if you just set theswing at the bottom of the hill, it will be fine. I'll be by first thing on Monday morning to perform a safety inspection andlay rubber chips around it so the kids can be playing on it by lunch time.\" Everyone smiled and nodded, and Jim left forthe weekend, not imagining that anything could go wrong. The call came from Jim's assistant at 11:00 a.m. on Saturday morning. Jim left his son's soccer game and went straight to Central Elementary. He was shocked by what he saw: fire trucks were everywhere, and an entire city block had been evac-uated. The police chief explained that a natural-gas line had been cut. \"But how?\" Jim thought, \"The swing set wasn't to beanywhere near that line.\" Then Jim saw a hole in the ground more than 20 yards from where he had instructed the par-ents to place the swing. \"Well,\" the PTA president explained sheepishly, \"The early morning sun was right in our eyes whenwe were at the spot you selected, and we didn't want the kids to have to squint when they were swinging, so we thoughtwe'd move to a shadier spot. Bad idea, I guess, huh?\" Jim realized the situation was the result of more than one bad idea. Not only had the parents acted on their bad idea, but trusting the parents to install the swing unsupervised had been an even worse idea on his part. They could have beenkilled if the gas line had exploded. As it was, the city had to spend thousands of dollars on emergency service and repair-ing the break\u2014all for a $900 swing set. Jim frowned. Things would have to be different next time. Work order system documentation should be used to augment andhelp interpret facility audit findings. job priority (emergency, routine, or preventive) job location (where, specifically, is the work to be performed) entry user (the person requesting the work) supervisor and craftsperson assigned to the job supply and labor costs for the job job completion date/time Staff from every building and campus in a district should have the ability to initiate a work request and determine its status. However, it is a good policy to limit \" official\" requesting authority to a single person at each site so that better internal oversight is maintained (e.g., to prevent multiple requests being submitted for the same job). Many organiza-tions provide staff with a one-page work request (in either paper orelectronic form) that is then submitted to the person responsible forevaluating and entering requests into the work order system. Once a work order reaches the maintenance department, a control number is issued and the work is given a priority rating. The task isthen assigned to a craftsman and a supervisor. Upon completion of thework, the craftsman records all labor and parts needed to complete thejob. The work order is then submitted to the maintenance office forclose-out. But first the supervisor must determine that the quality of the work meets or exceeds departmental standards. Because it isunrealistic to check every work order that goes through the maintenanceoffice (even in small districts), good supervisors often take a two-step approach to evaluation: 1) randomly inspecting a small percentage (e.g., 3 percent) of completed work orders; and 2) in every case, providing the requesting party an opportunity to respond to a customer satisfaction survey. Upon closing out a work order, all information about the request should be placed in a data bank for future historical and analytical use (e.g., for determining the yearly cost of building maintenance).Sophisticated CMMS enable the data to be analyzed in detail and at different scales (e.g., weekly, monthly, and annual reporting; as well as by room, building, and campus), depending on user need. 88 PLANNING GUIDE FOR MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIESJOB PR IORITIES Some tasks are urgent (e.g., there is a giant leak in the girls' bathroom). Others are less pressing (e.g., there is a dent in the paper towel dispenser in the boys' bathroom). Thus, assigning \"job priority\" is a necessary step in anygood work order system. Some facility managers use the following system: Emergency overtime is authorized Routine overtime is not authorized; complete in order of receipt Preventive overtime is not authorized; complete according to the maintenance schedule How many people need to \"touch\" a work order before the task gets completed? That depends on the size andorganization of the school district. However, a good ruleof thumb is that work ordersystems should be streamlinedto minimize the number ofpeople involved in delivering,approving, and performinga job.Are You Being Well Served?

Work Order # __________________ Job Description _________________ COMMENTS: ___________________ _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ CHAPTER 5: MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIES AND GROUNDS 89BASIC ELEMENTS OF A WORK ORDER SYSTEM FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS Primary Types of Users Work order initiators: Typically school-based personnel, including school secretaries, teachers, and principals Work order recipients: Typically facilities management staff, including the facilities maintenance manager and secretary Typical Workflow A maintenance need is identified at a school district facility. Information required to request a work order includes: Contact name: A person in the facilities department to contact about the work order Contact phone: The telephone number of the contact person Contact e-mail: The e-mail address of the contact person Room number/location: The building, room, or other site where the work is to be performed Work requested: A short description of the work to be performed Job type: Carpentry, custodial, electrical, environmental, glazing, grounds, maintenance, heating, masonry, new construction, painting, plumbing, roofing, supplies, systems, or vehicles Urgency: Typically a yes/no indicator as to whether the work order is urgent; may also be a \"pick list\"(e.g., urgent, routine, preventive) Requested date of completion: When the school-based personnel initiating the work order would like to have it completed. (Note that the actual date the work is scheduled by maintenance staff may differbecause of work loads or other factors.) A good CMMS will automatically generate the following: Job number: A unique number that identifies the work order (often sequential) Received date: The date the work order was requested Entry user: Verifies the ID name/password of the person authorized to request a work order The maintenance administrator adds the following to the work order: Work person: The person to whom the work order is assigned Scheduled date: When the work is to occur (not necessarily the requested date) Work order priority: Emergency, routine, or preventive Status code: For example - O (Open) - The work order has not yet been assigned A (Assigned) - The work order has been assigned to a worker and is in process C (Completed) - The work order has been completed R (Reopened) - The work order was completed but is now reopenedD (Deferred) - A work order will not be assigned at the current timeComments: Additional instructions or guidance as necessary After the assignment and scheduling information is entered, the work order record is updated in the database so the person who initiated the job can view the status of the request. Time and materials data are optional and may or may not be entered against a work order. These data are tracked in a separate but related database. A record layout that incorporates the basic data elements for an effective computerized work order system is shown as Appendix E.For more information about work order systems, visit the National Clearinghouse for Educational Facilities' Facilities Management Software Page at http://www.edfacilities.org/rl/software.cfm, which describes and evaluates computer-aided facilities maintenance management systems for handling priorities, backlogs, and improvements to school buildings. Building Use Scheduling Systems Another use for computers in facilities maintenance is the employment of an automated building use scheduling system for planning special events(activities such as athletic contests, PTA meetings, and holiday concerts thatoccur during non-instructional hours). The building secretary enters into adatabase all special activities in the facility that will require extended heating,cooling, or lighting. Information captured for each activity includes: the date of the event, expected attendance, beginning and ending time, specific location within the building where the activity will occur (e.g., classroom#201, the gymnasium, or the auditorium), HVAC and lighting needs, personauthorizing the event, and a contact name. The HVAC department can print a list of all special needs on a weekly basis, allowing staff to schedule its systems for appropriate heating, cooling, and lighting in the particularareas where these after-hour events are taking place. The Facilities Manager can also access the building use scheduling the activities. Managing Supplies A large portion of a school district's maintenance budget goes to purchasingsupplies for day-to-day maintenance and custodial work. Managing supplyinventories efficiently may not seem like a difficult task, but a considerableamount of planning is required to ensure that valuable funds are not tied up in excess inventory. 90 PLANNING GUIDE FOR MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIESPublishing an annual calendar of school or district events helpsprevent duplicate scheduling ofresources and facilities. To be most useful, the calendarshould be posted to a networkor web site so that it is easilyaccessible and new events canbe added as they are scheduled. A REASONABLE EXPECTATION Marty Simmons was a reasonable man, everyone at Lincoln High School agreed. As principal, Marty rarely had time to waste, so when the lock on the door to the teacher's lounge broke, he promptly instructed his secretaryto notify Jack, the maintenance supervisor for his building. Twenty-four hours later, when the lock hadn't beenrepaired, Marty called the maintenance department himself. Linda, the maintenance secretary, said the supervi-sor was in a meeting, but she was sure he was handling the job. Two days later, Marty called again. This timeJack caught the brunt of the frustrated administrator's impatience. \"Jack, how tough can it be to fix a lock? I'vegot teachers who need a quiet place to retreat during the day and they deserve their privacy. What's wrong withyou guys?\" He was surprised by Jack's calm reply: \" I know it's not a big job, Marty, but I've finally been author-ized to get that heavy-duty, tamper-resistant lock you've wanted for so long. It will be here tomorrow. I thoughtit would be well worth the wait.\" Marty smiled. He had wanted that type of lock installed for years and it wassurely worth a day or two's delay. \"But why didn't you just tell me so I wouldn't have wasted my time worryingabout the repair job?\" he asked. It was a reasonable question, Jack realized (after all, Marty was a reasonableguy). \"Hmm,\" Jack wondered out loud, \"maybe it's time I got that work order system that I've always wanted. Itwould have allowed you to see the status of the job right from your desk.\" \"Yes,\" Marty replied, \"you shoulddefinitely get that system\u2014so that I don't call and chew you out for no good reason any more.\"Parts purchased for storage should meet one of the following criteria: High-volume purchases generate cost savings that exceed the cost of storage. The parts may be needed at any time for emergency repairs. The parts are difficult to obtain or take a long time to get delivered. Many facility managers take advantage of consignment cabinets that ven- dors supply at their cost. That is, a vendor stocks the district's storage space,but the district does not pay for the material until it is used. What's in it forthe vendor? Well, the consignment cabinet translates into guaranteed busi-ness for the vendor whenever the district needs the stored parts or supplies. Another effective system for managing equipment inventories is the use of open purchase orders or open procurement cards, which can be issued toa local store (e.g., a $1,000 purchase order at the hardware store that is validfor a 30-day period). As parts are needed for a project, craftsmen go to thestore, select the items, and sign the purchase ticket. At the end of the 30-dayperiod, the purchase order is closed out and paid. To verify the legitimacy ofall purchases, receipts must include an itemized list of the items purchased,the name and ID number of the staff person, and the work order number. Centralized Versus Decentralized Parts Storage. Both site-based storage and central storage systems have costs and benefits. Site-based storage keepsparts where they will be needed\u2014i.e., maintenance staff don't have to wait forsupplies to arrive from central office. On the other hand, supplying multiplesites leads to increased costs associated with redundant inventories. Whenvendor-supplied consignment cabinets are used, redundant inventories don'tcost the district any extra money except for the storage space. Another draw-back with site-based storage is that inventory management is difficult, leavingthe district vulnerable to property loss from theft (making effective key con-trol for supply facilities essential). Whether centralized or decentralized, theinventory management system must be integrated with other facilities andfinancial management software in use (e.g., the organization's CMMS). Standardization of Parts and Equipment. It makes sense to standardize equipment and parts whenever possible. After all, if a district has three different brands of chillers (or even three different models of the same brand), then it will need three different kinds of replacement parts - a waste of storage space. Moreover, staff training require-ments increase since maintenance workers will need to know how to service three different pieces of equipment instead of one. Unfortunately, manyschool districts must adhere to low-bid contracting, which can result in a CHAPTER 5: MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIES AND GROUNDS 91Every dollar in parts sitting on a shelf is a dollar that is not available for classroom instruction. Consignment cabinets save money and time\u2014they containsupplies that are provided byvendors, but not paid for by the district until they are used. For routine replenishment of supplies, a \"just in time\" systemmay be used. For example,because HVAC filters are neededon a routine and predictableschedule, they don't need to bestored in-house; instead, theycan be ordered in bulk fordelivery by a vendor the daybefore they will be used. A large portion of the custodial budget goes to the purchase of cleaning chemicals. Thus, chemical dispensers that automatically mix chemical concentrates with waterat the proper ratios can result in significant savings by ensuring proper mixing, as well as reduced waste and theft of cleaning agents. Other custodial supplies can also be purchased in bulk and managed using appropriate inventory control procedures.different vendor getting a given contract in successive years. One way to overcome this problem is to include language in all procurement contractsthat requires vendors to provide services and equipment that is consistent with the existing infrastructure and staff expertise. When selecting parts, keep in mind that you may not always need the best product\u2014for example, if your HVAC system has a 10-year life expectan- cy, there is no need to purchase a top-of-the-line 15-year pump as a corollarycomponent. But neither does it make sense to buy cheap 15-year shingles for a new building that has a life expectancy of 40 years. THE ROLE OF MAINTENANCE DURING RENOVATION AND CONSTRUCTION There are two prevailing approaches to planning a renovation or construction project. The first is an item-by-item (or building block) approach; it is drivenby school need and the final project cost is calculated only after needs havebeen addressed. The risk is that the total cost often comes in far higher than anticipated because actual needs sometimes get confused with perceived need(or even a wish list). The second approach is the \"top-down method,\" inwhich building features are selected based on a preconceived \"acceptable\" totalcost of the project. Often, total project cost gets translated into cost per squarefoot, which then dictates what options and features are available. The risk withthis approach is that the district gets only what it thinks it can afford and notnecessarily what it needs. Most renovation and construction projects blend the two approaches to planning\u2014in other words, some tasks will rely uponitem-by-item planning, whereas other aspects will use the top-down approach. When establishing selection criteria for an architect, consider what experi- ence the firm has with designing environmentally friendly schools, includingcomponents such as active and passive solar heating, ground-water recycling,garden space, and low-VOC (volatile organic compound) building materials. Another key to successful renovation and construction is the assembly of a diverse project team consisting not only of school staff (e.g., business personnel, maintenance and operations staff, principals, and teachers), but also construction professionals, architects, engineers, and general contractors. Other stakeholders such asstudents, parents, and other community representatives should also beincluded in the planning efforts. Each stakeholder should be encouraged toshare his or her opinions about the needs and expectations of the new orrenovated facility. Of course there will be disagreements during this phase,but the net effect of this exchange of ideas should be positive if the interac-tions are managed respectfully. This team of stakeholders should review all plans and construction docu- ments throughout the project (e.g., at 25, 50, 75, and 100 percent complete)to minimize the likelihood of last-minute surprises and objections. Key teammembers, such as the district's business personnel and maintenance staff,must review the construction documents prior to the release of procurementguidelines because any changes thereafter will invariably result in additionalcosts to the school district. Generally, the mechanics of the bid process aremandated by local or state law (e.g., fixed bids or competitive sealed propos als). 92 PLANNING GUIDE FOR MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIESIf constrained by \"low bid\" requirements, district planners might consider switching to performance-based specifications to ensure they get the equipment they want. The facilities manager should be one of the team leaders inany renovation or constructionproject. After all, he or she isthe school district's in-houseexpert on building manage-ment and knows how the district's maintenance andoperations departments can bestsupport a new or renovatedfacility. To best accomplish this task, the facilities managermust keep an open mind to the needs of all stakeholdersthroughout the planningprocess.These types of decisions should be made only after consultation with the district's architects and legal advisors. Although construction staff need to limit access to work sites and ensure site safety, district representatives have every right to expect access to the work site on a regular basis (after all, it is the district's property and the contractor works for the dis- trict). Thus, during construction, members of the maintenance and operationsdepartment (or locally hired and trusted plumbers, electricians, etc.) should visit the construction site regularly to observe the quality of the work, monitor theplacement of valves and switches, and verify overall project progress. Digitalcameras, video recorders, and still photos are valuable tools for documentingconstruction activities. On large projects, the district's chief project officer, the architect, general contractor, and subcontractors should meet on a weekly basis to discuss progress and problems. All such discussionsshould be well documented. As construction begins to wind down, the project may be designated as having reached \"substantial completion\": although work may not be100 percent complete, the building can be used for its intended purpose.Building \"ownership\" is customarily transferred to the district at this point,meaning that the contractor is no longer responsible for utility or insur-ance bills. Upon designation of \"substantial completion,\" however, thearchitect must prepare a \"punch list\" to identify those components that are not yet complete (or which do not meet the district's quality standards). CHAPTER 5: MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIES AND GROUNDS 93The topic of building renovation and construction is, quite literally, a separate book. There are many excellent resources available to the educationcommunity, including those available from: American Institute of Architects http://www.aia.org American School and University Magazine http://www.asumag.com Council of Educational Facility Planners International http://www.cefpi.org National Clearinghouse for Educational Facilities http://www.edfacilities.org SchoolDesigns.com http://www.schooldesigns.com/ School Planning and Management Magazine http://www.spmmag.com U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Smart Schools http://www.eren.doe.gov/energysmartschools/ In this Planning Guide , we address only those renovation and construction issues that directly relate to facility maintenance planning. Digital cameras, video recorders, and still photos are valuable tools for documenting construction activity.The school district should retain the last payment to the contractor to ensure that the balance of the work is completed in a timely manner. Finally, it has been estimated that 15 percent of all new build- ings have missing system components for which the owner has paid. Thus, construction contracts should require that a third party commission the facility before contractors are relieved of their contractual obligations. Commissioning is discussed in greater d etail in Chapter 3 of this document and in the PECI document Model Commissioning Plan and Guide Specifications (http://www.peci.org/cx/mcpgs.html). COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS How does preventive maintenance save on costs? Equipment failure is often a direct result of wear and tear on parts thatshould be replaced on a periodic basis (such as filters, belts, gaskets, andvalves). Preventive maintenance is designed to minimize these breakdownevents by attending to these deteriorating components in a timely fashion.This means replacing filters and belts, changing oil, and cleaning coils according to schedule. The costs associated with routine servicing of equipment (in terms of both parts and labor) is small compared to the cost of coping with unexpected and catastrophic breakdown events that willinevitably occur if equipment is not properly maintained - particularly sincebreakdowns often require not only major repairs but even the replacement of affected components and systems. Another argument is that failure to perform preventive maintenance may invalidate the warranties on majorequipment and systems. What is the difference between preventive maintenance and predictive maintenance? Preventive maintenance is the routine, regularly scheduled maintenance of a piece of equipment to ensure its continued use and maximize its lifeexpectancy (e.g., by replacing filters, changing oil, and cleaning coils).Predictive maintenance uses advanced computer software to monitor equipment operation and forecast future failures based on performance measures and statistical analysis. 94 PLANNING GUIDE FOR MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIESMaintenance should be a consideration even during the building design phase. For example, designing a building without carpeting may make sense because wall-to-wall carpeting is so hard to keep clean over time. Situating vents andcleaning wells in areas that can be easily reached is another area where maintenance needs can influence building design. Seasoned maintenance staff can also inform construction and renovation planners about where the maintenance equipment should be housed. Be wary of \"casual renovation.\" Construction that takes placein occupied buildings can have an adverse impact onoccupants' health (e.g., airquality problems may ariseduring construction). Facilities planners generally schedule renovations during breaks in the academic year so as to minimize disruptions. But in some cases this may not be possible(e.g., in year-round schools, schools with summer programs, and after-schoolenrichment programs). Q &AWhat role does computing technology play in facility maintenance management?When dealing with facilities management, technology use must be consideredfrom two perspectives: 1) operations technology and 2) administrative technol- ogy. Increasingly, maintenance personnel are required to master the use ofcomputerized diagnostic and programming tools for many types of buildingcomponents. HVAC systems, for example, are now operated almost exclusivelythrough computerized interfaces. From the perspective of facilities managerstoo, technology has become an essential tool in all but the smallest of organi-zations. By automating maintenance records in even simple ways (e.g., use ofspreadsheets), facilities managers can more effectively evaluate and analyzefacility use, maintenance demands and history, and funding trends. Why is a work order system necessary? Work order systems have always been necessary in the school business\u2014it's just that 50 years ago the \"work order system\" was probably a note from theprincipal to the building custodian to repair a broken fan before completingthe day's cleaning. But times have changed and school operations havebecome substantially more complicated. Buildings are larger, and contain complex electrical, HVAC, and technology systems. If these components andsystems are to be properly maintained, communications between administra-tive staff, instructional staff, maintenance staff, and the central office (e.g., busi-ness personnel) must be seamless and well documented. Modern work ordersystems have evolved into computerized maintenance management systems(CMMS), which allow staff to submit work requests, assign tasks to craftspeo-ple, track project status, record parts and labor costs, verify completion, andevaluate performance\u2014all automatically. Thus, automated work order systemshave become an indispensable part of effective school facilities management. CHAPTER 5: MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIES AND GROUNDS 95WHEN YOU CAN'T AFFORD NOT TO MAKE THE INVESTMENT Harry had worked hard to mine his database for all the relevant information. He didn't want the district to waste money on unnecessarily high utility bills at yet another school. He arrived at the construction planning meeting. \"Now listen,\" he said after several speakers advocated cutting corners on the quality of construction materials, \"You may save $30,000 or $40,000 now,but that is just peanuts compared to what we'll pay for that mistake over the life of the building.\" He saw an assistant superi n- tendent roll his eyes, but he continued: \"In 1978, we built Spinner Middle School correctly because of the high utility bills w e saw during the winter of '77 . And now we pay 88 cents a square foot to heat and cool that building, even after 25 years, com-pared to $1.72 per square foot for the elementary buildings you skimped on in 1995. I've done the math; at those rates yourecoup the additional upfront costs in less than three years. After that, we'll save $15,000 a year on the building's utility b ills. You can't tell me this doesn't make sense.\" No one said a word. Harry was right. They couldn't tell him it didn't make sense.ADDITIONAL RESOURCES Every effort has been made to verify the accuracy of all URLs listed in this Guide at the time of publication.

Does the organization have a plan for responsibly managing drainage systems? Does the organization have a plan for responsibly managing \"rest time\" for fields/outdoor areas? Does the organization have a plan for responsibly managing the costs and benefits of flowerbeds? Does the organization have a plan for responsibly managing the use of the grounds as a classroom (e.g., \"science courtyards\" and field laboratories)?

Are facilities managers proactive with their communications to and management of community groups (e.g., PTAs, booster clubs)? Has an automated work order system (e.g., a Computerized Maintenance Management System or CMMS as discussed in Chapter 3) been instituted within the organization? Does the CMMS incorporate the basic features of a \"best practice\" system? Do staff in every building and campus in a district know the procedures for initiating a work order request? Is the ability to officially submit a work order limited to a single person at each site (who can evaluate the need for work prior to sending it)? Does a supervisor evaluate (either by random personal assessment or customer feedback) whether the quality of work meets or exceedsdepartmental standards before \"closing out\" a work order? Is all information about a completed work order maintained in a data- base for future historical and analytical use upon its completion? Is the work order system streamlined so as to minimize the number of people involved in work order delivery, approval, and completion as isreasonable for managing the process? Has an automated building use scheduling system been instituted within the organization? Has the organization investigated the use of a \"consignment cabinet\" as a tool for storing supplies and parts in a cost-effective manner? Has the organization investigated the use of \"open purchase orders\" as a tool for purchasing supplies and parts in a cost-effective manner? Have appropriate control checks been placed on supply storage and purchasing systems? Have planners considered the costs and benefits of both local and central site storage for supplies and parts? Has equipment selection been standardized throughout the district (as possible and necessary) in order to save on storage space and costsassociated with increased staff training for servicing multiple brands? Are chemical dispensers used to automatically mix and conserve cleaning agents? Have performance-based specifications been introduced to procurement contracts for the purpose of standardizing equipment purchasing? Have planners considered the costs and benefits of both the item-by- item (building block) and top-down approaches to renovation and construction planning? 85 86 8687 88 88 88 88 88 90 91 91 91 91 91 91 92 92CHAPTER 5: MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIES AND GROUNDS 103When selecting an architect to help plan a renovation or construction project, have planners considered the firm's experience designing environmentally-friendly schools? Has a qualified, yet experientially diverse, project team be identified, including business personnel, maintenance staff, principals, teachers, construction professionals, architects, engineers, and general contractors? Does the project team meet to review all plans, construction documents, and decisions throughout development (e.g., at 25, 50, 75and 100 percent complete)? Do members of the maintenance and operations department (or locally hired and trusted plumbers, electricians, etc.) visit the construction site ona routine basis to observe the quality of the work, monitor the placementof valves and switches, and verify the overall progress of the project? Do the chief project officer and the project architect, general contractor, and subcontractors meet on a weekly basis to discuss project progressand obstacles? Are the results of all renovation/construction meetings well documented and archived? Upon the renovation or construction project being designated \"substantially complete,\" did the architect prepare a \"punch list\" toidentify components that are not yet complete (or which do not meet the quality standards)? Has the organization retained the last of its payments to the contractor in order to ensure that the balance of work on the \"punch list\" is completed in a timely manner? Has the renovated or newly constructed facility been commissioned by a third-party specialist?92 92 92 93 93 93 93 94 94CHAPTER 6 EFFECTIVELY MANAGING STAFF AND CONTRACTORS Why bother to put energy into managing your staff? Because they are the people who make the day-to-day decisions that determine how your facilities work. Their preparation and support will determine whether or not facilities are run properly, efficiently, and safely. HIRING STAFF Times are changing. It used to be that maintenance and custodial work was categorized as \"basic labor.\" Today, however, most maintenance jobs demand specialized skills and training. For example, staff working in a modern boiler room need to be trained in computer use to operate the building's heating and cooling systems. This change in the expectations requires a corresponding changein the selection and training of maintenance personnel. Selecting the rightstaff requires that time and energy be put into identifying the needs of theorganization, developing accurate job descriptions, envisioning the charac-teristics of \"ideal\" employees, and verifying each applicant's qualifications. Job Descriptions See Appendix F for a model job description for a custodial worker. A good job description accurately identifies the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed by an individual to meet the expectations of the job. It alsodescribes the type of person the organization wants to hire into its ranks. GOALS: To communicate the necessity of good human resources practices as a pre-condition for effective facilities maintenance management To describe best practice strategies for effectively managing staff CHAPTER 6: EFFECTIVELY MANAGING STAFF AND CONTRACTORS 105Table of Contents: Hiring Staff................................105 Job Descriptions ..................105 Selecting the Right People ..107 Dotting Your I's and Crossing Your T's ..................................108 Training Staff ............................111 Newly Hired Employees ..111 Ongoing Training and Professional Development ..112 The \"Moment of Truth\" Chart........................................113 Evaluating Staff ........................113 Maintaining Staff ....................116Managing Contracted Staff and Privatized Activities ................117 Commonly Asked Questions ..118Additional Resources ............118 Managing Staff and Contractors Checklist ....................................121Someone on the hiring team must have command of the technical aspects of the position. The superintendent can't accurately evaluate whether a candidate knows a great deal about HVAC repair, or just a little more than the hiring committee knows. Unless a committee member can verifyexpertise, the organization won't find out how much (or little) the candidate knows until the person is already on the job! Components of an effective job description include: Duties and responsibilities. If the organization needs someone to run a leaf blower for 40 hours a week, it shouldn't advertise a position that would stir the interest of someone who wants to be a gardener. The aspiring gardener will likely resent the misunderstand- ing every time he or she has to ask the real gardener to step aside in order to clear the grounds of leaves. As this resentment builds and the employee either quits the job or begins to perform in a lacklustermanner, both the employee and employer will likely regret the miscommunication. Working conditions. What are the days and hours of employment? Where, and under what conditions, will the work be accomplished?Are there exceptions to these conditions? For example, will a custodianbe expected to arrive at school early on winter mornings to shovel snow? If so, the job description needs to state clearly that the jobrequires travel in inclement weather. Physical requirements. Many maintenance and custodial tasks require considerable physical strength (e.g., one might reasonably be expectedto lift 50 pounds to waist level in order to dispose of the trash). Therequirements of the job must be documented and included in the jobdescription so as to meet the requirements of federal, state, and locallaws designed to protect the employment opportunities of physicallychallenged applicants. 106 PLANNING GUIDE FOR MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIESTo comply with equal opportunity laws*, the hiring process (including advertising job openings) may neither intentionally nor inadvertently screen out disabled or minority applicants. Thus, employment standards must relate to the actual job assignments,not to beliefs, desires, or prejudices about the job. The following guidelines can help in making employment decisions. All employment requirements must be related to the duties actually required of a person in the position. Hiring standards should not automatically eliminate applicants whose speech, dress, personal habits, or lifestyle differ from those of the predominant group. Education and other requirements (e.g., licenses or certificates) must be justified by objective assessments of their relatedness to performing the job. *Visit http://www.eeoc.gov for more information about the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and employment laws.THE TALE OF THE UNHAPPY \"GROUNDSKEEPER\" Jack enjoyed being outdoors. He'd always liked picnics and parks, so it didn't surprise him when he real- ized that an office job just wasn't his cup of tea. He was surprised, however, when he didn't even like hisjob as a \"groundskeeper\" at the local high school. Jack had thought that he'd love the job\u2014he had visionsof working in the sun, cutting grass, maintaining gardens, trimming trees. Instead he found he had tospend most of his time in the shop tinkering with mowers, leaf blowers, and power saws\u2014while his \"fieldpersonnel\" got to use (and break) the equipment out under the sun. Shouldn't someone have told him inadvance what a groundskeeper's job was in the school district? He probably wouldn't have accepted theposition but, at least then, he wouldn't hate his job.Educational requirements. Some positions demand knowledge and skills that are best verified by the completion of certain academic work (e.g., a degree in accounting might be a job requirement for the manager ofthe maintenance department's budgeting and accounting). Credentials and licensure. Licenses are required to operate certain pieces of equipment (e.g., a bus driver needs a commercial drivers license),while other tasks and duties might require licensure or credentialing that is independent of equipment used (e.g., electricians). Equipment used. Some equipment works better when it is handled skill- fully (e.g., a floor sweeper), whereas other equipment is dangerous tothe user and others when it is not handled properly (e.g., power saws,forklifts, and chemical dispensers). Employees should be made awareof these risks and be required to demonstrate expertise before beingpermitted to use potentially dangerous pieces of equipment.\"Demonstrating expertise\" may require a license or other credential, orthe employing organization may provide the required training. Even ifa tool isn't particularly dangerous, the organization benefits if it is usedproperly so that the task gets accomplished effectively. At-will versus unionized position. Depending upon local conditions (e.g., state laws, labor agreements, and the size of the organization), somepositions may be limited to personnel who either belong or do notbelong to a union. If an employee does not belong to a union, he or she may be designated as an \"at-will\" staff member\u2014a person who hasno expectation of continued employment and may be dismissed at anytime without cause or reason. The terms of employment must bespelled out clearly at the onset of the hiring process. Channels of authority. You want to know who your boss is, right? Well so does your staff. Employees should always know whom they reportto and who has the authority to direct their efforts. A clear channel ofauthority starts with an accurate job description and an unambiguousorganizational chart. Evaluation mechanisms. Just as everyone wants to know who the boss is, most people want to know how their performance will be measured. For example, will custodial staff performance be measuredby spot checks of their work, by school staff customer service surveys,or some other process? The organization should clearly communicateto employees what evaluation mechanism will be used. Selecting the Right People The qualities of an \"ideal\" staff member should be identified before the interview process begins. Doing so requires an accurate assessment of theculture of the organization and the personalities of the people with whom CHAPTER 6: EFFECTIVELY MANAGING STAFF AND CONTRACTORS 107No matter how much forethought goes into the preparation of a job description, the text must allow some flexibility for the organization to adapt to changing circumstance. One way of accomplishing this is by including standard language in alljob descriptions that reads, for example, \"and other duties as may be assigned.\" This leaves the organization much neededflexibility in adapting staff responsibilities to meet the ongoing (and potentially changing) needs of the organization.108 PLANNING GUIDE FOR MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIESMAPPING: THE ART OF USING YOUR ENTIRE BRAIN IN THE STAFF SELECTION PROCESS Mapping is a concept that combines left and right brain perspectives on managing. The goal of mapping is to focus on the desired traits of the new employeethroughout the interview process. Here's how it plays out. Say your district is interviewing for a supervisor of maintenance. Before candidates are interviewed,write down the specific characteristics that the new supervisor of maintenanceshould demonstrate. Share this with the selection committee and see if they havetraits or characteristics to add or delete. This process will help each member of the selection committee to develop a clearer idea of the profile that best matches the \"ideal\" candidate. Next, prepare an interview worksheet that lists the idealcharacteristics. During the interviews for the position, each committee membercan take notes about whether (or to what degree) the applicant exhibits the ideal characteristics. The results might very well help to inform your decision-makingregarding the selection process. See Appendix H for an example of how mapping can be used to identify knowledge, skills, and abilities that a supervisor of maintenance should possess. the newly hired person must interact. Some general qualities of effective employees are described below, but many more can be developed. From a practical perspective, it may be helpful to take notes during the interviewabout how well the applicant matches the various qualities that have beenidentified as desirable in the position. Dotting Your I's and Crossing Your T's Once a person has been identified during the interview process as the preferred candidate for a position, additional screening is required before an offer of employment can be extended. These essential tasks include: Reviewing references. While there is no need to talk to all former employ- ers (for most positions), an applicant's most recent employment shouldbe verified. In addition to providing information about a person's job performance, references can verify information provided by the applicanton resumes, employment applications, and during interviews. Someapplicants may choose to supply character reference; these can be valu-able, but should be accepted in lieu of a reference from past employersonly if the person does not have prior (or recent) work experience. Performing a background check. While contacting an applicant's references is one form of checking a person's background, performing a \"back-ground check\" has a very specific meaning for people who will work with or in the vicinity of children. Background checks are conductedby local, state, and national authorities to determine whether an indi-vidual has been convicted of a criminal offense. Several states require thatall prospective employees in schools and school districts undergo a fin- gerprint-driven criminal history check. Thus, hiring committees shouldwork with the district's Human R esources Department to ensure that all required procedures are followed in accordance with best practicesand/or state and local laws as applicable.CONSIDERATIONS WHEN INTERVIEWING AN APPLICANT Personal Characteristics eye contact demeanor interpersonal skills appropriateness of dress work ethic Special Qualifications work history educational background certifications and licenses professional affiliations professional interests Technology Use energy management electronic work order system inventorying (portable devices) use of e-mail other computer skills Leadership Potential articulated vision goal orientation consensus building communication skills personnel management Job Growth Possibilities supervisory experience budgeting experience organized work schedules resource management staff selection Appendix G includes a list of specific interviewquestions that have provenuseful to school districtpersonnel as they inter-view potential employees.CHAPTER 6: EFFECTIVELY MANAGING STAFF AND CONTRACTORS 109VERIFYING AN APPLIC ANT'S RIGHT TO WORK IN THE UNITED STATES Employers may not specify which documents they will accept from a job applicant. However, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) requires that documents establish both the applicant's identity and employment eligibility. TheINS recommends either ONE document that establishes both identity and employment eligibility from List A below OR ONE of the documents that establishes identity in List B AND ONE of the documents that establishes employment eligibility in List C. List A (documents that establish both identity and employment eligibility) 1.U.S. Passport (unexpired or expired) 2. Certificate of U.S. Citizenship (INS Form N-560 or N-561) 3. Certificate of Naturalization (INS Form N-550 or N-570) 4. Unexpired foreign passport (with I-551 stamp or attached INS Form I-94 indicating unexpired employment authorization) 5. Alien Registration Receipt Card with photograph (INS Form I-151 or I-551) 6. Unexpired Temporary Resident Card (INS Form I-688) 7.Unexpired Employment Authorization Card (INS Form I-688A) 8. Unexpired Re-entry Permit (INS Form I-327) 9.

ID Card for Use of Resident Citizen in the U.S. (INS Form I-179) 7.Unexpired employment authorization document issued by the INS (other than those listed in List A) Visit http://www.ins.gov/ for more information about the Immigration and Naturalization Service.Verifying Employment Status. Under the Federal Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, it is unlawful for employers to recruit, hire, or continue to employ illegal immigrants to the United States. At thesame time, it is illegal to discriminate against work-eligible individuals solely because of their country of origin. The employer must take threesteps when a job applicant is hired: 1) verify the applicant's right towork in this country (within three business days of the initial date ofemploy ment); 2) attest that written proof of the right to work has been presented (by completing INS Form I-9); and 3) maintain records ofsteps 1 and 2. Only after the selected candidate has satisfied all pre-hiring requirements should an offer of employment be made. However, the new employee still mustprovide certain additional information to the employer, including the following: Personnel records. The employee must provide emergency medical information, emergency contact information, home contact information, and other personal information. Payroll records. The employee must provide a permanent mailing address, bank account routing numbers (for automatic deposit of paychecks), tax instructions (e.g., number of deductions, applicable taxing authority, etc.), beneficiary information for insurance policies,and participant information for joining medical, dental, and otherinsurance plans as applicable. Immunization Records. Newly hired employees may also be required to provide an immunization record and medical history to verify that they are free from certain communicable diseases. Since details of these require-ments vary from state to state (and even school district to school district),be sure to consult your Human Resources staff about this topic prior to initiating the hiring process. 110 PLANNING GUIDE FOR MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIESWHEN CHECKING REFERENCES Recommended actions: Verify position title and dates of employment. Verify candidate's reasons for leaving. Ask whether candidate is eligible for rehiring. Optional actions: Ask about candidate's attendance record. Ask about job performance specific to the position for which candidate is applying. Prohibited actions: Do not ask questions requiring value judgments (e.g., did she have a good attitude?). Do not ask questions about an applicant's personal life (e.g., what about his family commitments?). Due diligence must be demanded by board policies and met during the day-to-day hiring process. POLICIES MUST SUPPORT STAFF DEVELOPMENT New employees must be trained when they join the organization. Current employees must be trained on an ongoing basis as a means of improving their job satisfaction and performance.TRAINING STAFF Newly Hired Employees People who are new to an organization have special training needs. They need to know how to completea time sheet, the procedure for lodging a complaintand, for that matter, where to find the bathroom\u2014and that doesn't even take into consideration whatthey need to know to accomplish the task they have been hired to perform. Consequently, newlyhired personnel should receive the following types of training as soon as possible after joining the organization: Orientation (or tour) of the organization's facilities - including the payroll division (where timecards are punched and submit-ted), emergency locations (such as the nurse's office), the cafeteria, andthe supervisor's office. Orientation (or tour) of the person's work area - including the primary location where he or she reports to work and all areas where he or shemight be expected to perform job-related tasks (e.g., a plumber shouldbe shown the organization's plumbing headquarters and all campuses he or she will be servicing). Equipment instructions - including an introduction to all tools, machinery, and vehicles the individual will be expected to use (e.g., industrial floorsweepers, lawn cutting equipment, power tools, and district trucks). Task-oriented lessons - including instructions on how to best perform the individual's work tasks (e.g., how to clean a carpet, repair a roof, orservice a school bus). Expectations - including a clear description of precisely what the individual must do to meet the requirements of the job (what, where,when, and to what extent). Evaluation information - including an explanation of all criteria on which the individual will be evaluated, such as the tasks that will be evaluated, all relevant performance standards and expectations, who will do the evaluating, what mechanisms will be used to perform the evaluations (e.g., random checks or daily assessments), and thepotential ramifications of the evaluations. CHAPTER 6: EFFECTIVELY MANAGING STAFF AND CONTRACTORS 111WHO PROVIDES TRAINING? Other staff who have demonstrated expertise with the equipment or performing the task Managers who will supervise and evaluate the work District trainers (in large organizations) Product vendors and equipment manufacturers Vocational education staff A NOTE ABOUT TRAINING NEW STAFF MEMBERS It might be 10 or 20 years since you've ridden a bike\u2014still, you likely remember how to do so. But do you recall howmany times you fell off of your first bike while trying to master the skill? It is much the same for staff members whohave to learn new skills for their jobs, except that they havethe added burden of knowing that their paycheck dependsupon their performance! So be patient and supportive whentraining new staff. Mastering a new task takes time and practice, especially if you are worried about making a goodimpression on your new boss. THE PU RPOSE OF STAFF TRAINING MAY BE TO: ensure that your staff stay safe (e.g., OSHA training) teach staff how to deal with changing needs (e.g., caringfor newly installed floors) provide a stimulating experience to people whoperform repetitive tasks(thereby improving staffmorale and retention rates) prepare staff for future promotionsOngoing Training and Professional Development Skills tend to get rusty unless they are used on a regular basis (who among us can jump rope like we did when we were kids?). The fact that a person has been taught how to perform a spe- cialized task doesn't mean that he or she will be able to perform the task in the future, especially if the task is not a regular part of his orher routine. Admittedly, there is a trade-off between the benefits of staff training and the costs of lost work time during training. School districts can't simply treat theiremployees like full-time students; nonetheless, preparing staff to get their workdone properly, efficiently, and safely is cost-effective in the long run\u2014and man-agers need to have the wisdom to balance the competing concerns. Plannersshould also be open to considering the benefits of developing \"general\" skills in their staff. For example, should a custodian be able to spend one hour permonth learning about computer use with other staff? This professional develop-ment activity may seem unrelated to a custodian's job, but custodial work maysomeday (soon) require e-mail skills for communicating with centralized supervisors. Moreover, in light of their overall mission, school districts may be uniquely motivated to provide educational opportunities to their personnel. Managers must think creatively about how to provide high-quality training opportunities in the face of time and budget constraints. Provenmethods include: Sharing training costs with other organizations on a collaborative basis (e.g., training may be sponsored by several neighboring school districtsor jointly by the school facilities department and the public worksdepartment in the same community). Hiring expert staff or consultants to provide on-site supervision during which they actively help staff improve their skills while still on-the-job. Developing training facilities, such as a custodial training room in which equipment (e.g., vacuums) and techniques (e.g., mopping) canbe demonstrated and practiced. Providing this type of training will pay for itself in more efficient and better work from the trainee. Largerschool districts, which are more likely to find such specialized facilitiesto be worth the investment, can do a good deed (and generate goodwill) by hosting training events for smaller districts in the area. 112 PLANNING GUIDE FOR MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIESSchool districts can't treat their employees like full-timestudents; nonetheless, preparingstaff to get their work doneproperly, efficiently, and safelyis cost-effective in the longrun\u2014and managers need to have the wisdom to balance the competing concerns. \"Staff training\" refers to learning opportunities designed specifically to help an employee do his or her job better. \"Professional Development\" has a broadermeaning, which includes expanding participants' knowledge and awareness toareas outside their specific job duties, yet still related to the overall well-being of the organization. Such topics might include: asbestos awareness energy systems building knowledge first aid emergency responsebiohazard disposal technology use universal precautions Right-to-KnowAll staff training sessions should be documented. Videotaped sessions can be used in future training activities.Offering tuition reimbursement programs which provide educational opportunities to staff who might not otherwise be motivated toimprove their knowledge and skills. Building training into contracts so that vendors are obligated to provide training at either an on-site or off-site training center as a condition of the purchase of their products. The \"Moment of Truth\" Chart Training staff to not just do their jobs, but to do them well, can be a difficult task. One proven method for accomplishing this challenging task is the\"Moment of Truth\" chart. To begin, a trainer asks the employees to think ofa task that is a routine part of their work. They are then asked to think of theminimum standards that must be met to accomplish this task. Finally, theyare asked to consider what would be required of them to exceed that mini-mally acceptable performance. The results should be recorded in a tabularformat, as shown in the accompanying chart. EVALUATING STAFF Managing a school district effectively requires that two vital tasks be navigatedsuccessfully. First, district leadership must institute policies that direct the organization's efforts toward desired goals and objectives. Second, theorgani zation's employees must act on those policies on a daily basis so as to meet the goals and objectives the organization has set. Thus, if policieslead the organization in the wrong direction, \"good\" workers will only take it there more efficiently. On the other hand, good policies aren't worth thepaper on which they are written if staff aren't getting their jobs done properly.To ensure that staff are doing their part to meet an organization's goals and objectives, employee performance must be evaluated on a regular basis. To assess staff productivity, the organization (through its managers and supervisors) must establish performance standards and evaluation criteria. For example, a custodian's performance might be measured by the amount of floor space or number of rooms serviced, the cleanliness of those facilities, and his or her attendance CHAPTER 6: EFFECTIVELY MANAGING STAFF AND CONTRACTORS 113TRAINING: FOCUSING GOOD INTENTIONS INTO PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITIES Hal couldn't figure out why the school's ventilator fan kept turning off overnight. He'd verified that it was running before he left the office at 6 p.m. the evening before, but it was off again by 8 a.m. the next morning. He spent the daychecking fuses and switches, but everything appeared to be working fine. He was about to go home very perplexedwhen the night shift custodian arrived. \"Linda,\" he asked, \"did you see anyone in the ventilator room last night?\" \"No,\" she answered, \"why?\" \"Well,\" Hal explained, \"the ventilator keeps switching off at night and I can't figure outwhy.\" \"Oh,\" Linda said openly, \"I started turning it off during my rounds.\" Hal looked incredulous. \"Why would you dothat, Linda?\" \"Because you told me to make sure that all lights, fans, and computers get turned off every night so thatwe stop wasting so much energy around here,\" she replied. \"Well, yeah, I did say that, but I didn't mean...\" Lindainterrupted him again. \"My job isn't to guess what you mean, Hal. I get paid to do what you tell me.\" She had a point,and Hal knew it. He had to do a better job of communicating what he wanted Linda to do (and not do).The goal of staff evaluations is the ongoing positive growthof staff members. Althoughshortcomings in performancemust be addressed, evaluationsshould not be viewed as disciplinary events and shouldnever be the venue for unexpected criticism. Employeeswho are under-performingshould be told so as soon as it is recognized (not just duringtheir formal evaluations).114 PLANNING GUIDE FOR MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIES\"MOMENT OF TRUTH\" CHART A Girl Scout troop meets every Thursday night at James Elementary School, where Steve is the custodian. Following is the \"Moment of Truth\" chart Steve created at a staff development meeting: On Thursday nights...BELOW STANDARD STANDARD TO BE MET OPPORTUNITY TO EXCEED Outside doors locked Outside doors unlocked Exterior and lobby lights turned on; Scouts greeted as they arrive Room door locked Room door unlocked Room lights turned on; signs pointing to the meeting room Meeting area unprepared Meeting area prepared Closest bathroom unlocked, lit, (e.g., temperature checked, cleaned, and supplied; introduce room straightened) self to troop leader; tell troop leader to call if they need any other help; reappear at end of meeting to escort the troop out of the buildingand lock the doors behind them How did the \"Moment of Truth\" chart inform Steve's actions? Because Steve knew that the Girl Scouts would be arriving at 7 p.m., he planned his work schedule so that he would be in the lobby area to welcome them. He opened the door and greeted Mrs. Jones, the troop leader, two parents,and the scouts as they entered the building. Steve told them that he had checked their room, and that the lights wereon, the temperature was comfortable, and the bathrooms on that corridor were open and supplied. He also mentionedthat he would be working down the hall in the cafeteria in case they needed him for any thing. When the meeting was over, Steve walked the guests out of the building and locked up behind them. The next day Steve got summoned to the main office where the principal asked him what in the world he had done to Mrs. Jones! The troop leader had called the principal that morning for the sole purpose of recognizing Steve'shospitality and efficiency the previous evening. The principal was pleased to pass along the thanks to Steve, addingthat she was proud of him for leaving such a positive impression on the school's guests. And what were things like before Steve constructed his \"Moment of Truth\" chart?Steve was cleaning the gymnasium floor when he heard pounding on the windows down the corridor. He opened the front doors and found Mrs. Jones and the girls standing in the dark and the cold. Mrs. Jones explained that twoparents had walked around to the back of the building to look for an open door. Steve went to look for them. When he returned, he found Mrs. Jones and the troop waiting outside the locked meeting room. When he opened the doorand turned on the lights, he found the room in a state of disarray. Mrs. Jones grimaced and said that the girls wouldstraighten it if Steve could get some heat into the room. Forty minutes later, he heard someone calling through thedark halls for \"Mr. Janitor.\" He was asked not only to open the bathroom, but also to bring a mop since one of theyoung girls had not been able to wait. The next day Steve got called to the office by the principal, who had justreceived an angr y phone call from the troop leader. ConclusionsWould you rather work in a school district that hears praises or complaints about the custodial staff? Most people would rather be helpful when possible\u2014and one of the keys to good leadership is helping staff to see that doing a good job is not only possible, but preferable. The Moment of Truth Chart is a technique for accomplishing thisobjective. It shows that doing an exceptional job doesn't require that much more work, just that the work be donemore efficiently. In the example above, Steve had to open the doors, turn on the lights, heat the rooms, and supplythe bathrooms anyway. The Moment of Truth Chart just reminded him that he should plan to reorganize his schedule on Thursday nights so that he performed these tasks before the guests arrived!history. The custodian's work likely will be assessed by his or her immediate supervisor and the principal of the school. Self-evaluations can also be usefulpersonnel management tools\u2014i.e., ask the staff member to rate his or herown work and then discuss the outcomes relative to the supervisor's opinion. Determining performance standards may be best accomplished as a joint endeavor between the individual and his or her supervisor. Although somesupervisors may be reluctant to share this authority, joint decision-makingwith the staff member has two very positive features: 1) the staff member cancommunicate atypical features of his or her working conditions that warrantmodification of \"normal\" performance standards (e.g., the vinyl tile floor inthe work area requires additional time to clean properly); and 2) the supervi-sor will know that the staff member is fully aware of the jointly developedexpectations. Assessing how an employee measures up to performance standards is an uncomfortable task for many supervisors. To avoid unpleasantness, thesupervisor must maintain his or her composure, objectivity, and professional-ism\u2014otherwise one risks inciting staff morale issues and, perhaps, personnelcomplaints or even legal issues. To avoid these problems, evaluators must be careful to: Be objective and not allow personalities to influence the assessment Document evidence that supports the assessment Encourage improvement rather than fixate on shortcomings CHAPTER 6: EFFECTIVELY MANAGING STAFF AND CONTRACTORS 115GUIDELINES FOR DEVELOPING PERFORMANCE STANDARDS Management must: Establish goals Create an evaluation instrument (e.g., a checklist) Be as detailed and specific as possible Define the performance scale (e.g., 0 = poor to 5 = excellent) Be flexible (i.e., acknowledge extraordinary circumstances when they arise) Convey expectations to affected staff people Review the performance standards on a regular basis (e.g., annually) A \"desk audit\" is a good place to begin establishing performancestandards: ask employees to writedown how they spend each day(i.e., what are their currentduties and responsibilities?). Does it seem like an employee is consistently absent on Fridaysand Mondays? If so, personnelrecords should verify this before the issue is brought up as a concern during a staff evaluation. An evaluation system that fails to discriminate between performance levels is failing the organization. For example, a system is flawed when every staffmember is rated \"above average\" in every facet of his or her performance. After all, by definition, \"above average\" means better than half of one's peers!MAINTAINING STAFF A great deal of time, energy, and money goes into hiring good employees and providing them with worthwhile staff training opportunities. Thus, it is an expensive proposition to replace good staff who leave prematurely. Moreover, when a position is unfilled, the work either doesn't get accomplished or morale is hurt whenexisting staff are expected to work harder or longer to pick up the slack.Therefore it should not be surprising that retaining good staff is an essential aspect of effective management. The first step to retaining staff is to determine the current staff turnover rate. If it is high, does this reflect how personnel are treated, either becauseof policies (e.g., poor compensation or benefits) or organizational culture(e.g., do staff feel undervalued)? And how might these data inform organiza-tional policies and practices? For starters, staff retention can be affected bychanges in policies. If turnover is costing the organization too much money and affecting the amount of work that is getting done, it may be time tointroduce financial incentives for staff who stay on the job. For example, a one-year anniversary bonus equal to 5 percent of a person's annual salary might be a very effective tool for retaining staff for a full 12 months. Staff retention efforts might also take the form of staff appreciation awards, parties, and gifts. After all, nothing says \"we value your work\" like an end-of-the-year picnic (paid for by the district) where the facilities manager and superintendent pass out performance awards to maintenanceand custodial staff who might otherwise not receive very much recognitionfor their work. 116 PLANNING GUIDE FOR MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIESWHA T KEEPS GOOD PEOPLE ON THE JOB? good pay good benefits a sense that they are respected a feeling that their work is valued opportunity for advancement Consider allowing staff to vote on award recipients\u2014it showsthat their opinions are valuedand may help to eliminate controversial decisions on thepart of management. INCENTIVES IDEAS INCLUDE: on-the-spot awards annual cash bonuses hats or shirts with the department logo plaques gift certificates (to restaurants, movies, etc.) tickets to sporting events or musical concerts employee-of-the-month announcements picnics or banquets tuition reimbursement special privileges (e.g., coffee and doughnut parties)AND THE AWARD FOR \"BEST ATTITUDE\" GOES TO... It was Henry's favorite day of work each year\u2014the facilities department picnic! Every May, he and his family would meet his co-workers (and their families) at the outdoor swimming pool for an afternoon of food and fun. The facili-ties department would roast a pig, fry fish, bake potatoes, boil corn, invite the ice cream vendor, and pick up the tab! This year, when Mr. Davis stood up to recognize his staff, the day got even better for Henry, as he was recognized for having the best attendance rate in the department over the past 12 months. Henry was proud to shake Mr. Davis's hand at the podium, but even happier to receive a $50 gift certificate to a local seafood restaurant. His friend Samantha also received an award\u2014a plaque that read \"Most Conscientious Employee\"\u2014that everyone in the department had voted on. It was a day of family fun and pride. Henry's kids enjoyed the day as much as he did (which was part of why he liked the picnic so much), and Henry knew that his department valued the job he did throughout the school year! MANAGING CONTRACTED STAFF AND PRIVATIZED ACTIVITIES Some school districts hire outside agencies to handle certain maintenance and custodial tasks - that is, they use \"privatized\" or \"contracted\" services.Why would an organization want to pay a third party enough money to perform a service and make a profit? There are many reasons for outsourcingjobs. Perhaps in-house staff are constantly being bombarded with \"special\"projects and emergencies that take priority over their daily duties. Maybe asmall school district may not be able to afford to keep specialized personnelon the staff. Or a large district may need to cut back on the number of permanent staff. Whatever the reason, privatizing is not just a question of the school district writing a check to pay for services. School staff must still put considerable energy into managing privatized endeavors. For example, when contracted staff are hired, precise specifications must be drawn up for the procurement, including an objectivestandard for measuring performance. Moreover, depending on the complexityof the task, a member of the in-house staff may still need to serve as projectmanager. To be effective, the project manager should have expertise inmaintenance and operations, a thorough understanding of the contractor'sscope of work, the skills to evaluate the contractor's performance, and theauthority to assign supplemental support tasks to in-house staff. CHAPTER 6: EFFECTIVELY MANAGING STAFF AND CONTRACTORS 117While there may be financial benefits to privatizing certainactivities in a school system, the effects on an organization'swork culture must also be considered. Where on the organizationalchart does one draw the linewhen privatizing maintenanceresponsibilities? The short answer is that at least the\"manager\" should be a school district employee. Opportunities for in-house staff to work alongside outside contractors should never be ignored if schedules allow for such interaction. This type of cooperationcan provide valuable (albeit informal) training for the district's maintenance and operations staff. At the same time, outside contractors can pick up valuable information about the practical applications of their work. Including in-house staff in all aspects of the maintenance program may have the added bonus of building support for the privatization program from within the organization.COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS How does \"training\" apply to maintenance and custodial staff? Caring for a school facility requires considerable expertise. While the organization may prefer to hire maintenance and custodial staff who possess this expertise, this is not always possible. Sometimes \"hiring\" experts is just too expensive. In other cases, existing staff need training to meet changing facility needs. No matter the circumstances, developing staff expertise is a necessary and cost-effective component of getting the job done\u2014and \"developing\" expertise is simply another way of saying \"training.\" Staff training provides employees with the knowledge, skills, and experience (through practice) to accomplish their jobs effectively. How does one justify professional development versus time-on-task? Staff do not get hired to be students\u2014they are hired to accomplish a job. N onetheless, effective managers understand that helping employees improve their knowledge and skills also helps them to become better employees. Professional development can also be an effective tool for boosting or maintaining staff morale. After all, nothing conveys that an organization values and respects its workers like its willingness to invest in them. What types of reward and incentive programs are effective? Reward and incentive programs should be tailored to the needs and wants of the staff and the best interests of the organization. Staff might appreciate creativity when conceiving incentive programs, but planners should ensurethat the incentives are things that the staff (and not the planners) wouldwant. Examples include: on-the-spot awards, annual cash bonuses, gift certificates (e.g., to restaurants, movies, and stores), tickets to sporting events or musical concerts, hats or shirts with the department logo, plaques,employee-of-the-month announcements in the newspaper, picnics and banquets, tuition reimbursement, and special privileges (e.g., bonus time for coffee breaks or free doughnuts during breaks).

He'd championed the idea, recommending it in no uncertainterms to the superintendent and school board. So when the money was earmarkedfor a preventive maintenance program, everyone congratulated him. But Nick knewthat getting the money and implementing the initiative was only the start of the job.He had to show that the program was working\u2014or at least find out where it wasn'tworking and then reassess his strategy as needed. When the next year's budget cuts came down from the top, the assistant superin- tendent tried to reassure Nick that the maintenance program would survive the cut.\"Look, Nick, you could make up nearly a third of the cut if you just reassign yourprogram evaluation funds back into the maintenance budget.\" Nick looked at hisboss with surprise. \"Ted, in ten years of working together, I've never heard such abad idea come out of your mouth.\" Ted was taken aback by the reply, \"But Nick, I just want to make sure that you're getting the biggest bang for your buck out ofthe budget.\" Nick laughed, \"So do I, and that's why we've got to evaluate our work.Otherwise, we'll have no way of knowing what the 'buck' is really buying us. Wewon't know what we're doing right, or doing wrong, or where we needed toimprove our performance. I'm telling you, Ted, when the budget gets lean\u2014that'swhen we really need to stay serious about evaluating our work so that we candetermine our priorities and allocate those tight dollars.\" Ted scratched his head, \"I hadn't thought of it that way, Nick. I bet the same is true in the rest of the district as well, huh?\" Nick cracked a smile, \"I bet it is.\"GOALS: To communicate the importance of regular facilities maintenance program evaluation To recommend best practice strategies for evaluating facilities maintenance efforts124 PLANNING GUIDE FOR MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIESEVALUATING YOUR MAINTENANCE PROGRAM This Planning Guide provides a framework for proactively developing a comprehensive, district-wide facility maintenance plan. The preceding chaptersaddress the primary elements of maintenance planning, including recognizingthe need for effective maintenance programs, planning maintenance pro-grams, performing facilities audits (i.e., data collections), ensuring environ-mental safety, maintaining grounds and facilities, and managing staff andcontractors. One other vital component of adequate school facilities maintenance is periodic evaluation to assess the success of these efforts at a program level. To realize the full potential of a comprehensive preventive maintenance system, school staff, the school board, and town planners must incorporatemaintenance priorities into all modernization goals, objectives, and budgets.However, it is also fair for stakeholders to expect the maintenance programto yield results\u2014namely: clean, orderly, safe, cost-effective, and instructionallysupportive school facilities that enhance the educational experience of all students. But stakeholders also need to demonstrate patience because theonly thing that takes more time than implementing changes to a mainte-nance program is waiting to see the improvements bear fruit. CONSIDERATIONS WHEN PLANNING PROGRAM EVALUATIONS Evaluation doesn't have to mean more dollars and more surveys. Many of the day-to-day activities or systems used to plan and operate a maintenanceprogram also generate the types of information needed to evaluate the program's effectiveness. These can include: Physical inspections: Records of physical inspections are good evaluative material. To care for buildings and grounds, staff must observe andassess their condition on a regular basis. Inspections should be bothvisual (i.e., how things look) and operational (i.e., how things work),and should result in work orders for items requiring service or repair. Work order systems: An effective work order system, as explained in Chapter 5, is a good tool for identifying, monitoring, and projectingfuture maintenance needs. All maintenance work should be recordedon work orders, which then provide valuable quantitative informationfor evaluations. User feedback/customer satisfaction surveys: There are many ways to gather information from users/customers (i.e., the people who benefitfrom the maintenance activities), including collecting satisfaction surveysand convening advisory committees of stakeholders. The value of user perception should not be overlooked as an evaluation tool.Appendix I provides a sample customer survey form used to requestfeedback relating to custodial and maintenance work.Reasons for evaluating the facilities maintenance program include: internal management control school board requests state reporting mandates regulatory inspections (e.g., EPA) Program success can only be evaluated relative to program objectives. In other words, measuring \"success\" means answering the question: Are we reaching our goals and objectives? Audits: Performance audits, commissioning, retro-commission- ing, comparisons with peer organizations, benchmarking, andannual reviews of accomplishments provide important data forthe facility plan and ensuing evaluation. Alternative resources: Maintenance staff need not reinvent the wheel when it comes to evaluations. Maintenance andoperations manuals, vendor expertise, warranties, and other resources (e.g., Web sites) can be sources of benchmarking data or evaluation standards. Regulatory activities: Appropriately trained staff or contractors must be assigned to determine whether applicable public safetyand environmental regulations are followed. These staff must be responsible for documenting inspection activities and reports, notifying appropriate oversight organizations of deficiencies, developing strategies for remedying deficiencies,and verifying compliance to applicable laws and regulations.Documentation of these activities can be used in programevaluation. CHAPTER 7: EVALUATING FACILITIES MAINTENANCE EFFORTS 125A NOTE ABOUT BUDGETS Even with the best planning, budget cutbacks are sometimesunavoidable. This may force plan-ners to reprioritize their opera tional objectives\u2014which can affect thegoals of an evaluation effort aswell. For example, under shortfallconditions, evaluators might beasked to assess whether budgetcutbacks have prevented thedepartment from reaching one or more of its goals. Or the evaluation effort might be used to identify mission-critical compo-nents of the maintenance plan inthe event of ongoing program cuts. QUESTIONS TO DRIVE EVALUATION EFFORTS A simple evaluation program can be implemented by answering these four questions: Step 1: What is the purpose of the evaluation? That is, what decisions need to be made and by whom? Example: The facilities maintenance director and the school business official want to know whether the new work order system is worth the money that was invested in its purchase, installation, and staff training. Step 2: What questions need to be answered to make an informed decision, as identified in Step 1? Example: Is the new work order system accomplishing all that we had hoped it would? Is the new work order system running more efficiently than the old system? Step 3: What information needs to be available to answer the questions identified in Step 2? Example: What was the total cost for purchasing and installing the work order system? What was the total cost to train staff to use the work order system?Are staff time and materials accounted for in the work order system?Does the system maintain historical data about maintenance at each site?Does the system track all purchases, from ordering through delivery, installation, and storage?Does the system document all preventive maintenance activities?Has the response time for work order requests decreased? If so, by how much?Has the number of work orders accomplished increased? If so, by how much? Step 4: What is the best way to capture the information needs identified in Step 3? Example: Accounting and management audits, work order system user surveys, current work order system reports, and data from previous work order requests.126 PLANNING GUIDE FOR MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIESCOLLECTING DATA TO INFORM A COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION To evaluate a facilities management program, the district must collect and maintain accurate, timely, and comprehensive data about its facilities. After all, responsible decision-making requires good data and documentation. Before assessing maintenance improvements, it is necessary to identify the baseline against which progress will be measured (see Chapter 3). In otherwords, will the organization compare its current status against its previous status, against peer organizations, or relative to commonly accepted norms and best-practice standards? The graph shows the number of days it took for a work order to get completed in a school district before and after the process was streamlined.Although the amount of time it takes for the actual work to be accomplishedhas not changed, two significant time-saving approaches have been adopted: 1) the number of people handling the work order has been cut, and 2) the partsand materials procurement system has been linked to the work order system.This type of streamlining not only increases efficiency with respect to getting work accomplished, but also decreases unnecessary administrative costs. Collecting data may require substantial effort, but it is a necessary task all the same. Proven sources of information about the condition of school facilities and the impact of a facility maintenance program include: number of work orders completed changes in maintenance costs major incident reviews (e.g., number of school shutdowns, safety events, etc.)The only thing worse than no data is misplaced confidencein bad data. Decisions arebound to be bad if the dataused to inform them are ofpoor quality. Document all \"lessons learned\" to keep a record of things thatdidn't work as planned so thatmistakes can be avoided thenext time around. \"customer\" feedback (e.g., the opinions of principals and other occupants) visual inspections by supervisors and managers comprehensive management audits performance audits organizational studies annual snapshots (e.g., maintenance/operations cost per square foot or per student) facility report cards or other summaries comparisons with \"peer\" organizations benchmark performance trend analysis (e.g., progress toward the organization's long-range plans) external audits/peer reviews weekly foreman's meetings staff turnover rates public opinion (e.g., newspaper articles, etc.) EXAMPLES OF GOOD EVALUATION QUESTIONS Over the years, experienced facilities maintenance planners have learned to ask some very good evaluation questions, some of which are listed below.Some questions may not apply to every school district, but the list illustratesthe types of questions that facilities maintenance planners can ask to meetthe information needs of their evaluation efforts. Work Orders Does the work order system account for all maintenance staff time and materials? Does the work order system produce data about the history of allmaintenance activities at each site? Does the work order system track all purchases, from orderingthrough delivery, storage, and installation? CHAPTER 7: EVALUATING FACILITIES MAINTENANCE EFFORTS 127PITFALLS TO AVOID WHEN INT ERPRETING MAINTENANCE EVALUATIONS Stakeholders should not assume that improvements to a maintenance program will always yield cost savings in real dollars. To obtain an accurate assessment of maintenance initiatives, evaluators must also look for: Cost avoidance rather than direct savings (e.g., well-maintained equipment tends not towear out or need to be replaced as quickly as poorly maintained equipment) Fewer service interruptions resulting from better maintained, and better performing, equipment. Moreover, improving facilities maintenance requires patience. A comprehensive, proactive program takes resources, energy, and time to initiate\u2014and even more time before results are realized.128 PLANNING GUIDE FOR MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIES Does the work order system document all preventive maintenance activities? Is priority recognition available to differentiate between emergency,routine, and preventive maintenance? Do preventive maintenance activities outnumber emergency responsesin the work order system logs? Is user feedback documented through work orders, surveys, or minutesof stakeholder meetings? Needs Assessment Does the needs assessment include a mechanism for collecting, analyzing, and prioritizing input from users? Does the needs assessment include data from the work order system? Are stakeholders (e.g., maintenance staff, educators, users) included inneeds assessment and capital planning activities? Does the needs assessment include information from the work ordersystem? Does the needs assessment include information from site and equipment inspections? Does the needs assessment include data from performance and systems audits? Does the needs assessment include commissioning and retro-commis-sioning results? Does the needs assessment include comparisons with peer organizations? Does the needs assessment reflect outstanding regulatory or compliance issues? Are safety checks based on documentation and incident reports? Is an annual facility plan created from the needs assessment? Site Inspections Are inspectors adequately trained for their task? Are there clear standards for inspections? Are inspections conducted with both property needs and maintenancecapacity in mind? Are all inspection results documented? Data Management Systems Does the data management system document the current status of themajor systems and components in every school building? Does the data management system document the capital and maintenance needs of every school building? Does the data management system document the short- and long-term needs of the district? Budgeting Does the budget request accurately reflect the needs of the annualfacility plan? Are there both short- and long-term budget objectives? Are maintenance staff involved in developing the budget? Does the annual budget reflect the inevitability of unplanned emer-gency maintenance issues? Are there contingency plans in the budget? Are industry standards used to estimate costs? Does the budget include funds for new hires, contracting, and equipment and supply purchases? Is the financing plan for long-term capital needs separate from themaintenance budget? Staffing Does the personnel policy include maintenance and contracted staff? Do job descriptions reflect the identified needs of the organization? Do job descriptions outline the necessary qualifications to perform thework? Does the organizational chart accurately delineate reporting responsibilities? Are training opportunities available and relevant to the duties of thestaff? Are all tradespeople fully licensed for their work? Are industry guidelines used to determine custodial staffing needs? Are cost-benefit analyses conducted to determine staff/contractingneeds? Is cost-benefit analysis based on numbers of available staff, skill levelsor training needs of existing staff, and the type of job? Staff Evaluations Are staff performance evaluations performed on a regular schedule? Do data drive staff performance evaluations? Is there follow-up to staff performance evaluations that includesadditional training opportunities, reassignment of staff, changes in job duties, contracting out duties, and hiring of additional staff? Are staff accomplishments reviewed and documented on an annualbasis? CHAPTER 7: EVALUATING FACILITIES MAINTENANCE EFFORTS 129130 PLANNING GUIDE FOR MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIES Q &A Are staff accomplishments measured in part by comparing budget estimates to actual expenditures? Are staff accomplishments measured in part on the basis of workorder system records? Are staff accomplishments measured in part by personnel evaluations? Facility Plan Does the facility plan provide for periodic reports of staff accomplish- ments to stakeholders? Are staff accomplishments related to the objectives stated in the annual facility plan? Were all facility plan objectives met? Was reprioritization of objectives needed to meet goals? When goals and objectives were not met, was the reason for this failure substantiated? Were cost estimates sufficient to meet the objectives? Were other aspects of the budget negatively affected to meet mainte- nance objectives? Were staffing levels sufficient to meet the objectives? Are the goals and objectives of the facility plan reprioritized based on actual budgets received, number of emergencies, school shutdowns,complaints, safety issues, school days lost or sick days increased, nega-tive inspection reports, loss of accreditation, compliance, regulatory orlegal action, impact on capital plan or long-term plan, staff overtime,staff turnover, or the impact on other planned projects? Are unmet goals and objectives documented? Are unmet goals and objectives included in the next planning cycle? COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS Doesn't \"evaluation\" take precious resources from actually maintainingfacilities? Absolutely. However, without earmarking funds for evaluation, there is noway of knowing whether the money, time, and energy going into facilitiesmaintenance efforts are producing worthwhile results. After all, the only thingworse than \"wasting\" part of the maintenance budget on evaluation is wastingthe entire maintenance budget on activities that aren't really working. What tools are available for maintenance program evaluation activities? An \"evaluation tool\" is any means by which an organization can get accurateand timely information about the status of its facilities, and any improve-ments that are a result of the maintenance program. In addition to the services of outside evaluation consultants, potential tools available to aschool district include: work order records, major incident reviews (e.g.,the number of school shutdowns, safety events, etc.), \"customer\" feedbackfrom building principals and other stakeholders, weekly foremen's meetings, visual inspections by supervisors and managers, comprehensive managementaudits, focused operational reviews, performance audits, organizational stud-ies, reengineering projects, annual snapshots (e.g., cost per square foot or per student), facility report cards, comparisons with \"peer\" organizations,benchmarks, measured progress toward the organization's long-range plans, external audits and peer reviews, staff turnover rates, and public opinion(e.g., newspaper articles). Who is in charge of evaluating the facilities maintenance program? Program evaluation is the responsibility of the facilities manager. However,because facilities are such a key aspect of an organization's overall budget and mission, other senior staff should be included in evaluation oversight asappropriate to ensure sound management and planning. Moreover, manyschool districts employ in-house staff with considerable expertise in programevaluation who may also be able to contribute to the process.

Give an example.Are you overqualified for this job? 166 PLANNING GUIDE FOR MAINTAINING SCHOOL FACILITIESAPPENDIX H 167APPENDIX H USING MAPPING DURING THE INTERVIEW PROCESS The use of \"mapping\" during the interview process helps decision-makers focus on the desired traits of a candidate being interviewed for a job. The goal is to determine how well the candidate demonstrates the ideal qualities for the positionsought by the hiring organization. Mapping can be conducted as follows: Say your district is interviewing for a supervisor of maintenance. First identify the general categories of knowledge, skills, and abilities required for the position. Then list specific expertise or experienc e that the ideal candidate will demonstrate as evidence of these characteristics (see Figure 1). Share this with the selectioncommittee to see if they have traits or characteristics to add or delete. As the discussion evolves, each member of the selection committee will develop a better idea of the profile that best matches the \"ideal\" candidate. Next, prepare an interview worksheet that lists only the general categories of the knowledge, skills, and abilities required for the position (i.e., only the headings in the ovals) (see Figure 2). During the interview, each member of theinterview team can then take notes about whether and how the applicant exhibits the related characteristics. The teammembers can later compare their notes to the detailed list of expertise and experience that characterizes the ideal candi-date. The results of this type of exercise might very well help to inform your decision-making during the selection process. Note that mapping is a technique that combines left and right brain perspectives on an issue. In this case, the concept is applied during the process of interviewing candidates for potential employment. However, this management approachcan also be applied for other tasks as well. While it may not appeal to everyone, it is a proven method for integrating information and informing decision-making. Figure 1. An example of the use of mapping while interviewing candidatesfor the position of Supervisor ofMaintenance. The selection committee identified five basic categories of knowl-edge, skills, and abilities (represented bythe ovals) that the ideal candidate wouldpossess. They then listed specific traits or know-how that candidates might beexpected to demonstrate. Figure 2. The \"blank\" mapping form on which interviewers take notes aboutwhether and how an applicant exhibitsthe knowledge, skills, and abilities of the \"ideal\" candidate during the jobinterview. The members of the selectionteam then compare their notes to thedetailed list of expertise and experience,as seen in Figure 1.
