This means that as we navigate this dynamic situation community-by-community and store-by-store, we may adapt the store experience by limiting seating to improve social distancing, enable mobile order-only scenarios for pickup via the [Starbucks App](https://www.starbucks.com/coffeehouse/mobile-apps?_branch_match_id=692023235128839951) or [delivery via Uber Eats](https://delivery.starbucks.com/), or in some cases only the Drive Thru will be open. As a last resort, we will close a store if we feel it is in the best interest of our customers and partners, or if we are directed to do so by government authorities. In any such situation, we expect store disruption to be temporary.\" The company has gleaned insights from its [experience in China](https://stories.starbucks.com/stories/2020/one-global-companys-bold-steps-to-navigate-covid-19-in-china-and-the-lessons-learned/), he said, where there are encouraging signs of recovery and over 90 percent of the stores have reopened. \"It is our intent to remain transparent,\" he wrote. \"Starbucks resilience is owed to our unwavering Mission to inspire and nurture the human spirit - one person, one cup and one neighborhood at a time.\" Updated as of 9:30 a.m. March 11 Starbucks will offer full support to partners, including catastrophe pay and mental health resources Starbucks partners who are sick or need to be quarantined won't have to choose between working or taking care of themselves, wrote Rossann Williams, evp and president, U.S. company-operated business and Canada. It is one of a number of resources being offered to partners during the COVID-19 outbreak, detailed in an open letter published Wednesday. \"You have our full support when it comes to partner care, including access to catastrophe pay, benefits that support your physical and mental health, as well as a network of partners who are all here to help,\" she wrote. In addition to existing benefits such as sick pay and personal time off, the company will offer catastrophe pay to any partner who has been diagnosed with or exposed to COVID-19 or comes in close prolonged contact with someone in their store or household who has. It also will be available to partners experiencing symptoms, even if they haven't been in known contact with someone diagnosed with COVID-19, and to those who may need to take extra precautions, such as those 60 years or older or who have underlying health conditions. The full catastrophe pay benefit is for 14 days, but if partners are still unable to return to work, additional pay replacement may be made up to 26 weeks, she wrote. Partners can also access other resources such as a range of mental health benefits including free counseling through the Employee Assistance Program and Headspace for mindfulness and meditation. Another resource is the company's CUP Fund, which provides grants for partners experiencing financial hardship.
