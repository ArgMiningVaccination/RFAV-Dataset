In nature, a virus is a microscopic infectious agent (too small to be perceived by the human senses) that replicates itself within the cells of a living host. A virus cannot thrive and spread without a host. Varying in shape and complexity, viruses are present in homes, schools, workplaces \u2014 anywhere in our environment \u2014 waiting for a host to come along. They look for a way inside a body (nose, mouth, breaks in the skin). Once inside, the virus uses a type of protein on its outer coat to \"feel\" or \"recognize\" suitable host cells to infect. When a cell is infected, the virus replicates itself within the host cell. It then breaks free from the cell, either by breaking it open (thus destroying it), or by pinching out from the cell membrane, breaking away with a piece of the cell surrounding the virus. (In the latter case, the host cell is not destroyed.) The virus then spreads throughout the body, multiplying itself, and attacking and infecting other cells. The body's immune system responds by producing chemicals that cause the body's temperature to increase (i.e., a fever). The immune system's job is to eliminate the virus from the body. Let's think about this in a spiritual realm. Not one of us has actually seen Satan face-to-face this week or ever. That is because Satan needs a host. These hosts are individuals that do the Devil's bidding for him. Satan desires to infiltrate each one of us, and then we do exactly what he wants. We become the puppet and Satan pulls the strings. Physically we have an immune system that fights off sickness, and thankfully we have the same thing spiritually. Immunity is a state whereby certain things cannot harm you. It is having an internal defense. God has given us the Holy Spirit as an internal defense against Satan and his attacks, but we need a strengthened spiritual immune system. These spiritual attacks are going to get much worse and more frequent as we see the coming of the Lord approaching. We must be prepared! Our spiritual immune system needs to be like a wall surrounding us. If we do have a breech in the wall, and Satan happens to get in, we run a spiritual fever, and our God who is a consuming fire burns the sin out of our lives purging us. You may be wondering how we can boost our spiritual immune system. You may not realize that the flu virus is as prevalent in the summer as in the winter, but during the summer we spend a great amount of time in the sunlight. This exposure to the sunlight actually boosts our immune system with Vitamin D, so our body actually has the stamina to fight off the virus. In the winter months, we have less daylight and due to cold temperatures we stay inside more, so our immune system is compromised and we are more susceptible to the flu. Now the picture should be coming more in to focus. We must have more exposure to the Son of God. The more we are with Jesus, the stronger our spiritual immunity. Dr. David Jeremiah addresses this in a wonderful article on the Turning Point. Here is what he says. \"Immune systems need food. Fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains are the staples of our physical diet, but the Word of God is the spiritual food we rely on. When the words and will of God become sweeter to you than honey, you will know your spiritual immune system is being fed properly (Psalm 119:103).\" Immune systems need water. Ninety-two percent of our blood, and nearly 98 percent of our digestive juices, are comprised of water. We are literally surrounded by water, which is a beautiful picture of the way we ought to live spiritually \u2014 surrounded by the presence of the Holy Spirit; Jesus the living water! Immune systems need exercise. The body's lymphatic system \u2014 filled with disease-fighting white blood cells \u2014 circulates in the body as a result of physical motion; it is not circulated under pressure like blood is. And spiritual ministry provides the interaction you need with others that continually stimulates you to love and do good deeds. Immune systems need rest. \"It is useless...to work so hard from early morning until late at night, anxiously working for food to eat; for God gives rest to his loved ones\" (Psalm 127:2). God can speak to your spirit even as you sleep, healing and refreshing your heart and mind. It is the quietness of the night-time hours which allows the Spirit complete access to your undistracted spirits. (Matthew 11:28-30) Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. 30 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. So let's summarize what we can do to boost our spiritual immunity. Study the Bible daily. Study the word of truth daily to receive God's instructions. Regularly look at yourself in God's spiritual mirror and study to seek His will. Allow His Word to correct (straighten) your path. Know the Bible, which reflects the mind of God, so that no one can deceive you with false doctrine. Pour yourself out in daily fervent prayer. Make it a point to get on your knees and talk to God about your attitudes, your shortcomings. Ask Him for more wisdom, understanding and mercy. Meditate. Take and make the time to think about the BIG PICTURE. Strive to see life from God's perspective. Take every petty thought, feeling and attitude and compare it to the glorious future God has in store for you in His kingdom. Fast. Deny your flesh in order to seek God's will first in your life. Humble yourself through regular fasting. Due to his close walk with Christ, the Apostle Paul had a spiritual immune system like Fort Knox. His spiritual experience was the equivalent of a person walking through a laboratory of deadly pathogens, viruses, and bacteria with no protection \u2014 yet not succumbing to any of them. His spiritual immune system was so strong that, while he experienced the occasional fever, chills, headaches, and sniffles, he was never knocked out of action. His spiritual body was well-fed; his defenses were strong; his resources were well-stocked. We must be determined to be more like Paul to stand against the wiles of the Devil. Let's strengthen our spiritual immune system! (The Solution Column is provided by Brandon Young, Pastor of Harmony Free Will Baptist Church, Hampton, and his associate, Hunter Greene.) "}
