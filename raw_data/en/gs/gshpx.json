Methods : A compartmental model with pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic i nfluenza infections is proposed which incorporates age groups as well as inter vention measures such as age-specific vaccination, in order to study spread of influenza in a communit y. Results : We derive the basic reproduction number and other effective reproduct ion numbers under various intervention measures. For illustration, we make use of the Pneumonia and Influenza (P&I) mortality data and vaccination data of t he very young (age 0-2) and the very old (age >64) during 2004-2005 Taiwan winter infl uenza season to fit our model and to compute the relevant reproduction numbers. The reproduct ion number for this winter flu season is estimated to be slightly above one (~1.0001). Conclusions : Comparatively large errors in fitting the P&I mortality data of the elderly (>64) were observed shortly after winter school closings in Januar y, which may indicate the impact of younger, more active age groups transmitting influ enza to other age groups outside of the school settings; in particular, to the elderly in the households. Pre-symptomatic infections seemed to have little effect on th e model fit, while asymptomatic infection by asymptomatic infectives has a more pronoun ced impact on the model fit for the elderly mortality, perhaps indicating a larger role in disease transmission by asymptomatic infection. Simulations indicate that the impact of vaccination on the disease incidence might not be fully revealed in the change (or t he lack thereof) in the effective reproduction number with interventions, but could still be subst antial. The estimated per contact transmission probability for susceptible eld erly is significantly higher than that of any other age group, perhaps highlighting the vulne rability of the elderly due to close contacts with their caretakers from other age groups. The relative 3impact of targeting the very young and the very old for vaccinati on was weakened by their relative inactivity, thus giving evidence of the lack of impac t of vaccinating these two groups on the overall transmissibility of the disease in the com munity. This further underscores the need for morbidity-based strategy to prevent elderly mortalit y. 4Background In the spring of 2009, the novel H1N1 influenza virus first emerged in Mexico and later spread widely throughout the world within just a few months. The Wor ld Health Organization (WHO) announced on June 11 the start of 2009 influenza pandemi c [1], and further issued an advisory on August 28 for countries in the northe rn hemisphere to prepare for a second wave of pandemic spread in the coming fall/wint er [2]. As of November 8, more than 206 countries and overseas territories or communitie s worldwide have reported laboratory confirmed cases of the pandemic pH1N1 virus, inc luding over 6250 deaths [3]. To lessen the severity of this pandemic, developing an effective fl u vaccine and a global vaccination strategy is considered to be among the most i mportant medical interventions [4]. However, to have the greatest impact, pandemic vac cines need to be available quickly and in large quantities, and to be delivered to the popula tion optimally. Moreover, vaccines against a novel pandemic strain might take up to six months to manufacture and deliver, even in developed countries [5]. Given the potent ial threat of drug-resistance resulting from widespread use of antiviral treatment a gainst pandemic flu, vaccine appears to be our primary weapon to prevent and to mitigate a pandemic. However, in addition to the need to consider the logistics of implement ing large-scale vaccination, distinctly different age-specific mortalities had a lso been observed during some past flu pandemics (e.g., in 1918 [6]), which require different priori ties when large-scale vaccination is to be implemented. Moreover, vaccine for influenza is known to have different efficacy (i.e., reduction in the number of infectives) and effectiveness (i.e., reduction in sympt omatic case number) for different age groups, see e.g., [7-9]. Setting priority f or vaccination by targeting age groups most vulnerable (the elderly, infants, etc. ) to prevent mortalities is commonly employed in most countries. However, when vaccinating those at greatest risk 5of mortality becomes impractical (if, e.g., medical care is relatively inaccessible) or inefficient (if, e.g., immune response is deficient), targeting those most likely to expose them to infection might be more preferable [10]. In this way, the ver y young and the old might be better protected by vaccinating those who are most l ikely to be in contact with them (thereby reducing their risk of exposure), rather than by bei ng vaccinated. Comparison of influenza mortality among elderly Japanese during tim e periods when schoolchildren were and were not vaccinated suggests that the infe cted children pose a risk to others [11], including the elderly. Moreover, several past US experiences (as summarized in [12]) also are consistent with this conclusion. Nonethel ess, influenza policymakers have typically advocated protecting those individuals of ages 6-24 months and >65 years directly. Bansal et al. [13] recently carried out a comparative analysis of two classes of suggested vaccination strategies, namely, the mortality-based strategies that target the high-risk populations and the morbidity-based strategies that targe t the high-prevalence populations, by applying the methods of contact network epidemiology to a mode l of disease transmission in a large urban population. Using a range of mortality rates reported previously for past influenza epidemics and pandemics, they concluded that the optimal strategy depends critically on the viral transmission level (or reproduction number) of the virus. That is, the morbidity-based strategies outperform the mortality-base d strategies for moderately transmissible strains, while the reverse is true f or highly transmissible strains. However, they also cautioned that when information pertaining to viral t ransmission rate of a particular disease and the frequency of new introductions into the community pri or to an outbreak is unreliable or not available, a mortality-based vaccina tion priority is recommended. This further demonstrates the importance of targeting and, moreover, the uncertainty surrounding this issue. To further the uncertainties regarding influenza pandemic preparedne ss planning, it 6is widely believed that asymptomatic cases (i.e., individuals who ha d been infected but showed little or no symptoms) and asymptomatic infection of influenza (i.e., infection caused by an asymptomatic case) do indeed occur regularly (e.g., [14-17]). Model with only asymptomatic infections, by either asymptomatic or subclinical infectives, during their infectivity period had been recently s tudied in [14]. In this current study, we will consider a traditional compartmental model which in corporates both pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic infections, in order to explore the role which they could play in the overall spread of disease, if any. Moreover, the age-g roup structure of the model, by dividing the population into seven groups of the very young, presc hool children, younger and older schoolchildren, young adults, adults, and the elderl y, allows us to study targeted public health policies (e.g., immunization) a imed at different age groups. Our model also allows for inclusion of immunity and other age -dependent intervention measures such as quarantine and voluntary home withdrawal (s ee e.g., [15-16]). A full model will be proposed to take into account of the above-me ntioned factors that may be important in determining the best vaccine strategy. Methods Model Formulation Our model is an age-dependent compartmental model. The model flowchar t is given in Fig. 1, where the subscript i denotes the i th age group. The model variables are described as follows, with the time unit t in days: ()iS t : number of susceptible individuals of the ith age group at time t; ()iV t : number of vaccinated individuals of the ith age group at time t; ()iE t : number of exposed (infected) individuals of the ith age group at time t; ()V iE t : number of exposed (infected) vaccinated individuals of the ith age group at time 7t; ()iQ t : number of quarantined infected individuals of the ith age group at time t; ()iI t : number of infective individuals of the ith age group at time t; ()V iI t : number of vaccinated infective individuals of the ith age group at time t; ()iA t : number of asymptomatic (subclinical) infective individuals of the ith age group at time t; ()iH t : number of hospitalized (treated) individuals of the ith age group at time t; ()iZ t : number of recovered and immune individuals of the ith age group at time t; ()iD t : cumulative number of influenza deaths of the ith age group at time t; cij : contact rate of an individual of ith group with an individual of jth group; ij : per contact transmission probability of a susceptible individual of ith group by an infective of jth group. i : age-specific vaccine efficacy for age group i. ( ) and ( ) V i i t t : disease incidence rates for the susceptible and vaccinated indivi duals of age group i. See [Additional file 1] for detailed formulae. The rest of the model parameters are listed in Tables 1-2, wi th the age-specific parameters given in Table 2. The detailed description of the model i s given in [Additional file 1]. Our main model assumptions are as follows: (1) Exposed individuals are infective during the incubation period. It is commonly known (e.g., [18]) that the pre-symptomatic (exposed) individuals cannot t ransmit the disease in the noninfectious latent period, during which the viral titr es gradually increase to detectable and transmissible levels when they became infecti ve for only a short period (0.25 days in [19]) before the onset of symptoms. To avoid adding an extra c ompartment 8to account for the (short) period of infectivity after the end of t he latent period and before the end of incubation period (see e.g., [20]), we assume that the individual s are infective during the incubation period with the infectivity averaged out over the whol e incubation period. This simplification is reasonable since the incubation period for influenza is typically very short, e.g., 1.48 days in [21]. (2) Influenza vaccine is efficacious in preventing influenza infection and ef fective against influenza-like illness, albeit at different levels of efficac y and effectiveness for different age groups [8-9]. Moreover, the vaccinated individuals are less infectious , once they become infected, when compared to those who had not been vaccinated. (3) The quarantined individuals will be hospitalized directly followin g the onset of symptoms (see [22-23] for modeling of quarantine for 2003 SARS outbreak). (4) A fraction of the infectives has no symptoms or only subclinical symptoms, and is classified as asymptomatic infectives with reduced infectivity [14]. (5) A hospitalized person is removed from isolation either by death or discharged due to recovery from illness. (6) Homogeneous mixing within subpopulations is assumed. (7) Negligible births and deaths (excluding disease deaths) during t he course of the disease outbreak are assumed. Reproduction Numbers The basic reproduction number R0, the average number of infections by an infective in an immunologically naive population (see, e.g., Diekmann et al. [24] or van den Driessche and Watmough [25]), is an important epidemiological quantity which gives indication to the potential severity of an epidemic. More precisely, the epidemi c cannot be eradicated without interventions if R 0 exceeds unity. Denoting 0 (0) i i S S = , we have 9( )11 12 1 1 21 22 2 0 1 2 1 11 det 1, 1n n n n n nn R R R R R R R R R R + = + L L M M O M L (1) where 11 R, the average number of infections in group j caused by an infective from group i in an immunologically naive population, is given by () \u0004()2 2 0 1 * 2 0 11 1 j j j ij ij i j ij n j j j ik k kh c S R c S = = + + + , , 1, 2, , i j n =L .

The term 11 22 R R subtracted in (3) accounts for the redundancy that resulted when adding 11 R and 22 R. Similar results for the basic reproduction number of a multi-group model were also obtained in [26-27]. Moreover, we have the following effective reproduction numbers due to interventions: (i) The effective reproduction number with interventions excluding vaccination RE is ( )11 12 1 1 21 22 2 1 2 1 11 det 1 1E E E n E E E n n E E E E n n nn R R R R R R R R R R + = + L L M M O M L, where () \u0004\u0004()()2 2 2 0 1 1 * * 1 1 1 2 2 0 11 1 1 ( ) j j j j ij ij i j j E ij n j j j j ik k kh q c S q R c S q = = + + + + + +, (4) , 1, 2, , i j n =L . 10 (ii) The effective reproduction number with vaccination only over a time period of immunization [0, T], RV, is: ( )11 12 1 1 21 22 2 1 2 1 11 det 1 1V V V n V V V n n V V V V n n nn R R R R R R R R R R + = + L L M M O M L, (5) where 0[(1 ) ][1 (1 ) ] V V ij i i ij i i ij j j R R R = + (6) and 0 0( ) ( ) ( ) T i i t i T i tv S dt S t dt = == , , 1, 2, , i j n =L , is the average vaccine coverage of age group i over the time period [0, T], and ()()() \u0004()()2 2 1 0 0 * 2 0 11 1 1 1 [ 1 ] j jV V V V j j j j j j j ij ij i V ij n V V j j ik k kh c S R c S = + = + + + (7) (iii) The effective reproduction number with interventions including va ccination RVE over the time period [0, T], is ( )11 12 1 1 21 22 2 1 2 1 11 det 1 1EV n n nn R R R R R R R R R R + = + L L M M O M L, where [(1 ) ][1 (1 ) ] VEV E ij ij i i ij i i j j R R R = + with ()()() \u00042 1 0 1 2 0 11 1 [ 1 ] { ( ) jV V V j j j j j ij ij i ij n V V ik k kc S R c S q = + = + + + 11 () \u0004()()()() 2 2 1 * * 1 1 21 1 1 1 [ 1 ] }. j jV V V V V V j j j j j j j V j j h q q + + + + (8) Detailed derivations of the reproduction numbers are also given in [A dditional file 1]. Model fit using 2005-2006 Taiwan winter seasonal influenza data and age- specific vaccination data as it was implemented during that flu season, as w ell as simulation studies of hypothetical scenarios, will be carried out. Simulations with Taiwan Seasonal Influenza With the issue of morbidity-based vs. mortality-based vaccine st rategy for pandemic influenza still open to debate, the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (TCDC) l aunched a new program of free flu vaccination for 1st and 2nd grades elementary school students (age 6-7) prior to the 2007-2008 winter flu season which was expanded further to include grades 1-4 in the fall of 2008. The aim of this vaccine program is hopef ully to lower the seasonal influenza incidence across all age groups of the population. I n anticipation of future investigation on public health impact of this program, we car ry out model simulations by dividing the Taiwan population into 7 age groups (see Table 2), and by making use of the weekly Taiwan influenza vaccination data for young children of age 2 or less (age group 1, with free flu vaccination since 2004) and the elde rly of 65 or older (age group 7, with free flu vaccination since 2001) during the 2004-2005 winter flu season. The average vaccine coverages of age groups 1 and 7 during the 2004-2005 winter season in Taiwan are 63.4% and 58.2%, respectively. There were no other nonpharmaceutical intervention measures during thi s winter flu season. That is, all parameters pertaining to quarantine and hom e withdrawal in the model are set to be 0 in Table 1. Moreover, for the sake of sim plicity, we assume no noticeable level of migration and no waning of immunity during the flu season. The rest of the parameter values used are given in Tables 1-2. We also assume a conservative 20% pre-epidemic immunity in our simulation based on a recent sero-e pidemiological survey 12 conducted during 2005-2006 winter flu season in Taiwan [28]. For the contact rates between different age groups, we make use of the age-specific contact matrix obtained by Wallinga et al. [29] for Utrecht, the N etherlands, 1986. We adjust for the discrepancy in the population age distributions of Taiwan in 2005 and the Netherlands in 1986, by considering the ratios of demographic age struct ures of Netherlands in 1987 (Appendix Table 1 in [29]) and of Taiwan in 2005 [Additiona l file 1: Table A1]. The resulting contact matrix, of the average daily number of contacts for each individual in a certain age group with individuals in another age group, is given in [Additional file 1: Table A2]. Fitting with Seasonal Influenza Data The age-dependent hospitalization rates and per contact transmissi on probability in the last four rows (in bold) in Table 2 were obtained by least-square d curve-fitting with the 2004-2005 Taiwan winter P&I (Pneumonia and Influenza) mortality data f rom October 9, 2004 to March 5, 2005 for age groups 6 (age 22-64) and 7 (>64) using MATLAB software. 7 1 ( ) and ( ) v v are piecewise linear (by week) approximations of the respective weekly vaccination data for elderly (>64) and young c hildren in Taiwan during this time period. To simply our data fitting, we first fitted the data by assuming the per contact transmission probability of the infectees in i th group are averaged, i.e., ij i (see next to the last row in bold in Table 2). Results The result of data fit is given in Fig. 3. The reason for using only groups 6 and 7 for data fit is that the P&I mortality data during that winter sea son consists mostly of older people. More precisely, 5038 (88.5%) of the 5694 individuals who died of P&I are of ag e 65 or older (age group 7), 607 (10.7%) are between age 22-64 (age group 6), followed by 17 between age 0-2 (age group 1) and 14 between age 15-21 (age group 5). Each of other 13 age groups has only a handful of cases. Therefore, to avoid large error s due to fitting data with small data size, we only use the data from the two largest groups for our model fit. We also fitted the data by assuming the per contact transmis sion probability of the infectors in i th group are averaged, i.e., ij j (see the last row in bold in Table 2 and Fig. 4). We will compare these results to ascertain the diff erence in age groups on per contact transmission probabilities to and from particular age groups. To give more insight to the data used and the goodness of fit, we also provide the daily observe d and predicated mortality corresponding to the case ij j in [Additional file 1: Figs. S1-S2]. Discussion and Conclusion Age-specific Transmission By fitting only the hospitalization rates and the per contact trans mission probabilities to the 2004-2005 Taiwan winter season P&I mortality for age groups 6 (age 22 -64) and 7 (>64), we are able to obtain satisfactory model fit (see Fig . 3), although we note that fitting P&I deaths might conceivably lead to an overestimate o f hospitalizations rates. However, simulation studies showed that the model fit is less sensi tive to the hospitalization rates than to the transmission probabilities, and intui tively, most sensitive to changes in these rates for the elderly group. It is interesting to note that comparatively significant error s in both theoretical curves occur in late January roughly after day 110. We note that day 105 was January 22, 2005, when all schools in Taiwan closed for the winter vacation which las ted until after the traditional lunar New Year holiday, in mid-February of that yea r. The school closure, and subsequent shutdown of all non-essential venues during the week-long Ne w Year holiday, surely had a significant impact on the contact rates which was not reflected in our constant contact matrix that implicitly assumes that inter-age group contact patterns 14 remain the same during the whole season. More precisely, the P &I deaths for the elderly exhibits a slight increase for about 3 weeks after the closing of schools (shortly after the New Year) when compared to the model predicted values, while the P& I deaths for the adults of age 22-64 dropped substantially below the theoretical curve. T hese results indicate that the school closure and the subsequent New Year holiday le d to more frequent contacts by the elderly in the households with family mem bers who spent more time at home during the holidays At the same time, there were l ess contacts for the adults at the workplace (especially for those working in the educational fa cilities who had longer holidays) during this time period. Since most individuals in the elder group (and the very young) are not directly affected by the school closings and the holidays, one may speculate that the difference in the actual mortality and the theoretical mortality of the elderly, as averaged over the whole time period, is due at least i n parts to the impact of interaction between the elderly and younger children with the school-age children and adults, when the activity levels (in terms of frequency as well as whom to make contact with) of the latter groups were significantly changed by the holidays. Furthermore, the elderly had a higher per contact transmission probabi lity (Table 2) but lower contact frequency [Additional file 1: Table A2]. This study showed that , with the combination of these two factors, morbidity-based vaccination stra tegy still could be effective for the prevention of elderly mortality. Although a rec ent study to quantify the effect of school closures during the 2008 winter influenza season in Hong Kong did not find the school closures as having a substantial effect on the communit y transmission [30], our results indicate the need for further studies on this topic. We also note that, normally, one would like to use averaged excess winter season P&I m ortality data over other seasons for the data fitting of seasonal influenza. However, Ta iwan often experiences summer influenza epidemics which would offset any att empt to obtain a reasonable \"excess\" P&I mortality for the winter season. 15 The Reproduction Number Using Equations (2-3) we obtain R 0=1.0001, just above unity. However, we note that it is more appropriately the reproduction number R of the winter flu epidemic, given the effect of pre-epidemic immunity that must exist. Chowell et a l. [31] used several weekly seasonal flu mortality data, derived from P&I excess deaths and influenza-specific deaths from US, France, and Australia during 1972-1997 (1972-2002 for US), to estim ate the (mean) reproduction number R p over 3 decades of seasonal flu. They found that the mean of R p to be around 1.3, with year-to-year variability of 0.9-2.1. Our estimate is lower, but within their range. Vaccination It is also interesting to note that for our set of parameter val ues used in Figs. 4-5, the effective reproduction number with vaccine only (see Equations 5-6) has almost the same value as R 0, to the fourth decimal digit. One explanation for this apparent lack of impact of vaccination during the 2004-2005 flu season, as indicated by the value of RV, is that the vaccination data we used is only for groups 1 (age 0-2) and 7 (age >64). In the formula for R V, or more precisely for 0V ij R in Equation (7), c ij 2 is the daily contact frequency between groups i and j. The contact frequencies of groups 1 an d 7 [Additional file 1: Table A2] are substantially smaller than the contact frequencies of the other groups, with the exception of within-group contacts and contact between groups 1 a nd 2 (age 3-5) in daycare facilities. Therefore, the relative impact of tar geting these two groups for vaccination was weakened by their relative inactivity, thus givin g further evidence of the lack of impact of vaccinating the very young and the very old on the overall transmissibility of the disease in the community. However, simulat ion with the same parameter values as in Fig. 3 except assuming no vaccination in the young children and elderly age groups, i.e., ()()1 7 0 t t = = , and everything else the same produces Fig. 5, 16 where the result indicates that the impact of no va ccination (red curves) would still be significant, resulting in nearly 4-fold increase in mortality of elderly and 2-fold increase in mortality of adults. Therefore, the impact of va ccination on the disease incidence sometimes might not be fully revealed in the change (or the lack thereof) in the effective reproduction number with intervention but could sti ll be substantial, since it is a simple mathematical property that distinctly different (ne xt generation) matrices may have similar eigenvalues. Furthermore, in our simulations we had assumed vacc ine efficacy (proportion of infection prevented) of 40% for elderly and 70% for young children, to be in line with current literature [8-9]. However, efficacy depends very much on matching of the circulating strains with vaccine strains each year, where mismatch often causes low efficacy and might have affected our resulting data fit. We also assumed vaccine effectiveness (proportion of reduction in symptomat ic cases) to be 60% for elderly and 40% for young children (also see [8-9]). The per contact transmission probability for the su sceptible elderly (>64) infectees (see next to the last row in Table 2) is estimated to be 0.155, more than three-fold of any other age group (with the young children of 0-2 bei ng the next highest), which may be due to the common need for very close contact while the elderly (or younger children of age <3) are being cared for, typically by individua ls from adults of ages 22-64 in age group 6, even though the frequency of contact might be less than that of with other a ge groups. This further highlights the high vulnerabil ity of the elderly (or the younger children) to exposure from other age groups, and de monstrates the need for morbidity-based strategy to prevent the elderly (or younger children) influenza mortality. On the other hand, the estimated per contact transm ission probabilities for the younger (<3) and the elderly (>64) infectors are also both higher than those of the other group s (see the last row in Table 2), but not significantl y so except when compared with those 17 between ages 8-14. The higher transmission probabil ities of young children and elderly infectives could reflect, again, the fact that cont acts with these individuals are usually of a more intimate nature, although these probabilities are not as drastically different as their vulnerability to be infected. The less likelihood o f schoolchildren of 8-14 to infect others might also be attributable to signs of their less i ntimate contacts with others as they grow into adolescence. To further explore this situation, we note that fro m Equation (6), the partial derivatives of v ij R with respect to i i are: 0( ) v ij v ii ii i i ii i i RR R R i j = + = 0( )[1 (1 ) ] if . ( ) v ij v ij ij j j i i RR R i j = We know 0v ii ii R R from Equations (2) and (7). We also know that [0,1] and [0,1], i i for all i. Subsequently, ( ) v ij i i R is a nonincreasing function of i i for all i, j . However, since ( )11 det 1 n V VR R += + , where ()V V ij R R = is the matrix with V ij R its ij th element, the effective reproduction number with vaccination only, RV, does not necessarily decrease as the effective vaccination r ate i i increases. In other words, vaccination is not always beneficial in reducing in cidence and the design of an effective vaccination program in multi-group model is highly nontrivial, unlike in simple epidemic models where there is a simple formula for the crit ical vaccination coverage level necessary for eradication (p c) [20]. In fact, it has been shown mathematically b y Hadeler and Castillo-Chavez [32], using a model with a core group, that partially effective vaccination program may actually increase the total number of cases. Explicit quantification of an optimal vaccination policy ([3 3]) in a multi-group population 18 scenario remains to be a challenge for mathematical modelers and is beyond the scope of this work. Moreover, the model fit was carried out with vaccination (of the elderly and small children of age 2 or less) as the only interv ention since vaccination was the only intervention that was implemented during the flu se asonal for which the fitted P&I data was collected. Further simulations with quarantine and home withdrawal also can be easily carried out. Pre-epidemic Immunit y A related issue is that of pre-epidemic immunity. F urther sensitivity analysis using pre-immunity in the range of 10%-30% has shown that the results of curve-fittings are not sensitive to small changes in the pre-epidemic immunity. One would expect that pre-epidemic immunity does impact the outbreak, but nonetheless it is not reflected, at least not in the reproduction numbers. Pre-symptomatic infection and asymptomatic infectio n by asymptomatic infectives were incorporated into the proposed model. To gauge the roles these two features of influenza might play in a seasonal influenza epidem ic, we performed the following simulations. Again using Fig. 3 as a benchmark, we first assume no pre-symptomatic infection (=0) with all other parameter values unchanged (Fig. 6). Next we assume no asymptomatic infection by asymptomatic infectives ( i=iV=0) (Fig. 7). The results indicate that pre-symptomatic infection seemed to h ave little effect on the model fits and the fitted parameters; while asymptomatic infection by asymptomatic infectives has a more pronounced impact on the model fit for the eld erly, perhaps indicating the comparatively larger role asymptomatic infection pl ays in disease transmission. Finally, as the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Exp erts (SAGE) recently made its recommendations for priorities in vaccination f or the H1N1 pandemic in terms of the social groups (e.g., healthcare workers those with chronic medical conditions), health groups (pregnant women), and age groups [34], the m odel also can be used to divide 19 population into social/health groups. For example, to study vaccine policy for the elderly, we could divide the elderly into those living in ho useholds and those living in old age homes, since they mix differently in these two dist inct settings. The model is also useful for simulations of the cost-effectiveness of vaccin e and other intervention measures, such as prophylaxis treatment, perhaps in future work. Competing interest.
