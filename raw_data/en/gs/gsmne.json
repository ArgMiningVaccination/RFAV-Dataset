Learn the best crystals for meditation and how to use them in your practice!", "sitename": "Through the Phases", "date": "2019-11-03", "cleaned_text": "I love adding crystals into my meditations because I feel like they supercharge the power of my intentions and enhance my experience. Whenever I meditate with crystals I access strong meditative states and feel so uplifted afterwards, guaranteed. And not only this, when I use the best crystals for meditation this effect increases tenfold! So I want to let you in on this experience too. If you're curious about meditating with crystals but are unsure where to start, you're in the right place. In this post I'm gonna go into some of the best crystals for meditation and how to use them so that you can experience the benefits too. And you'll be pleased to know that it's so simple once you know how! Why use crystals for meditation? As I said previously, crystals can supercharge the power of your intentions during meditation. Each crystal has its own frequency and metaphysical properties, which help you to vibrate in alignment with it and soak up its juicy benefits! The right crystals can help you to access meditative states and heal any particular issues you're wanting to target. Plus they really don't add any extra difficulty into your meditation, so I'm sure you'll agree it's a no brainer! How to Meditate with Crystals Before we get onto the best crystals for meditation, let's look at how to meditate with crystals. Because, I promise, meditating with crystals doesn't have to be complicated. Follow these simple steps on how to meditate with crystals and you'll be practicing crystal healing in no time! 1. SET AN INTENTION I would really recommend always setting an intention before your meditation, especially when using meditation crystals. This is because knowing your intention helps you to choose crystals for meditation that will help you align with that intention. So why are you meditating? What do you want to target today? Ask yourself these questions to reinforce with yourself why you're engaging in this practice. For example, you may decide that in today's practice you really want to focus on self love. This can then help you to not only choose your crystal, but other tools that can help you achieve this intention such as using [self love affirmations](https://www.throughthephases.com/self-love-affirmations/?swcfpc=1). 2. CHOOSE YOUR CRYSTAL Now you have your intention set, it's time to choose a crystal that will help you align with this intention. You can [choose crystals based on a chakra](https://www.throughthephases.com/how-to-unblock-chakras-using-crystals/?swcfpc=1), or search for crystals that are helpful for your specific intention. And of course, I'd encourage you to keep reading to find out the best meditation stones in this post. Try to tune into your intuition with this - which crystal is calling out to you? 3. CLEANSE AND CHARGE YOUR CRYSTAL It's important to cleanse your crystal if you've just purchased it, because it is likely to have soaked up a lot of different energies that you don't want to take on! One of my favourite ways to cleanse crystals is under the moonlight or sunlight. You can simply place your crystals on a window sill under the full moon and morning sun, or outside if you wish to. You may also choose to cleanse your crystals in room temperature salt water, though this shouldn't be done with softer crystals and crystal clusters. You can also cleanse your crystals by placing them with clear quartz or selenite, as these powerful crystals can clear unwanted energies. 4. PLACE YOUR CRYSTAL Sit in the position that you would ordinarily sit in for meditation. The only difference is that you can now place your crystal wherever you want to place it. A common method is to hold the crystal in the left hand, as this is the receiving hand. Using this hand means that you're receptive to the energies of the crystal and can receive the benefits during your meditation. You may also choose to lay down and place your meditation crystal on its resonating chakra point. How to do this can be seen in [this post](https://www.throughthephases.com/how-to-unblock-chakras-using-crystals/?swcfpc=1). 5. FOCUS ON THE CRYSTAL Begin your meditation practice as you usually would, but direct your focus towards the energies of the crystal and visualise yourself receiving these energies. Notice how the crystal feels as you meditate - you may be able to sense the energy that radiates from it. Continue to focus on the crystal throughout your practice, returning your attention to it if your mind starts to wander. Also remember to keep your intention in mind and recenter yourself if you lose sight of it. There is no right or wrong way to practice this, you'll know what feels right for you.

How to choose crystals for meditation Before we move onto the 6 best crystals for meditation, I first want to quickly cover how to choose your own crystals for meditation. Because, sometimes, the best crystal for meditation is the one you choose yourself! I'm a firm believer that you should always choose your crystals based on your intuition. This is because your intuition knows what you need more than your headspace does. Trust your gut. Which crystals are you most drawn to? If a particular one is calling out to you, that's the one you want to meditate with! Don't question it - just go with the flow. If you find that no singular crystal is calling out to you, that's okay too. Instead, think about what you feel like you might need in this moment. Could you benefit from more self love, are you wanting to get more in tune with your intuition, or perhaps you want to work on confidence? Whatever it is, there's a crystal for it! Pick a meditation crystal that has the properties you are wanting to work with (you can simply google if you're unsure). Or alternatively, you may wish to work with a certain chakra. This is a great option if you feel like a certain chakra needs more attention to balance you out. If you want to learn more about how to do this, just check out [How to Unblock Chakras with Crystals](https://www.throughthephases.com/how-to-unblock-chakras-using-crystals/?swcfpc=1). The 6 Best Crystals for Meditation Now, let's move onto the good stuff - the very best meditation crystals to use in your practice. If you're still unsure of what crystals you want to work with, these are some of the best crystals for meditation that can have powerful effects no matter your intention. These crystals can be seen as great all rounders and are the perfect crystals to reach for when you're unsure of what you want to work with! 1. [Clear Quartz](https://www.amazon.com/Luckeeper-Healing-Crystal-Amethyst-Obsidian%EF%BC%8C6/dp/B074CZ8DDY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=clear+quartz&qid=1572791974&sr=8-7&th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=hopefullotus-20&linkId=ed010c82258524ad718ba4653388186d&language=en_US) [Clear quartz](https://www.amazon.com/Luckeeper-Healing-Crystal-Amethyst-Obsidian%EF%BC%8C6/dp/B074CZ8DDY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=clear+quartz&qid=1572791974&sr=8-7&th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=hopefullotus-20&linkId=ed010c82258524ad718ba4653388186d&language=en_US) is, in my opinion, the best meditation stone. This is because it is a stone that has the power to awaken your crown chakra, which is associated with your psychic abilities. Plus, despite being associated primarily with the crown chakra, [clear quartz](https://www.amazon.com/Luckeeper-Healing-Crystal-Amethyst-Obsidian%EF%BC%8C6/dp/B074CZ8DDY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=clear+quartz&qid=1572791974&sr=8-7&th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=hopefullotus-20&linkId=ed010c82258524ad718ba4653388186d&language=en_US) actually has the ability to balance all of your chakras. It is the ultimate balancing stone, and a great crystal to use to bring your other crystals back into alignment. If you're feeling out of balance and like you could benefit from the properties of the \"master healer\", [clear quartz](https://www.amazon.com/Luckeeper-Healing-Crystal-Amethyst-Obsidian%EF%BC%8C6/dp/B074CZ8DDY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=clear+quartz&qid=1572791974&sr=8-7&th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=hopefullotus-20&linkId=ed010c82258524ad718ba4653388186d&language=en_US) is the perfect stone for you to meditate with. 2. [Selenite](https://www.amazon.com/Beverly-Oaks-Energy-Infused-Selenite-Complete/dp/B06ZZQ14VN/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=selenite&qid=1572792119&sr=8-27&linkCode=ll1&tag=hopefullotus-20&linkId=5f52d86221e2243ff36cad3919ae50b6&language=en_US) [Selenite](https://www.amazon.com/Beverly-Oaks-Energy-Infused-Selenite-Complete/dp/B06ZZQ14VN/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=selenite&qid=1572792119&sr=8-27&linkCode=ll1&tag=hopefullotus-20&linkId=5f52d86221e2243ff36cad3919ae50b6&language=en_US) is another powerful crystal associated with the crown chakra. It is particularly beneficial for developing peace, serenity and universal consciousness. [Selenite](https://www.amazon.com/Beverly-Oaks-Energy-Infused-Selenite-Complete/dp/B06ZZQ14VN/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=selenite&qid=1572792119&sr=8-27&linkCode=ll1&tag=hopefullotus-20&linkId=5f52d86221e2243ff36cad3919ae50b6&language=en_US) is the perfect stone to meditate with if you want to clear your mind space and gain clarity. It can help to develop self awareness and make you more in tune with yourself and your surroundings. Its' calming properties make it an amazing tool for accessing meditative states. 3. [Amethyst](https://www.amazon.com/Amethyst-Healing-Crystal-Pointed-Meditation/dp/B0789661J4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=amethyst&qid=1572792277&sr=8-14&linkCode=ll1&tag=hopefullotus-20&linkId=2bcdf7839e7cbcb21513f0b5b47fcaa8&language=en_US) [Amethyst](https://www.amazon.com/Amethyst-Healing-Crystal-Pointed-Meditation/dp/B0789661J4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=amethyst&qid=1572792277&sr=8-14&linkCode=ll1&tag=hopefullotus-20&linkId=2bcdf7839e7cbcb21513f0b5b47fcaa8&language=en_US) is a form of quartz, which has a purple hue. This is a stone that is connected to the third eye chakra, which is associated with your intuition. For this reason, amethyst is one of the best crystals to enhance your meditation. Using [amethyst](https://www.amazon.com/Amethyst-Healing-Crystal-Pointed-Meditation/dp/B0789661J4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=amethyst&qid=1572792277&sr=8-14&linkCode=ll1&tag=hopefullotus-20&linkId=2bcdf7839e7cbcb21513f0b5b47fcaa8&language=en_US) during meditation can promote inner peace and healing, relieve stress and enhance spiritual awareness. If you want to connect more to your intuition, amethyst can be an amazing stone to work with before going to sleep.
