Mass global vaccination offers the most ef cient pathway towards ending the pandemic. The development and deployment of rst-generation COVID-19 vaccines, encompassing mRNA or viral vectors, has proceeded at a phenomenal pace. Going forward, nanoparticle-based vaccines which deliver SARS-CoV-2 antigens will play an increasing role in extending or improving vaccination outcomes against COVID-19. At present, over26 nanoparticle vaccine candidates have advanced into clinical testing, with \u00bb60 more in pre-clinical devel- opment. Here, we discuss the emerging promise of nanotechnology in vaccine design and manufacturing to combat SARS-CoV-2, and highlight opportunities and challenges presented by these novel vaccine platforms. \u00a9 2021 The Authors.

SARS-CoV-2 and the generation of protective immunity by vaccination Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respi- ratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The viral spike (S) protein mediates viral attachment, entry into host cells and serves as a critical target for vaccine design [1]. S exists as a homo-trimer on the virion sur- face and enables viral recognition of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the host cell surface via the receptor binding domain (RBD) (Fig. 1 ). All 22 COVID-19 vaccines that are in use worldwide have included S or an S-derivative engineered for increased stability [2]. Delivery of S protein or S-encoding nucleic acid as a vaccine indu- ces neutralising antibodies and antiviral T and B cell memory [3/C06]. Induction of neutralising antibodies (nAbs) was recently demon- be a robust correlate of protective ef cacy for current COVID-19 vaccines [7]. After vaccine administration, vaccine antigen is traf cked to lymph nodes by lymphatic drainage or through immune cell-mediated transport, depending on routes of administra- tion, vaccine antigen properties (e.g. molecular weight and dimen- sions) and adjuvants [8]. In the lymph node, antigen is introduced to the adaptive immune system. With the support of CD4+T cells, anti- gen-speci c B cells undergo activation, proliferation and selection forclones with mutations in their immunoglobulin genes that confer increased antigen af nity [ 9,10]. High-af nity B cells can differentiate into either antibody-producing plasma cells or memory B cells. In addition to direct neutralisation of free virus [7], Abs can also mediate clearance of virus-infected cells through Fc-mediated engagement with 'killer 'immune cells [11]. Killing of virus-infected cells is also a primary function of CD8+T cells, which develop rapidly after SARS- CoV-2 infection [12]. As vaccine-elicited antibody levels wane over time, ongoing protection against infection is likely to rely upon stable populations of memory B and T cells. A major challenge in designing SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is the emer- gence of mutated viruses termed variants of concern (VOC) [13].F i r s t generation COVID-19 vaccines were developed based on the genome of the original SARS-CoV-2 isolate, Wuhan-Hu-1 [14]. However, novel viral strains with multiple mutations in the spike protein have begun to circu- late worldwide, and mutations (notably at the amino acids E484 and E417 in the RBD) can drive immune escape from vaccine elicited nAbs [13], with consequent reductions in vaccine ef cacy [15].F u t u r ep r o o ng coronavirus vaccine strategies to protect human populations requires overcoming antibody-escape by emerging VOCs. 2. Nanoparticle vaccines for COVID-19 in development Besides traditional vaccine modalities (i.e. inactivated vaccines, live attenuated vaccines, and recombinant protein vaccines) and DNA and vector-based vaccines (which have been reviewed elsewhere* Corresponding skent@unimelb.edu.au 2352-3964/\u00a9 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/ebiom [16]), nanoparticle vaccines offer a unique opportunity to advance vaccine science and provide tractable solutions to the current pan- demic and beyond. Nanoparticles are loosely de ned as nanoscale- sized and tunable particulate structures that mimic structural fea- tures of natural viruses. This adaptive design makes them highly promising platforms for next-generation vaccine development, pro- viding pathways to drive strong nAb responses, or broader antibody-based immunity that might better account for variation and evolution of viral pathogens. At present, at least 26 nanoparticle-based vaccine candidates have advanced into human clinical trials ( Table 1 ), with \u00bb60 additional candidates in varying stages of preclinical develop- ment. Such vaccines encompass diverse formats such as lipid nano- particles (LNPs), virus-like particles (VLPs), protein nanoparticles, micelles, and other technologies ( Fig. 2 a). Potential advantages and disadvantages of different nanoparticle vaccine platforms are detailed in Table 2 . Based on antigen loading strategies, nanoparticle vaccines can be divided into two groupings: (1) nanoparticles encap- sulating vaccine antigens or nucleic acid cargos within their core and (2) nanoparticles that present vaccines antigens on their surface. A key feature of antigen-encapsulating nanoparticle vaccines is the pro- tection and controlled release of cargo after immunisation, while nanoparticles displaying vaccine antigens are able to engage antigen- presenting cells (APCs) and/or ef ciently promote B cell used to deliver nucleic acid cargos (DNA and RNA) encoding vaccine antigens. Encapsulation within LNPs acts to both protect mRNA cargo from rapid degradation by RNases, and to facilitate cellular delivery of mRNA which is challeng- ing due to size and charge constraints (reviewed in [18]). A key com- ponent of LNPs is an ionizable lipid, which is positively charged at low pH to allow encapsulation of negatively-charged mRNA, while being neutral at physiological pH [19]. LNPs enter cells via endocyto- sis and within the low pH of endosomes, the ionizable lipid becomes positively charged and can disrupt endosomal membranes, allowing mRNA cargo release into the cytoplasm for protein translation. LNPs often also contain a PEGylated lipid to minimise opsonization in vivo and various helper lipids and cholesterol to support particle forma- tion. mRNA-LNPs are fully synthetic and manufactured without the requirement of living cells, allowing rapid production of vaccines at scale within weeks after the availability of a viral genome [20].Therst two COVID-19 vaccines approved for use were LNPs delivering mRNA encoding engineered S [ 3,4]. Both Moderna and BioNTech/P zer mRNA-LNP greater than 90% against Wuhan-Hu-1 SARS-CoV-2 after two vaccine doses in clinical trials. Similarly high effectiveness has been observed in mass vaccination settings such as Israel, where the BioNTech/P zer BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine (Comirnaty ) has been used to vaccinate more than 80% of the adult population with at least one dose [21]. Similarly, in the United States, the two mRNA-LNP vaccines were 94% effective against COVID-19 hospitalization among fully vaccinated older adults aged /C2165 years [22]. Neutralising antibody responses after LNP immunisation are durable, persisting past six months in all healthy adult participants in an ongoing phase 1 trial [23]. However, a reduction in effectiveness of both mRNA vaccines against VOCs has been observed [24/C027] . Currently, the Delta variant is the dominant SARS-CoV-2 VOC in circulation in many countries. A single dose of BNT162b2 was considerably less effective at preventing symptomatic disease caused by the Delta variant compared to the Alpha variant (30.7% compared to 48.7% effective) [27]. After two doses, BNT162b2 was 93.7% effective against Alpha and 88% effective against Delta. Thus, the next generation of reformulated mRNA-LNP vaccines aim to address emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Both mRNA and lipid particles contain potent immunostimulatory properties [ 28,29], negating the need for additional formulation with adjuvants [ 3,4]. In fact, the intrinsic immunogenicity of mRNA can be problematic. Both the Moderna vac- cines use designed to limit the immunogenicity of mRNA, allowing higher vaccine doses and enhancing translational capacity [30]. In contrast, the CureVac mRNA-LNP containing nucleosides lacking modi cation required lower doses to be delivered in clinical trial, and demonstrated only 47% ef cacy against currently circulating variants [31]. In the devel- opment pipeline are numerous other vaccines comprised of LNPs encapsulating nucleic acids, not only conventional mRNA encoding S, but also self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) which enhances antigen expression at lower doses (ISRCTN17072692, NCT04758962), or mRNA cocktails encoding three structural proteins S, M, and E of SARS-CoV-2 (RQ3013) or polyethylenimine (PEI)) have been widely used in the past to prepare nanoparticle vaccines for other coronaviruses (e.g. SARS-CoV, MERS- natural polysaccharide, was utilised to encapsulate the SARS-CoV-2 RBD Fig. 1. Structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. S protein exists as homo-trimer. Each monomer is divided into S1 ing domain (RBD, purple). The SARS-CoV-2 structure was reprinted from CDC Public Health Image Library. The S protein structure was prepared using the PDBle'6VSB 'on PyMol.2 M.N. Vu et [34]. Positively charged chitosan can electrostatically act negatively charged mucus sialic acid, facilitating nanoparti- cle adhesion in airway epithelial surfaces upon intranasal administration. In addition, the surface of the chitosan nanoparticles was decorated with mannose sugars. Innate immune recognition of mannose could lead to increased nanoparticle shuttling to the net- work of follicular dendritic cells and deposition in germinal centres of lymph [35]. Although immunogenicity data for RBD-manno- sylated chitosan nanoparticles have not yet been reported, a similar system was exploited to deliver swine in fluenza A viral antigens, which induced robust cross-reactive IgA and IgG antibody titers and protection in a challenge nanoparticles2.2.1. Virus-like particles VLPs are nano-sized self-assemblies of viral structural proteins that can act as vaccine antigen delivery vehicles [36]. They mimic molecular and morphological features of native viral virions, while lacking genetic material rendering them non-infectious and non-rep- licating. Several SARS-CoV-2 VLP vaccines are in clinical and pre-clin- ical development, with CoVLP the most advanced in phase 2/3 clinical trials (NCT04636697). Developed by Medicago, CoVLP is pro- duced by transient transfection of tobacco plants with Agrobacterium [37]. Enveloped vesicles spontaneously develop and display stabi- lized pre-fusion S trimers on the surface. In a phase 1 trial, vaccina- tion with two doses of CoVLP formulated with AS03 adjuvant elicited potent nAb responses \u00bb10-50-fold higher than observed in COVID- 19 convalescent individuals.The quality and magnitude of antibody responses is greater fol- lowing a single dose of a VLP vaccine compared to soluble antigen. A single dose of enveloped VLPs derived from murine leukemia virus and displaying prefusion S (VBI-2902a) induced robust nAb responses in mice and better protected hamsters from infectious SARS-CoV-2 challenge compared to recombinant prefusion S [38]. The VBI-2902a vaccine is currently in phase 1/2 clinical trials (NCT04773665), while trivalent VLPs displaying S from multiple coronavirus strains are currently in pre-clinical development (VBI- 2901). Also in phase 1/2 clinical trials are VLPs consisting of RBD con- jugated to Hepatitis B surface antigen (ACTRN12620000817943). A candidate poised for rapid advancement is avian pathogen New- castle disease virus-like particles (NDVLPs) used to domains were replaced with those from NDV to create a fusion protein that when co-expressed with NDV matrix and nucleocapsid proteins form S2P-NDVLPs. Vaccination of mice with S2P-NDVLPs formulated with Sigma Adjuvant System elicited higher nAb titers at a lower antigen dose compared to soluble S2P. Importantly, the NDVLP technology can utilise existing in fluenza vac- cine manufacturing capacity for rapid mass production of SARS-CoV- 2 vaccines, thus speeding global vaccine deployment. 2.2.2. Micelles Micelles are self-assembled amphiphilic structures that can deliver SARS-CoV-2 proteins, an example being the vaccine manufac- tured by Novavax currently in late-stage phase 3 clinical mulated with saponin-based Matrix-M1 this vaccine amphiphilic detergent polysorbate 80 (Tween 80)Table 1 Nanoparticle COVID-19 vaccine candidates in clinical development Types of nanoparticles Developer Types of vaccine candidates Phase Trial registration CVnCoV mRNA Stemirna Therapeutics mRNA-LNP COVID-19 vaccine 1 ChiCTR2100045984MRC/UVRI and (CoVLP) 2/3 NCT04636697 The Scienti c and Technological Research Council of TurkeyVLP vaccine 2 NCT04962893 Serum RBD-I53-50 nanoparticle 3 NCT05007951 Walter Reed Army drive self-assembly of proteins [ 6,40]. The hydrophobic transmembrane domain of S inter- acts with the hydrophobic core of the micelle to form a protein- detergent rosette structure upon mixing. In clinical trial in the UK (NCT04583995), NVX-CoV2373 was reported to be 96% ef cacious against and 86% against the Alpha VOC, pro- tecting immunised subjects from mild, moderate, or severe disease outcomes [41]. In a phase 1/2 clinical trial, the addition of Matrix-M1 to the S-micelle vaccine was found to be antigen-dose sparing with a two 5 mg dose regime eliciting serum IgG and nAb titers markedly higher than those found in convalescent individuals [42]. However, in the phase 2b trial (NCT04533399) in South Africa, where the Beta VOC is dominantly circulating, the vaccine demonstrated a lower overall ef cacy of 49.4% [43]. A reformulated vaccine that targets the Beta variant is under development. 2.2.3. Self-assembling protein nanoparticles Protein-based nanoparticle platforms have also been developed to deliver SARS-CoV-2 subunit protein vaccines (S and RBD). A self-assembling SARS-CoV-2 S ferritin nanoparticle (SpFN) is currently in a phase 1 clinical trial (NCT04784767). To produce SpFN, a gene encoding prefusion-stabilized S ectodomain was genetically fused to a gene encoding Helicobacter pylori ferritin, a ubiquitous, iron-storage protein that consists of [44]. Upon expression in mam- malian cells, a nanoparticle, with 8 vertices with 3-fold symmetry facilitating the ordered display of trimeric S proteins. In preclinical testing, vaccination of rhesus macaques with two doses of 50 mg SpFN co-formulated with a liposomal adjuvant elicited robust nAb titers, and protected animals against intranasal and intratracheal SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Reduced viral replicationwas reported in the lower and upper airways, as well as reduced pul- monary pathology. In a parallel study, SpFN was compared to immunisation with RBD-ferritin nanoparticles (RFN) in mice and macaques [ 45,46]. After two doses in mice, RFN elicited equivalent neutralising titers as a sin- gle immunisation of SpFN, which were more than 20-fold higher than titres in convalescent donor serum. Passive transfer of puri ed IgG from either SpFN- and RFN-vaccinated mice induced robust pro- tection for K18-hACE2 transgenic mice from a lethal SARS-CoV-2 virus challenge. Moreover, immunisation of rhesus macaques with two doses of RFN co-formulated with a liposomal adjuvant elicited \u00bb10-50-fold greater nAb titer relative to those observed in NHP stud- ies of several authorised COVID-19 vaccines. Furthermore, vaccina- tion inhibited viral replication in the upper and lower airways following high-dose SARS-CoV-2 respiratory challenge. SARS-CoV-2 protein antigens can also be covalently conjugated onto a nanoparticle core using the SpyTag/SpyCatcher sys- tem. SpyTag peptide (13 amino acids) and SpyCatcher proteins (116 amino acids) are derived from Streptococcus pyogenes and spontane- ously form isopeptide bonds upon mixing [47]. Either SpyTag or Spy- Catcher can be fused to vaccine antigens or to protein nanoparticle platforms, facilitating rapid covalent linkage upon mixing. Compared to direct fusion of antigens onto protein platforms, SpyTag/Spy- Catcher can increase expression yields or facilitate high throughput testing of a range of vaccine antigens. Such a strategy was used to construct ferritin the SARS-CoV-2 higher than observed after immunisation with soluble RBD-SpyTag. Antibody responses after ferritin-NP-RBD vacci- nation were durable, lasting for at least 7 months and were Fig. 2.

Nanoparticle vaccines can drive increased antigen processing by APCs and antigen deposition in lymph nodes, elicit- ing more and/or better-quality neutralising antibodies than soluble antigens.4 M.N.

Alongside ferritin, other are under development to deliver SARS-CoV-2 immunogens. For example, a 60-subunit Aquifex rable neutralizing responses to 2.0 mg of a prototypic S protein vaccine, a substantial dose-sparing effect [49]. Similarly, construction of bacteriophage capsid-like particles (RBD-CLP) using the SpyTag/ SpyCatcher system allows and high density display of RBD vaccine antigens [50]. Mice vaccinated with a single dose of RBD-CLP vaccine formulated with squalene-water-emulsion adjuvant elicited nAb titers higher than vaccination with soluble RBD and com- parable to COVID-19 convalescent human plasma, with further titre improvements following a booster dose. 2.2.4. Liposomes Liposomes are nanostructured assemblies of amphipathic phos- pholipids with one or multiple lipid bilayers forming a membrane which, unlike LNPs, encapsulate an aqueous core. Liposomes have been used to deliver SARS-CoV-2 vaccine antigens. In a preclinical trial, RBD subunits were attached to the surface of liposomes to form RBD-liposomal vaccines [51]. By simply with liposomes containing cobalt (CoPoP), chelating ion and histidine residuesformed, resulting in serum-stable and conformationally intact display of RBD on the liposome surface. RBD-liposomes elicited robust anti- body titers in vaccinated mice that inhibited live virus replication. RBD-liposomes also displayed enhanced antigen uptake by APCs and increased immune cell recruitment to draining lymph nodes. Lipo- somes have also been further upgraded to increase their biomimetic properties. Intranasal administration of liposomes encapsulating Toll-like receptor agonist Poly(I:C) and coated with a pulmonary sur- factant in addition to the display of RBD on the surface induced stron- ger mucosal immunity than intramuscular or subcutaneous administration in mice [52]. 3. Application of nanotechnology to address vaccine challenges3.1. Maximising protective nAbs with tunable nanoparticle design Nanoparticle-based vaccines can confer more robust protective antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 compared to soluble or non- particulate vaccine antigens (reviewed in [ 53,54]). Mechanistically, efcient uptake by APCs and improved lymph node drainage drives enhanced antigen deposition in lymph nodes and consequently increased nAb production ( Fig. 2 b). More importantly, multimerisa- tion of antigens on the surface of antigen-presented nanoparticle vac- cines can enhance B cell activation via direct engagement and cross- linking of BCRs [55]. Here we discuss recent advances of nanopar- ticles with surface display of vaccine antigens, which aim to maxi- mize productions of nAbs. The modular nature of nanoparticle platforms enables particle characteristics such as size, antigen valency and spacing to be modi-ed to further optimise the elicitation of protective antibody responses ( Fig. 3 a). However the tunability of self-assembling protein nanoparticles is limited by the small number of naturally occurring scaffolds whose structural properties are amenable for use as a vac- cine. Advances in computational protein modelling and design algo- rithms have allowed the design of synthetic protein building blocks with low-energy protein-protein interfaces to drive self-assembly of nanomaterials with atomic-level of particle structure [56]. For example, mi3 and I3-01 are computationally (KDPG) from Thermotoga maritima intoa higher order dodecahedral 60-mer nanocages, which allows display of 60 monomeric dis- play 24 /C060 copies of RBD or 8 - 20 copies of stabilized S on a single particle [58]. E2p and I3-01 nanoparticle vaccines with a larger parti- cle size and higher antigen valency induced increased antigen-spe- cic binding and nAb titres in vaccinated mice as compared to those immunised with ferritin nanoparticles or soluble antigens. The I3-01 vaccine elicited not only the highest neutralising activity at 8 weeks post vaccination, but also potent T cell responses. In another study, combining computationally-designed mi3 with the SpyTag/Spy- Catcher system allowed multivalent presentation of RBDs [60] . Vacci- nation of mice and pigs with two doses of adjuvanted RBD-mi3 induced strong nAb responses equivalent to convalescent sera, and 5-10-fold higher than soluble RBD alone. Importantly, this vaccine was also thermostable following repeated freeze/thaw cycles and able to be lyophilized, removing the cold-chain distribution require- ment of current COVID-19 vaccines. Computationally designed protein nanoparticles need not be assembled from a single identical subunit, but can utilise multiple distinct protein subunits. Multicomponent protein nanoparticles allow greater control of antigen spacing, the assembly process ,and the possibility of cargo encapsulation within the nanoparticle core [61]. For instance, a I53- subunits, self-assembles in vitro into a cle with a diameter of \u00bb30 nm [62]. This platform can be constructed to attach either 60 [63] or 120 [64] protein monomers or 20 two-component computationally- designed I53-50 were used to display 24, 60, and 120 copies of SARS- CoV-2 RBDs respectively using the SpyTag/SpyCatcher system [64]. Vaccination of mice with the RBD-nanoparticles co-formulated with either AddaVax or Sigma Adjuvant System exhibited 8-120-fold greater neutralising activity against both pseudo- and authentic viruses than those immunized with monomeric RBD. Increased valency of RBD presented on the nanoparticle surface was positively associated with elicitation of neutralising antibodies. In another study, I53-50 scaffolds were designed to attach 20 cop- ies of SARS-CoV-2 S protein with 15 nm spacing [62]. These S-I53-50 nanoparticles were able to trigger direct B cell activation in vitro through BCR crosslinking and elicit potent nAbs in vaccinated mice, rabbits, and cynomolgus macaques. Vaccination with S-I53-50 pro- tected macaques from a high-dose viral infection, with reduced viral replication in the upper and lower airways [62]. The I53-50 cage was also used to display 60 copies of monomeric SARS-CoV-2 RBD, which is currently in phase 1/2 clinical trials (NCT04742738 and NCT04750343). In preclinical testing, RBD-I53-50 nanoparticles pro- tected vaccinated mice from infectious viral challenge and elicited 10-fold higher nAb titers in mice relative to animals immunised with prefusion-stabilized S proteins, despite a 5-fold lower dose [63].I na further study, RBD-I53-50 nanoparticle vaccination of rhesus maca- ques generated robust nAb titers maintained for at least 180 days and conferred signi cant protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection, with viral loads reduced in the pharynges, nares, and in the bron- choalveolar lavage [65]. 3.2. Using nanotechnology to combat viral variants and ongoing evolution Existing nanoparticle vaccine platforms have been rapidly updated to combat emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. With rst genera- tion Moderna has developed mRNA-1273.351 with mRNA cargo updated to express S from the Beta VOC. It is noteworthy that6 M.N. Vu et al. / EBioMedicine 74 (2021) 103699compared to traditional methods (e.g. thin lm hydration, reverse- phase evaporation, etc.), novel micro fluidic mixer approach currently used to manufacture mRNA-LNP vaccines allows rapid and large- scale production of LNPs with high mRNA encapsulation ef ciency [66]. This vaccine is currently in a phase 2 clinical trial (NCT04405076), with mRNA-1273.351 booster immunisation of trial participants previously vaccinated with the wildtype mRNA-1273 eliciting markedly increased neutralising variants [67]. Boosting with mRNA-1273.351 appeared more effective at increasing neutralization against Beta compared to boosting with mRNA-1273. Encouragingly, immunisation ofmacaques with protein nanoparticles alum of heterologous vaccine antigens on a single particle might favour the selection of cross-reac- tive B cells into the vaccine-elicited immune response, thus broaden- ing the range of variants or pathogens recognised by ( protein nanoparticle platform mi3 employing the SpyTag/SpyCatcher system was used to form mosaic nanoparticles displaying four to eight distinct RBDs from SARS-CoV-2 and zoonotic betacoronaviruses [71]. Mice immunised Fig. 3. Mechanisms of immune response modulation by nanoparticle-based vaccines. a, Tuning features such as particle size or antigen valency can optimise t he presentation of vaccine antigens on nanoparticle vaccines, which can drive increased B cell activation via ef cient B cell receptor cross-linking. This can in turn elicit higher levels and/or better- quality neutralising antibodies. b, Mosaic design sees the display of heterologous vaccine antigens on the surface of a single nanoparticle. This ca n act to favour the selection of cross-reactive B cells into the vaccine-elicited immune response, thereby broadening range of pathogens recognised by neutralising antibodies.M.N. Vu RBD-mi3 nanoparticles antibody recognition and neutralisation activity against heterologous virus strains, compared to those vaccinated with SARS-CoV-2-RBD nanoparticles or COVID-19 convalescent human plasma. In another approach, the two-component computationally designed protein scaffold I53-50 was constructed to deliver RBDs from four distinct sarbecoviruses - SARS-CoV-1, coronaviruses WIV1 and RaTG13 [72]. of mice with either a mosaic (four RBDs co-displayed on the same nanoparticle) or as a cocktail (four nanoparticles each expressing a single type of RBD) was able to elicit broad neutralising activity against diverse sarbecoviruses including the SARS-CoV-2 Beta variant. The maintenance of long-term immune protection against VOCs might similarly be achieved by driving increased T cell immunity. It has been established that the peptide epitopes recognized by anti- viral CD4 and CD8 T cells are relatively conserved in the viral spike, allowing T cell responses to be better maintained in the face of muta- tions present in VOC compared with antibody responses [73]. Nano- particle vaccines that can elicit strong T cell memory responses might therefore provide a pathway to durable protection against current and future VOCs. Notably, presentation of RBD on protein nanopar- ticles elicited greater cytotoxic CD8+T cell responses compared to monomeric antigen in mice [74]. However, optimal T cell immunity would likely be localised to the site of infection in the form of resi- dent memory T cells. Therefore, the utility of delivering nanoparticle vaccines directly to mucosal sites requires further investigation. The availability of multiple types of nanoparticle vaccines could support the deployment of heterologous prime-boost strategies,which can reduce the impact of supply-chain disruptions and allow greater flexibility in vaccination programmes [ 5,75]. So called \"mix- and-match \"strategies have demonstrated that exceptionally potent immune responses can be generated by combining two or more existing vaccine platforms [76], in particular, boosting adenoviral vaccines primed subjects with mRNA-LNP vaccines [77]. Maximising immunity in the population is likely critical for vaccine protection to allow better control of emerging viral variants. In addition, dimin- ished vaccine immunogenicity due to increasing immu- nity seen after repeated dosing with live virus-based vaccines suggests multiple non-redundant vaccine platforms will be required for boosters into the future [76]. 4. Future of nanoparticle vaccines for this pandemic and the next The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has heralded a coming-of-age for vac- cine nanotechnology. Decades of groundwork optimizing new vac- cine platforms allowed clinical trials with nanoparticle vaccine candidates to begin within 2 months of the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence being made publicly available. The unprecedented swift- ness of this response and the high degree of ef cacy afforded by nanoparticle COVID-19 vaccines now approved has saved many lives and signi cantly advanced the science of vaccinology. However, how nanoparticle-based vaccine technologies will evolve for the next phase of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, or to combat emerging pandemic threats from other pathogens is not yet clear. Current COVID-19 vaccine deployment is not globally equitable with selected high- and middle-income countries approaching high vaccine coverage while vaccine roll-out has barely begun in many low-income countries [2]. mRNA-LNP vaccines are more expensive than traditional vaccines, with both the P zer/BioNTech and Mod- erna vaccines costing \u00bb$USD 15-30 per dose to \u00bb$USD 2 for a less ef cacious, whole-inactivated virus vaccine Covaxin, devel- mRNA-LNP and protein nanoparticle vac- cine platforms require specialised manufacturing facilities and highly skilled workforces, a major challenge in many resource-limited set- tings. An additional drawback of mRNA vaccines is the current requirement of ultra-cold chain storage, which complicates thelogistics of vaccine manufacturing, storage and distribution. A next generation COVID-19 mRNA vaccine candidate (mRNA-1283) devel- oped by Moderna is refrigerator-stable, facilitating easier distribution and administration in a wider range of settings and has entered a phase 1 clinical trial (NCT04813796). Protein-based nanoparticle platforms face extensive challenges also. In particular, the stringent requirements of GMP-grade cell-line development to facilitate manufacturing, along with relatively complicated puri cation, for- mulation and stability challenges can complicate vaccine scale-up efforts, potentially leading to signi cant delays in gaining regulatory approval [79]. There is an urgent need for technology transfer, and research into advanced manufacturing technologies to spread the benets of nanoparticle vaccine technologies more widely and ensure an adequate global supply of vaccines for durable immune control over the virus. The rapid and widespread use of new classes of nanoparticle vac- cines has raised safety concerns, with evidence of extremely rare but severe anaphylaxis and myocarditis following vaccinations withmRNA-LNP [80]. A lipid mRNA-LNP vaccine formula- tion which contains polyethylene glycol (PEG) 2000 has been believed to cause this anaphylactic response, especially in people with pre-existing anti-PEG antibodies [81]. This phenomenon also raises safety concerns to other PEG derivatives such as polysorbates which are formulated with other nanoparticle vaccines, for examples S protein-micelle vaccines manufactured by Novavax [82]. Thus, fur- speci c mechanisms and/or genetic/epige- netic pre-disposing factors for such reactions, not only related to PEG but also other new materials/carriers need to be urgently performedin order to avert the risk of increased vaccine hesitancy and improve public acceptance of novel vaccine technologies. 5. Outstanding questions Finally, we need more information to guide the rational design of next generation vaccines to combat SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging pathogens. In particular, which vaccine platforms strike the optimal balance between ef cacy and manufacturability for global scale use? Can combinations of multiple nanoparticle vaccine platforms in a heterologous prime-boost approach confer superior immunity? And will mosaic vaccines allow universal protection against all SARS-CoV- 2 strains, or at least reduce the impact of emerging variants that escape antibody-based neutralisation? 6.
