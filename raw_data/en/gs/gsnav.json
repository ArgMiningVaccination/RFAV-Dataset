Hot flushes and night sweats are the most common of these, affecting [75% of women](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29393299/), and the symptom for which most women seek treatment. Others include changes in weight and body composition, skin changes, poor sleep, headaches, joint pain, vaginal dryness, depression, and brain fog. While menopause hormone therapy is the most effective treatment for menopausal symptoms, it's sometimes not recommended (such as following breast cancer, as there's conflicting evidence about the safety of menopause hormone therapy following breast cancer) or avoided by people, who may seek non-hormonal therapies to manage symptoms. In Australia, it's estimated [more than one-third](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26224187/) of women seek complementary or alternative medicines to manage menopausal symptoms. But do they work? Or are they a waste of time and considerable amounts of money? What's on the market? The [complementary or alternative interventions](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30868921/) for menopausal symptoms are almost as varied as the symptoms themselves. They include everything from mind-body practices (hypnosis, cognitive behavioural therapy, and meditation) to alternative medicine approaches (traditional Chinese medicine and acupuncture) and natural products (herbal and dietary supplements). There's some evidence to support the use of [hypnosis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23435026/) and [cognitive behaviour therapy](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22336748/) for the treatment of hot flushes. Indeed, these therapies are recommended in [clinical treatment guidelines](https://www1.racgp.org.au/getattachment/bfaa5918-ddc4-4bcb-93cc-d3d956c1bbfd/Making-choices-at-menopause.aspx). But there's less certainty regarding the benefit of other commonly-used complementary and alternative medicines, particularly nutritional supplements. The most popular [nutritional supplements](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26224187/) for hot flushes are phytoestrogens (or plant estrogens). This trend has been driven in part by [supplement companies](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-11915645/HRT-not-supplement-created-experts-women-RAVING-effects.html) that promote such agents as a safer or more natural alternative to hormone therapy.

Five tips for navigating uncertain times](https://theconversation.com/how-long-does-menopause-last-5-tips-for-navigating-uncertain-times-195211) What are phytoestrogens? Phytoestrogens are plant-derived substances that can show oestrogen-like activity when ingested. There are numerous types, including isoflavones, coumestans and lignans. These can be consumed in the form of food (from whole soybeans, soy-based foods such as tofu and soy milk, legumes, wholegrains, flaxseeds, fruits and vegetables), and in commercially produced supplements. In the latter category, extracts from soy and red clover yield isoflavones, and flaxseed gives us lignans. Because declining oestrogen levels drive menopausal symptoms, the theory is that consuming a \"natural\", plant-based substance that acts like oestrogen will provide relief. What does the evidence say? In the case of isoflavones, initial support came from [epidemiological data](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23562010/) showing [women in Asian countries](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15919681/), consuming a traditional, phytoestrogen-rich diet (that is, one including tofu, miso and fermented or boiled soybeans), experienced fewer menopausal symptoms than women in Western countries. However, several factors may influence the effect of dietary phytoestrogens on menopausal symptoms. This includes gut microbiota, with research showing only about [30% of women](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15919681/) from Western populations possess the gut microbiota needed to convert isoflavones to their active form, known as equol, compared to an estimated 50-60% of menopausal women from Japanese populations. Circulating oestrogen levels (which drop considerably during menopause) and the [duration of soy intake](https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article/11/5/495/605995) (longer-term intake being more favourable) may also influence the effect of dietary phytoestrogens on menopausal symptoms. Overall, evidence regarding the benefit of phytoestrogens for hot flushes is fairly mixed. A [Cochrane review](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD001395.pub4/full) synthesised study results and failed to find conclusive evidence phytoestrogens, in food or supplement form, reduced the frequency or severity of hot flushes or night sweats in perimenopausal or postmenopausal women. The review did note genistein extracts (an isoflavone found in soy and fava beans) may reduce the number of hot flushes experienced by symptomatic, postmenopausal women, though to a lesser extent than hormone therapy. Another [recent study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36253903/) showed marked reductions in hot flushes in women following a low-fat, vegan diet supplemented with daily soybeans. However, it was questioned whether concurrent weight loss contributed to this benefit. In Australia, [clinical guidelines](https://ranzcog.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Managing-menopausal-symptoms.pdf) do not endorse the routine use of phytoestrogens. [Guidelines for the United Kingdom](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng23/chapter/Recommendations#managing-short-term-menopausal-symptoms) note some support for the benefit of isoflavones, but highlight multiple preparations are available, their safety is uncertain, and interactions with other medicines have been reported.

Less research has explored whether phytoestrogens improve psychological symptoms of menopause, such as depression, anxiety, and [brain fog](https://theconversation.com/brain-fog-during-menopause-is-real-it-can-disrupt-womens-work-and-spark-dementia-fears-173150). A recent systematic review and [meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33987926/) found phytoestrogens reduce depression in post- but not perimenopausal women. A more [recent clinical trial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9022873/) failed to find an improvement. Some research suggests phytoestrogens may reduce the [risk of dementia](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960076015301254?via=ihub), but there are no conclusive findings regarding their effect on menopausal brain fog. The symptoms of menopause, which can include sleep disturbance, depression, anxiety and 'brain fog' can span perimenopause and last for up to ten years.\u2014 The Conversation (@ConversationEDU) [https://t.co/JcPifgXfeo] [December 19, 2021] The bottom line At present, there's uncertainty about the benefit of phytoestrogens for menopause symptoms. If you do wish to see if they might work for you, start by including more phytoestrogen-rich foods in your diet. Examples include tempeh, soybeans, tofu, miso, soy milk (from whole soybeans), oats, barley, quinoa, flaxseeds, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, almonds, chickpeas, lentils, red kidney beans, and alfalfa. Try including one to two serves per day for about three months, and monitor symptoms. These are nutritious and good for overall health, irrespective of the effects on menopausal symptoms. Before you trial any supplements, discuss them first with your doctor (especially if you have a history of breast cancer), monitor your symptoms for about three months, and if there's no improvement, stop taking them.
