There is no one protocol for a health condition that works for everyone, as the underlying causes of the same disease are unique to the individual. Also, we find it important to differentiate between supplement interventions that address symptoms and those that address underlying causes. Managing symptoms is often more important at the start of treatment and through short-term use of supplements that address underlying causes, gradually management becomes less necessary. Foundational supplements often include a Multivitamin, Omega 3 fatty Acids, Vitamin D and for some, probiotics. Regular supplementation of immunosupportive nutrients through cold and flu season is also recommended.
