On Monday, March 16, [News science writer Anna Kuchment and KXAS-TV (NBC5) anchor Bianca Castro spoke with three experts in the medical field to answer coronavirus-related questions from readers and viewers:](https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2020/03/14/the-news-and-nbc5-partner-for-a-special-coronavirus-broadcast-ask-your-questions-now/#_ga=2.263864460.1601450072.1584454242-1192200662.1570672285) Dr. John Carlo, who served as medical director of Dallas County Health and Human Services during the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic and is now CEO of Prism Health North Texas; Dr. Bryan Johnson, a Frisco internist; and Dr. Mark Casanova, president of the Dallas County Medical Society. We asked you, what do you want to know about coronavirus? Readers asked Curious Texas many questions about how coronavirus spreads and how it's being treated, including \"How are doctors treating COVID-19 in the hospital without a vaccine, and do we have enough of this treatment?\" Curious Texas is an ongoing project from The Dallas Morning News that invites you to join in our reporting process. The idea is simple: You have questions, and our trained journalists track down answers. [What you need to know about coronavirus](/news/public-health/2020/03/03/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-coronavirus/) Here's what the panel of medical experts had to say about your questions. Their responses have been edited and condensed for clarity. How are doctors treating COVID-19 in the hospital without a vaccine, and do we have enough of this treatment? Dr. Mark Casanova: Here's the reality ... treatment of a virus like COVID-19, that we don't have a cure for, really translates into as much organ support for our patients. So, what appears to be the predominant pathway for patients suffering from severe respiratory difficulty is that they enter health care facilities in need of help with breathing due to their symptoms. That comes from a mechanical ventilator, or a breathing machine. The goal is to support those individuals through that stage of the illness in the best way we can. Dr. Bryan Johnson: We also treat the underlying illness, because you can get a secondary infection if your immune system is compromised. Can a person contract COVID-19 twice? Dr. John Carlo: \"I think from a theoretical standpoint, no. Most people would expect that if you've recovered from the coronavirus, you would then be immune. However, this is such a new situation, we can't say for sure. Now, the other part is that viruses change, just like influenza does. It could be that the virus changes, and then you would be susceptible again to another infection. But most of the time, if it's the same virus, you recover and are immune.\" Is the virus airborne? Carlo: \"We don't know for sure at this point. There is no exact criteria for the definition of airborne. Like most respiratory viruses like the common cold and other coronaviruses, droplets spread \u2014 coughs, sneezes, wet material \u2014 don't travel very far. But that's the main way that COVID-19 would be spread from person to person. That's why we're saying that maintaining six feet of distance from others is a general guideline to be safe. We don't know for sure about the airborne risk. The bigger risk is coming into direct contact with the droplets.\" Casanova: Touching surfaces and the like. A droplet travels through the air, but there's the risk of it landing directly on a family member or a surface that somebody comes behind and touches. Johnson: On a surface, the virus can be active for, to our knowledge, three days. So, decontamination of commonly used surfaces is essential to decreasing the spread of the virus. Does the COVID-19 virus always make its way to the lungs? Or can it infect other areas of the body? Casanova: Viruses are going to have a portal of entry, whether it be the nose, mouth, eyes or upper airways. There will be subsequent effects on the lungs. And on the entire body. If you're having a fever, you're going to feel it all over. The virus doesn't have to get all the way down into the lungs to set up shop. It's going to set up shop if it finds its way into the body, typically through a mucus membrane \u2014 nose, mouth, eyes and the like. Is wearing a mask effective if you are still healthy? Carlo: No, I don't think so. If you are showing symptoms and you are coughing, sneezing, expecting some sort of infection \u2014 then a mask is a good idea with regards to COVID-19. Wearing a mask can prevent those respiratory droplets from coming out very far. If you're already sick, masks are a good prevention measure. If you're not showing symptoms, I wouldn't recommend it. If the virus can be transmitted through surface contact, should I wipe down the ATM and other public keypads and screens before touching them? Johnson: Theoretically, it may not be a bad idea. If an individual with COVID-19 had used that device within three days and contaminated it, then yes, you could become infected by using it. Carlo: Wash your hands and use hand sanitizer. Just because you come in contact with the virus doesn't mean you'll become sick with it. Hand washing is very important. Can pets contract COVID-19 or give it to you? Casanova: I don't think we have a clear answer on that yet. We have no clear evidence of animal transmission at this point. Can the virus penetrate unbroken skin? Carlo: We don't think so. This is a respiratory virus. Typically, unbroken skin is not a way this virus would enter the body. I think you're generally safe in those situations. The big thing to avoid is touching your nose, mouth and eyes. It's the hardest thing to do, but it's probably your best way of preventing yourself from getting sick. If someone sneezes, how long can the virus stay in the air? Casanova: Droplet transmission in the air is typically short-lived, from a classic transmission standpoint. Carlo: Yeah, I don't think very long. The bigger risk is direct contact. I don't think a long, sustained airborne risk is there. If you have severe symptoms, should you call an ambulance and be taken to the emergency room? Casanova: The simple answer is yes. If you have a health care provider, give them a call and alert them of the symptoms and severity. They may have a mechanism to direct you in an expedient fashion. If you're in severe respiratory distress \u2014 marked difficult breathing \u2014 you need to get medical attention as soon as possible. Our ask would be that you notify 911 when you make that phone call, that you're having difficulty breathing, so EMS personnel can be prepared. Same thing for the ER, to make them aware that they're receiving someone who may potentially be carrying COVID-19. Johnson: And by shortness of breath we mean ... what I always tell my patients is, if you're having difficulty completing a sentence. As the airways become inflamed, if the air moving through creates a musical note. A wheeze. If you have those types of symptoms and regular breathing is labored and you're really using lots of energy and struggling, you probably should contact emergency services and a loved one, because you probably won't be able to manage yourself. If you contract COVID-19 but can take care of yourself at home, what should you do? Carlo: I would treat it just like the flu. Get plenty of rest. You really have to let your body heal. Drink plenty of fluids, treat your symptoms for muscle aches. Use decongestants. These are all common things that we know how to do. We all go through those experiences. Just follow similar guidelines if you're infected with COVID-19. Casanova: Also, have a family plan in place. Create as much physical separation as possible between sick and healthy individuals. Especially if your household includes someone with a compromised immune system or the elderly. As much as possibly feasible. Grandpa may not be able to move to another location. Take care of yourself, but take care of each other.
