People with eczema have an increased risk of severe mpox infection. Currently, two vaccines are available in the United States, one of which is safe for people with eczema, and the other is not. This article looks at the safety of each vaccine, and recommendations for people with eczema. Currently, there are two mpox vaccines available in the United States: - ACAM2000 vaccine - Jynneos vaccine People with eczema have an impaired skin barrier, which a virus may take advantage of and cause a [more severe and widespread infection](https://nationaleczema.org/blog/ask-the-ecz-perts-monkeypox/) than in people without skin barrier issues. The ACAM2000 vaccine can replicate and may cause eczema vaccinatum, which is a severe condition that [can be ](https://nationaleczema.org/traditional-smallpox-vaccines-atopic-dermatitis-frequently-asked-questions/)life threatening. According to the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/interim-considerations/acam2000-vaccine.html) - eczema or atopic dermatitis - a history of eczema, atopic dermatitis, or any acute or exfoliative skin conditions The ACAM2000 vaccine is also [unsafe](https://www.fda.gov/media/75792/download) - severe immunodeficiency, such as those undergoing bone marrow transplantation or those with HIV or AIDS - underlying heart disease, such as [cardiomyopathy](/articles/327456)and [coronary artery disease](/articles/184130) The ACAM2000 vaccine also has [more known side effects](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/clinicians/vaccines/vaccine-considerations.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fpoxvirus%2Fmonkeypox%2Fhealth-departments%2Fvaccine-considerations.html) People with eczema will also need to avoid contact with anyone who has had an mpox vaccine, particularly the ACAM2000 vaccine, for around [30 days](https://nationaleczema.org/blog/ask-the-ecz-perts-monkeypox/). Exposure to people who have had a recent mpox vaccine may put people with eczema at risk of developing eczema vaccinatum. Jynneos [is suitable](https://nationaleczema.org/blog/ask-the-ecz-perts-monkeypox/) people with eczema. The Jynneos vaccine uses a replication-deficient virus, which means the virus does not replicate, and so it does not have the same risks as the ACAM2000 vaccine. People will need to take extra care if they have previously had an allergic reaction to any vaccine. People may still be able to receive the Jynneos vaccine, but a healthcare professional will need to monitor them for [30 minutes](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/vaccines/index.html) The [Jyennos vaccine](https://www.fda.gov/media/131078/download) - gentamicin or ciprofloxacin antibiotics - chicken or egg protein People would need to avoid any further doses of the Jynneos vaccine if they had a severe allergic reaction after getting the first Jynneos dose. According to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7122e1.htm) According to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/cases-data/mpx-JYENNOS-vaccine-effectiveness.html) Estimates suggest one dose may be 37% effective against mpox, and two doses may be 69% effective against mpox. These percentages may vary for different genders and types of vaccine administration. The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/vaccines/index.html) - have known or suspected exposure to a person with mpox - have had sexual contact in the last 2 weeks with a person with mpox - are men who have sex with men, or any [transgender](/articles/what-is-transgender), [nonbinary](/articles/321529), or gender-diverse person who has had a new diagnosis of a [sexually transmitted infection](/articles/sexually-transmitted-diseases)or more than one sexual partner in the previous 6 months - have had sex at a commercial sex venue in the previous 6 months - have had sex at a large commercial event or geographical area where mpox transmission is present in the previous 6 months - have had sex with anyone with the above risk factors, or if people anticipate experiencing any of those risk factors - have immune suppression, such as [HIV, and have experienced or anticipate experiencing](/articles/316373)the above risk factors - may have possible exposure to mpox from the workplace, such as people who work with orthopoxviruses in a laboratory setting or as a response team If a person with eczema develops mpox, or suspects they have come into contact with the virus that causes it, they must contact a healthcare professional immediately. It is also essential that anyone with mpox takes steps to prevent passing the virus on. Mpox can pass on through direct contact with the affected areas of the skin and fluid from the blisters. People will need to follow preventive measures until the rash has fully healed and a new layer of skin has formed. People without symptoms cannot transmit the virus to other people.
