In her twenties, the left side of Nan Luke's body went numb from the bottom of her foot up to her chin. The diagnosis was multiple sclerosis (MS) and thirty years later she still experiences that numbness and has had bouts of temporary blindness, loss of bladder control, and excruciating fatigue. MS is a disease in which the immune system attacks the central nervous system (brain, spinal cord, and optical nerves). Although drugs can reduce symptoms, no cure exists. In this video, Nan talks to the CIRM governing board about the challenges of living with MS and her excitement about the promise of stem cell treatments for the disease. Nan is an active patient advocate for MS and is on the board of trustees for the Pacific South Coast chapter of the National MS Society. "}
