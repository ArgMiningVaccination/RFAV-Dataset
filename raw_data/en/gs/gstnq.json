Along with [q\u00ec](/index.php/Qi) and [sh\u00e9n](/index.php?title=Shen_(Chinese_%22spirit;_god%22)&action=edit&redlink=1), it is considered one of the Sanbao of [Traditional Chinese Medicine](/index.php/Traditional_Chinese_Medicine) or TCM. Jng is stored in the kidneys and is the most dense physical matter within the body (as opposed to sh\u00e9n which is the most volatile). It is said to be the material basis for the physical body and is [yn](/index.php?title=Yin&action=edit&redlink=1) in nature, which means it nourishes, fuels, and cools the body. As such it is an important concept in the [internal martial arts](/index.php?title=Internal_martial_arts&action=edit&redlink=1). Jng is also believed by some to be the carrier of our heritage (similar to [DNA](/index.php/DNA)). Production of semen, in the man, and menstrual blood (or pregnancy), in the woman, are believed to place the biggest strains on jng. Because of this, some even equate jng with semen, but this is inaccurate; the jng circulates through the 8 extraordinary vessels and creates marrow and semen, among other functions. [[1]](#cite_note-1) One is said to be born with a set amount of jng (pre-natal jng, also sometimes called [yuan qi](/index.php?title=Yuan_qi&action=edit&redlink=1)) and also can acquire jng from food and various forms of stimulation (exercise, study, meditation.) Theoretically, jng is consumed continuously in life; by everyday stress, illness, substance abuse, sexual intemperance, etc. Pre-natal jng by definition cannot be renewed, and it is said it is completely consumed upon dying. So, this jng is considered quite important for longevity in TCM. Many disciplines related to [q\u00ecgng](/index.php/Qigong) are devoted to the replenishment of \"lost\" jng by restoration of the post-natal jng. In particular, the internal martial arts (esp. [Tai chi chuan](/index.php/Tai_chi_chuan)) and the Circle Walking of [Baguazhang](/index.php/Baguazhang) may be used to preserve pre-natal jng and build post-natal jng - if performed correctly. Commonplace in China is the sight of [r\u00e9nshn](/index.php/Ginseng) on sale in herb shops, at a wide range of prices - Kung Fu classics fans may remember it used as a plot element at the start of [Drunken Master 2](/index.php?title=Drunken_Master_2&action=edit&redlink=1). R\u00e9nshn, particularly Korean and Chinese, is said to bolster the jng and a common medicinal recipe is to add to porridge (of course [congee](/index.php?title=Rice_congee&action=edit&redlink=1) in China) along with cinnamon, [goji berries](/index.php?title=Goji_berries&action=edit&redlink=1) and ginger for a sweet, warming breakfast when the weather starts to turn cold in Autumn. An early mention of the term in this sense is in a 4th century BCE chapter called \"Inner Training\" () of a larger text dynasty](/index.php?title=Han_dynasty&action=edit&redlink=1), the [Gunzi](/index.php?title=Guanzi_(text)&action=edit&redlink=1) () [[2]](#cite_note-2). Jng (; essence) should not be confused with the related concept of [j\u00ecn (; power)](/index.php?title=Nei_Jin&action=edit&redlink=1), nor with jng (; classic/ [warp](/index.php?title=Warp_(weaving)&action=edit&redlink=1)), which appears in many early Chinese book titles, such as the [N\u00e8i Jng](/index.php/Huangdi_Neijing), [y\u00ec jng](/index.php?title=I_ching&action=edit&redlink=1) and [Ch\u00e1 Jng](/index.php?title=Cha_Jing&action=edit&redlink=1), the fundamental text on all the knowledge associated with tea [[3]](#cite_note-3). The concept of Jing is employed in the animated series [Avatar: The Last Airbender](/index.php?title=Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender&action=edit&redlink=1).
