Many medicinal plants are popularly used in Asian folk medicine to increase body resistance. An herbal formulation named KM1608 was prepared from three medicinal plants: Saussurea lappa, Terminalia chebula, and Zingiber officinale. In this study, we evaluated the immune stimulatory effect of KM1608 on RAW 264.7 murine macrophages. Network pharmacological analyses were used to predict potential immune response pathways of major compounds from KM1608. The cytotoxicity and immuno-stimulating effect of KM1608 were determined using cell viability and nitric oxide assays. The underlying mechanism of immunomodulatory activity was evaluated by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The results of network pharmacological analysis suggested that major compounds from KM1608 possess anticancer potential via immune signaling pathways. After treatment with KM1608 at 25-100 \u00b5g/mL for 24 h, the level of nitric oxide was increased in the dose-dependent manner. The results of quantitative real-time PCR showed that KM1608 stimulates the expression of immune cytokines (interferon (IFN)-, -, IL-1, -6, IL-10, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)) in macrophages.

Introduction [1](#B1-biomolecules-10-00424)]. Abnormality or dysfunction of the immune system may cause an unexpected immune response in the case of hypersensitivity or autoimmunity, as well as immunodeficiency. In addition, malnutrition or immune ageing results in an ineffective immune response. Immunity may be impaired by certain pathogens, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or in the patients who suffer from immunosuppression at the advanced stage of some chronic diseases [ [2](#B2-biomolecules-10-00424)]. [3](#B3-biomolecules-10-00424)]. [4](#B4-biomolecules-10-00424), [5](#B5-biomolecules-10-00424), [5](#B5-biomolecules-10-00424), [15](#B15-biomolecules-10-00424), [16](#B16-biomolecules-10-00424)] activities. The main biological effects of Z. officinale were anti-nausea [ [17](#B17-biomolecules-10-00424)], In this study, we investigated the combined immunostimulatory effect of these medicinal plants for cancer treatment. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Plant Materials and KM1608 Extraction [23](#B23-biomolecules-10-00424)]. The mixture was refluxed twice with 50% ethanol at 80 \u00b0C for 3 h each time and filtered. The filtrate was evaporated under reduced pressure to remove solvent until 35-45% of yield was obtained. After that, it was dispersed in 50% ethanol and filtered using a 0.22 \u00b5m membrane filter to acquire 5 mg/mL KM1608 solution for high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. In the other hand, the filtrate of KM1608 extract was evaporated and then freeze-dried to acquire the dry powder for biological assays. 2.2. High performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet/ diode array detection (HPLC-UV/DAD) Conditions [23](#B23-biomolecules-10-00424)] 2.3. Network Pharmacological Analyses [24](#B24-biomolecules-10-00424)]. We retrieved pathways from the Kyoto Encyclopedia Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database [ [25](#B25-biomolecules-10-00424)] using the target data. Then, the pathways were listed in descending order according to their combined score, leaving only the pathways satisfying the threshold (adjusted p-value 0.05 and combined score 30). We visualized a network graph using Cytoscape 3.5.1 [ [26](#B26-biomolecules-10-00424)] by collecting information on active compounds of KM1608, their targets, and related KEGG pathways. 2.4. Cell Culture 2.5. Cell Viability Assay [27](#B27-biomolecules-10-00424)]. 2.6. Nitric Oxide Assay [28](#B28-biomolecules-10-00424)]. After incubation at room temperature for 10 min, the absorbance of the mixture was measured at 450 nm with a microplate reader. The nitrite concentration in the supernatant was calculated from a sodium nitrite standard reference curve. Prednisolone (PDS) and 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) were used as reference drugs. 2.7. Quantitative Real-Time Reverse Transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) [Table 1](#biomolecules-10-00424-t001). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed by QuantStudio 3 Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) under these conditions: denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 45 amplification cycles at 95 \u00b0C for 3 s, and annealing at the appropriate temperature for 30 s. The relative gene expression levels were calculated using the Cq method with normalization to -actin as the reference gene [ [29](#B29-biomolecules-10-00424)]. 2.8. Western Blotting Analysis 2.9. Statistical Analysis 3. Results 3.1. Network Pharmacological Analyses of KM1608 Compounds T. chebula, and Z. officinale, respectively, are active compounds possessing anti-inflammatory activity [ targets were found between DCL and EA. KEGG analysis was conducted to determine potential pathways of the targets ( [Table 3](#biomolecules-10-00424-t003)). Among the targets, 22 genes were involved in cancer, apoptosis, and TNF signaling pathways, all of which are related to the immune response ( [Figure 2](#biomolecules-10-00424-f002)). 3.2. Stimulatory Effect of Production [Figure 3](#biomolecules-10-00424-f003)a, treatment with KM1608, up to the concentration of 100 \u00b5g/mL, did not suppress cell proliferation. The stimulatory effect of KM1608 on nitric oxide production was investigated by measuring the concentration of accumulated nitrite, the stable product of nitric oxide metabolism, released in cell culture medium. After KM1608 treatment at concentrations of 50 and 100 \u00b5g/mL for 24 h, the concentration of accumulated nitrite was increased in a dose-dependent (PDS) and 5-aminosalicylic acid were as reference drugs. 3.3. Effect of KM1608 on Cytokine Expression [Figure 4](#biomolecules-10-00424-f004)). The experimental conditions for gene changes were determined by analyzing various time-dependent alterations of mRNA expression through preliminary studies ( [Figure Pathway [Figure 5](#biomolecules-10-00424-f005)). 4. Discussion [4](#B4-biomolecules-10-00424)] and human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells [ [9](#B9-biomolecules-10-00424)]. Ellagic acid form T. chebula was reported to suppress the proliferation of human osteosarcoma HOS-1 malignant cells [ [31](#B31-biomolecules-10-00424)]. The cytotoxic effects of 6-gingerol from Z. officinale were also mentioned on cancer cell lines included human hematopoetic leukemia HL-60 cells, murine solid sarcoma S180 PBMC cells [ [32](#B32-biomolecules-10-00424)]. [33](#B33-biomolecules-10-00424), [34](#B34-biomolecules-10-00424)]. Our results also showed that the synthesis of NO was slightly stimulated by treatment with prednisolone (PDS) and 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), even though they were used as anti-inflammatory drugs. In fact, some previous researches mentioned that NO releasing is capable to enhance the therapeutic effect of anti-inflammatory drugs. The NCX 1022, a derivative of hydrocortisone, prevented the recruitment of granulocytes to the site of inflammation in C57BL6 mice by releasing NO [ [35](#B35-biomolecules-10-00424)]. In another study, treatment with MyoNovin and isosorbide dinitrate, two nitric oxide donor drugs, improve the anti-inflammatory of prednisone on dystrophic mdx mice [ [36](#B36-biomolecules-10-00424)]. Prednisolone was also mentioned that suppressed the proliferation of SaOS2, an osteosarcoma cell line, by stimulating the release of NO through the upregulation of iNOS [ [37](#B37-biomolecules-10-00424)]. [38](#B38-biomolecules-10-00424)]. In addition, type-I IFNs participate in the antitumor activity by promoting the adaptive immune response of CD8+ T-cells which controls tumor growth. When delivered to tumor sites via monocytes, IFN- suppresses the tumor growth and metastasis. tumor-targeting monoclonal antibodies also induces the antitumor immune response through the activation of dendritic cells [ [3](#B3-biomolecules-10-00424)]. [39](#B39-biomolecules-10-00424)]. IL-1 controls the recruitment of neutrophils to the infection site to destroy the damaged tissue [ [40](#B40-biomolecules-10-00424)]. IL-6 plays multiple roles in the immune response, such as recruitment of mononuclear cells, stimulation of B-cells as well as endothelial cells, and inhibition of T-cell [ [41](#B41-biomolecules-10-00424)]. In IL-6, IL-10 acts as an anti-inflammatory cytokine that regulates the immune response to minimize host damage. IL-10 inhibits the activation of T-cells, monocytes, and macrophages to limit and terminate the inflammation [ [42](#B42-biomolecules-10-00424)]. These results seem to be contradictory when KM1608 enhanced the expressions of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines at the same time. However, each cytokine play its own role in the immune response, whether it stimulates the inflammatory process or not. Our results showed that KM1608 enhanced the mRNA expressions of IFN-, -, and IL-10, consistent with the previous studies that type-I IFNs stimulate the IL-10 expression in macrophages [ [38](#B38-biomolecules-10-00424)]. [43](#B43-biomolecules-10-00424)]. In this study, we also found that KM1608 induces NO production by macrophages. NO is an important for host defense against infectious organisms. Moreover, NO can induce the cell function as well as regulate the growth and death of many immune cells, such as macrophages, neutrophils, T-cells, and natural killer cells [ [33](#B33-biomolecules-10-00424)]. In contrast to iNOS, COX-2 participates in the immune response by stimulating the cyclooxygenase pathway that leads to the synthesis of PGE2 [ [44](#B44-biomolecules-10-00424)]. PGE2 elicits vasodilatation and increases blood flow that facilitates the recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages to the infection site. PGE2 also promotes the production of a few pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-17 and IL-13 [ [45](#B45-biomolecules-10-00424)]. [30](#B30-biomolecules-10-00424)], the results showed that the anti-inflammatory activity of KM1608 caused by the significant inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis as well as suppressing the expressions of inflammatory mediators such as IL-6, MCP-1, and TNF- in lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-treated RAW264.7 cells. With the same material, the extract of herbal formulation KM1608, our recent studies suggested that KM1608 itself stimulated the expression of immune cytokines liked We evaluated further the protein expression of MAPKs, which involve in the regulation cytokine production [ [46](#B46-biomolecules-10-00424)]. KM1608 stimulated the KM1608 might contribute to the up-regulation of cytokine synthesis through the MAPKs signaling pathway. 5.
