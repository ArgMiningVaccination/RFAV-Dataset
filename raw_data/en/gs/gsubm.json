We do see other pathologies, ALS, Parkinson's, MS, auto-immune conditions, seizure disorders, dementia, other infectious diseases, chronic toxicities, etc. We see nearly all types of cancer Most common include breast, prostate and colon The key is personalization. Everything we do is individualized, from diagnostics to treatment modalities For all new patients, we recommend comprehensive lab testing to investigate root causes, as well as the best targets for treating their disease process These diagnostics guide the treatment recommendationsOur Integrative Approach to Treating Cancer and Chronic Infectious Disease The majority of the treatments that we provide are intravenous. Most of the IVs are natural, with some key conventional IVs as well. These include, but are not limited to the following: IVC, IV Curcumin, IV Quercetin, IV Resveratrol, IV Hydrogen Peroxide, IV Ozone, IV Artemisinin, IV Melatonin, IV EGCG, IV Antibiotics, IV Antifungals, etc. We do utilize other naturopathic modalities, but again those are patient dependent. These include acupuncture, homeopathy, botanical medicine, and physical medicine.Our Integrative Approach to Treating Cancer and Chronic Infectious Disease Envita Medical Center partners with Vertisis Compounding Pharmacy, Envita IR, Envita Mexico and Unipathic Medicine Envita works directly with Vertisis to not only compound specific IVs for our patients, but also offers exceptional compounded IVs for doctors across the country Envita also has an interventional radiology branch, which provides cutting edge procedures for our cancer and Lyme patients Envita has a sister branch in Hermosillo, Mexico that provides extremely high-quality immunotherapies for our cancer patients Lastly, Envita is an accredited unipathic facility that is dedicated to the education of physicians to provide safe and effective IV care for their patientsOur Integrative Approach to Treating Cancer and Chronic Infectious Disease The doctor and patient areas are designed for collaboration and shared experiences All of the physicians share an office to encourage collaboration and to improve patient care This allows for a better learning curve for the residents as well All of the patients share rooms to allow for shared experiences while they go through the process of healing, which makes it much easier for them We currently have 14 naturopaths and 3 medical directors as part of our team. So there is a lot of support!The Experience Gained by Being a Resident at Envita The level of pathology you will learn at Envita is second to none The lab results we see often would surprise most new doctors With late-stage cancer, there are often complications that arise that increase the complexity of the cases further With late-stage Lyme Disease, there are usually a multitude of secondary infections and toxicities that make the case more difficult to treat The learning curve for residents is immense Because we see very complex cases and we utilize cutting edge technology, there is a lot to learn. That being said, we are committed to support our residents through this learning process so that it allows them the most amount of growth as a physician.Compensation and Benefits Compensation and other benefits of the Residency Program Envita currently pays up to $60,000/year, which is one of the highest paid residencies in the country Envita pays up to $1000/year to complete your annual CNME requirements Medical, Dental and Vision are provided at a low cost to full time employees Envita offers life insurance for all full-time employees Envita offers an IRA and may match your contribution (up to a certain percentage) All full-time employees will receive 2-5 weeks of PTO (depending on how long you have been with the company), as well as 1 week of sick time per year There are 7 holidays per year that the clinic is closed (typically 9 additional days off per year) Envita will pay for your annual fee for your medical license, certificate to dispense, as well as the fee for your DEA numberWhy Work at Envita? We make a huge difference in the lives of our patients! An analysis of our patient outcome data and metrics for 2020 showed 74.71% in clinical response rates for late-stage and complex cancer patients. It is estimated that in 2020, a large number of these patients had failed standard oncology elsewhere before coming to Envita. 3 out of 4 patients responded to Envita's care. Envita's precision model \"Patient Reported Outcome\" shows 88% satisfactory/symptom score improvement. Envita patients reported fewer side-effects from prior chemotherapy and or radiation at a rate of 95% less side-effects under Envita's care. This is an important metric for measuring the patient's quality of life.Why Work at Envita? The learning opportunity is immense It is one of the best compensated residencies in the country The staff you will work with at Envita is truly incredible Although the residency program is structured, it can be flexible based on the skillset and desires of the residentInterested in Applying?
