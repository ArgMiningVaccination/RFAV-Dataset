A: Focus on lean proteins like turkey. Ground turkey, turkey cutlets or even turkey burgers can add variety to your lean protein options. Q: What foods should I avoid? A: Foods that are high in calories and low in nutrition. They go down fast, but leave us feeling hungry when compared to fruits, vegetables and proteins, which leave us feeling full and satisfied. Q: Will eating late at night prevent me from losing weight? A: Busy schedules and longer hours at work push dinner times later and later. This can have an impact on weight loss, but may also lead to other health issues. Simply not eating after 7 p.m. can help.Q: What's the largest contributing factor to weight loss? A: When calories consumed are less than calories burned, weight loss will occur. But many other factors can play a role. Hydration and sleep are also very helpful. It is true\u2014a well-balanced diet is essential, but a well- balanced life is crucial, too. Q: Should I focus more on diet or exercise? A: Creating a calorie deficit is the key to losing weight. For example, 1 pound of weight loss equals a calorie deficit of 3,500 calories. It 's important to figure out the easiest way to achieve this. If it 's simply cutting calories, that will usually result in a faster weight loss. However, if you 're like me and want a little more flexibility with the foods you eat, exercise is key. Q: Which is more important: the number of calories or the type of calories? A: I will always encourage individuals to choose the right calories. You really are what you eat, and over time your health will be determined by the food choices you've made throughout your life.

Slow down and don't forget to enjoy your meals! Eating intuitively takes time and focus.

WORDS Aaron Ventling PHOTOS Ray 4/2/18 6:20 PMkitchen and that is where I got the most rewards\u2014it's where I felt the strongest, the most empowered and truly happiest. It was almost a no-brainer to forge my own path and go into cooking,\" Giada says. She studied at the largest network of culinary and hospitality schools in the world, yet bouts with homesickness threatened her career. Ultimately, Giada's mother convinced her to stay. She completed her training and moved back to Los Angeles where she honed her cooking skills at restaurants including, Wolfgang Puck's flagship restaurant, Spago and luxury hotel chain Ritz-Carlton . \"I wasn't making any money and my parents were getting very frustrated with me. So, to make more money I started to cater and food-style,\" Giada says. Giada was helping a friend food-style for Food & Wine magazine when she was asked to write an article about her family. Her big break came in 2002 when a Food Network executive read Giada's story and eventually offered her a job. \"When it came to doing the shows\u2014it took me nine months to put a tape together\u2014I originally didn't want to do it,\" Giada says. Everyday Italian premiered in April 2003. The first series challenged her shy nature, but she persevered. Over time, her career blossomed to include other shows such as Food Network Star, Giada at Home and Iron Chef America . She is also a regular contributor on NBC's The Today Show . \"Being in front of the camera all of these years has been like therapy\u2014 a camera to talk to the whole time. It helped me become empowered,\" Giada says. Off-camera, she's authored nine cookbooks, a series of children's books and has opened two restaurants on the Las Vegas Strip. With her career success, Giada's life mirrors the trajectory of her grandfather's. Like him, she took the gifts she was given and makes the most out of them. \"Success means a lot of different things to different people. To me, success is making a mark in my field and I work at it every day,\" Giada says. Still, in the quiet moments, when she talks about her family, the loss of her younger brother to skin cancer and the love she has for her 9-year-old daughter, Jade, whom she calls her \"biggest passion,\" her family values show above everything. \"I think Italians have a unique love for their culture, their ingredients and their family...we are rooted in that, and food and family come before almost anything else. Italian food, Italian culture is like a big warm hug and everybody wants it.\" Like grandfather Dino, his children and grandchildren come together to cook, share a table and love each other. Along the way they find the sweet life. Giada 's passions may be great, but her goal is simple: \"to make my family proud, you know, to make my family proud of me.\"\"My earliest food memory is making pizza with my grandfather and siblings,\" Giada says. \"He 'd give us each a ball of dough and we'd sit on the counter to make our own pizza and he 'd bake them in the pizza oven for us.\" Born in Rome\u2014a city known for its rich heritage and old-world cuisine\u2014Giada gained a passion for cooking, along with a deep value for family and Italian culture, through time spent with her late grandfather Dino De Laurentiis, at his restaurant, DDL Foodshow. Dino and his nine siblings grew up selling spaghetti at his parents ' pasta factory in pre-World War II Italy. \"He would go door to door with his siblings and sell pasta and sauce,\" Giada says. \"I love his work ethic.\" In time, Dino found opportunity in the Italian film business, eventually producing more than 500 films and earning 38 Academy Award nominations. \"At times his work took precedence over everything and at times it didn 't,\" Giada says. \"But he grew a humongous business for his entire family and changed the way we lived. He had barely any education, but he loved what he did\u2014and was the greatest salesman. At the end of the day that 's what got him where he ended up,\" Giada says. Her mother and grandmother were actresses, her father was an actor-producer, and two siblings have worked in Hollywood, as a makeup artist and a film editor. \"My family was in the movie business, so definitely I could 've gone down that road, \" she says. But, she confesses, it was her shyness that kept her from working in movies. \"Cooking is where I felt empowered. I come from a large Italian family\u2014they 're very loud and it can be hard to get a word in\u2014so you try to find what you 're good at, \" Giada says. At 7, she moved from Italy to Los Angeles with her mother and siblings. It wasn't an easy transition for a self-described \"painfully shy \" kid. Adding to her troubles was a new culture and language. But Giada's Italian roots grow deep and she drew from her strong family ties and adapted to a new world. After high school, she stayed close to home and earned a degree in social anthropology from the University of California-Los Angeles. Still unsettled with her career path, Giada moved to Paris to train as a cuisine and pastry chef at Le Cordon Bleu. \"I was good in the WHAT DOES LIVING A BALANCED LIFESTYLE MEAN TO YOU? \"BEING A SINGLE, WORKING MOM AND ABLE TO HAVE A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP WITH MY DAUGHTER, WHILE GROWING MY BUSINESS .\" BALANCE | May 2018 32 030-035 Giada_03.28 BM.indd 32 4/3/18 5:21 PM SAVORY OR FAVORITE SHAPE? rigatoni.

As a general rule, most meats with the word \"loin\" contain the least amount of fat: beef sirloin, tenderloin, and pork loin. Other lean meats are skinless chicken or turkey, shrimp, salmon, and swordfish. If you're looking for a meat alternative, tofu is great for grilling. FILL UP ON FIBER Fruit is more than just a flavor-booster for the perfect kabob. Like veggies, fruit can be a great source of fiber\u2014which keeps you feeling full longer and helps prevent heart disease and diabetes. Mangos, papayas, avocados, peaches, pears, and pineapples are all fiber-filled fruit options that are great for the grill.

KABOBS Pair fruits, veggies and protein with common cooking times. Allow space at both ends of each skewer for easy handling. Also, small spaces between pieces can pare cook times. Keep kabobs from sticking to the grill by brushing the grill rack with vegetable or olive oil before adding the kabobs. Distribute weight evenly along the kabob. Bookend thin-sliced veggies with bulky pieces of meat or tofu to keep everything in place and prevent sliding. To check meat for doneness, remove one kabob from the grill and cut into a piece of meat. Look for clear juices and smooth cutting. Use a meat thermometer to determine doneness on larger chunks of meat. FOOD-SAFE TIP: ALWAYS PLACE COOKED KABOBS ON A CLEAN PLATTER FOR SERVING.

We often link the symptoms\u2014sleepiness, lack of energy, headache\u2014to something else. Instead of searching online for obscure medical ailments to blame your symptoms on, try drinking more water. We all know that increasing fluids is the way to go, but some of us can't maintain our drinking habits. Forget the eight glasses a day you were told to drink as a kid. The current daily water recommendation for ages 19 and older is 3.7 liters for men and 2.7 liters for women. That suggestion boils down to about 15 and 11 glasses of water, respectively. On top of that, you may need more water if you live in a hot climate or at a higher elevation, if you exercise often, or have a fever, diarrhea or vomiting. Although it's not proven how water intake affects chronic disease, it's well known that water is essential for regulating body temperature, lubricating and cushioning joints, protecting the spine and helping to eliminate waste. The average person is composed of around 60 percent water\u2014 and without enough water, we cannot function properly. Symptoms of dehydration include extreme thirst, fatigue, infrequent urination with the possibility of dark-colored urine, headaches and mental fogginess. Dehydration may even lead to overheating, constipation, mood changes, kidney stones, seizures and shock. Mild dehydration is easily treated by drinking water or other fluid, but extreme dehydration may call for a trip to the hospital. To prevent dehydration, drink liquids before you feel thirsty. If you wait until you're thirsty, you're already dehydrated. Eating fruits and vegetables with a high water content can contribute up to 20 percent of your daily fluid needs. Stock your kitchen with fresh or frozen melons, cucumbers, green peppers, berries, radishes, celery, cantaloupe and other watery produce to both supplement your hydration needs and eat healthfully.

STRETCH THE RIGHT WAYRISE. SHINE. STRETCH. SECOND OPINIONStretching\u2014dynamic and static\u2014increases flexibility and primes your body for exercise. In addition, Fett says stretching releases stress- reducing chemicals. \"Endorphins help with stress,\" Fett says. \"When you stretch and then work out, these released endorphins relax your muscles.\" Think beyond isolated hamstring or shoulder muscles. Your whole body, including the muscles in your core, want a stretch. \"Stretching needs to be a holistic, or whole-body approach,\" he says. \"Even when you 're walking or running\u2014 you need to stretch your core before doing that. Full-body stretching is more important than just isolated stretching.\"We instinctively stretch each morning to release fluids that collect in our back. By tensing and stretching our limbs, we redistribute it to literally spring back to life and start a new day. Blood slowly and gently flows to other parts of the body. The heart begins pumping a bit faster. Mental cobwebs dissipate and our minds start to focus. \"Stretching\u2014when done consistently and correctly\u2014can greatly improve your quality of life,\" says Daira Driftmier, Certified Personal Trainer and Director of Hy-Vee KidsFit and Hy-Vee Fitness. Yet somehow when we Q. WHAT ARE THE KEY BENEFITS OF STRETCHING? A. First, there's a static component\u2014long- duration holds that help fibers stretch and get more blood flow. Also, there's a dynamic component where you move the body and muscles lengthen. Generally, stretching gets blood flowing and fibers prepared for activity.Q. HOW CAN STRETCHING MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER? A. In my profession, I find that the first complaint people have is pain. So we try to reduce that. Stretching allows for pain modulation\u2014 whatever the injury. Blood flow and tissue stretching allow some extent of relief. So, number one\u2014I use it for pain relief and acute injuries.Q. INCORPORATING MINDFULNESS INTO EXERCISE AND LIFE IN GENERAL HAS BECOME A TREND. CAN THAT APPLY TO STRETCHING? A. Any kind of mind's-eye activity beforehand helps. You need to get muscles ready with stretching, and you need to get the body ready with the mind. Mindfulness is a good component to that. Q. HOW DO YOU KEEP PEOPLE ON STRETCHING ROUTINES AFTER THEY LEAVE A CLINICAL SETTING? A. I say, 'Hey, your goal is 10 percent better next visit, right?' If they don't do anything, they're not going to get 10 percent better. But if I say, 'Hey, this exercise will make you 10 percent better,' they'll be more accountable at home.THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SPORTS MEDICINE RECOMMENDS THAT EXERCISERS OF ALL AGES AND FITNESS LEVELS PRACTICE STRETCHING A MINIMUM OF TWO DAYS A WEEK.consciously decide to couple stretching with exercise, we often get it wrong. Even worse, we may simply avoid the practice altogether, which limits our mobility, fitness gains and increases risk of muscle and joint-related injury. \"There are two faults that people have,\" says Zach Fett, a physical therapist with the Iowa Clinic in West Des Moines, Iowa. \"One, they're not able to stretch a muscle effectively, so they find compensations to stretch it, breaking down something else. Also, people tend to overstretch, which will cause more problems later on.\" When added to a well-rounded exercise program, stretching yields obvious benefits beyond blood flow. The key lies in getting it right, with proper timing and technique. \"Stretch for 10 minutes before, then spend 20 minutes stretching afterward,\" Fett says. \"You need to get blood flowing to the muscles that you work out. Then you need to cool down.\" HOW IT WORKS WITH ZACH FETT, PHYSICAL THERAPIST, THE IOWA CLINIC BALANCE | hy-vee.com 59 058-061 Stretching_03.29_2_BM.indd 59 4/3/18 3:00 PMDYNAMIC STRETCHES Begin with your feet hip-width apart.

Biking is a low-impact aerobic exercise that doesn 't jar the body, yet as an endurance sport improves cardiovascular fitness and tones your legs, arms, butt and stomach. It even triggers the release of endorphins that may promise you a happier day. Biking is a unique activity as there is truly something for everyone.

Biking can be a lifetime workout routine to get and stay in shape for the long haul.

Research the types of bikes, the function and design. And before you fall in love, set a budget. Bikes are best purchased from a local bike shop as the sales people are often avid cyclists with a universal love of sharing their knowledge and passion. \"Everyone's needs are different,\" says bike shop owner Dave Hoss. \"Different types of bikes fit a variety of people. In a bike shop, someone will help you find the style that suits your needs.\"DRINK UP! INTENSE RIDES IN EXTREMELY HOT WEATHER COULD REQUIRE AS MUCH AS 4 BOTTLES OF WATER PLUS ELECTROLYTES AN HOUR. PEDALS There are three choices in bike pedals: plain, toe-clippable and clipless. Plain are best for most riders. Toe-clippable pedals were popular until the ' 80s but today 's serious riders choose clipless pedals. These require special bike shoes with cleats that clip into the pedal 's locking mechanism. While they take practice, clipless pedals offer benefits. They provide the best connection to the bike 's power train because both feet maintain constant contact with the pedal and both legs work together making, strokes more powerful. They also offer security. The feet are attached to the bike, giving better control for quick movements\u2014 even a bunny- hop over obstacles, if needed. The heart of the bike, frames typically come in four materials (listed below , least-to-most expensive) with each offering benefits for specific users. ALUMINUM : Inexpensive and strong, aluminum is possibly the most common material for bike frames. Because it 's lightweight it shapes energy-efficient bikes. \"Most hybrid bikes and entry-price road bikes are made of aluminum,\" says Zac Angus, bike department manager at Scheels Sporting Goods Store in West Des Moines, Iowa. STEEL : The workhorse of frames, steel touring and adventure bikes can carry loads of luggage. Steel frames may be the easiest to repair and are a great option for commuter and recreation bikes. If budget allows, avoid low-end bikes made of high tensile (Hi-Ten) steel, which has a poor strength-to-weight ratio. Instead, look for chromoly (CroMo) steel. CARBON FIBER: Light and comfortable, carbon fiber bikes absorb minute road vibrations. \"Carbon fiber absorbs road shock,\" Angus says. \"A carbon-fiber fork helps create a smooth ride, and when used in the frame, carbon fiber is a major benefit. \" Carbon fiber takes about 14 times longer to produce than aluminum bikes. TITANIUM : Lighter, more durable and more resistant to corrosion than steel, titanium is almost indestructible\u2014but has the downside of being expensive. It 's typically offered only by specialty bike manufacturers. Sources: https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-top-5-bene ts-of-cycling4THERE ARE MANY TYPES OF BIKE SADDLES ON THE MARKET. RESEARCH AND TRIAL ARE THE SECRET TO FINDING THE BEST ONE FOR YOUR NEEDS. 4 $80-$550. BALANCE | hy-vee.com 63 062-069 Cycling_Ads_03.29 PMHEADHELMET USE HAS BEEN ESTIMATED T0 REDUCE THE ODDS OF HEAD INJURY BY SIZE IT RIGHT Bike helmets serve the most important role of any bike accessory you can buy. They can save your life. Although all helmets sold in the U.S. must meet government standards for safety, they do vary by style, size and shape. Prices range from $35 to more than $300. Higher prices get you less weight, more vents to keep you cool, aerodynamics and customizable fit. Whether it's a lightweight, well-vented helmet for hot days or one with a visor for shade and protection from tree limbs, look for a helmet that meets your specific needs. Bike helmets have a foam liner of expanded polystyrene (the material used in picnic coolers) under a rigid shell to reduce the impact of a crash. Never wear a helmet that was worn during a crash. Discard it and replace it with a new one. Any impact likely crushed some of the foam and possibly cracked the outer shell, compromising the effectiveness of the helmet even if the damage isn't visible.To select the right helmet, put one on your head without fastening the straps. The front of the helmet should be level and two-fingers- width above your eyebrows. Shake your head from side to side; the fit should feel similar to that of a baseball cap. Fasten the straps tightly. Wearing a bike helmet with loose straps is the same as not wearing a helmet at all. Each side strap should come to a point \u00bd inch or less under an earlobe. The chin strap should be about \u00bd inch below your chin when your mouth is closed. 50% 1. STAND OVER HEIGHT Measure your inseam minus the amount needed for clearance (1 to 2 inches). 2. SADDLE HEIGHT With the saddle level to the floor, ask someone to hold the bike upright. Sit on the saddle, hips level, one foot over the center of a pedal and in lowest position. Your knee should have a slight bend\u201427 to 37 degrees\u2014and your leg should be about 80 to 90 percent extended. Adjust the saddle as needed. 3. SADDLE SETBACK Ask someone to hold your bike upright. Sit on the saddle, hips level, one foot over the center of a pedal. The saddle setback position is correct when the knee is directly over the pedal spindle, mid stroke. Tip: Dangle a piece of string with a weight on the bottom next to your kneecap to check the plumb line. 4. UPPER BODY POSITION/ HANDLEBARS Your upper body position should be relaxed, shoulders squared, without straining the back or arms to reach the handlebars. If you need to stretch too far, the effective top tube\u2014the distance from the stem and head tubes\u2014may be too long. This is determined by sitting on the bike for proper fit. The most comfortable position for most road cyclists is when the torso and upper arm connect at a 90-degree angle and the hips form a 45-degree angle. You should have a slight bend in the elbows to maximize comfort and control. Other bikes, such as touring, mountain or road bikes allow the rider to sit more upright.Bikes need to fit the rider to be safe and to offer an efficient, injury-free workout and a comfortable ride. A professional bike fitting is the best option for determining bike size. The three things they'll look at are contact points: pedals, saddle and handlebars. Depending on the type of bike and manufacturer, sizes may vary. Consider these four measurements:MADE TO MEASURE hold your bike upright.

It's a missed deadline, failed contract, sick child at home. In small doses, acute stress is expected, but too much of it can lead to anger, anxiety, tension headache, jaw pain and digestive problems.Episodic Acute When acute stress compounds, migraines, hypertension, chest pain and other more serious symptoms can occur. Pockets of life become disordered and there is a continued state of chaos\u2014 you're always rushing, and you become aggressive, impatient, harried or hostile. Chronic This is grinding stress that goes on for months or years. It can be the stress of poverty, a dysfunctional family, or being trapped in an an unhappy marriage or a despised job. It can also stem from an early traumatic event that has not been dealt with. Chronic stress can lead to heart attack, stroke and death.Have you ever experienced a fight-or-flight response while driving? The answer is likely, yes, if you 've ever been cut off by another driver. Perceived threats or stressful situations can kick out hormones that compel you to fight or flee. Eventually, your body 's parasympathetic system even calms you down. Controlling stress is a matter of finding ways to relax. Instead of stirring up stress through the sympathetic system, send positive thoughts to your parasympathetic system\u2014and you'll be cool and collected. Dr. Anand Chockalingam\u2014a cardiologist at the University of Missouri Health Care and an associate professor at UM School of Medicine with a special interest in preventive cardiology\u2014 says there are many simple ways to deal with stress including, \"spending a few minutes in the woods or sharing a pleasurable, healthy meal with good, positive people. \" \"Patients have more control over their own health than they realize, \" Chockalingam says. \"Doctors and pills contribute only 20 to 30 percent to resolving chronic conditions. That means 70 to 80 percent of restoring a person's health is in their own hands. Positive outlook, confidence and trust play a crucial role. If people pay a little more attention to their lives, they can derive a lot of day-to-day benefits for their health.\" TAKING CONTROL ou 're not alone if you experience stress on the job. Sixty- one percent of us reported it last year, according to a \" Stress in America \" survey by the American Psychological Association. Prime culprits: big workloads, tight deadlines, little control over the work environment, perceived mistreatment by supervisors or coworkers, unclear job descriptions, restructuring and management changes. It doesn 't help that technology keeps us reachable at all times. A little goes a long way, as chronic stress can lead to gastrointestinal problems, insomnia, high blood pressure or heart disease. It can also lead to depression and harm personal relationships if you keep putting your job ahead of them. But stress is also the motivator that gets things done. How can we use the good side of stress to our advantage while relieving some of the pressure? It helps to understand your stress. Try strategies, large and small to deal with it, and find ways to be reminded that stress can help us grow.Y BALANCE | hy-vee.com 71 070-073 NinetoFive_03.28.indd 71 4/3/18 3:06 PMSources: Success Under Stress: Powerful Tools for Staying Calm, Con dent, and Productive When the Pressure's On, Sharon MelnickSTRESS TOOLS Control Yourself. This is the fundamental idea behind making stress your partner rather than your enemy. Professional athletes or successful business leaders face stress frequently, transforming tension into a focusing tool. How do they do it? They control what they can control. You can't stop someone who points out your shortcomings. You can control your own thoughts and observations about your work skills. Ignore the critic with a negative message. Control what you can control. Take a Cool Breath. You have a boss who is a screamer. Whenever you go into his or her office, you feel like wearing a protective helmet. Instead, when the boss goes negative, quietly and deeply, with your lips barely apart, draw air into your mouth. Then quietly exhale through your nose. Keep this up for a few minutes. Instead of a negative reaction, you'll soon feel a cooling sensation on your tongue. As you become calm, speak to your boss quietly and without rancor. He or she will likely chill out in response. HOW CAN I STOP GETTING STRESSED? THAT'S THE WRONG QUESTION. STRESS IS ALWAYS A MOMENT AWAY. THE QUESTION IS: HOW CAN I MAKE STRESS WORK FOR ME?

What triggers stress? Perhaps your team has an important meeting to close the big sale. The entire group is on edge. Although the others are nervously excited, you feel overwhelmed, inadequate and tense. Having counseled thousands who struggle with workplace stress, psychologist Sharon Melnick has seen this pattern repeatedly. She frequently speaks about stress at leading corporations, and wrote Success Under Stress: Powerful Tools for Staying Calm, Con dent, and Productive When the Pressure's On, a book on the topic. \"You're thinking: What's going on? I can't do this! Everything has to be perfect. What will this mean for me? There's fear, there's stress. This psychological response sets you up for how you will perform,\" Melnick says. Melnick shares how you can make stress work for you in \"Stress Tools ,\" right.Tell a Different Story. When leaders or workmates criticize skills, most people get stressed and defend themselves emotionally. But what if there's a kernel of truth in what's been said? Instead of dismissing the information, assess it honestly. If some part was true, write a different script. Don't be reactive and strike back; be resilient, examine yourself and tell yourself what you need to hear. Maybe it's not that your work is inadequate. Perhaps your pace is a little slow. Accept this allegation and work to improve. One day you might be commended for always hitting deadlines. Accept and Accomplish. Confidence, a key to success in the workplace, opens the door for you to become an innovative and high-performing employee who speaks up with worthy ideas. Perhaps you prepare first-rate reports, yet you avoid speaking in groups. You can accept this view and resign yourself to the lower ranks, or you can get actively involved in the community to develop stronger speaking skills. Go for it. 72 BALANCE | May 2018 070-073 NinetoFive_03.28.indd 72 4/2/18 6:34 PM BRAIN Stress is a response triggered in the brain by the release of the hormone cortisol, which signals the heart, lungs, immune system and skin to react to a stressful situation.

YOURTYPES OF KNOW MASSAGE ETIQUETTEBENEFITS RUN DEEP NICE TO BEKNEADED If you think of massage as a pampering day at the spa, reconsider. People rely on massage to reduce arthritis, neck and low back pain, aid digestion, make pregnancy more comfortable, and lower blood pressure, heart rate and anxiety\u2014 as well as to energize muscles before a workout and soothe them afterward. The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine reports that approximately 9 percent of Americans use massage, one of the most popular complementary therapies. American Massage Therapy Association reports that 72 percent of people surveyed claim the main reason for getting a massage is either medical or stress-related. Studies of the benefits of massage are few and results are often unclear; but because massage simply makes you feel good and is about as natural as you can get, it's easy to understand why it's so popular. Here's the rub: Studies suggest that pressing or stroking skin and underlying tissue can lower the body's production of the stress hormone cortisol while boosting production of the feel-good hormone serotonin. Studies are under way on the effects of massage on arthritis. A 2006 study at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey reports that 68 adults with osteoarthritis of the knee showed improved function and range of motion and less pain after receiving two Swedish massages a week on the knee area. Another study, in 2010, at the University of California, Los Angeles School of Medicine and the nearby Cedars-Sinai Medical Center found that participants' number of lymphocytes\u2014 part of the immune system\u2014increased after just one session of Swedish massage.

Q: WHAT ARE THE SIGNS OF A TYPICAL TENSION-TYPE HEADACHE? Q: HOW IS PAIN ASSOCIATED WITH TENSION HEADACHE DIFFERENT FROM MIGRAINE? Q: WHAT SYMPTOMS DO YOU SEE WITH HEADACHES THAT REQUIRE FURTHER EVALUATION?A: I rule out the remote possibility of a secondary headache disorder, which could point to a brain lesion, brain infection or cerebrovascular problem. A: The pain associated with a tension headache involves band-like pressure, typically in the mid or dull pain range, and isn't accompanied by other symptoms. A: More than just a headache, a migraine has associated nausea, throbbing pain, and sensitivity to light, noise and, often, smells and motion. A: These include numbness, tingling, weakness on one side, changes in vision, tremors, loss of balance, and confusion. Also fever, chills, weight loss or other systemic signs.Most know what it's like to su er from a headache\u2014a migraine, though, is a step beyond. Headaches, including migraines, are caused by overactivity of pain- sensitive structures in the head. These headaches are called primary because they aren't associated with serious underlying diseases or secondary causes like tumors or infection. Primary headaches can be triggered by chemical activity in the brain, the nerves and blood vessels surrounding the skull, and muscles in the head and neck. A migraine' s pain is more severe than other primary headaches, and it can cause nausea, dizziness and other symptoms. \"Right o the top, it's the physician's job to determine whether a patient has a primary headache disorder, the most common being tension headaches and migraines, and not rare secondary disorders\" such as a sinus infection or brain tumor, says Lynn Rankin, M.D., neurologist and headache and migraine specialist with UnityPoint Health in Des Moines, Iowa. Tension-type headache, or TTH\u2014the most common primary headache\u2014is described as pressure or tightness that feels like a band around the head, sometimes spreading into the neck. TTH headaches often begin in the teen years and a ect women more than men. The cause may be stress- related or associated with musculoskeletal problems in the neck. Most TTH episodes last a few hours, and can persist several days. Migraine\u2014the more severe form of primary BAD NEWS: MIGRAINE HEADACHES AFFECT NEARLY ONE OUT OF FOUR HOUSEHOLDS IN THE UNITED STATES. GOOD NEWS: YOU CAN REDUCE THE THROBBING PAIN THROUGH NONDRUG APPROACHES ALONG WITH APPROPRIATE MEDICATION. TENSION HEADACHES are the second most common illness worldwide, while MIGRAINES rank third. Up to 4% OF ADULTS worldwide have a headache or migraine 15 or more days a month. Migraines affect 12 percent of the U.S. population. AND WITH LYNN RANKIN, M.D., HEADACHE AND MIGRAINE SPECIALIST AT UNITYPOINT HEALTH\u2014DES MOINES, IOWAA Continues 79 4/3/18 5:25 PM90% of migraine sufferers have a family history of the illness. PREVENTION Prevention and treatment of headaches and migraine work hand- in-hand. \"Patients can take migraines under control to an extent by accessing resources to track migraines and look for patterns,\" Dr. Rankin says. Electronic apps, such as migrainebuddy.com, provide tools to gather valuable information to share with your physician. Keeping a diary helps identify specific migraine triggers\u2014food, beverages, exercise, routine, medications\u2014 as well as headache severity. Substances that can trigger a headache or migraine include chocolate, processed meats, artificial sweeteners, and cheese. Caffeinated and alcoholic food and drinks, especially red wine and champagne, are common triggers. Limit how much you consume or, perhaps, eliminate them from your diet. Lack of sleep or too much sleep can also cause migraines. Make sure to get 7 to 8 hours of sleep each night, and track your sleep patterns. For migraines, loud noises, flashing lights and sensory stimulation are common triggers, and challenging to avoid. Being aware of situations that affect you\u2014such as driving at night, watching movies, noisy clubs, crowded events, exposure to glare from the sun\u2014 might help you to avoid them. Also remember to give your eyes a rest from your computer screen or TV. Note visual or audio disturbances around you and, if you sense a migraine coming on, be prepared to exit the environment. MIGRAINES AND OTHER HEADACHES\u2014 A LEADING CAUSE OF OUTPATIENT AND EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS\u2014 ARE A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE AMONG WOMEN AGES 18 THROUGH 44.headache\u2014is a neurological disorder that affects 39 million men, women, and children in the U.S. \"A migraine is more than just a headache,\" Dr. Rankin says. \"The pain of a migraine is moderate to intense\u2014enough to affect daily activities. To work with a migraine probably means you're moving in slow motion.\" Sensitivity to light and sound is heightened as well, Dr. Rankin adds. \"A patient once gave me the example of her husband chewing celery across the room that was extremely annoying to her during a migraine. Or barking dogs that normally don't bother are really annoying.\" A migraine can also be accompanied by an \"aura, \" or an episode of changes in visual, sensory, speech or motor functions. These neurologic symptoms generally last less than an hour\u2014often just minutes. Some patients experience flashing lights for 15 minutes or fewer without accompanying pain of migraine. PREVENTIONQ: HOW EFFECTIVE ARE PREVENTIVE MEASURES FOR HEADACHES AND MIGRAINES? Q: WHAT LIFESTYLE CHANGES DO YOU RECOMMEND TO YOUR PATIENTS? Q: WHAT ABOUT DIET? WHAT DO YOU RECOMMEND TO HELP PREVENT HEADACHES? Q: WHAT IS A MEDICATION- OVERUSE HEADACHE, AND HOW CAN IT BE PREVENTED?A: Some factors involving treatment and lifestyle can prevent occasional migraines from becoming chronic, which affects about 2% of the population. They're the ones I tend to see. A: We discuss the importance of keeping a regular routine in terms of sleep, meals and exercise, and limiting caffeine to no more than one beverage per day. A: We talk about clean eating by avoiding dyes, preservatives, artificial sweeteners and processed foods. These measures can make a big impact in preventing headaches. A: We counsel patients not to take the medication more than two or three times per week. This is the threshold above which you develop rebound or overuse headaches.Continued from page 79 >> BALANCE | May 2018 80 078-083 AgainstTheGraine_Ads_3.28.indd 80 4/2/18 6:36 PMWORLDWIDE, MIGRAINESAFFECT MORE THAN10 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION AND ARE THE THIRD MOSTPREVALENT ILLNESS. The goal of migraine treatment is to stop the symptoms and prevent future painful attacks. If you or someone in your family has migraines, see a neurologist who is trained to treat headaches. After studying your medical history and symptoms, the doctor will likely perform a physical and neurological examination before making a diagnosis. Your doctor may also recommend additional tests to rule out other causes of pain if your condition is unusual, complex or suddenly becomes worse. Many medications are available for treating migraines. Some drugs used to treat other conditions are also effective for relieving or preventing a migraine. The medications used to treat migraines fall into two broad categories: Pain-relieving medications: Known as acute or abortive treatment\u2014these are taken during a migraine attack to stop symptoms.Preventive medications: Taken regularly, often daily, these drugs reduce the severity or frequency of migraines. The treatment plan your doctor develops depends on the frequency and severity of headaches, extent of disability the headaches cause and other medical conditions. TREAT MIGRAINESONE OUT OF FOUR WOMEN EXPERIENCE MIGRAINES, with 28 million women in the U.S. affected\u201485% of chronic migraine sufferers. Half experience more than one episode per month; 25% have four or more severe episodes per month. Migraines affect 12% of the U.S. population. Every 10 seconds, someone visits a hospital ER complaining of head pain. More than half of migraine sufferers are never diagnosed; the majority of migraine sufferers never seek medical treatment. \"Diet and lifestyle modifications can alleviate headaches and migraines, although medication management differs. In all headache types, prevention is important. Even for some patients who control every variable, they still have headaches, because they are genetically prone.\" \u2014 Dr. Rankin Most migraine sufferers experience episodes once or twice per month, but more than 4 million people in the U.S. experience chronic daily migraines.

FINAL IMAGE TK EAT SLEEP CLEANSE Vitamin A in orange and yellow produce, such as carrots and pumpkin , as well as in kale, helps maintain healthy skin and bone. Yellow and red bell peppers, berries and citrus fruits have vitamin C to protect skin- firming collagen, and it may prevent skin damage from UV rays. Tomatoes, rich in lycopene, may have skin cancer-preventing benefits, according to another study. Salmon, mackerel and other omega-3-rich fish may reduce skin scaling and dryness. During deep sleep, your body is in repair mode; it regenerates skin, muscle, blood and brain cells. If you're sleep deprived, your body can't produce new collagen and skin can't repair itself from sun exposure and other daytime stressors. The result is premature skin aging. The National Sleep Foundation recommends 7 to 9 hours of sleep each night.The American Academy of Dermatology recommends one 5- to 10-minute shower or bath per day with warm, not hot, water and gentle fragrance-free soap. Use only enough cleanser to remove dirt and oil. Pat dry (don't rub) with a towel and immediately add moisturizer . Ointments and creams are less irritating than lotions. Soothing ingredients include olive or jojoba oil, shea butter, glycerine, hyaluronic acid, lanolin and mineral oil . When shaving, first apply shaving cream, lotion or gel to lubricate skin.SLATHER UP! 15-50 RECOMMENDED SPF RANGE ANYTHING BEYOND 50 DOES NOT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE PROTECTIONSPF What does it stand for? Sun Protection Factor. It's a measure of how long it takes the sun to burn skin that's treated with sunscreen, compared to that which hasn 't. SPRAYS: Easy to apply CREAMS: Good for dry skin LOTIONS: Good for large areas, less greasy than creams GELS: Good coverage for skin that has a large amount of hair Avoid sun exposure between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., whatever the season (even on overcast days), because those are peak hours for ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Wear protective clothing, including pants, long sleeves, sunglasses and a wide-brimmed hat. For long days in the sun, consider laundry treatments that add UV protection to clothing for a specific number of washings. Apply sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 15, preferably 30 to 50, in a broad-spectrum sunscreen that protects against both UVA and UVB rays. UVA rays can cause skin wrinkling and age spots; UVB causes sunburn. Excessive exposure to either can cause skin cancer. Note: SPF beyond 50 does not greatly increase protection. Apply generously, one ounce (shot-glass or golf-ball size) over the entire body, 30 minutes before going outside. Reapply every two hours\u2014more if you're perspiring or swimming. Don't overlook ears, nose, back of neck, hands, tops of feet and hairline. 85 BALANCE | hy-vee.com 084-089 Skin Deep_Ads_04.03 BM.indd 85 4/3/18 62 5 7SUN CARE AT HY-VEE THE ANATOMY OF A SUNSCREEN BOTTLE SPF Sun Protection Factor, usually ranges from 15 (least protection) to 100.

No sunscreens are waterproof or sweatproof. If water resistant, label must say whether protection lasts for 40 minutes or 80 minutes while swimming or sweating. SPORT Not an FDA labeling term.

Some groups have warned there are worrisome properties in a few, including oxybenzone and avobenzone, including the ability to absorb through skin and potentially enter body tissue. However, both the FDA and the American Academy of Dermatology have said they are safe. In a statement last year, the AAD stated, \"Current scientific data does not support claims that sunscreen ingredients are toxic or a hazard to human health. Rather, evidence supports the benefits of applying sunscreen to minimize long-term damage to the skin from the sun 's harmful ultraviolet rays. \" WARNING SIGNS ABCDE 's of melanoma warning signs. Asymmetry: If you draw a line through your mole, it won't look even on both sides. Border: Moles with uneven borders that are notched or scalloped. Color: A normal mole has all one color. If it has color variation, it's suspicious. Moles that turn red, white or blue should also be examined for the possibility of melanoma. Diameter: Moles that are larger than 6 mm (pencil eraser) are more likely to contain melanoma. Evolving: If your mole changes in any way, it's suspicious. Normal moles do not change. Warning signs for basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma: Open sore that bleeds, oozes, crusts and/or doesn't heal Shiny bump or nodule, often pearly white or pink; can also be tan, black or brown Pinkish lesion with an indentation or ulceration in the middle and that won't heal White, yellowish or waxy lesion; often shiny and may resemble a scar Wart-like growth appears and sometimes bleedsS RESPONSES FROM MELISSA DIAMANTIS DARLING, M.D., AT MIDWEST DERMATOLOGY IN OMAHA, NEBRASKA Q: What are the different types of skin cancer? A: Basal cell carcinoma is the most common. It's usually a slow- growing, raised nodule that often crusts, ulcerates or bleeds. It's not considered life-threatening but can cause considerable disfigurement. Squamous cell carcinoma is another common form of skin cancer that advances rapidly. Malignant melanoma is a serious skin cancer that appears in moles or other pigmented cells of the skin. Q: Which is the most dangerous? A: Malignant melanoma, by far. It's extremely aggressive and, if not caught early, can spread to other parts of the body and cause death. Q: How is skin cancer treated? A: The first step is usually a biopsy. If the biopsy shows basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma, we examine to determine whether there is additional cancer in the skin. Often these cancers have roots under the lesion, and they must be removed entirely. If it is on the face, scalp or neck, or when the tumor has aggressive cells or is extra-large, we recommend a procedure called Mohs microscopic surgery. The surgeon excises a small section of skin surrounding the tumor and the tissue is examined microscopically during the surgical procedure. It is conservatively removed, small layer by small layer, until all skin edges are clear of cancer. This technique provides the highest known cure rate and has the added benefit of a good cosmetic outcome. Q: What about melanoma? How is it treated? A: Early melanomas with a low rate of growth may be treated with a wide excision, in the office of a dermatologist or under the care of an oncology surgeon. Advanced cases are referred to the care of a cancer specialist. Q: How can we know whether we have skin cancer ? A: Seeing your dermatologist yearly for a skin check is a good start. In addition, knowing the warning signs and conducting monthly skin self-checks will help you to recognize skin cancers early, when treatment is most effective.

The 2018 season offers a chance for the Lynx to win their first back-to-back championships. The team returns all five starters from 2017, including reigning MVP Sylvia Fowles. It hasn't always been trophies and confetti showers for the Lynx. Inconsistent performances resulted in rare playoff appearances from 1999 to 2010. The tide turned with the hiring of head coach Cheryl Reeve in 2010, a strong draft class and the signing of several veteran All-Stars. \"I was in my prime, [Rebekkah] Brunson was in her prime and Seimone [Augustus] was in her prime,\" says Lynx All-Star point guard Lindsay Whalen. \"Then we drafted Maya [Moore], once-in-a- generation player.\" Hy-Vee Partnership In November 2017, Hy-Vee announced a long-term partnership with the Minnesota Timberwolves, Minnesota Lynx and Iowa Wolves to be each team 's official grocery, pharmacy and floral partner. Under collective ownership, each team will focus on improving their respective communities, with the Timberwolves and Lynx focusing on fighting hunger and the Iowa Wolves teaming up with Hy-Vee's KidsFit.For the last seven years, the Minnesota Lynx have broken records and become the premier franchise in professional women 's basketball. This model franchise has won four championships and six conference titles since 2011, while winning nearly two-thirds of their games.

The ASPCA suggests to trim them before your dog's nails touch the ground when they walk. Slowly cut each nail at an angle until you see a circle in the nail. This indicates that you're nearing a blood vessel, known as the quick. After cutting, use an emery board to smooth sharp edges. A CLEAN CANINE The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) recommends bathing your dog at least once every three months. Begin with a thorough brushing of your pet to remove dead hair. Next, place them in a tub or sink with a few inches of lukewarm standing water and use a slow-spraying nozzle, hose or plastic container to wet your dog, never pouring water directly into eyes, ears or nose. Gently massage pet-specific shampoo with natural ingredients, like oatmeal or aloe vera, from front to back. Rinse thoroughly and carefully dry with a large towel. How often to brush depends on the length of your dog's hair. A boxer with a short coat may only need one brushing a week, while a longer- haired collie may need daily attention. Consistent brushing removes dirt and bacteria, prevents tangles and spreads natural oils.HAIR OF THE DOG NOT SOQUICKDOG DAYS boxer with a short coat brushing a week, while a longer- haired collie may need daily attention.

MCTs do contain an abundance of saturated fat, so keep an eye on the serving size. ANTI-INFLAMMATORY Inflammation, the body 's natural (and often painful) response to injury or infection, can wreak havoc on our bodies. Coconut oil contains another fatty acid called lauric acid, which lends a hand in fighting inflammation. GUT HEALTH MCTs in coconut oil aid in digestion, while its antimicrobial pro perties ward off bacteria that can lead to infection and irritation. WEIGHT LOSS A natural calorie burner, MCTs may boost metabolism by 5 percent within a 24-hour period, which adds up to significant fat loss over time. Don't expect miracles; the oil won't replace hard work and a healthful diet. SKIN AND HAIR SOLUTION The fatty acids in coconut oil are also good for your outsides. A daily application of this ultra-moisturizer can treat dry, cracked skin while reducing blemishes and prevent stretch marks and wrinkles. Coconut oil naturally contains an SPF of 4 to 5 and antioxidants that help block about 20 percent of harmful sunrays\u2014a super protector for hair and skin. 105 BALANCE | hy-vee.com 104-105 WhatsTrending_03.28 MF.indd 105 4/2/18 6:46 PM\u00a9Conagra Brands, In c.

The lack of oxygen during a stroke can damage or kill brain cells, reducing an individual's ability to perform actions controlled by the afflicted region. Strokes are often the result of unhealthy habits and high blood pressure. According to the Mayo Clinic, one of the most important actions you can take is lowering your blood pressure through exercise, stress management and limiting sodium, alcohol and tobacco.SIGNS OF A STROKE MANIFEST OUTWARDLY IN SEVERAL WAYS.
