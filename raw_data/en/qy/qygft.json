What Infanrix hexa is and what it is used for Infanrix hexa is a vaccine used to protect your child against six diseases: Diphtheria: a serious bacterial infection that mainly affects the airways and sometimes the skin. The airways become swollen cau sing serious breathing problems and sometimes suffocation. The bacteria also release a poison . This can cause nerve damage, heart problems, and even death. Tetanus : tetanus bacteria enter the body through cuts, scratches or wounds in the skin. Wounds that are more likely to get tetanus infection are burns, fractures, deep wounds or wounds that have soil, dust, horse manure or wood splinters in them . The bacteria release a poison . This can cause muscle stiffness, painful muscle spasms, fits and even death. The muscle spasms can be strong enough to cause bone fractures of the spine. Whooping cough (Pertussis ): a highly infectious illness that affects the airways . It causes severe coughing that may lead to problems with breathing. The coughing often has a \"whooping\" sound. The cough may last for one to two months or longer. Whooping cough can also caus e ear infections, chest infections ( bronchitis ) which may last a long time, lung infections ( pneumonia ), fits, brain damage and even death. Hepatitis B: is caused by the hepatitis B virus. It makes the liver swollen. The virus is found in body fluids suc h as in the vagina, blood, semen or spit (saliva ) of infected people. Polio : a viral infection. Polio is often only a mild illness . However, sometimes it can be very serious and cause permanent damage or even death. Polio can make the muscles unable to mo ve (paralysis ). This includes the muscles needed for breathing and walking. The arms or legs affected by the disease may be painfully twisted ( deformed ). Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) : can cause brain swelling (inflammation ). This can lead to serious problems such as mental slowness ( retardation ), cerebral palsy, deafness, epilepsy or partial 2 blindness. It can also cause swelling of the throat. This can cause death by suffocation. Less commonly, the bacteria can also infect the blood, heart, lu ngs, bones, joints, and tissues of the eyes and mouth. How Infanrix hexa works Infanrix hexa helps your child's body make its own protection (antibodies). This will protect your child against these diseases. As with all vaccines, Infanrix hexa may not ful ly protect all children who are vaccinated. The vaccine cannot cause the diseases that it protects your child from. 2. What you need to know before your child receives Infanrix hexa Infanrix hexa should not be given if your child is allergic to: - Infanrix hexa or any of the ingredient s of this vaccine (listed in section 6) . - formaldehyde. - neomycin or poly myxin (antibiotics). Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin , rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face or tongue. if your child has had an allergic reaction to any vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, hepatitis B, polio or Haemophilus influenzae type b. if your child has had problems of the nervous system within 7 days after previous vaccination with a vaccine against whooping cough if your child has a severe infection with a high temperature (over 38\u00b0C ). A minor infection such as a cold should not be a problem, but talk to your doctor first. Infanrix hexa should not be given if any of the above apply to your child. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or pharmacist before your child is given Infanrix hexa. Warnings and precautions Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before your child is given Infanrix hexa : if after previously having Infanrix hex a or another vaccine against whooping cough, your child had any problems, especially: - a high temperature (over 40\u00b0C) within 48 hours of vaccination - a collapse or \"shock -like\" state within 48 hours of vaccination - persistent crying lasting 3 hours or more within 48 hours of vaccination - fits with or without a high temperature within 3 days of vaccination if your child has an undiagnosed or progressive disease of the brain or epilepsy which is not controlled . After control of the disease the vaccine can be given . if your child has a bleeding problem or bruises easily if your child tends to have fits when they have a fever, or if there is a history of this in the family . if your child should become unresponsive or experience seizures (fits) after the vac cination, please contact your doctor immediately.

If any of the above apply to your child (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or pharmacist before your child is given Infanrix hexa. 3 Other medicines and Infanrix hexa Your doctor may ask you to give your child a medicine that lowers fever (such as paracetamol) before or immediately after Infanrix hexa is given. This can help to lower some of the side effects (febrile reactions) of Infanrix hexa.

This is a normal observation. The pre -filled syringe should be well shaken in order to obtain a homogeneous turbid white suspension. The vaccine is reconstituted by adding the ent ire contents of the pre -filled syringe to the vial containing the powder. The mixture should then be well shaken until the powder is completely dissolved prior to administration. The reconstituted vaccine appears as a slightly more cloudy suspension than the liquid component alone. This is a normal observation. The vaccine suspension should be inspected visually before and after reconstitution for any foreign particul ate matter and/or abnormal physical appearance. If either is observed, do not administer the vaccine. 7 Instructions for the pre -filled syringe Hold the syringe by the barrel, not by the plunger. Unscrew the syringe cap by twisting it anticlockwise. To attach the needle, connect the hub to the Luer Lock Adaptor and rotate a quarter turn clockwise until you feel it lock. Reconstitute the vaccine as described above. Do not pull the syringe plunger out of the barrel. If it happens, do not administer the vaccine.
