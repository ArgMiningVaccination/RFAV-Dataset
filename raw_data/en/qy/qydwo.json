Summary Paragraph As Malawi is approaching HIV epidemic control, there are still gaps in reaching men with HIV testing services. Men, especially those under 40 years of age, lag in case finding & treatment performance. As per the National HIV Strategic Plan (NSP) 2020-2025, adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) aged 15-24 years account for 25% of new HIV infections in Malawi and HIV incidence is eight times higher among AGYW at 0.40% than adolescent boys and young men at 0.05%. A strategic mix of effective HTS modalities at community levels is key to improve case identification among underserved and high-risk populations. Based on successful community-based HTS programs, PEPFAR Malawi will continue its targeted HTS support by deploying trained human resources, intensified site-level program mentorship and supervision, strengthening data analysis and use, and timely remediation. Key populations (KP) such as female sex workers (FSW) and men who have sex with men (MSM) have high HIV prevalence in Malawi and continued HIV & AIDS service provision is key to effectively control the epidemic. This NOFO's expected outcomes include increased access and demand for targeted community HTS for men, AGYW, and key populations; improved linkages to HIV prevention, treatment, and care services including referrals of exploited girls to relevant social services; and ensured access to comprehensive HIV prevention, care, and treatment services for KP, specifically, FSW, transgender persons (TG), and MSM. a.

Funding Opportunity Description 1. Background a. Overview As part of PEPFAR Malawi, CDC supports the NSP goal to end AIDS as a public health threat in Malawi by 2030. Among other program-specific objectives, the NSP 2020-2025 aims to improve HIV case finding among high-risk populations through using specific objectives and evidence-based innovative approaches. The 2020 Malawi Spectrum estimated that about 25% of all new infections occurred among AGYW and 20% among men aged 20-29 years; adults 30 years contributed to 35% of all new infections. According to the 2020 Malawi Spectrum estimates, HIV prevalence is very high overall among KP. Optima model epidemiological estimates for Malawi (2020) stated that HIV prevalence for KP at 55% and 7% among FSWs, and MSM, respectively. The Malawi program focuses on significant scale-up of routine HTS in health facilities and targeted community-based HTS for priority and key populations to reach the First 95 objective which aims at 95% of people living with HIV knowing their HIV status by 2030 The Malawi HTS program has scaled up its services to both facility and community levels. Over the years, the Ministry of Health (January-March 2021) report states that Malawi has reached 93% of the First 95 objective. Despite this achievement, there are still gaps to reach underserved populations such as men, populations with very high HIV prevalence such as female sex workers, and populations with high HIV incidence such as AGYW. To prevent further spread and acquisition of HIV infection among priority and key populations and to control the HIV epidemic further, targeted HIV interventions are needed. Expected outcomes of this NOFO include: Page 4 of 81 Increased access and demand for targeted community HTS for men, AGYW, and key populations Improved linkages to other HIV prevention, treatment, and care services Ensured access to comprehensive HIV prevention, care, and treatment services for key populations, specifically, FSW and MSM This NOFO will address gaps in the Malawi HIV program targeting priority (men and AGYW) and key populations. This NOFO will follow the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations on task shifting for HIV services to increase the human resource by implementing a dedicated HTS cadre referred to as HIV Diagnostic Assistant (HDA), peer KP educators/facilitators and appropriate linkages to health workers at the facility level. b. Statutory Authorities This program is authorized under Public Law 108-25 (the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Act of 2003) [22 U.S.C. 7601, et seq.] and Public Law 110-293 (the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008), and Public Law 113-56 (PEPFAR Stewardship and Oversight Act of 2013). The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) has called for immediate, comprehensive and evidence-based action to turn the tide of global HIV/AIDS. The overarching purpose of this NOFO is to fund activities to prevent or control disease or injury and improve health, or to improve a public health program or service. c. Healthy People 2030 N/A d. Other National Public Health Priorities and Strategies Under the leadership of the Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC), as part of PEPFAR, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (HHS/CDC) works with host countries and other key partners to assess the needs of each country and design a customized program of assistance that fits within the host nation's strategic plan and partnership framework in a manner consistent with the purposes of this NOFO. HHS/CDC focuses primarily on two or three major program areas in each country. Goals and priorities include the following: Achieving primary prevention of HIV infection through activities such as expanding confidential counseling and testing programs linked with evidence-based behavioral change and building programs to reduce mother-to-child transmission; Improving the care and treatment of HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and related opportunistic infections by improving STI management; enhancing laboratory diagnostic capacity and the care and treatment of opportunistic infections; interventions for intercurrent diseases impacting HIV infected patients including tuberculosis (TB); and initiating programs to provide anti-retroviral therapy (ART); Page 5 of 81 Strengthening the capacity of countries to collect, use, and share surveillance data and manage national HIV/AIDS programs by expanding HIV/STI/TB surveillance programs and strengthening laboratory support for surveillance, diagnosis, treatment, disease monitoring, and HIV screening for blood safety; and Developing, validating, and/or evaluating public health programs to inform, improve, and target appropriate interventions, as related to the prevention, care and treatment of HIV/AIDS, TB, and opportunistic infections. In an effort to ensure maximum cost efficiencies and program effectiveness, HHS/CDC also supports coordination with and among partners and the integration of activities that promote Global Health Initiative principles. As such, recipients may be requested to participate in the following programmatic activities: Implement a woman- and girl-centered approach; Increase impact through strategic coordination and integration; Strengthen and leverage key multilateral organizations, global health partnerships, and private sector engagement; Encourage country ownership and invest in country-led plans; Build sustainability through investments in health systems; Improve performance metrics, monitoring and evaluation and the quality of related data; and Promote research, development, and innovation to develop a body of knowledge, enhance awareness and increase the skills and abilities of stakeholders (research is not supported by this NOFO). PEPFAR defines national HIV epidemic control as the point at which the total number of new infections falls below the total number of deaths from all causes among HIV-infected individuals (the classic R0 to Ri approach to infectious diseases), with both declining. This definition of epidemic control does not suggest near-term elimination or eradication of HIV as may be possible with other infectious diseases, but rather suggests a decline of HIV-infected persons in a population, achieved through the reduction of new HIV infections when mortality among people living with HIV (PLHIV) is steady or declining, consistent with natural aging. Critically, however, a country will not be able to maintain epidemic control if program efforts are not sufficiently sustained and new infections are allowed to rebound or death rates to increase. Effective December 1, 2018 and continuing throughout the five-year project period established under this NOFO, in addition to the specific activities listed in the Strategies and Activities section of this NOFO, all CDC PEPFAR cooperative agreements resulting from this NOFO may address the following activities, where and when appropriate, that focus U.S. government resources and activities toward achieving and sustaining the HIV/AIDS epidemic: Optimize HIV testing and treatment strategies to reach undiagnosed populations living with HIV, especially young adults, men, and key populations (KP). These strategies may include or build upon traditional methods and activities related to outbreak detection, Page 6 of 81 investigation, and response. Responding to recent infections or ongoing patterns of transmission will be prioritized. Focus on prevention among children, adolescents, young adults, and members of vulnerable and key populations. Support surveillance activities and programs, along with information systems, that improve understanding of HIV epidemiology, remaining gaps, and informed future programming. Support efforts to maintain quality for laboratory systems and activities, including diagnostics and viral load measurement. Actively use epidemiologic, program, and financial/cost data to ensure implementation of high quality, cost-effective programs to improve partner performance and increase epidemiologic impact. Support country-led, sustainable programming by working with and implementing activities through indigenous partners, including faith communities and faith-based organizations (FBOs), HIV network organizations and community-based organizations (CBOs) directly servicing communities and populations at-risk and most affected by HIV to build local capacity. Strengthen policy and financial contributions by partner governments in the HIV/AIDS response. Support activities, interventions, and programs to find, treat, and prevent TB among PLHIV and to identify and treat HIV among people infected with TB. Support efforts to prevent, detect, respond, and treat infectious and non-infectious diseases that impact PLHIV and populations affected by HIV. Geographic prioritization may change over the course of the period of performance based on the burden of disease and changing program and PEPFAR priorities. If the scope of activities to be conducted by the recipient(s) of funds under this NOFO includes work with KP, the recipient(s) is expected to collaborate with KP organizations in the design and delivery of appropriate optimal and quality HIV services to KPs. In addition, PEPFAR is committed to protecting children from abuse, exploitation and neglect in order to decrease their vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. Consistent with underlying authorities, PEPFAR seeks to ensure that children and youth obtaining services through PEPFAR programming are also protected from abuse, exploitation, and neglect in CDC PEPFAR- supported programs. To that end, because activities to be funded under this NOFO may involve children or personnel coming into contact with children, Recipients of CDC PEPFAR funds agree to ensure compliance with host country and local child welfare and protection legislation or international standards, whichever gives greater protection, and with U.S. law, where applicable. Further, Recipients of CDC PEPFAR funding are strongly encouraged to: 1) have in place policies and procedures that prohibit recipient personnel from engaging in child abuse, exploitation, or neglect; 2) consider child safeguarding in project planning and implementation to determine potential risks to children that are associated with project activities and operations; 3) apply measures to reduce the risk of child abuse, exploitation, or neglect, including, but not limited to, Page 7 of 81 limiting unsupervised interactions with children; prohibiting exposure to pornography; and complying with applicable laws, regulations, or customs regarding the photographing, filming, or other image-generating activities of children; 4) promote child-safe screening procedures for personnel, particularly personnel whose work brings them in direct contact with children; and 5) have a process for ensuring that personnel and others recognize child abuse, exploitation, or neglect, report allegations, investigate and manage allegations, and take appropriate action in response to such allegations. It is also strongly encouraged that Recipients include the above provisions in any applicable code of conduct for its personnel implementing PEPFAR-funded activities. This NOFO is only for non-research activities supported by CDC. Recipients may not use funds for research. Certain activities that may require human subjects review due to institutional requirements but that are generally considered not to constitute research (e.g., formative assessments, surveys, disease surveillance, program monitoring and evaluation, field evaluation of diagnostic tests, etc.) may be funded through this mechanism. If research is proposed, the application will not be reviewed. For the definition of research, please see the CDC Web site at the following Internet address: https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/45- cfr-46/revised-common-rule-regulatory-text/index.html#46.102 e. Relevant Work This NOFO is a follow-on for CDC-RFA-GH17-1714, a cooperative agreement (CoAg) that increased utilization of HTS targeting priority and key populations such as men, AGYW, FSW, TG, and MSM using effective evidence-based delivery models. The ending cooperative agreement also established successful HIV-related prevention, treatment, and care services targeting AGYW and KP at the community level using standardized packages. Malawi's experience in successfully implementing HIV & AIDS programs using dedicated HTS cadre and KP peer educators/facilitators to increase the human resource contributed to the successful implementation of the cooperative agreement. This NOFO aligns with CDC Malawi's objectives that support the implementation of evidence-based and high-quality HIV & AIDS programs in the country. It builds on current CDC HTS program activities for priority populations, namely: AGYW and men; and KP HIV & AIDS services being implemented in the PEPFAR priority districts. In addition to the many initiatives the previous CoAg produced, it also created some valuable lessons. Lessons learned include but are not limited to: The use of dedicated peer cadres promotes successful implementation of KP prevention, treatment and care programs. Reaching men where they socialize with targeted HTS improves case identification amongst men. The lessons learned in the current CoAg will be considered for the NOFO and contribute to providing direction to address the gaps identified and continue the support of activities that are important to achieving the National HIV Strategy, PEPFAR Malawi Government priorities, and working toward the national goal of ending AIDS as a public health threat in Malawi by 2030. Page 8 of 81 To meet HTS, KP, and AGYW initiatives, CDC, through its implementing partners, has recruited and deployed HTS cadre of HDAs and KP peer educators/facilitators. Therefore, the recipient is expected to take over the training, supervision, mentorship, monitoring, and evaluation of HDAs and KP peer educators or facilitators in the CDC-supported districts to ensure uninterrupted service provision. The standard service provision ratios of different cadres should be considered by the applicant to determine its capacity and level of effort required; MSM = 1:20; TG = 1:20; and a minimum of 2 HDAs per catchment area. 2.

Collaborations a. With other CDC projects and CDC-funded organizations: The recipient will be expected to collaborate with other CDC funded implementing partners supporting HIV & AIDS direct service delivery activities. This might include also collaborating with faith-based and community-based structures/leaders. Collaborating with other CDC funded implementing partners will strengthen the quality of direct service delivery provision through sharing of best practices; improving data management and use; and strengthening already existing initiatives aimed at eliminating the HIV epidemic. b. With organizations not funded by CDC: The recipient will be expected to collaborate with other organizations not funded by CDC providing CBHTS and KP direct service delivery activities to avoid duplication of efforts. However, this collaboration will not be required unless agreed upon by the recipients on specific projects through respective District Health Support Services offices. The District Health Support Services offices will assist in coordinating and determining expected collaborations. Community gatekeepers and traditional leaders are key to program implementation. The recipient will be expected to work closely with them to gain community trust and create sense of ownership. Community gatekeepers and traditional leaders are also key in demand creation for Page 13 of 81 the services. The recipient will also be expected to collaborate with locally based KP led organizations which are very vital in reaching the hidden high risk KPs. Community Led Monitoring (CLM) will continuously evaluate the quality of services provided through this NOFO and provide feedback to the recipient. 2. Target Populations The target populations for this NOFO include men under the age of 40 years and AGYW for CBHTS. All KPs (e.g., MSM, TG, and FSW including their biological children) in targeted geographical areas will benefit from KP HIV package. Health care workers within respective catchment areas of project will also be trained in KP and AGYW appropriate health service packages ensuring that they are both adolescent/youth and KP appropriate. a. Health Disparities N/A iv. Funding Strategy Applicants to this NOFO are encouraged to apply to the Approximate Total Fiscal Year Funding/Average One Year Award Amount/Approximate Average Award amount. Applications must not exceed this amount. Component Funding: It is required that all PEPFAR-funded cooperative agreements be formulated for component funding. A component is a discrete set of activities with an associated budget. CDC will use component funding to provide funding for activities proposed in an application that received merit review but were not selected for funding in the initial award (i.e., at the onset of budget period 1) but may be funded at a later point in the budget period as programmatically necessary and as funding becomes available. Please review the following key points about component funding: Component funding must be setup at the time of the application. While preparing the application, applicants should review the expectations listed in the NOFO for Year 1 activities and group them under the anticipated components listed below. Only activities planned for Year 1 should be grouped into components; applicants do not need to group activities in the high-level plan for the subsequent years 2-5 of the award into components. Funding amounts and components for years 2-5 will be determined at continuation. Each component must be a discrete set of activities with an associated budget. Distinguishable component budget narratives are required. Setting up components based on time (i.e., quarterly) is an appropriate distinction of activities, provided activities are clearly outlined. Applicants should submit the anticipated components on an SF-424A form as part of their application which shows all components for the budget period. The amounts should exactly match what is being requested for funding. Each component has its own approved amount and cannot be funded above the established amount. The combined total of all components must total the requested amount. Page 14 of 81 If more than 4 components are proposed, multiple SF-424As will be needed. Applicants may include the first 4 components on one SF-424A form and the remaining components on a second SF-424A form. Applicants may download additional SF-424A forms and upload them as PDFs under \"Budget Narrative Attachment Form\" or \"Other Attachments Form.\" These should be clearly labeled for easy identification and included in the Table of Contents for the entire submission. If possible, applicants are encouraged to submit a separate budget justification for each component, but it is not a requirement. Applicants will not be deemed incomplete if separate budget justifications are not provided with the submission. A separate budget justification will ultimately be required for all components that are funded. Any component that is not funded at the time of a new award may be deemed \"Approved but Unfunded (ABU)\". There is no guarantee that all components will be funded in a budget period as ABU components are subject to the availability of funds and the underlying legal authority for the work. o Components may not be awarded in order. All ABU components are eligible to receive funding once (and if) funds become available. o If funding becomes available, multiple components can be funded through the same funding action (single NOA). o If funding is awarded for an amount less than the ABU component approved amount, it is not possible to fund the difference at a later time. Components can only be funded once. If, during the funding confirmation, the Program Office approves a budget that differs from what was submitted at the time of application (reflected in the budget markup), a revised budget may be required in addition to the technical review responses. If required, the revised budget is due within thirty (30) days of the start of the budget period. If required, technical review responses will also be due within thirty (30) days of the start of the budget period and must be submitted separately from revised budget applications. Future funding for ABU components will not be awarded until a revised budget, if required, is submitted and approved by CDC. Once components are awarded, funds cannot be redirected between components. However, funds may be redirected within a component between object class categories. It is critical to ensure accountability, transparency, and programmatic performance of all U.S. taxpayer dollars. When developing the annual work plan, please be advised that the annual Country Operational Plan (COP) guidance requires that CDC take decisive action if an implementing partner is underperforming programmatically during any quarter of a fiscal year. Applicants are encouraged to consider the following in the development of their budgets and budget narratives: For Year 1, CDC anticipates an Approximate Total Fiscal Year Funding/Average One Year Award Amount/Approximate Average Award of $3,500,000 with the below listed components: Component 1 - COP22 Q1 Targets/Activities; Component 2 - COP22 Q2 Targets/Activities; of 81 Component 3 Q3 Targets/Activities; Component 4 - COP22 Q4 Targets/Activities; - COP22 Additional Targets/Activities; Component 6 - Non-PEPFAR Emerging Public Health Priorities. Applicants must specify a descriptive title for each corresponding column shown on the SF- 424A, followed by the total (cumulative) in the column to the far right of the SF-424A. Applicants are encouraged to use the components listed above, but may propose alternative budget components so long as the general component funding guidance is followed. Funding provided under this NOFO is subject to the availability of funds. The total number of years for which federal support has been programmatically approved (project period) will be shown in the \"Notice of Award.\" This information does not constitute a commitment by the federal government to fund the entire period. All future year funding will be based on satisfactory programmatic progress and the availability of funds. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Funds: A recipient of a grant or cooperative agreement awarded by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) with funds made available under the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2020 (P.L. 116-123); the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, 2020 (the \"CARES Act\") (P.L. 116-136); the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act (P.L. 116-139); and/or the Consolidated Appropriations Act and the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplement Appropriations Act, 2021 (P.L. 116-260) and/or the American Rescue Plan of 2021 [P.L. 117-2] agrees, as applicable to the award, to: 1) comply with existing and/or future directives and guidance from the Secretary regarding control of the spread of COVID-19; 2) in consultation and coordination with HHS, provide, commensurate with the condition of the individual, COVID-19 patient care regardless of the individual's home jurisdiction and/or appropriate public health measures (e.g., social distancing, home isolation); and 3) assist the United States Government in the implementation and enforcement of federal orders related to quarantine and isolation. In addition, to the extent applicable, Recipient will comply with Section 18115 of the CARES Act, with respect to the reporting to the HHS Secretary of results of tests intended to detect SARS -CoV -2 or to diagnose a possible case of COVID -19. Such reporting shall be in accordance with guidance and direction from HHS and/or CDC. HHS laboratory reporting guidance is posted at: https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/covid-19-laboratory-data-reporting- guidance.pdf . Further, consistent with the full scope of applicable grant regulations (45 C.F.R. 75.322), the purpose of this award, and the underlying funding, the recipient is expected to provide to CDC copies of and/or access to COVID-19 data collected with these funds, including but not limited to data related to COVID-19 testing. CDC will specify in further guidance and directives what is encompassed by this requirement. This award is contingent upon agreement by the recipient to comply with existing and future Page 16 of 81 guidance from the HHS Secretary regarding control of the spread of COVID-19. In addition, recipient is expected to flow down these terms to any subaward, to the extent applicable to activities set out in such subaward. b. Evaluation and Performance Measurement i. CDC Evaluation and Performance Measurement Strategy CDC expects that routine performance data is reviewed, cleaned, and used for program management. To this effect, the recipient should hold regular review meetings to discuss performance and use data in program quality improvement activities. Recipients should allocate funds made available under this NOFO for both evaluation activities and performance monitoring. While the final funding amount will be agreed upon by both CDC and the recipient, a minimum of 5% of funds should be allocated for monitoring activities and 5% of funds used for evaluation activities. These are estimates for the total funding over the 5- year project. PERFORMANCE MONITORING Performance measures will include both PEPFAR (MER) and non-MER indicators. The recipient will be responsible for reporting on but not limited to the MER indicators listed below; applicants should propose additional relevant PEPFAR MER and non-MER indicators as part of their initial Evaluation and Performance Measurement Strategy. Applicants may access MER Guidance and resource materials at the following link (copy/paste into web browser to access): https://datim.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000084446-MER-Indicator-Reference-Guides . Targets and Reporting Frequency Illustrative indicators, targets, and reporting frequencies corresponding to Year 1 of the NOFO are shown below. Unless otherwise indicated, the reporting periods for MER indicators will mirror the PEPFAR MER indicator reporting frequency (quarterly, semi-annually, and annually). Targets and reporting frequencies may be adjusted, or new targets identified in subsequent years based on implementation of HIV/AIDS epidemic control strategies and program priorities. Any gaps or unmet needs not fulfilled in the first year will affect the targets of the subsequent years. Additional information regarding MER reporting is included in the PEPFAR MER 2.0 (v2.5) guidance. PEPFAR MER Process and Outcome Measures: HTS_SELF : Number of Reporting Frequency: Quarterly] HTS_TST: Number of individuals who received HIV Testing Services (HTS) and received their test results: [Target: 6715, Reporting Frequency: Quarterly] HTS_TST_POS: Number of individuals who received HIV Testing Services (HTS) and received their test results [Target: 1047 , Reporting Frequency: Quarterly].

Sample Evaluation Topics: Barriers and facilitators for referral of HIV negative KP to PrEP services [Outcome Evaluation] Average time for individual KP to complete designated service package [Process Evaluation] Evaluation Data Sources: Data sources may include registers, tally sheets, electronic and paper patient records, partner progress reports, focus groups, in-depth interviews, surveys and other program monitoring tools. Dissemination of Evaluation Results: Dissemination channels may include local and international conferences and forum abstract presentations, conference poster displays, manuscripts, bulletins, reports, presentations to technical working groups and stakeholder meetings, and other approved products in print and electronic media. The primary intended users of evaluation results and findings will be the wider program stakeholders. All evaluation reports will be publicly available on PEPFAR resource sites. CDC and stakeholders will use overall evaluation findings during the five-year NOFO period to share and implement key recommendations to strengthen program implementation and effectiveness, sustainability, and continued program improvement upon completion of the award. Recipients should plan to conduct an economic evaluation or costing analysis during the COP or program review processes once during the award project period to determine: Cost and/or unit costs, and cost drivers of interventions or activities Cost-effectiveness of interventions or activities Recipients will receive advance notice and guidance about conducting this activity and how to allocate funds to conduct a cost analysis or economic evaluation. Evaluations and strategy should align with national, PEPFAR, and agency requirements and priorities, and will be reviewed and may require approval as part of the Country Operational Plan (COP). As such, the example evaluation topics listed in this NOFO may be amended based on feedback from OGAC during the annual COP review process. ii. Applicant Evaluation and Performance Measurement Plan Applicants must provide an evaluation and performance measurement plan that demonstrates how the recipient will fulfill the requirements described in the CDC Evaluation and Performance Measurement and Project Description sections of this NOFO. At a minimum, the plan must describe: Page 19 of 81 How the applicant will collect the performance measures, respond to the evaluation questions, and use evaluation findings for continuous program quality improvement. How key program partners will participate in the evaluation and performance measurement planning processes. Available data sources, feasibility of collecting appropriate evaluation and performance data, and other relevant data information (e.g., performance measures proposed by the applicant) Plans for updating the Data Management Plan (DMP) as new pertinent information becomes available.

CDC Monitoring and Accountability Approach Monitoring activities include routine and ongoing communication between CDC and recipients, site visits, and recipient reporting (including work plans, performance, and financial reporting). Consistent with applicable grants regulations and policies, CDC expects the following to be included in post-award monitoring for grants and cooperative agreements: Tracking recipient progress in achieving the desired outcomes. Ensuring the adequacy of recipient systems that underlie and generate data reports. Creating an environment that fosters integrity in program performance and results. Monitoring may also include the following activities deemed necessary to monitor the award: Ensuring that work plans are feasible based on the budget and consistent with the intent of the award. Ensuring that recipients are performing at a sufficient level to achieve outcomes within stated timeframes. Working with recipients on adjusting the work plan based on achievement of outcomes, evaluation results and changing budgets. Monitoring performance measures (both programmatic and financial) to assure satisfactory performance levels. Monitoring and reporting activities that assist grants management staff (e.g., grants management officers and specialists, and project officers) in the identification, notification, and management of high-risk recipients. f. CDC Program Support to Recipients If funded, a cooperative agreement, as defined by the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act of 1977 (P.L. 95-224, 31 USC 6301 et seq.), will be used as the funding mechanism to award funds. CDC will have substantial programmatic involvement after the award is made. Substantial involvement is in addition to all post-award monitoring, technical assistance, and performance Page 21 of 81 reviews undertaken in the normal course of stewardship of federal funds and is not intended to gain stricter controls. CDC may coordinate, facilitate, collaborate, and/or intervene to programmatically effectuate performance under the award, consistent with applicable law, regulations, and the terms of this NOFO. The substantial involvement responsibilities enumerated in this NOFO and any additional substantial involvement responsibilities will be used to support the purposes of this NOFO. Under a cooperative agreement, CDC is responsible for normal oversight and monitoring activities. Examples of normal oversight and monitoring activities are listed below: 1. Organize an orientation meeting with the recipient for a briefing on applicable U.S. Government, HHS/CDC, and PEPFAR expectations, regulations, and key management requirements, as well as report formats and contents. The orientation could include meetings with staff from HHS agencies and OGAC. 2. Review and approve recipient's annual work plan and detailed budget, as part of the PEPFAR COP review and approval process, managed by OGAC. 3. Review and approve the recipient's monitoring and evaluation plan, including for compliance with the strategic information guidance established by OGAC. 4. Meet on a regular basis with the recipient to assess expenditures in relation to approved work plan and modify plans as necessary. 5. Meet on a quarterly basis with the recipient to assess quarterly technical and financial progress reports and modify plans as necessary. 6. Meet on an annual basis with the recipient to review annual progress report for each U.S. Government Fiscal Year, and to review annual work plans and budgets for the subsequent year, as part of the PEPFAR COP review and approval process, managed by OGAC. 7. Provide technical oversight for all activities under this award. Above and beyond the normal oversight and monitoring examples, CDC's substantial involvement includes, but is not limited to, the following activities: 1. Involvement in the review and selection of key personnel and/or post-award sub- contractors and/or sub-recipients to be involved in the activities performed under this agreement. This is solely limited to reviewing and making recommendations as necessary to the process used by the recipient to select key personnel and/or post-award sub- contractors and/or sub-recipients to be involved in the activities performed under this agreement, as part of the PEPFAR COP review and approval process, managed by OGAC. 2. Provide technical assistance, as mutually agreed upon or as may be necessary based on performance and revise annually work plans in concert with the recipient during validation of the first and subsequent annual work plans. This could include providing expert technical assistance and targeted training activities in specialized areas, such as strategic information, project management, and confidential counseling and testing. 3. Provide appropriate in-country administrative support to help the recipient meet U.S. Government financial and reporting requirements approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Page 22 of 81 4. Collaborate with the recipient on designing and implementing the activities listed above, including, but not limited to: the provision of technical assistance to develop program activities, data management and analysis, quality assurance, the presentation and possibly publication of program results and findings, and the management and tracking of finances. 5. Provide technical assistance or advice on any data collections on 10 or more people that are planned or conducted by the recipient. Data collections funded under this award, in particular where CDC staff will be or are approving, directing, conducting, managing, or owning data, must undergo OMB project determinations by CDC and may require OMB Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA) clearance prior to the start of the project. 6. Provide continuous consultation and scientific and technical assistance based on appropriate HHS/CDC and OGAC documents to promote the use of best practices known at the time. 7. Assist the recipient in developing and implementing quality-assurance criteria and procedures. 8. Facilitate and/or participate in in-country planning and review meetings for technical assistance activities. 9. Conduct site visits through the Site Improvement through Monitoring System (SIMS), in compliance with PEPFAR requirements, to monitor and evaluate clinical and community service delivery site capacity to provide high-quality HIV/AIDS services in all program areas and 'above-site' capacity to perform supportive or systemic functions, by assessing and scoring key program area elements of site performance and collaborating strategically with the recipient on identified gaps and continuous quality improvement, which might include more thorough data quality or service quality assessments as indicated. 10. Coordinate with the recipient to ensure the recipient's Evaluation and Performance Measurement Plan is aligned with the strategic information guidance established by OGAC and other HHS/CDC requirements, including PEPFAR's Monitoring, Evaluation, and Reporting (MER) strategy, PEPFAR's Evaluation Standards of Practice (ESoP), and CDC's Data for Partner Monitoring Program (DFPM). 11. Provide ethical reviews in order to direct and/or facilitate desired changes, as necessary, for evaluation activities, including from HHS/CDC headquarters. Evaluations can be process, outcome, or economic. A. Process Evaluation: measures how the intervention was delivered, what worked/did not, differences between the intended population and the population served, and access to the intervention. B. Outcome Evaluation: determines effects of intervention in target population(s) (e.g., change in knowledge, attitudes, behavior, capacity, etc.). C. Economic Evaluation: justifies the investment, and determines the efficiency and economic impact of interventions. 12. Supply the recipient with protocols for related evaluations. As described in current COP guidance, quarterly performance thresholds should be monitored throughout the year. In addition to CDC's substantial involvement, the agency will conduct normal oversight and monitoring activities to effectuate program performance. Page 23 of 81 Underperformance in achieving established programmatic targets may result in corrective action being taken as outlined in current COP guidance. Corrective action may include the implementation of a Target Improvement Plan (TIP) and/or a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) to assist recipients with meeting established programmatic targets. The agency will assess recipients' level of effort, including any preventative action taken, and any extenuating circumstances internal and external to the recipient when considering a TIP and/or CAP. Be advised that any changes made to the COP guidance related to substantial involvement and the monitoring of quarterly and annual performance PEPFAR targets will become effective and implemented in accordance with the revised/new COP guidance. These changes may impact the agency's substantial involvement and/or how it ensures the achievement of recipients' quarterly and annual PEPFAR targets. The use of a TIP and/or CAP does not replace or reduce recipient's requirement to comply with Federal regulations promulgated in 45 CFR \u00a7 75.371. If a recipient fails to comply with Federal statutes, regulations or the terms and conditions of its cooperative agreement, CDC or the pass- through entity may impose additional conditions, as described in 45 CFR \u00a7 75.207. If CDC or the pass-through entity determines that noncompliance cannot be remedied by imposing additional conditions, CDC or the pass-through entity may take one or more actions legally available. B.

The budget must include: Page 34 of 81 Salaries and wages Fringe benefits Consultant costs Equipment Supplies Travel Other categories Contractual costs Total Direct costs Total Indirect costs Indirect costs could include the cost of collecting, managing, sharing and preserving data. Indirect costs on grants awarded to foreign organizations and foreign public entities and performed fully outside of the territorial limits of the U.S. may be paid to support the costs of compliance with federal requirements at a fixed rate of eight percent of MTDC exclusive of tuition and related fees, direct expenditures for equipment, and subawards in excess of $25,000. Negotiated indirect costs may be paid to the American University, Beirut, and the World Health Organization. If applicable and consistent with the cited statutory authority for this announcement, applicant entities may use funds for activities as they relate to the intent of this NOFO to meet national standards or seek health department accreditation through the Public Health Accreditation Board (see: http://www.phaboard.org ). Applicant entities to whom this provision applies include state, local, territorial governments (including the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianna Islands, American Samoa, Guam, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau), or their bona fide agents, political subdivisions of states (in consultation with states), federally recognized or state-recognized American Indian or Alaska Native tribal governments, and American Indian or Alaska Native tribally designated organizations. Activities include those that enable a public health organization to deliver public health services such as activities that ensure a capable and qualified workforce, up-to-date information systems, and the capability to assess and respond to public health needs. Use of these funds must focus on achieving a minimum of one national standard that supports the intent of the NOFO. Proposed activities must be included in the budget narrative and must indicate which standards will be addressed. Vital records data, including births and deaths, are used to inform public health program and policy decisions. If applicable and consistent with the cited statutory authority for this NOFO, applicant entities are encouraged to collaborate with and support their jurisdiction's vital records office (VRO) to improve vital records data timeliness, quality and access, and to advance public health goals. Recipients may, for example, use funds to support efforts to build VRO capacity Page 35 of 81 through partnerships; provide technical and/or financial assistance to improve vital records timeliness, quality or access; or support vital records improvement efforts, as approved by CDC. Applicants must name this file \"Budget Narrative\" and upload it as a PDF file at www.grants.gov . If requesting indirect costs in the budget, a copy of the indirect cost-rate agreement is required. If the indirect costs are requested, include a copy of the current negotiated federal indirect cost rate agreement or a cost allocation plan approval letter for those Recipients under such a plan. Applicants must name this file \"Indirect Cost Rate\" and upload it at www.grants.gov . 13. Funds Tracking Proper fiscal oversight is critical to maintaining public trust in the stewardship of federal funds. Effective October 1, 2013, a new HHS policy on subaccounts requires the CDC to set up payment subaccounts within the Payment Management System (PMS) for all new grant awards. Funds awarded in support of approved activities and drawdown instructions will be identified on the Notice of Award in a newly established PMS subaccount (P subaccount). Recipients will be required to draw down funds from award-specific accounts in the PMS. Ultimately, the subaccounts will provide recipients and CDC a more detailed and precise understanding of financial transactions. The successful applicant will be required to track funds by P-accounts/sub accounts for each project/cooperative agreement awarded. Applicants are encouraged to demonstrate a record of fiscal responsibility and the ability to provide sufficient and effective oversight. Financial management systems must meet the requirements as described 45 CFR 75 which include, but are not limited to, the following: Records that identify adequately the source and application of funds for federally-funded activities. Effective control over, and accountability for, all funds, property, and other assets. Comparison of expenditures with budget amounts for each Federal award. Written procedures to implement payment requirements. Written procedures for determining cost allowability. Written procedures for financial reporting and monitoring. 14. Pilot Program for Enhancement of Employee Whistleblower Protections Pilot Program for Enhancement of Employee Whistleblower Protections: All applicants will be subject to a term and condition that applies the terms of 48 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) section 3.908 to the award and requires that recipients inform their employees in writing (in the predominant native language of the workforce) of employee whistleblower rights and protections under 41 U.S.C. 4712. 15. Copyright Interests Provisions This provision is intended to ensure that the public has access to the results and accomplishments of public health activities funded by CDC. Pursuant to applicable grant regulations and CDC's Public Access Policy, Recipient agrees to submit into the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Manuscript Submission (NIHMS) system an electronic version of the final, peer-reviewed manuscript of any such work developed under this award upon acceptance for publication, to be Page 36 of 81 made publicly available no later than 12 months after the official date of publication. Also at the time of submission, Recipient and/or the Recipient's submitting author must specify the date the final manuscript will be publicly accessible through PubMed Central (PMC). Recipient and/or Recipient's submitting author must also post the manuscript through PMC within twelve (12) months of the publisher's official date of final publication; however the author is strongly encouraged to make the subject manuscript available as soon as possible. The recipient must obtain prior approval from the CDC for any exception to this provision. The author's final, peer-reviewed manuscript is defined as the final version accepted for journal publication, and includes all modifications from the publishing peer review process, and all graphics and supplemental material associated with the article. Recipient and its submitting authors working under this award are responsible for ensuring that any publishing or copyright agreements concerning submitted articles reserve adequate right to fully comply with this provision and the license reserved by CDC. The manuscript will be hosted in both PMC and the CDC Stacks institutional repository system. In progress reports for this award, recipient must identify publications subject to the CDC Public Access Policy by using the applicable NIHMS identification number for up to three (3) months after the publication date and the PubMed Central identification number (PMCID) thereafter. 16.

The term \"motivate\", as it relates to family planning assistance, must not be construed to prohibit the provision, consistent with local law, of information or counseling about all pregnancy options. o No funds made available under this award will be used to pay for any biomedical research which relates, in whole or in part, to methods of, or the performance of, abortions or involuntary sterilizations as a means of family planning. Epidemiologic or descriptive research to assess the incidence, extent or consequences of abortions is not precluded. Prostitution and Sex Trafficking A standard term and condition of award will be included in the final notice of award; all recipients will be subject to a term and condition that none of the funds made available under this award may be used to promote or advocate the legalization or practice of prostitution or sex trafficking. In addition, non-U.S. nongovernmental organizations will also be subject to an additional term and condition requiring the organization's opposition to the practices of prostitution and sex trafficking. Any enforcement of this provision is subject to courts' orders in Page 39 of 81 Alliance for Open Society International v. USAID (See, e.g., S.D.N.Y. 05 Civ. 8209, Orders filed on January 30, 2015 and June 6, 2017, granting permanent injunction). Trafficking in Persons Provision No contractor or sub-recipient under this Agreement that is a private entity may, during the period of time that the award is in effect: o engage in trafficking in persons, as defined in the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress, and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children, supplementing the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime; o procure any sex act on account of which anything of value is given to or received by any person; or o use forced labor in the performance of this award. If HHS/CDC determines that there is a reasonable basis to believe that any private party contractor or sub-recipient has violated paragraph 1 of this section or that an employee of the contractor or sub-recipient has violated such a prohibition where that the employee's conduct is associated with the performance of this award or may be imputed to the contractor or sub-recipient, HHS/CDC may, without penalty, (i) require the Recipient to terminate immediately the contract or sub-award in question or (ii) unilaterally terminate this Agreement in accordance with the termination provision. For purposes of this provision, \"employee\" means an individual who is engaged in the performance in any part of the Project as a direct employee, consultant, or volunteer of any private party contractor or sub-recipient. The recipient must include in all sub-agreements, including sub-awards and contracts, a provision prohibiting the conduct described in sub-section a by private party sub- recipients, contractors, or any of their employees. Prohibition on Assistance to Drug Traffickers HHS/CDC reserves the right to terminate assistance to, or take other appropriate measures with respect to, any participant approved by HHS/CDC who is found to have been convicted of a narcotics offense or to have been engaged in drug trafficking as defined in 22 CFR Part 140. The Recipient agrees not to disburse, or sign documents committing the Recipient to disburse funds to a sub-recipient designated by HHS/CDC (\"Designated Sub-recipient\") until advised by HHS/CDC that: (1) any United States Government review of the Designated Sub-recipient and its key individuals has been completed; (2) any related certifications have been obtained; and (3) the assistance to the Designated Sub-recipient has been approved. The Recipient shall insert the following clause, or its substance, in its agreement with the Designated Sub-recipient: o The Recipient reserves the right to terminate this Agreement or take other appropriate measures if the [Sub-recipient] or a key individual of the [Sub- recipient] is found to have been convicted of a narcotic offense or to have been engaged in drug trafficking as defined in 22 CFR Part 140.

Using PEPFAR funds for Implementing Partners (IPs) and Partner Government Officials IPs are required to notify their Project Officer immediately upon abstract acceptance. Once accepted, IPs are required to submit a written justification to their Project Officer stating the rationale for seeking support to attend the conference. IPs with accepted oral posters or oral abstracts for presentations that give clear attribution to PEPFAR may be authorized to use PEPFAR funds for travel providing that funds are available for travel. Funds for travel must be drawn from an existing agreement with the IP and not from PEPFAR country program management and operations budget. IPs must obtain prior approval from their respective Project Officer for participation and on availability and use of funds. PEPFAR partner government officials who wish to attend any large conference using PEPFAR funds must submit requests to the Project Officer, who will work with this PEPFAR Coordination office in-country, or to the designated PEPFAR Point of Contact in countries without Coordinators. Final decisions will be made in collaboration with the PEPFAR Deputy Principals and responses will be circulated to Post. Project Officer prior approval is also required for registration fees for virtual scientific Page 43 of 81 conference attendance for IPs with accepted oral posters or oral abstracts for presentations that give clear attribution to PEPFAR, which may be authorized if funds are available. Please note that use of cooperative agreement funds to attend scientific conferences by non-presenters and non-oral poster presenters is not authorized, except by Partner Government Officials with approval of the PEPFAR Deputy Principals. Requirements for Voluntary Family Planning Projects A family planning project must comply with the requirements of this paragraph. A project is a discrete activity through which a governmental or nongovernmental organization or Public International Organization (PIO) provides family planning services to people and for which funds obligated under this award, or goods or services financed with such funds, are provided under this award, except funds solely for the participation of personnel in short-term, widely attended training conferences or programs. (3) Service providers and referral agents in the project must not implement or be subject to quotas or other numerical targets of total number of births, number of family planning acceptors, or acceptors of a particular method of family planning. Quantitative estimates or indicators of the number of births, acceptors, and acceptors of a particular method that are used for the purpose of budgeting, planning, or reporting with respect to the project are not quotas or targets under this paragraph, unless service providers or referral agents in the project are required to achieve the estimates or indicators. (4) The project must not include the payment of incentives, bribes, gratuities or financial rewards to (i) any individual in exchange for becoming a family planning acceptor, or (ii) any personnel performing functions under the project for achieving a numerical quota or target of total number of births, number of family planning acceptors, or acceptors of a particular method of contraception. This restriction applies to salaries or payments paid or made to personnel performing functions under the project if the amount of the salary or payment increases or decreases based on a predetermined number of births, number of family planning acceptors, or number of acceptors of a particular method of contraception that the personnel affect or achieve. (5) A person must not be denied any right or benefit, including the right of access to participate in any program of general welfare or health care, based on the person's decision not to accept family planning services offered by the project. The project must provide family planning acceptors comprehensible information about the health benefits and risks of the method chosen, including those conditions that might render the use of the method inadvisable and those adverse side effects known to be consequent to the use of the method. This requirement may be satisfied by providing information in accordance with the medical practices and standards and health conditions in the country where the project is conducted through counseling, brochures, posters, or package inserts. o The recipient must notify CDC when it learns about an alleged violation in the requirements for voluntary family planning projects described in paragraphs (3), (4), or (5), above. o The recipient must investigate and take appropriate corrective action, if necessary, when it learns about an alleged violation and must notify CDC about violations in Page 44 of 81 a project affecting a number of people over a period of time that indicate there is a systemic problem in the project. o The recipient must provide CDC such additional information about violations as CDC may request. Monitoring and Evaluation Section (SIMS) HHS/CDC or its designee will also undertake monitoring and evaluation of the defined activities within this award. The recipient must ensure reasonable access by HHS/CDC or its designee to all necessary sites, documentation, individuals and information to monitor, evaluate and verify the appropriate implementation of the activities conducted under the award and use of HHS/CDC funding under this award and must require a provision to this effect in all sub-awards or contracts financed by funds under this Agreement. Where applicable, this includes support for, and response to, activities associated with the Site Improvement through Monitoring System. Monitoring Reporting and Evaluation CDC programs must ensure that recipient's Evaluation and Performance Measurement Plan is aligned with the strategic information guidance established by OGAC and other HHS/CDC requirements, including PEPFAR's Monitoring, Evaluation, and Reporting (MER) strategy and CDC's Data for Partner Monitoring Program (DFPM). All evaluations conducted with PEPFAR funds must adhere to planning and reporting requirements as outlined in the PEPFAR ESoP including posting a final evaluation report detailing adherence to all evaluation standards on a publicly accessible website within 90 days of completion. https://datim.zendesk.com/hc/en- us/article_attachments/360040023292/PEPFAR_evaluation_standards_of_practice_v3.1_Octobe r_2019.pdf . Restrictions Pending Review of Proposed Data Collections for PEPFAR Awards All plans for data collection from persons or personal records and for laboratory specimen collection and testing that are expected to result in public reports will require protocols for technical review and review of institutional human subjects protection considerations by CDC. Funds for implementing these activities will be restricted until all necessary institutional protocol approvals have been obtained. Funds for preparatory activities (e.g., protocol development, training, equipment, reagents, and site preparation) may be provided prior to protocol approval. To facilitate the early availability of funding, the budget and narrative should clarify which activities are preparatory. Reference materials are available to recipients to assist with protocol submission and approval requirements by contacting the awarding CDC country office. Applicants to this NOFO may also request these materials by sending an email request to pepfarfoas@cdc.gov . Data collection protocols required for release of human subjects funding restrictions must be submitted to the DGHT Science Office within 6 months of notification of such restrictions, but no later than the end of the first budget year. Requests for exceptions to these deadlines will need to be submitted in writing to the Grants Management Officer. All protocol approvals should be obtained no later than the end of the subsequent budget period after the award or continuation has been made, provided that the Recipient has not been granted an exception to the deadlines specified above. Page 45 of 81 17. Data Management Plan As identified in the Evaluation and Performance Measurement section, applications involving data collection or generation must include a Data Management Plan (DMP) as part of their evaluation and performance measurement plan unless CDC has stated that CDC will take on the responsibility of creating the DMP. The DMP describes plans for assurance of the quality of the public health data through the data's lifecycle and plans to deposit the data in a repository to preserve and to make the data accessible in a timely manner.

Page 48 of 81 c. Phase III Review In addition, the following factors also may affect the funding decision: Funding Preferences Applicants to this NOFO will be scored based on direct consideration of findings from the Objective Review Panel and, as applicable, responsiveness to the funding preference listed below. Applicants meeting the criteria set forth in this funding preference will receive additional points beyond the possible total of 100 as follows: PEPFAR Local Partner Funding Preference (30 points) Applicants must submit supporting documentation and a narrative letter by and through an authorized representative on the organization's official letterhead as a separate attachment from the Project Narrative and Appendices and labeled as \"Local Partner Preference\" to be considered to receive the Phase III Local Partner Funding Preference points under this NOFO. This documentation will not count toward the page limits of the Project Narrative or Appendix. This documentation must demonstrate how the prime applicant organization meets at least one of the three criteria listed below under the \"PEPFAR Local Partner definition\" at the time of application. Funding preference points do not apply to sub-recipients/partners or consortium members. For each of the criteria listed below, a description of the supporting documentation is provided. Applicants that do not provide labeled supporting documentation to meet the PEPFAR Local Partner definition below will not be considered for, nor receive, the Funding Preference points as noted under Phase III Review. Applicants must meet the requirements of the local partner definition at the time of application submission in order to be eligible for funding preference points. Funding preference points will not be awarded on a scale for partially meeting the definition. Applicants may choose to submit one supporting document to demonstrate how the applicant meets multiple portions of the definition. If one document is submitted, it must be clearly noted in the accompanying narrative letter from the authorized representative. Any supporting documentation not submitted in English must be described in the accompanying narrative letter from the authorized representative. Submissions may be verified for accuracy.

A parastatal organization may be fully or partially government-owned or government-funded organization. Such enterprises may function through a board of directors, similar to private corporations. Principal Investigator (PI) must provide documentation depicting the organization's relationship with the government (e.g., an organizational chart, legislation, statute, or charter), as well as a letter describing how the organization is a partner government ministry, sub-unit of government ministry, or parastatal organization in country, and describing the government's partial ownership of the entity. Applications will be funded in order by score and rank determined by the review panel unless funding preferences or other considerations stated in this NOFO apply. After completion of the Phase II Review, applicants are placed in rank order based on their overall score from the objective review panel and funding preference if applicable. In the event two or more applicants are tied for top ranked, CDC will conduct a further review of the applicants tied for highest rank. CDC will deem the applicant with the highest overall score in the Approach section as top ranked. In the event there is still a tie, CDC will move to the Applicant's Organizational Capacity Section to Implement the Approach and will deem the applicant with the highest overall score in that section as top ranked. Any statements of performance submitted by applicants in response to this NOFO will be assessed for accuracy. In the event past performance described is not aligned with actual performance as documented in an official federal agency report (Corrective Action Plan, Site Improvement Plan, Data for Accountability, Transparency and Impact Monitoring (DATIM) Page 52 of 81 target reporting, or similar), CDC would consider any inaccuracies in determination of ranking. False statements or claims and misrepresentation or mischaracterization of any information in connection to the application, if funded, may result in legal enforcement action, up to and including termination, as authorized by law. Applicants should note that in furtherance of the activities and priorities of the PEPFAR program, CDC reserves the right to fund applications out of rank order. Review of risk posed by applicants. Prior to making a Federal award, CDC is required by 31 U.S.C. 3321 and 41 U.S.C. 2313 to review information available through any OMB-designated repositories of government-wide eligibility qualification or financial integrity information as appropriate. See also suspension and debarment requirements at 2 CFR parts 180 and 376. In accordance 41 U.S.C. 2313, CDC is required to review the non-public segment of the OMB- designated integrity and performance system accessible through SAM (currently the Federal Recipient Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS)) prior to making a Federal award where the Federal share is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, defined in 41 U.S.C. 134, over the period of performance. At a minimum, the information in the system for a prior Federal award recipient must demonstrate a satisfactory record of executing programs or activities under Federal grants, cooperative agreements, or procurement awards; and integrity and business ethics. CDC may make a Federal award to a recipient who does not fully meet these standards, if it is determined that the information is not relevant to the current Federal award under consideration or there are specific conditions that can appropriately mitigate the effects of the non-Federal entity's risk in accordance with 45 CFR \u00a775.207. CDC's framework for evaluating the risks posed by an applicant may incorporate results of the evaluation of the applicant's eligibility or the quality of its application. If it is determined that a Federal award will be made, special conditions that correspond to the degree of risk assessed may be applied to the Federal award. The evaluation criteria is described in this Notice of Funding Opportunity. In evaluating risks posed by applicants, CDC will use a risk-based approach and may consider any items such as the following: (1) Financial stability; (2) Quality of management systems and ability to meet the management standards prescribed in this part; (3) History of performance. The applicant's record in managing Federal awards, if it is a prior recipient of Federal awards, including timeliness of compliance with applicable reporting requirements, conformance to the terms and conditions of previous Federal awards, and if applicable, the extent to which any previously awarded amounts will be expended prior to future awards; (4) Reports and findings from audits performed under subpart F 45 CFR 75 or the reports and findings of any other available audits; and Page 53 of 81 (5) The applicant's ability to effectively implement statutory, regulatory, or other requirements imposed on non-Federal entities. CDC must comply with the guidelines on government-wide suspension and debarment in 2 CFR part 180, and require non-Federal entities to comply with these provisions. These provisions restrict Federal awards, subawards and contracts with certain parties that are debarred, suspended or otherwise excluded from or ineligible for participation in Federal programs or activities. 2. Announcement and Anticipated Award Dates Applicants will receive notification of their application status by the end of August 2022. The award date will be September 30, 2022. F.

The full Expenditure Reporting template (Form DS- 4213, approved under OMB 1405-0208) was previously completed by prime recipients only. This form will now be required to be completed by prime recipients and by sub-recipients, who will report through their prime recipient partner. This expenditure reporting is in addition to and in conjunction with the PEPFAR Annual Progress Report required at the completion of the USG fiscal year. As noted, prime recipients are only required to collect this information from sub-recipients with fiscal year expenditures greater than $25,000. Prime recipients should implement this requirement by providing a template to each of these sub-recipients as part of any agreement entered into between the prime and the sub-recipient using award funds. When reporting expenditures in a separate template, sub-recipients should be reminded to provide full cost category detail on their expenditures, in addition to the program area and beneficiary information. Prime recipients are expected to collect the completed Expenditure Reporting Page 62 of 81 templates from impacted sub-recipients and upload them into the DATIM system in line with the annual Expenditure Reporting timeline. d. Federal Financial Reporting (FFR) (required) The annual FFR form (SF-425) is required and must be submitted 90 days after the end of the budget period through the Payment Management System (PMS). The report must include only those funds authorized and disbursed during the timeframe covered by the report. The final FFR must indicate the exact balance of unobligated funds, and may not reflect any unliquidated obligations. There must be no discrepancies between the final FFR expenditure data and the Payment Management System's (PMS) cash transaction data. Failure to submit the required information by the due date may adversely affect the future funding of the project. If the information cannot be provided by the due date, recipients are required to submit a letter of explanation to OGS and include the date by which the Grants Officer will receive information. e. Final Performance and Financial Report (required) The Final Performance Report is due 90 days after the end of the period of performance. The Final FFR is due 90 days after the end of the period of performance and must be submitted through the Payment Management System (PMS). CDC programs must indicate that this report should not exceed 40 pages. This report covers the entire period of performance and can include information previously reported in APRs. At a minimum, this report must include the following: Performance Measures - Recipients must report final performance data for all process and outcome performance measures. Evaluation Results - Recipients must report final evaluation results for the period of performance for any evaluations conducted. Impact/Results/Success Stories - Recipients must use their performance measure results and their evaluation findings to describe the effects or results of the work completed over the project period, and can include some success stories. A final Data Management Plan that includes the location of the data collected during the funded period, for example, repository name and link data set(s) Additional forms as described in the Notice of Award (e.g., Equipment Inventory Report, Final Invention Statement). 4. Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (FFATA) Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (FFATA), P.L. 109-282, as amended by section 6202 of P.L. 110-252 requires full disclosure of all entities and organizations receiving Federal funds including awards, contracts, loans, other assistance, and payments through a single publicly accessible Web site, http://www.USASpending.gov . Compliance with this law is primarily the responsibility of the Federal agency. However, two elements of the law require information to be collected and reported by applicants: 1) information on executive compensation when not already reported through the SAM, and 2) similar information on all sub-awards/subcontracts/consortiums over $25,000. Page 63 of 81 For the full text of the requirements under the FFATA and HHS Foreign Taxes (International/Foreign projects only) A.

If one document is Page 68 of 81 submitted, it must be clearly noted in the accompanying narrative letter from the authorized representative. o Any supporting documentation not submitted in English must be described in the accompanying narrative letter from the authorized representative. Submissions may be verified for accuracy. Amendments, Questions and Answers (Q&As) Applicants must submit their Q&As, if any, by email to pepfarfoas@cdc.gov and to the Project Officer listed under the Agency Contacts Section of this NOFO no later than 15 days after the publication date in www.grants.gov . Questions received more than 15 days after the NOFO is published on www.grants.gov will not be considered and a response will not be provided. All changes, updates, and amendments to the NOFO will be posted to www.grants.gov following the approval of CDC. Amendment I: Questions and Answers (Q&A) The purpose of this amendment is to include questions and answers (Q&A) in Section H. Other Information. 1. Is a \"Letter of Intent\" required, and if so, what is the due date? o As stated, in section D. Application and Submission Information of the NOFO, a letter of intent is not requested or required as part of the application for this NOFO. 2. In the NOFO, under D. Submission Dates and Times b. Application Deadline, there is a date and time listed, but it also says, \"Number of Days from Publication 60\". Can you clarify what is meant by that and what the deadline should be? o As stated in Part I. Overview of the NOFO, the due date for application is the date listed under F. Dates, 2. Due date for Applications which should be the same date listed in D. Submission Dates and Times b. Application deadline. Applicants can ignore the phrase \"Number of Days from Publication 60\". While it is true that most NOFOs are posted for at least 60 days, applicants should not count days to come up with the deadline and should instead refer to the date and time listed in these 2 sections. 3. The NOFO mentions needing a Unique Entity Identifier (UEI) and Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number if applying after January 25th. Do applicants need to have a UEI number in addition to a DUNS number? o No, applicants to this NOFO do not need to have a UEI number in addition to a DUNS number. This NOFO was published with incorrect information regarding whether applicants need to have a Unique Entity Identifier (UEI) and a Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number to apply for this NOFO. UEI is Page 69 of 81 required for all applications to federal awards after April 4, 2022. January 25, 2021 was incorrectly listed in this NOFO. CDC confirms that a UEI is not required as part of the application for this NOFO because applications are due February 25, 2022. Applicants are only required to enter their DUNS number on the SF424 form when submitting their application to this NOFO. 4. Please clarify if CDC allows 3rd tier sub-awarding. Thus, if we have a sub-awardee, does CDC accept the sub-awardee to have a sub-sub awardee? o Yes, as long as it's in line with the scope of the project/goals and objectives and the budget guidelines. Sub-awarding is at the discretion of the recipient. CDC does not restrict sub-recipients from further sub-awarding to other partners to implement project activities. 5. On page 16 regarding the PEPFAR MER Process and Outcome measures will CDC provided the indicators disaggregated by district? o Yes, refer to table below and the table provided in the response to question #18 below Indicator Chikwaw a Chiradzul u Mwanz a Mzimb a Blantyr e Lilongw e HTS_SELF * * * * * * HTS_TST * * * * * * HTS_TST_NEG * * * * * * HTS_TST_POS * * * * * * KP_PREV * * * * PrEP_CURR * * * * * PrEP_NEW * * * * * TX_CURR * * * * TX_NEW * * * * TX_PVLS (N) * * * * TX_PVLS (D) * * * * OVC_SERV * OVC_SERV_UNDER_ 18 * PP_PREV * 6. On page 7, last sentence on the last paragraph, you have referred to ....a minimum 2 HDAs per catchment area. What is the definition of a catchment area? o The Malawi HTS minimum standards recommend deployment of a minimum of 2 certified HTS providers per site to ensure uninterrupted service provision. In this Page 70 of 81 context, a catchment area refers to any defined geographical location/site where targeted community HTS will be offered. 7. In terms of data collection, is CDC expecting IPs to use CDC data collection tools from the previous CoAg or will the primate data source be the MoH data collection tools? o As stated in section D. Application and Submission Information, \"As identified in the Evaluation and Performance Measurement section, applications involving data collection or generation must include a Data Management Plan (DMP).\" The IP will use data collection tools from both the CDC previous CoAg and MoH, ensuring that the DMP \"describes the plan for assurance of the quality of the public health data through the data's lifecycle and plans to deposit the data in a repository to preserve and to make the data accessible in a timely manner.\" 8. In the NOFO the target population includes AGYW to be addressed with targeted community HTS strategies. Should this also include AGYW enrolled in DREAMS (who will receive HTS as part of the package)? o Yes, It is at the discretion of the applicant to determine and propose their approach to address the strategies and activities encompassed in the NOFO. The logic model in section A. Funding Opportunity Description of the NOFO contains a high-level summary of strategies, activities, and outcomes. Applicants should ensure they consider all strategies (including DREAMS, listed in strategy 2) and are encouraged to include their own proposed activities and outcomes if they are within the scope of the NOFO. Applicants should keep in mind that bolded outcomes (short-, intermediate, or long-term) in the Logic Model are specific outcomes that CDC expects the partner to achieve in the project period. 9. Can the CDC describe if the current modality of facility-based IPs leading community HTS will change upon award of the anticipated cooperative agreement? o Current CDC facility-based IPs are leading in community based HTS targeting contacts of index clients through active index testing modality. This will not change upon award of the anticipated cooperative agreement 10. In which districts will the successful applicant be expected to carry out this work? Will the same districts be prioritized for all interventions, or will the KP districts be different than the districts where CBHTS for men and AGYW will take place? // May you also clarify on the districts of implementation. Will they be the same as in the previous agreement or is there a change? // Can CDC confirm that all CDC-supported districts are to be supported by this project? o Yes, the same districts as in the previous agreement will be maintained. Please note prioritization for interventions below: i. KP = Blantyre 71 of 81 iii. CBHTS for Men = Lilongwe and Blantyre 11. Will the successful applicant be expected to provide direct service delivery for HTS, treatment, VL monitoring/suppression, and PrEP at the community-level? Or is the expectation that men, AGYW, and KP will be identified by the implementing partner of the resulting CoAg and linked to facilities for these services? o Applicant is expected to provide KP direct service delivery interventions at community level with active linkage to facility treatment and PrEP services. HTS for AGYW and men will be offered at community followed by active linkage to treatment. 12. If the successful applicant is only expected to link clients to facilities (and not provide community-based services) as suggested in the NOFO, please explain the direct service delivery targets (HTS_TST and HTS_TST_POS, PREP_NEW, TX_NEW, TX_CURR, and TC_PVLS) and how these will not duplicate what facility-based partners will also report. o The recipient is expected to provide both community-based services and link clients to facilities for HIV treatment and PrEP. There will be no duplication of reports as Partners will be assigned annual \"direct service delivery (DSD)\" and \"technical assistant (TA)\" targets accordingly. 13. Please confirm that people who use injection drugs (PWUID) are not included as a KP in this NOFO? o PWUID are not included as targeted KP population group in this NOFO. Malawi National AIDS Commission is planning to implement a PWUID size estimation and formative study in year 2022. Applicant may consider inclusion of screening questions/checklist that may inform programing as there is no information available for this group now. 14. Targets: HTS_POS is 1047 and TX_NEW is 508 which is 49% linkage. Can CDC confirm that these are accurate targets? o No, these are not correct targets. The overall linkage rate should be 54%, this is low because TX_NEW targets for two districts (Blantyre and Lilongwe) were not set for this mechanism. The targets have been assigned to facility-based IPs. TX_NEW targets were only set in districts that are implementing KP program. For KP districts, the linkage rate target is 100%. 15. Targets: PREP_CURR has been retired. Please provide target for PREP_CT. o The FY22 PrEP_CT target has not yet been determined; CDC is still waiting for guidance from SGAC and will work with the recipient once it is determined. Page 72 of 81 16. Targets: What are the targets for HTS_INDEX? o This mechanism has no HTS_INDEX Targets 17. Can CDC confirm that all facilities and drop-in centers in the districts are to be supported? o CDC's approach strengthens public health facilities' capacity to ensure availability and access to KP friendly services. CDC's Partners do not support drop-in centers (DICs). 18. Targets: What are the disaggregated targets by sex, age, and population type (KP vs, AGYW vs. Men) for all indicators (HTS_TST_POS, TX_NEW, PREP_NEW, etc.)? o Please refer to the 4 District Key Pop HTS_SELF HTS_TST HTS_TST_NEG 73 4 69 4 84 584 Chiradzulu MSM 314 36 2 34 356 FSW 262 56 56 570 Mwanza MSM 84 14 1 13 95 FSW 1,310 109 6 103 2,494 MSM 478 34 2 32 475 Mzimba TG 1 1 Total 4,173 563 28 535 6,736 Page 73 of 81 TX_PVLS District Key Pop PrEP_CURR PrEP_NEW TX_CURR TX_NEW D N FSW 234 234 220 144 232 220 Chikwawa MSM 276 276 135 69 161 153 FSW 107 107 121 84 124 118 Chiradzulu MSM 111 111 45 34 44 42 FSW 94 94 128 56 161 153 Mwanza MSM 29 29 30 13 37 35 FSW 451 451 245 103 312 296 MSM 79 32 93 89 Mzimba TG Total 1,381 1,381 998 535 1,164 81 DREAMS Intervention PP_PREV PrEP_CURR PrEP_NEW OVC_SERV District Age HTS_SELF HTS_TST HTS_TST_NEG HTS_TST_POS District 196 384 337 47 903 40-44 135 208 184 24 701 45-49 89 118 101 17 405 50+ 145 48 42 6 409 Lilongwe 15-19 2,090 878 858 35-39 131 491 426 65 1,170 40-44 94 300 258 42 667 45-49 86 42 35 7 602 50+ 143 2 2 751 Grand Total 41,871 6,101 5,638 463 19,729 Page 76 of 81 I. Glossary Activities: The actual events or actions that take place as a part of the program. Administrative and National Policy Requirements, Additional Requirements (ARs): Administrative requirements found in 45 CFR Part 75 and other requirements mandated by statute or CDC policy. All ARs are listed in the Template for CDC programs. CDC programs must indicate which ARs are relevant to the NOFO; recipients must comply with the ARs listed in the NOFO. To view brief descriptions of relevant provisions, see .https://www.cdc.gov/grants/additional-requirements/index.html . Note that 2 CFR 200 supersedes the administrative requirements (A-110 & A-102), cost principles (A-21, A-87 & A- 122) and audit requirements (A-50, A-89 & A-133). Approved but Unfunded: Approved but unfunded refers to applications recommended for approval during the objective review process; however, they were not recommended for funding by the program office and/or the grants management office. Assistance Listings: A government-wide compendium published by the General Services Administration (available on-line in searchable format as well as in printable format as a .pdf file) that describes domestic assistance programs administered by the Federal Government. Assistance Listings Number: A unique number assigned to each program and NOFO throughout its lifecycle that enables data and funding tracking and transparency Award: Financial assistance that provides support or stimulation to accomplish a public purpose. Awards include grants and other agreements (e.g., cooperative agreements) in the form of money, or property in lieu of money, by the federal government to an eligible applicant. Budget Period or Budget Year: The duration of each individual funding period within the project period. Traditionally, budget periods are 12 months or 1 year. Carryover: Unobligated federal funds remaining at the end of any budget period that, with the approval of the GMO or under an automatic authority, may be carried over to another budget period to cover allowable costs of that budget period either as an offset or additional authorization. Obligated but liquidated funds are not considered carryover. Competing Continuation Award: A financial assistance mechanism that adds funds to a grant and adds one or more budget periods to the previously established period of performance (i.e., extends the \"life\" of the award). Continuous Quality Improvement: A system that seeks to improve the provision of services with an emphasis on future results. Page 77 of 81 Contracts: An award instrument used to acquire (by purchase, lease, or barter) property or services for the direct benefit or use of the Federal Government. Cooperative Agreement: A financial assistance award with the same kind of interagency relationship as a grant except that it provides for substantial involvement by the federal agency funding the award. Substantial involvement means that the recipient can expect federal programmatic collaboration or participation in carrying out the effort under the award. Cost Sharing or Matching: Refers to program costs not borne by the Federal Government but by the recipients. It may include the value of allowable third-party, in-kind contributions, as well as expenditures by the recipient. Direct Assistance: A financial assistance mechanism, which must be specifically authorized by statute, whereby goods or services are provided to recipients in lieu of cash. DA generally involves the assignment of federal personnel or the provision of equipment or supplies, such as vaccines. DA is primarily used to support payroll and travel expenses of CDC employees assigned to state, tribal, local, and territorial (STLT) health agencies that are recipients of grants and cooperative agreements. Most legislative authorities that provide financial assistance to STLT health agencies allow for the use of DA. https://www.cdc.gov/grants/additional- requirements/index.html . DUNS: The Dun and Bradstreet (D&B) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number is a nine-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet Information Services. When applying for Federal awards or cooperative agreements, all applicant organizations must obtain a DUNS number as the Universal Identifier. DUNS number assignment is free. If requested by telephone, a DUNS number will be provided immediately at no charge. If requested via the Internet, obtaining a DUNS number may take one to two days at no charge. If an organization does not know its DUNS number or needs to register for one, visit Dun & Bradstreet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/ webform/displayHomePage.do . Evaluation (program evaluation): The systematic collection of information about the activities, characteristics, and outcomes of programs (which may include interventions, policies, and specific projects) to make judgments about that program, improve program effectiveness, and/or inform decisions about future program development. Evaluation Plan: A written document describing the overall approach that will be used to guide an evaluation, including why the evaluation is being conducted, how the findings will likely be used, and the design and data collection sources and methods. The plan specifies what will be done, how it will be done, who will do it, and when it will be done. The NOFO evaluation plan is used to describe how the recipient and/or CDC will determine whether activities are implemented appropriately and outcomes are achieved. Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (FFATA): Requires that information about federal awards, including awards, contracts, loans, and other assistance and payments, be available to the public on a single website at www.USAspending.gov . Fiscal Year: The year for which budget dollars are allocated annually. The federal fiscal year starts October 1 and ends September 30. Grant: A legal instrument used by the federal government to transfer anything of value to a recipient for public support or stimulation authorized by statute. Financial assistance may be Page 78 of 81 money or property. The definition does not include a federal procurement subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation; technical assistance (which provides services instead of money); or assistance in the form of revenue sharing, loans, loan guarantees, interest subsidies, insurance, or direct payments of any kind to a person or persons. The main difference between a grant and a cooperative agreement is that in a grant there is no anticipated substantial programmatic involvement by the federal government under the award. Grants.gov: A \"storefront\" web portal for electronic data collection (forms and reports) for federal grant-making agencies at www.grants.gov . Grants Management Officer (GMO): The individual designated to serve as the HHS official responsible for the business management aspects of a particular grant(s) or cooperative agreement(s). The GMO serves as the counterpart to the business officer of the recipient organization. In this capacity, the GMO is responsible for all business management matters associated with the review, negotiation, award, and administration of grants and interprets grants administration policies and provisions. The GMO works closely with the program or project officer who is responsible for the scientific, technical, and programmatic aspects of the grant. Grants Management Specialist (GMS): A federal staff member who oversees the business and other non-programmatic aspects of one or more grants and/or cooperative agreements. These activities include, but are not limited to, evaluating grant applications for administrative content and compliance with regulations and guidelines, negotiating grants, providing consultation and technical assistance to recipients, post-award administration and closing out grants. Health Disparities: Differences in health outcomes and their determinants among segments of the population as defined by social, demographic, environmental, or geographic category.
