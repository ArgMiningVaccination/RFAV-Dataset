Anna Sayburn asks if it could it help reduce chronic disease\u2014and whether it places blame on patients Lifestyle medicine's adherents talk enthusiastically of fixing the broken medical model and saving the NHS. Does the launch of a new diploma and its introduction to the curriculum at medical schools such as Cambridge University signal its emergence as a standalone specialty\u2014and what might its impact be? The Lifestyle Medicine Global Alliance, which lists 16 regional members from around the world and runs online training,1 defines lifestyle medicine as \"an evidence based medical specialty\" that uses \"lifestyle therapeutic approaches\" to prevent, treat, or modify non-communicable chronic disease2\u2014the disease area that accounts for 71% of deaths worldwide.3 These approaches include \"a predominantly whole food, plant based diet, regular physical activity, adequate sleep, stress management, avoidance of risky substance use, and other non-drug modalities.\"2 \"Lifestyle medicine is not complementary or alternative\u2014it's mainstream,\" says Rob Lawson, a retired NHS GP from East Lothian now working privately, who is chair of the British Society of Lifestyle Medicine (BSLM), founded in 2016. He says people need to realise it's not just about nutrition. \"You've got to get to the people who need it most. They're not going to switch fish and chips for avocado and chia seeds,\" he says. Helping people find a purpose in life and beat isolation can tackle the \"upstream causes\" of disease, he says. Key to the delivery of lifestyle medicine is the ability to help people make sustainable lifestyle changes through behavioural change management techniques. \"It's all about behavioural psychology and buy-in,\" says Alex Maxwell, a GP in Thornton Heath, south London, who is introducing lifestyle medicine into his practice.

Hippocrates said so eloquently long before we made medicine a science and business. \"If you are not your own doctor, you are a fool.\" Hippocrates I think we have a desperate need to accept that the current model of medicine will neither be sufficient nor sustainable in years to come. If we have the freedom to utilize the health care system then we should have a responsibility to promote healthy behavior and try to sustain it lifelong. The healthcare system should be used when lifestyle interventions seem to be failing. By medicalising conditions, we foster a false hope that lifestyle diseases can and should be treated at any stage. The government should encourage healthy behaviors and reward champions to drive the message across. No amount of statins can undo the effects of an unhealthy lifestyle without side effects and incurring cost to the taxpayer. Finland had one of the highest ischemic heart disease-related deaths in the world. Dr Pekka Puska and his team orchestrated a multi-pronged, community-wide approach starting with North Karelia, and within five years it spread to all of Finland. Now the country has witnessed over 75% reduction in the last four decades by dramatically controlling risk factors like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking. We as human beings, whether a doctor or a patient, have an obligation to actively seek what is healthy, pursue what is wholesome and get help when we fall short or get sick. Competing interests: No competing interests Teach students lifestyle medicine, as it is the basis of medical care rather than its own specialty. This article echoes recent findings by a paper published in the Lancet[1]. The leading causes of 'estimated years of life lost' are commonly associated with lifestyle factors. This highlights the vital need for integration of lifestyle medicine into all medical specialties rather than forming one of its own. A vast amount of the NHS budget is spent on preventable conditions such as some of those mentioned in the Lancet paper. Despite the increased number of medications available, the burden of disease is not declining. For example in type 2 diabetes the risk of complications is not reduced by drug glucose control[2]. Why then is the focus still in these pharmacological areas? The British Heart Foundation stated this summer that heart attacks and strokes were set to 'surge in the next 20 years' due to a continuing rise in obesity, often associated with type 2 diabetes[3]. Uninformed lifestyle choices, as such, set off this tumbling domino chain of medical conditions. The concept of lifestyle medicine can therefore tackle the cause of these conditions. It does not simply treat the problems if they arise. A quote in the article states that \"advising citizens and patients about evidence based alterations to diet or exercise to prevent and treat disease has been part of the medical curriculum for decades\". In my experience as a medical student, it has barely been addressed over my last 3 years of study. Its involvement in the curriculum does not extend much beyond the words 'advise patient on a healthy lifestyle'. We must support people to improve their health generating habits. Therefore, I think students should be given the resources to enable the individual patient to understand from their own perspective how they could benefit from the change. In my opinion, this kind of behavioural change forms the foundations of lifestyle medicine although is a difficult aspect of the consultation. From my own experience and shadowing I have not gained good insight into how to deliver positive change generated by the patient's own understanding. References 1) Steel, N. et al.

The more we get, the worse we feel. There are 24 medical specialties and 88 sub-specialties. How can we choose, afford, or survive so much healthcare? There are three kinds of healthcare: traditional medicine, alternative medicine, and complementary medicine. Complementary medicine (integrative medicine) combines traditional medicine with alternative medicine. All three kinds of healthcare use drugs. Traditional medicine uses prescription drugs, such as antibiotics, tranquilizers, vaccines, and chemotherapy. Alternative medicine uses over-the-counter drugs, such as vitamins, minerals, herbs, and enzymes. Complementary medicine uses both prescription and over-the-counter drugs. So all healthcare uses drugs, and patients have no real alternatives. Drugs are a mixed blessing. They prolong life, but they also shorten it. This is because drugs are toxins and addictions that fool and block our body's biochemistry. This is why drugs have so many serious side effects and adverse reactions. In contrast, nutritious food, which is free of toxins and addictions, fuels and builds our body's biochemistry. This is why food is live medicine, but medicine is dead food. So healthcare needs selfcare. Competing interests: No competing interests Three questions a) Has the body of knowledge expanded substantially over the years with the potential to benefit patients? b) Do diverse branches of medicine have a common thread in relation to understanding the matter and added benefits to patients, when a single branch appears to be conferring limited benefits? c) Is the new speciality likely to be vibrant with ongoing and continued research for widening the scope and adding to knowledge? As the answers to all three questions and probably more are in the affirmative, there is certain merit in supporting Lifestyle Medicine as a new medical speciality. A degree of overlap and some initial bickering is to be expected, yet proven yields in the new speciality would justify its creation and consequent consolidation. Dr Murar E Yeolekar, Mumbai Competing interests: No competing interests I am writing as one of the first cohort of physicians to sit the Lifestyle Medicine examination in Edinburgh earlier this year, after years of study and practice of lifestyle medicine principles. In my opinion, although lifestyle and nutrition is listed as the initial step in guideline algorithms, it receives, at best, lip service. I believe that part of the reason for this is that physicians themselves are unaware of the profound benefits that can be achieved with profound lifestyle changes, and that part of this unawareness stems from the guidelines lagging behind the literature. As an example, most physician colleagues who I communicate with are unaware that research showing the reversal of coronary artery disease has been published in top peer reviewed journals for literally decades. One need only google the names of Dr Esselstyn and Dr Ornish to see that this is so. Yet many busy doctors are not inclined to go to primary literature and are satisfied with reliance on guidelines. This is understandable but unfortunately if we as doctors are not informed, we will not be able to offer our patients real choice as to how to prevent or treat the conditions that cause the most morbidity and mortality. I believe this is an ethical issue for the profession and especially for creators of guidelines and for educators. We should not be leaving motivated patients at the mercy of the internet which is full of unsubstantiated claims regarding nutrition, and we should not abandon less motivated patients because we do not believe they will make changes. I hope all physicians but first and foremost, GPs, will regard the field of Lifestyle Medicine as a natural extension of the evolution of our advice about smoking. We know that it is bad, and we know we have to tell people, and continue to develop ways to shape the environment to encourage choices which promote human health, and to assist patients to move towards making their own educated healthy choices whether by big steps or small. In addition, since all physicians are also patients, or potential patients, we should examine how we can promote our own health through example and never consider that there is an 'us and them' situation. We are them. In response to the question of whether the field of Lifestyle Medicine should be separate, or integrated into medicine in general, I would like to bring an analogy to Palliative Medicine, which started out as a separate endeavour but which is widely practised within General Practice and becoming integrated into other specialities. Yet, some situations will always require specialist palliative care expertise, there is no contradiction here. Competing interests: No competing interests As a medical student, I support and look forward to the paradigm shift into lifestyle modification as a therapeutic and preventative measure. I strongly advocate public health teaching and implementing lifestyle medicine into all curriculums because everybody needs to be aware of how lifestyle behaviours will shape our future community, in terms of chronic disease. In 2017, a group of medical students in Bristol set up Nutritank Society, which promotes messages of nutrition and medical lifestyle education to all. Since then the popularity and demand for this has evidently soared, and the society now exists in 15 medical schools nationwide, and I proudly helped to set up the branch at Imperial College London. There is clear support from healthcare professionals, medical and non-medical students to become engaged with the importance of our wellbeing, as we empower each other, but ultimately patients within the community to look after themselves. In this current age of the mental health crisis and with a growing awareness of stressful lifestyles, it would be unwise to not devote time and effort towards implementing change and improving the wellbeing of people. Advising people to modify simple behaviours through basic steps can be so much more beneficial for patient self-management and empowerment. Patient-centred self-management can be financially beneficial in the long-term, as the outcomes of chronic conditions improve and hospital visits are reduced[1]. Nutritional and lifestyle medicine do not belong in a separate box to our current practice of medicine. The notion that clinicians should be able to choose whether they want to (or not) learn about lifestyle medicine is highly irrelevant because it is already so deeply engrained within medical consultations as we continue to guide patients to eat well and exercise anyway. This is not a case of enforcing ideas onto other people, nor placing blame on patients for their disease, but rather giving them the responsibility and choice to do something about their circumstances. There is no disadvantage to educating patients further about lifestyle modification, only barriers such as time constraints, thus we need to look towards improving efficient methods of education. Diseases are typically managed through treating the cause; however, becoming aware and advocating lifestyle medicine will aim to prevent the cause instead, by tackling issues at the root of the problem. Introducing these concepts to others is necessary and education through media is really critical to reach a wide enough cohort. [1] Bodenheimer T, Lorig K.
