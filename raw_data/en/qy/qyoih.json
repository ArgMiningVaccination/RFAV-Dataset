Being in nature connects me with spirit: a glimpse of sky between buildings, rain on the sidewalk, or the whisper of treetops in the wind. Carol Greco, PhD \u2014 Psychologist and Mindfulness Meditation Instructor, CIM Meditation and spirituality is calming time, a pleasant thought, a drop of rain, a young child sleeping, a short prayer, a walk in the park. Jeanette Adams \u2014 Administrative Manager, CIM Beginning, experiencing and closing each day knowing God is in control and is shaping today and orchestrating tomorrow. Jeannette South -Paul, MD \u2014 Chair, Department of Family Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine Before I enter a room to begin a massage, I take a moment to pause and focus on gratitude and bringing healing energy into my hands. Jessie Violet Larson \u2014 Massage Therapist, CIM Lean into small daily challenges. Say thank you for the experience, and you will find what you are grateful for. Tricia Smith \u2014 Acupuncturist, CIM May the Lord Jesus Christ guide my hands to do his work in healing. This was said by a senior physician who was treating a patient with musculoskeletal injections at a conference on pain management. Coming from a different religious background, I found this somewhat disquieting as I put myself in the patient's position. But as I learned, my comfort wasn't the issue; the focus was on the patient, an older woman suffering from arthritis pain. The physician immediately had her trust, and I can only expect that his words enhanced her experience. What's the place for discussion of religious and spiritual beliefs in medical practice? It seems to be acceptable to raise the topic during end -of-life discussions and in the setting of critical illnesses, such as cancer. Especially in these contexts, patients and families would like to talk about spirituality. However, physicians and other health care providers often are not comfortable straying from the more familiar territory of medical management. Amy Stine, MD , was a family physician in Pittsburgh who had a holistic practice and was much beloved by her patients, until her tragic death in an accident five years ago. Her family has graciously sponsored a conference on holistic approaches to medicine for the community and those connected with the health care system. This spring marks the fourth annual Amy Stine Workshop. This year's program will focus on spirituality in medicine, which is an important part of holistic care. This is the kind of personal care that Dr. Stine shared with her patients. In her memory, we hope to keep this vital discussion going. To start a dialogue, I invited the staff and friends of the Center for Integrative Medicine to chime -in with up to 140 characters highlighting how they experience spirituality in their daily lives. While these responses won't make it into the twitter - sphere, we hope to post them on our website. If you would like to contribute, some select responses will be added to those Shadyside Place Suite 310 580 S.

Esther Teverovsky, MD \u2014 Fellow in Geriatric Psychiatry I remain mindful that what is possible for my patients is infinitely more interesting than what is not. David Lesondak \u2014 Structural Integrator, CIM Spirituality allows us to do what is otherwise impossible: love others who don't love us. James Donnelly, MA \u2014 Psychologist, CIM Part of having a spiritual practice for me is connecting with nature. Taking a long hike in the woods helps me feel more spiritual. EngKeat Teh \u2014 Acupuncturist, CIM Being wired is the opposite of mindfulness; a few minutes walking, smartphone home, literally smelling the roses, attending to my breathing.

My father was a chiropractor, and when I'd get banged up playing sports as a kid, he would treat me. My friends would be hobbling around for a few days, but I would be feeling much better right away. I learned early on how this could help people. How does chiropractic care differ now from when your father was practicing? My father led the push for insurance coverage for chiropractic treatment in Pennsylvania. The biggest change is that it was considered a truly alternative treatment in his day, and now it's become a much more mainstream type of care for people with pain and musculoskeletal problems. Are there things that people would be surprised to know about chiropractic treatment? If someone's never seen a chiropractor before, they may be nervous and expect that it will hurt. They're surprised to find that not only is the treatment gentle, but often they will experience immediate relief. If someone has an episode of low back pain, how many treatments does it usually take to see benefit? On average it will usually take four to eight treatments to treat an acute problem, and it may take longer for more chronic conditions. If a patient engages in other exercises and rehabilitative care, that may further aid recovery. Are there some patients who shouldn't receive the usual manipulative treatment? As a general rule, patients with any type of bone cancer, or marked bone demineralization or bone weakness at the area to be treated, should avoid spinal manipulation. Is chiropractic care covered by my health insurance? Yes. We're pleased that most health insurance plans in western Pennsylvania cover chiropractic care. How does a chiropractor coordinate care with other health care providers? Many primary care physicians and specialists recommend spinal manipulation for patients with musculoskeletal pain. We're fortunate at the Center for Integrative Medicine that my treatment notes are included in UPMC's medical record system, so there's communication going back and forth to the patients' physicians. What kind of educational background is required to become a chiropractor? Chiropractors complete at least two years of undergraduate studies, and then at least four more years at one of the 17 chiropractic colleges across the country. How do chiropractors make a diagnosis, and do they always need to take x -rays before using manipulation? Chiropractors obtain a careful history and perform a musculoskeletal and neurological examination, similar to the patient's primary care physician, to render a diagnosis. If there are any particular risk factors discovered during the examination, or if a patient isn't responding well to treatment, then I'll consider x -rays, MRI, or a referral to physician specialist for further evaluation. Dr. Daniel Miller is a chiropractor at the Center for Integrative Medicine Healing Context Study Help us design questionnaires to meas- ure patients' experi- ences with traditional and integrative medicine. Participants will be asked to com- plete two computer questionnaires. For more information call 412-623-6872.
