Although wellness tourism was severely impacted by the pandemic, the practice of personal wellness is now more important to consumers than ever before. Strict regulations around health, safety, cleanliness and qualications are key to keep participants safe and generate condence in local operators' abilities and professionalism.

Through what channels can you get wellness tourism products on the European market?2. What competition will you face in the wellness tourism market?3. What are the prices for wellness tourism products on the European market?4. 1. What requirements must wellness tourism products comply with to be allowed on the European market? European tour operators that sell wellness tourism products to Europeans are bound by strict regulations to ensure the safety of their travellers and to protect them nancially. Sustainable tourism is also an issue that is becoming more important to buyers, both European tour operators and European travellers. You should understand what these regulations are. What are the mandatory and additional requirements that buyers have? The requirements that European tour operators have for wellness tourism products in developing countries cover the following: The European Package Travel Directive General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Liability Insurance and Insolvency Protection Sustainability and Responsible Tourism As a rst step, you should read the CBI's What requirements must tourism services comply with to be allowed on the European market - and specically section 3, 'What are the requirements for niche markets' - and familiarise yourself with the comprehensive details of legal, non-legal and common requirements. Since the UK's departure from the EU in January 2020, now commonly referred to as Brexit, it has been reported that both the EU and the UK will make changes to the existing package travel rules . The changes are likely to focus on improving protection for customers and may not have too much impact on local suppliers. However, you should keep up with any developments. Sustainability in the sector is discussed in more detail in the section Embed sustainability tourism into your wellness tourism business below.Travel restrictions post-COVID-19 Travel restrictions are being lifted around the world. Some countries continue to have travel restrictions in place but most demand that visitors are fully vaccinated visitors are permitted to enter - with or without the need for pre-arrival testing and/or self-isolating - or have a COVID-recovery certicate. Sometimes, unvaccinated persons must take a COVID-19 test before traveling. However, every country has dierent rules, and you should do your own research to nd out what they are. This is a useful list of travel restrictions for every European country that is updated regularly. And you can also have a look at Re-open EU , an interactive tool developed by the European Union (EU) to provide information about the current COVID-19 situation in each country. The EU Digital COVID Certicate system is widely used across the EU, and has made it easier for vaccinated travellers to travel more freely. Consult the European Commission for more information about the EU Digital COVID Certicate . Europeans travelling abroad to developing destinations will consult their own government's foreign travel advice websites along with that of the chosen destination. These are good websites to bookmark: Keep up-to-date with advice given to UK nationals about travel to all countries in the world on the government's Foreign Travel Advice page. Each country page also contains useful links to other nations' government websites. Consult the International Air Transport Association's (IATA) interactive travel restrictions map for travel restrictions in most other countries. Visit the relevant travel pages on your own government's website to ensure you are aware of the regulations and restrictions in place in your country and make sure you keep up-to-date with changes as they occur. As tourism resumes, you should prepare your travel product for a European market that is keen to travel but will need reassurance that there are robust safety protocols and cleanliness measures in place to keep them safe. You must also establish new booking terms and conditions and clearly state what cancellation and waivers you will oer your buyers during the pandemic. The World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) Safe Travels Scheme was launched to help rebuild consumer condence, reduce risk and encourage travel to resume. The scheme was developed with other partners including the Adventure Travel Trade Association (ATTA). The measures created include: Reducing numbers of participants to allow for social distancing Ensuring activities are at the suitable diculty level to reduce the need for rescue services Providing clear, consistent, and up-to-date communication on health and hygiene protocols Providing clear information about protocols such as face masks, hand hygiene guidance and social distancing requirements Encouraging online sales where possible Encouraging guests to handle their own equipment for the whole trip Limiting queuing and physical contact wherever possible Tips: Consult the CBI study How to respond to COVID-19 in the tourism sector for tips on preparing for the future recovery of the tourism sector. The study includes detailed information about revising terms and conditions to help you amend yours. Download WTTC's Tour Operators - Global Protocols for the New Normal for more details about the measures and decide whether to apply for the 'Safe Travels' Stamp , which is free of charge. Viator, the world's largest online travel agency (OTA) for trips, tours and experiences, has gathered a number of useful resources for tour and activity operators, COVID-19: Resources and How to Navigateyour Business through a Crisis. Requirements relating to the conflict in Ukraine The humanitarian crisis unfolding because of the war is, of course, the most immediate life-changing issue facing families and communities in Ukraine. Impact on the tourism industry is likely to be most felt by destinations traditionally visited by Ukrainian and Russian tourists, which will suer from falling tourism arrivals and revenue. Examples include many developing countries such as Kazakhstan, Thailand and Turkey. Nationals from Eastern Europe, particularly from neighbouring countries may also be more reluctant to travel in these uncertain times. Ukrainian airspace is closed, and Russian airspace is closed to many European countries and the US. This means that many major airlines must reroute flights which make journeys longer and/or more expensive to passengers. Tips: Regularly check the Pressroom section of the IATA website to keep up with developments in the aviation sector. Search the Internet for and read articles like these, Ukraine crisis clouds Southeast Asia's fragile tourism recovery and What impact will the Russia-Ukraine conflict have on the tourism industry . However, make sure your sources are reputable as far as you are aware and that the articles are recent, as the conflict is an ever-changing event. For the remainder of this report, all discussion, insight, and advice has been provided on the basis of travel in normal circumstances. What are the requirements for niche markets? Wellness tourism is dened as travel associated with the pursuit of maintaining or enhancing one's personal wellbeing. It is a major tourism segment made up of several related tourism niches including wellness activities and tness, religious and spiritual tourism, sun and beach tourism, food and wine tourism, and weddings and honeymoons. Wellness tourism is a substantial segment of the wellness economy, which is globally valued at US$4.4 trillion. Before COVID-19, wellness tourism was estimated to be worth US$720.4 billion and growing strongly. However, as the chart below shows, the value of the segment fell substantially when the pandemic hit and was re- estimated to be worth US$436 billion in 2020. Figure 1: Value of the Global Wellness EconomySource: Global Wellness Institute However, the pandemic has led to an ongoing trend of maintaining personal wellbeing and tness, including while travelling. Driven by traveller values that include a desire to be out in nature, to live more simply sustainably, and to nourish personal mental wellbeing, the market is predicted to recover strongly. An annual growth of 20.9% is expected , reaching a value of US$1.1 trillion by the end of 2025. This outstrips the anticipated growth projection of 9.9% annually for the entire global wellness economy. Wellness tourism is available all over the world and dierent destinations can oer their own distinctive wellness experiences. Wellness activities in a destination are often linked with local cultures, the natural assets of a place and local culinary specialities. Because of the diversity of the global landscape, a huge range of unique and authentic wellness activities are often based on indigenous healing practices, ancient and/or spiritual traditions, the existence of naturally occurring waters with special/mineral properties, mud baths and so on. Figure 2: Global Wellness DestinationsSource: Global Wellness Institute Requirements for wellness destinations and providers As such, the most important requirements for a successful wellness destination and/or wellness provider rely on a mix of natural and environmental factors, suitable infrastructure (buildings and facilities), sustainable business practices and well-qualied and competent practitioners. Below you will nd a checklist that examines the tangible and intangible requirements of a wellness tourism business. Checklist of Requirements for a Wellness Tourism Business Assess your own destination and current tourism business against this checklist of requirements to establish where your strengths and weaknesses are. Ideally, a successful wellness tourism business must have: Natural assets that t well with the provision of wellness tourism. This is a very broad requirement as wellness tourism activities can be practiced in many landscapes - mountains, forests, beaches, areas where there are mineral/salt waters, hot springs, mud baths and so on. A peaceful location that feels 'removed' from the stresses of everyday life. Many wellness destinations discourage Internet connectivity and do not provide Wi-Fi so their guests can have a truly immersive wellness experience. A destination that is safe and secure . Wellness travellers will not choose a place they do not believe to be safe for them to travel to or stay at. They seek peace and tranquillity that cannot be found in places that may be subject to political instability, even if they only think it to be true. Infrastructure and facilities that are clean and sanitary for both domestic and international visitors. Cleanliness is paramount for wellness tourism - especially after the pandemic. Sustainable actions incorporated. Wellness tourism and wellness travel also encompass wellness for the planet so sustainability is a key requirement for all wellness tourism businesses. It is essential that wellness tourism businesses have sustainability policies and practices in place to attract sustainability-conscious travellers. See the section Embed sustainability into your wellness tourism business below.Employment opportunities for local people . A sustainable tourism business must also make sure to employ local people - who should be paid a fair wage, receive proper training and have good working conditions. Wherever possible, locally made produce, products and other services should be available for sale. Qualied and professional practitioners in their relevant elds of expertise, whether they are yoga/Pilates instructors, providers of holistic and/or alternative therapies, masseuses or otherwise. Healthy food that has been sustainably sourced - often vegetarian and increasingly vegan - is a key factor of wellness tourism. Provision of a wide range of healthy cuisine prepared by local chefs, preferably with ingredients that are locally sourced and/or grown, and/or organically produced where possible. Animal produce must be sourced from reputable suppliers which operate to high levels of animal welfare. Availability of a wide range of additional tness-based activities such as swimming, yoga, hiking, cycling, tness classes, kayaking/canoeing or stand up paddleboarding (SUP). Local sightseeing trips and/or tours to local festivals and markets also add value to wellness tourism. Tips: For more information about wellness tourism and associated niches, have a look at the CBI infographic Which European tourism market segments should you target . For practical advice on setting up a new tourism product, download the CBI study How to get started developing your tourism product . Embed sustainability into your wellness tourism business Sustainability is now more important than ever in all areas of tourism provision. There is a very close link between personal wellness and the wellness of the planet, which means that it is essential for wellness tourism providers to make their products sustainable. Today, wellness tourism is often more than just taking part in 'yoga on the beach'. It is also about culturally immersive interactions and getting involved in supporting sustainable initiatives that might be conservation, restoration, zero waste or contributing towards carbon neutrality. Sometimes this type of hands-on tourism activity is referred to as regenerative tourism - a developing concept where sustainable tourism activities make the place better than when they arrived, rather than just maintaining the current situation. Best Practice: Examples of sustainability in wellness tourism Many wellness tourists care for the environment, want to support local people and help preserve their culture while minimising their impact on the destination. Here are some good examples of destinations and providers that have successfully implemented sustainability into their wellness tourism businesses. Some of these operators are large players in the tourism industry and have big budgets to support their activities. However, many of their ideas can be easily adapted by small, local operators in order to also commit to becoming waste free/plastic free and take other realistic actions. Besides being very beautiful, coral reefs are essential for the health of the planet. They protect the coast from erosion and storm damage, keep the ocean water healthy and are nurseries for many sh species. The Kokomo Island Wellness Resort in Fiji encourages guests to take part in all stages of the coral restoration process and has restored many thousands of corals to date. The Sixth Senses resort in Ninh Van Bay in Vietnam also oers guests the opportunity of taking part in coral restoration programmes. The Como Hotel in Maalifushi in the Maldives encourages guests to sponsor coral frames which are planted on the seabed as part of their coral conservation initiative. Sponsors can track the progress of coral growth via regular updates and are invited to join complimentary underwater dives when they visit.In St Lucia, the Body Holiday wellness resort oers its guests an educational 'farm to table' food experience, teaching the Rastafarian culture of clean eating and organic farming. This includes harvesting ingredients and preparing a meal that provides exactly the right nutrients for maximum health and energy. It is also a good example of a wellness experience combined with an immersive cultural exchange. The Iberostar hotel chain has launched an innovative sustainability tourism programme called the Wave of Chain , that has three major aims for all its properties: become waste free by 2025, source 100% of its seafood responsibly by 2025, and ensure the ecosystems that surround their properties are healthy (such as coral reefs) by 2030. From a destination perspective, Slovenia Green is a national certication scheme that supports all tourism providers to implement and/or improve their sustainability eorts. Visiting the mountainous resort of Rogla in the Pohorje Mountains is all about wellness - experiencing authentic tradition in green, unspoiled nature. Wellness activities are walking, cycling (pedal power or electric), consuming locally grown food, taking part in local tasks to support the local lifestyle and preserve traditional cultures. European wellness tourists like to know their trips are not having a negative impact on the destination. Being certied as a sustainable tourism business through a recognised certication scheme like Travelife is a good way to show your customers that you understand and have implemented sustainable business practices. Even if you are not certied, you must embed sustainability into your business and make sure you tell your customers what you are doing to reduce your carbon footprint and support local economies. Tips: Assess your business to see how you can either implement or improve your sustainability eorts, using the study to help you. Make a list of everything you currently do as a starting point. Do your research to nd out about sustainability in tourism. The CBI study How to be a sustainable tourism business is a good place to start. Decide whether you should apply for certication as a sustainable tourism business with Travelife or similar. To nd out more about regenerative tourism, consult the new CBI report Regenerative tourism: moving beyond sustainable and responsible tourism . Adopt wellness industry standards To sell to the European market, it is essential that you have stringent health, hygiene and safety protocols in place. Practitioners and therapists must also be qualied at least to the standards expected in your country. If you can establish standards above and beyond these, this will give you a competitive advantage. Applying international standards to your wellness tourism product is a good way to inform your customers that you are oering a good-quality product and that you understand fully the issues of the sector. The ISO oers two wellness tourism standards for you to consider: ISO 17679:2016 Wellness Spa - establishes the service requirements of a wellness spa, the main supporting processes and quality of service provided to the client. ISO 17680:2015 Thalassotherapy - establishes the service requirements for businesses using treatments derived from the marine environment. There is a series of European standards and certications for providers of wellness tourism providers in Europe which you should be aware of. The standards that Europeans expect from wellness tourism providers are useful benchmarks for you to apply to your wellness tourism product. Look at the following standards to see what you might be able to apply to your own business:EuropeSpa - featuring quality and safety criteria and oering a certication programme Wellness-Hotels & Resorts - is a German organisation with a network of wellness hotels and resorts that conrm to its set of criteria. 2. Through what channels can you get wellness tourism products on the European market? How is the end-market segmented? The market is segmented into two types of wellness traveller: Primary wellness travellers - people who travel to wellness destinations, hotels, resorts, spas or retreats for the specic purpose of wellness. They are very focused on their own personal wellness and tend to expect a specic outcome from their wellness trip - recovery, resolving health issues, developing their quest for wellness. Secondary wellness travellers - people who participate in wellness activities while taking a general leisure or business trip. They are more interested in the cultural link between a destination and the wellness remedies that are special to it. The table below shows how to distinguish between primary and secondary wellness tourists. Table 1: Wellness tourism activities taken by Primary and Secondary Wellness Tourists Primary Wellness T ravel Secondary Wellness Travel A Primary Wellness Tourist will: Take a one-week or two-week wellness holiday at a wellness destination resort (spa, resort, hotel) or other specic wellness centre/retreat. Take a short break of 2-4 days at a hot springs resort or yoga/wellness activity retreat. Stay at an Ashram or other meditation/yoga retreat for a short break, or longer. Take a weekend break at a spa or wellness hotel for rejuvenation and stress relief Travel to a wellness centre for a comprehensive health check-up. Take a wellness cruise on a wellness-specic ship. Stay at a yoga retreat that includes healthy food and meditation in a natural environment. A Secondary Wellness Tourist will: Choose to stay at a wellness hotel, eat healthy food and take part in tness activities during a broader leisure or business trip. Be part of a family, couple, or group of friends that spend a day/afternoon at a hot springs destination as part of a wider holiday trip. Enjoy a holiday at a beach resort/destination and make one or more visits to a spa/salon during the trip. Be a cruise tourist that selects a ship with wellness activities (but is not a wellness cruise), or spontaneously takes part in wellness activities whilst on a cruise. Be an adventure tourist that visits a spa after a long day hiking, trekking, biking etc. As part of group tour, have a Thai massage, visit a Turkish hammam, have reflexology treatment or take part in a yoga session, either as part of the tour experience or in their free time on the tour. Source: Acorn Tourism Consulting Secondary wellness travellers account for almost 9 in every 10 wellness trips taken worldwide (89%) and 86% of total expenditure. This is good news for small, local operators who can attract spontaneous leisure travellers who are keen to take part in wellness while on an overseas trip. The market is also segmented by: Domestic wellness travellers - the biggest global market by some margin, accounting for 82% of trips and 65% of total expenditure. Domestic wellness travellers are an important market that should be included in marketing activities by local wellness tour operators. International wellness travellers - which is a smaller market but generates more expenditure per person. The European market of wellness tourists is very large. Europeans took more wellness trips in 2019 than any other market (333.5 million trips). They spent US$248.2 billion on wellness tourism, the second-largest amount after North American wellness tourists.Understanding the motivations of wellness tourists When considering who to target your wellness product to, it is important to understand the needs and motivations of wellness tourists. The table below shows how wellness tourists are motivated to nd what they are seeking to achieve, what they will do and where they will go to get what they need. Table 2: Motivations of, and Activities Enjoyed by, Wellness Tourists SEEK DO VISIT Physical Fitness - tness classes, stretching, Pilates Healthy Eating - nutrition, weight management, detox, culinary experiences, vegetarian/vegan Health - check-ups, diagnostics, chronic condition management Spa & Beauty - massage, bathing, body treatments, facials, hair & nailsGyms, Fitness Centres Organic, natural restaurants Wellness Centres, Health Centres Wellness hotels, wellness cruises, health resorts, spas & salons, baths & springs, Thalassa Mental Mind-body - yoga, meditation, Tai Chi, Qigong, Biofeedback Yoga studios, martial arts studios Spiritual Spiritual & Connection - praying, time with family, time alone, volunteering Yoga retreats, spiritual retreats, Ashrams Emotional Personal Growth - retreats, life coaching, reducing stress, reading, music & arts Lifestyle retreats, wellness retreats Environmental Eco & Adventure - hiking, biking, walking, nature visits Parks, Wildlife Sanctuaries, Nature Reserves Source: Global Wellness Institute/Acorn Tourism Consulting You can also refer to this table when developing your wellness tourism product to understand who your targetcustomer is and which is the best way to reach them (see the section Through what channels do wellness tourism products end up on the end-market ? below.) Tips: Target the secondary wellness tourist. It oers the best potential to develop your wellness tourism product. Also target the domestic secondary wellness tourist. It is a large, readymade market and is likely to be less seasonal than the international secondary wellness tourist. Assess your wellness product against the values, motivations and goals of the primary and secondary wellness traveller markets to ensure you are delivering what they are expecting of you. Through what channels do wellness tourism products end up on the end- market? The chart below shows the dierent sales processes used by primary and secondary wellness tourists to purchase their holidays.

More examples of European wellness tour operators include: UK - Healing Holidays ; Wellbeing Escapes ; The Healthy Holiday Company Germany - Wellnessurlabub ; TUI; Urlaubsguru France - Pierre & Vacances ; Nomade Aventure Netherlands - Wellness Vakantie ; Spa Dreams Secondary wellness tourists use a range of suppliers to directly purchase wellness tourism products. They will make direct sales that are either online (through your website or via social media platform) or oine (phone sales, walk-in). Indirect Sales Secondary wellness tourists are also more 'opportunistic' which means they are more likely to make decisions in the spur of the moment and make indirect sales through OTAs like Viator . Wellness is a very large category on OTAs that specialise in trips and experiences. If you type 'wellness' into the search bar on Viator, you can see there more than 88,500 wellness experiences listed on the platform, worldwide. By comparison, there are 64,000 adventure listings and almost 95,000 nature listings.

The top destinations markets in developing countries for global wellness tourism in 2019 were Costa Rica, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Thailand and Turkey. However, you should take into account that there are many more countries that oer wellness tourism, and these may include your own country and/or your neighbours. Costa Rica Costa Rica is a good example of how wellness tourism crosses over with adventure tourism to provide wellness experiences that are benecial physically and mentally. Examples of 'wellness/adventure' experiences that are 'life-arming' include whale watching in the Ballena Marine National Park, hiking with capuchin monkeys in Corcovado National Park, and exploring primeval rainforests in Tirimbina. As one of the world's best-known eco-destinations, Costa Rica is well-placed for wellness tourism. Wellness retreats oer a variety of activities including medicine walks, Qi Gong, naturopathy, reiki, coee scrubs, digital detoxes and more. Costa Rica Tourism's wellness strategy, Wellness Pura Vida , was established in 2018 to support the development of the sector as a catalyst for social and economic growth in seven regions across the country. India India is one of the world's great spiritual destinations and has been a must-visit destination for many decades for those in search of spiritual enlightenment. It is the birthplace of the traditional wellness practices of Ayurveda and meditation, and there are wellness retreats all over the country. Major wellness areas in India are Kerala (for Ayurveda), Goa (yoga on the beach, healthy eating) and the Himalaya region (for spiritual retreats). The Ministry of Tourism has been building on opportunities to develop wellness tourism. Luxury hotel chains and independent boutique hotels are leading the way in investment in the market. The domestic market of wellness tourists is very large - 56 million nationals made wellness trips at home and abroad in 2017 , an increase of 45% since 2015. Before the pandemic, the market was anticipating a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12% between 2017 and 2020. Indonesia (Bali) Bali is home to large numbers of wellness retreats, usually located in beautiful, tranquil surroundings of lush tropical gardens and surrounded by waterfalls and natural pools.

In 2021, Bali was voted Asia's Best Spa Destination in the World Travel Awards for the range and quality of spa resorts throughout the island country. There are around 3,200 traditional wellness centres on the island and tourism stakeholders are looking to create a stronger network and implement more robust regulations to ensure compliance with the country's wellness standards. Mexico Mexico has a very strong wellness tourism sector and is particularly known for its spa industry and thermal/mineral springs. The town of Tepoztl\u00e1n is one of Mexico's oldest destinations for wellness tourism and is home to temazcales, or hot springs. Purication rituals and techniques adopted by the Mayan culture are common features in wellness businesses in M\u00e9rida on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula - where you will also nd the ancient city of Tulum, yet another leading wellness destination.Although one of the largest megacities in the world with a population of more than 10 million, Mexico City also promotes the cocoa ritual, a more unusual wellness activity.

Turkey Turkey is one of the world's leading destinations in terms of tourist arrivals. Since the Romans discovered the therapeutic powers of thermal springs, the associated Turkish hammam and massage treatments have been perfected over the years. The country has almost 1,500 natural thermal springs, largely scattered throughout western Anatolia, Turkey's top tourist region. The spectacular landscape of Pamukkale, known for mineral rich thermal waters flowing over bright white terraces, is one of Turkey's leading tourist attractions with more than 2 million annual visitors. In 2019, Turkey's hot springs generated about US$1 billion in tourist revenue . The Ministry of Tourism is working to develop Turkey's spa tourism further and a masterplan developed in 2017 aimed to position the country as a major health and thermal destination, attracting 1 million tourists to thermal tourism by 2023. One of the supporting initiatives was to distribute brochures on Turkey's thermal springs to tourists arriving by air. Tips: Research competing nations' wellness oers in your region to see who is oering what. Assess the wellness tourism industry locally so you can see where there are gaps for new businesses.
