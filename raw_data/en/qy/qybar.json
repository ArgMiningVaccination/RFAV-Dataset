Pragya Gondane BEAUTY & AYURVEDA Ayurveda is based on the belief that optimal health is achieved when your mind, body and spirit are aligned with the universe. Ayurvedic beauty rituals included bathing and oil treatments. The skin care was edible and derived from the most nutritious herbs and oils around. Herbs like neem, tulsi, turmeric, sandalwood, saffron and amla were incorporated into masks, creams and the widely used sesame oil. Nature's gifts were the only option for ingredients back in our modern world we are making our way back to the roots of these ancient beauty traditions. In the beauty industry, manufacturers and consumers are becoming more educated and conscious when it comes to skin care.We are happy to see people making the switch to more botanical based inspired by ancient practices.
