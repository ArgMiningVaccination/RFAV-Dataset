Here are 64 findings Becker's covered, starting with the most recent: 1. A study involving 12,000 COVID-19 patients in Hong Kong found the incidence of viral rebound after antiviral treatment was very low, according to findings [published](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/patient-safety-outcomes/covid-19-rebound-uncommon-after-antivirals-researchers-say.html) Dec. 6 in JAMA Network Open. 2. Repeat COVID-19 infections contribute significant additional risk of adverse health outcomes, including hospitalization and death, according to findings [published](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/patient-safety-outcomes/repeat-covid-19-infections-are-russian-roulette-study.html) Nov. 10 in Nature Medicine. 3. Major life stressors such as financial or food insecurity, death of a loved one or new disability are strong predictors of whether hospitalized COVID-19 patients will develop long COVID-19, according to findings [published](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/patient-safety-outcomes/life-stressors-up-long-covid-19-risk-study-suggests.html) Nov. 5 in Journal of the Neurological Sciences. 4. People who take the antiviral [Paxlovid](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/pharmacy/4-recent-paxlovid-updates.html) within the first few days of a COVID-19 infection may have a 25 percent lower risk of developing a number of conditions associated with long COVID-19, according to [findings](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/patient-safety-outcomes/paxlovid-cuts-long-covid-19-risk-early-va-findings-show.html) published Nov. 5 in the preprint server medRxiv. 5. Researchers at NYU Langone Health in New York City [found](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/patient-safety-outcomes/covid-19-disrupts-gut-bacteria-increasing-risk-of-infections.html) COVID-19 alone, and not the initial use of antibiotics, damages the gut microbiome. 6. A study [published](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/patient-safety-outcomes/7-of-children-hospitalized-with-covid-19-have-neurologic-complications-large-study-finds.html) Oct. 20 in Pediatrics found about 7 percent of children hospitalized with COVID-19 experienced neurologic complications, such as seizures. 7. COVID-19 may age organs, according to a series of studies [compiled](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/patient-safety-outcomes/covid-19-ages-organs-compilation-of-studies-finds.html) by Ziyad Al-Aly, MD, director of the Clinical Epidemiology Center at Washington University in St. Louis and the chief of research and education service at Veterans Affairs St. Louis Health Care System. The studies on long COVID-19 in the brain, heart and kidneys all pointed to multiple human organs aging faster after COVID-19. 8. Even when asymptomatic, trauma patients with COVID-19 may be at greater risk of complications compared to those without the infection, according to [research](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/patient-safety-outcomes/covid-19-tied-to-worse-outcomes-for-trauma-patients-even-if-asymptomatic.html) presented in mid-October from researchers at LAC+USC Medical Center in Los Angeles. 9. Researchers at Oakland, Calif.-based Kaiser Permanente identified 17 conditions most frequently associated with long COVID-19 in a study published Oct. 12 in Nature Medicine. The study is among the first to account for preexisting conditions when defining such symptoms. View the 17 most frequent conditions associated with long COVID-19 [here](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/patient-safety-outcomes/17-most-common-long-covid-19-symptoms-kaiser-permanente.html). 10.

The evidence builds on the findings from smaller studies earlier in the year. 12. Patients with long COVID-19 symptoms are more likely to have autoimmune disease markers in their blood, a [study](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/patient-safety-outcomes/autoimmune-responses-play-major-role-in-long-covid-19-study-suggests.html) published Sept. 22 in the European Respiratory Journal found. 13.

The list of long COVID-19 symptoms may be much longer than the 20 [included](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/patient-safety-outcomes/hair-loss-low-libido-among-long-covid-19-symptoms-study-finds.html) in the World Health Organization's clinical case [definition](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-Post_COVID-19_condition-Clinical_case_definition-2021.1) of the condition, according to a study published July 25 in [Nature Medicine](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-01909-w). Other symptoms may include lower libido and hair loss. 22. A July study involving more than 428,000 COVID-19 patients found the infection is tied to a sixfold increase in heart disease diagnoses in the weeks after infection, [compared](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/patient-safety-outcomes/large-study-ties-covid-19-to-6-fold-increase-in-heart-diseases.html) to those without COVID-19. The findings were published in PLOS Medicine. 23.

Pulse oximeter measurements are less accurate among Black, Hispanic and Asian COVID-19 patients compared to white patients. These inaccuracies may have led to minority patients receiving [delayed](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/patient-safety-outcomes/inaccurate-pulse-ox-readings-may-have-delayed-prevented-care-among-minority-covid-19-patients.html) or no treatment, according to a study published May 31 in [JAMA Internal Medicine. ](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2792653?guestAccessKey=d8afcdc5-9d61-48a8-875c-07e2c68646a4&utm_source=For_The_Media&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=ftm_links&utm_content=tfl&utm_term=053122) 33. in 5 adult COVID-19 survivors between the ages of 18 and 64 has [experienced](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/patient-safety-outcomes/1-in-5-covid-19-survivors-may-have-long-covid-cdc.html) at least one health condition that could be considered long COVID-19, a May 24 [study](#contribAff) from the CDC found. 34.
