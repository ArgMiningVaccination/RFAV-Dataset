The long-term clinical practice of traditional Chi- nese medicine (CM) confirms its importance andessential role in the health care system in China,especially in the prevention and treatment ofchronic diseases [1]. With its unique theoreticalsystem and accumulated clinical experiences, CMhas developed a comprehensive therapeutic ap-proach and gained the confidence of the public.More and more patients with chronic diseasesprefer the CM treatment or the integration of CMtreatment with biomedicine therapy. AlthoughCM is currently facing some significant challengesfrom both the application of modern medicineand social development, its practice still accountsfor around 20% of all health care delivered in Chi-na [2].The nutritional status and sanitary conditionshave been significantly improved for the peoplein China, and the major causes of mortality have changed from infectious diseases to coronaryheart disease and other chronic illnesses [3].Meanwhile, the Chinese government has realizedthat an affordable and easily accessible healthcare system will be essential for the stability ofthe country. \"The high cost to receive health care and the inconvenience to access it \"have become two major complaints among Chinese people [4].In an effort to address these concerns and providehigh-quality, affordable, and accessible healthcare to Chinese people, the Chinese governmenthas explored a number of approaches to remodelthe health care system, which has been signifi-cantly reformed since the beginning of the 1980s[5], and new initiatives were launched in 2006,which are aimed to provide at least one commu-nity health care center for every 30000 to100000 citizens. The centers will integrate West-ern medicine (WM, biomedicine) and CM, whichAbstract ! Chinese medicine (CM) has a long history of expe-rience and proven successful treatment for chron-ic diseases and has also played an important rolein the provision of health care in China. Patientswith chronic diseases are happy to accept CMand physicians are willing to use CM to relieve pa-tients suffering from chronic illnesses. The Chi-nese health authorities encourage CM develop-ment to meet the requirements for the treatmentof chronic diseases. CM products are an essentialpart of medications that have a predominant rolein the prevention and treatment of chronic dis-eases in China. A large number of CM clinicalstudies, including a substantial number of avail-able randomized controlled trials and systematicreviews, have shown that CM is effective and safein the treatment of chronic diseases. Although theefficacies of some evaluated CM therapies remainuncertain, it is worth assessing them by using CM pattern (Zheng or syndrome) differentiation toverify treatment outcomes. CM is considered tohave a better safety profile compared to pharma-ceutical chemicals, but inappropriate applicationsof CM also makes the safety issues a hot discussedsubject. As a medical system, CM should be ableto provide worldwide contribution for the pa-tients who are suffering from chronic diseases.The application of CM pattern classification in di-agnosis with corresponding prescribed treatmentusing herbal formulae in the relief of chronic dis-eases can be linked with modern biomedical pa-rameters (biomarkers) as treatment outcomes.These outcome parameters, together with the pa-tients reported quality of life assessment, can provide innovative approaches for evidence-based estimation of the efficacy of CM treatmentin chronic diseases.The Role of Chinese Medicine in the Treatment of Chronic Diseases in China Authors Miao Basic Research in Clinical Medicine, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, China 2The University of Sydney and University of Western Sydney, Sydney, Australia Key words l\"chronic disease l\"efficacy l\"safety l\"Chinese medicine l\"China received Nov. 11, 2010 revised March 16, 2011 accepted March 19, 2011 Bibliography DOI http://dx.doi.org/ 10.1055/s-0030-1270983Published online ChanHMREC Faculty Sydney andCompleMED ScienceUniversity 61 08 40 32 88 1lap64067611@126.com873 Jiang M et al.

CM is an Important Health Care Approach in China ! There is a saying in China: CM is good at treating chronic diseasessince it is focusing on the Ben (root) of the disease, and Westernmedicine (WM) is good at treating acute diseases since it is focus-ing on the Biao (phenomenon) of the disease. The distribution ofpatient visits in different departments in China hospitals in 2009showed that over 30% of the patient visits (both of inpatients andoutpatients) were found in the internal medicine departments(the majority of the patients had chronic diseases) in CM hospi-tals (l \"Fig. 1 ) [6], while patient visits to internal medicine depart- ments of WM hospitals are remarkably lower (about 21 -25%). The data also showed that there were more than 10% patient vis-its to CM departments of general (WM) hospitals (12.7% and18.8% inpatients and outpatients, respectively). The results indi-cated that the patients with chronic diseases in China are willingto see CM doctors either in CM hospitals or in CM departments ofWM hospitals.Two surveys on the use of CM from patients with chronic diseasesconducted by our team in Beijing from 2008 to 2009 also supportthat CM has been favored by these patients (unpublished data).The first survey was conducted on 968 patients with any of the4 most common chronic diseases in China: diabetes, hyperten-sion, coronary heart disease, and osteoporosis. The results showthat more than half of the respondents believed that CM thera-pies could help them improve their health situation. The othersurvey was conducted on the health care professionals in com-munity clinics in Beijing and focused on the major perception ofthe role of CM. A total of 306 medical staff members were in- cluded in the survey, and the majority expressed a desire to pro-vide both WM and CM for the patients. All of them expressedfully confidence on the important role of CM in the preventionand treatment of chronic diseases. Furthermore, a total of 278 re-sponders expressed their willingness to accept further CM train-ing to improve their health care career. The results suggest thatthe role of CM in the treatment of chronic diseases retains a goodimage not only for the public in China but also among the healthcare professionals.The data of recent years from the Ministry of Public Health of Chi-na shows that the quality and efficiency of the medical service inCM and WM hospitals are similar ( l \"Fig. 2 ) [6,7]. However the average expenditure for both outpatient and inpatient in CM hos-pitals was lower than in WM hospitals ( l \"Fig. 3 ), even though the average stay in hospital of inpatients in CM hospitals was longerthan in WM hospitals ( l \"Fig. 4 ). The data indicated that CM ther- apy is relatively cheaper than WM therapy. That might be one ofthe reasons why CM is favored both by patients with chronic dis-eases and professionals in community clinics and the Chinese au-thorities encourage the use of CM for the treatment of chronicdiseases.In the health care system reform of China, to set up the NationalEssential Drug List and Drug List for Insurance Coverage are pri-mary steps towards the provision of accessible, affordable, effec-tive, and safer health care for all. In the National Essential DrugList in China (issued in 2009 for community clinics), there are102 CM products out of total 307 drugs, and CM products are rec-ommended to treat patients with chronic diseases. In the Nation-al Health Insurance Drug List (Version 2009), there are a total of683 CM products (also called proprietary Chinese medicines,PCM) which are mainly for internal medicine application. Amongthem, 103 are commonly used for the treatment of cardiovascu-lar and cerebrovascular diseases. These essential policies on CMin China, which are based on its clinical effectiveness in a long Fig. 1 Distribution of patient visits in different de- partments in WM and CM hospitals in the year of2009.874 Jiang M et al.

China has been encouraging the development of CM products in the past 20years. The data shows that the output value of the pharmaceuti-cal industry in CM in 2007 was up to 669.7 billion RMB (Yuan) which amounts to 26.4% of the total value for the pharmaceuticalindustry in China. On the other hand, there are much more func-tional foods developed from CM in China. A study shows that, asof the end of September 2010, China had totally reviewed 10118functional food applications, and most of them are formulatedwith Chinese Materia Medica (CMM) ingredients. Among them, Fig. 4 Average stay (days) in CM and WM hospi- tals. Fig. 3 Average medical expense (Chinese RMB) per outpatient and inpatient in CM and WM hospi-tals.

These health products, with total salesabout 40 billion RMB (Yuan), have become essential productsused by patients with chronic diseases for prevention and reha-bilitation.CM as one part of the Chinese health care system has been fa-vored by both patients and medical professionals. Especially pa-tients with chronic diseases welcome CM treatment, and moremedical professionals believe that CM is good at the preventionand treatment of chronic diseases. Based on the preference forCM in the treatment of chronic diseases, Chinese authorities en-courage further application and overall development of CM in thehealth care system. CM Has Shown Efficacy in the Treatment of Chronic Diseases ! The very large clinical services of CM in China attract an increas- ing number of scientists focusing on demonstrating or providingevidence of the efficacy of CM for treating chronic diseases in thepast 30 years. Although the interest in and use of CM is not the most valuable indication that CM is effective, it does show at leastthat patients with chronic diseases and the physicians who treatthem are looking for CM therapeutic options.More CM clinical studies have been reported (in Chinese) in Chi-na over the past 30 years ( l \"Fig. 7 ), and the majority are observa- tional ones since it is still difficult to conduct randomized con-trolled trials (RCTs) for CM with its unique diagnostic approach.The observational clinical studies on CM do show its efficacy forthe treatment of chronic diseases. The treatment processes,which include individually prescribed, bulk-dispensed, water-based decoctions, are the professional standard of CM care in Chi-na [8]. This means that decoctions have their own particular indi-cations and uses in a large outpatient population. Usually, non-randomized controlled clinical trials and observational studiesindicate decoctions efficacy while their effectiveness tested by RCTs has not yet been verified.Recently, numerous RCTs have been conducted in China to evalu-ate the efficacy of PCMs generated from well-known Chinesemedicine formulae or from currently effective practice formulaefor the treatment of chronic diseases. Some studies have showngood effectiveness in the treatment of certain chronic diseases,such as hypertension [9], gastroenteritis on PCM is not comprehensive enough since theclinical trials are not so good to evaluate the individually pre- Fig. 5 The ratios of CM personnel to total health care professionals in China.

In fact, the bulk of current RCTs are testing one substance s action on a specific chronic disease diagnosed with WM (biomedicine) and aimed to prove the \"one size fits all\"hypothesis, while CM practice is more personalized and the herbal combination is prescribed individually on the basis of eachperson s particular CM pattern (Zheng or syndrome). As the evidence gathering tools, systematic reviews (SRs) andmeta-analyses provide synthesis of available research. The num-ber of SRs and meta-analysis on CM is increasing rapidly afterevidence-based medicine (EBM) was introduced and practicedin China. Here, recently published findings of SRs that explore arange of evidence on CM for the treatment of chronic diseaseshave been summarized.For herbal medicines used against irritable bowel syndrome, 75randomized trials, involving 7957 participants are included [19].Traditional Chinese formulae showed significant improvement ofthe global symptoms. 22 CMM demonstrated a statistically sig-nificant benefit in symptom improvement. Six tested PCMshowed an additional benefit from the combination therapycompared to conventional monotherapy. Some herbal medicinesdeserve further examination in high-quality trials.For Chinese herbal medicines used in the treatment of type 2 dia-betes mellitus, 66 randomized trials, involving quality was generally low.Some PCM showed hypoglycemic effects in type 2 diabetes. SomePCM deserve further examination in high-quality trials.Danshen (Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae) and related PCM were in-troduced into clinical practice for the treatment of ischemicstroke in 1970 in China. Six trials involving 494 patients were in-cluded [21]. These Dan Shen products were associated with a sig-nificant increase in the number of patients with a positive out-come. No deaths were reported within the first two weeks oftreatment or during the whole follow-up period. The authorssuggest that further high-quality randomized controlled trialsshould be performed.Most of the clinical studies have been shown to be inconclusiveabout CM for the treatment of chronic diseases [22 -25]. Reasons were multiple. Most of these projects employed \"standard \"ran- domized controlled designs that were not suitable for CM trialdesigns, and some of the research had not involved collaborationbetween WM and CM researchers. Thus, there was a failure toconsider only the fundamental concepts of CM. It is important toincorporate the concepts of both WM and CM into research pro-tocols, thus collaboration between WM and CM practitioners isessential. Despite the fact that RCT is considered to be the meth-odology offering the highest level of evidence, different types ofresearch are needed to answer different types of clinical ques-tions. Observational studies and case reports often are the best research methods suitable for certain clinical researches. CM effi-cacy research is one of them. A case report indicated effectivetreatment for diabetic foot ulcers with integration of CM andWM [26].CM is holistic and conceptual, and it identifies and treats patternsrather than diseases. Because of the unique characteristics of CMpattern classification, CM efficacy evaluation on one herbal prod-uct or preparation should focus on a specific subgroup of patientswith a specific disease. Unfortunately, many SRs on CM efficacy,which declared that there were no solid evidences to supportthe CM intervention efficacy and indicated that the quality ofclinical trials of CM are needed for collecting evidence to supportCM clinical application, have neglected the application of CM pat-tern classification [27]. For example, based on our search on Chi-na Biology Medicine (Chinese) and Pubmed (English) databases,there were 180 RCTs on Danshen herbal products, which is com-monly used in clinical practice in China for activation of bloodstasis (based on CM theory), and only two studies described thetrial design based on CM pattern classification. Since CM patternclassification is aimed to further classify the patients into sub-groups, the efficacy would be improved if the responsive casescould be distinguished from nonresponsive cases with CM pat-terns. Therefore, the incorporation of CM pattern classificationinto disease diagnosis, an innovative approach by additional spe-cific diagnosis based on CM theory for documented indications,would greatly improve the assessment of the efficacy of CM inter-ventions.It has been reported that CM pattern differentiation can help tospecify the indications for combination of biomedical therapy inthe treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and our previouswork indicated that the total effective rate of CM interventioncould be predicted to be 80% if 10% of the patients were classifiedwith a corresponding CM pattern [28]. This multicenter, random-ized, controlled trial suggested the CM pattern (or CM relatedsymptom assemblages) to have predictive roles considering theAmerican College of Rheumatology 20% response criteria(ACR20) evaluation in RA. Our other RCT was performed to com-pare the symptomatic effects on patients with benign prostatichyperplasia (BPH) treated by two therapeutic approaches, WMand CM, and the results showed that CM is a potentially effectivetreatment in improving the quality of life (QOL), prostate vol-umes, and maximum urine flow ratio (UFR) for a subgroup of pa-tients with BPH, and the non-urethra-related symptoms experi-enced by BPH patients might be one of the parameters for furtherdistinguishing the effects of CM and WM [29]. The results suggestthat it may also be useful in defining specific indications both for Fig. 7 The number of papers in total CM clinical studies and RCTs for 10 chronic diseases publishedin China from 1979 to 2009 in the Chinese Bio-Medical Literature Database (CBM)(http://sinomed.imicams.ac.cn/index.jsp).877 Jiang M et al.

CM interventions and biomedical therapies used for the treat- ment of other chronic diseases.RCT, as a good approach to evaluate the effectiveness of interven-tion, should be used widely in CM clinical study, and CM patternclassification should be incorporated into the RCT design in orderto make sure that we can assess the real efficacy of CM in thetreatment of chronic diseases. Following the active and impor-tant role of CM in the treatment of chronic diseases, the Chinesegovernment continued to raise research funding for evidence-based CM, and more than fifty CM RCTs programs were sup-ported in the \"Eleventh Five-Year \"plan (2006 -2010) by the Min- istry of Science and Technology. We believe that more positiveresults from RCTs with CM pattern classification will be shownup in the near future. CM Has Been Proved to Be Relatively Safe in the Treatment of Chronic Diseases ! CM is regarded as safe since CM practice has a history of several thousands of years, and it achieved personalized therapy bymeans of a successful organization of concerted actions derivedfrom holistic, multitarget, and multidimensional pharmacologi-cal actions [30]. However, the safety issues of CM have been es-tablished through experience of clinical practice during the evo-lution and development of the traditional practice.We searched literatures on safety and adverse drug reactions(ADRs) of CM treatment from 1978 to October of 2010 in the Si-nomed database (http://sinomed.imicams.ac.cn/), and there arealtogether 30631 related papers on the safety of CM. The increas-ing literature number on ADRs after the year 2005 indicated theclose attention paid to the safety issue of CM recently in China.l \"Table 1 shows the summary of adverse events for chronic dis- eases reported in SRs (CM vs. Pharmaceuticals) focusing on thecommon chronic diseases in China. The conclusion exhibited adesirable safety profile of CM compared to pharmaceuticals.CM products (including CMM) could be applied according to theprinciples of diagnosis and treatment in CM, and based on that,CM practice can be considered as safe. There are various studies reporting the good safety of CM decoctions in the treatment ofsome chronic diseases [35 -39]. Our survey also showed that both CM practitioners and patients believe that decoction is effectiveand safe (unpublished data). Although the majority of herbalproducts (PCMs) have been reported to be safe [40 -47], the safety issues were still more prevalent in many PCMs when com-pared to CM decoctions due to the usually long-period usage ofPCM. The latest published National Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR)Report by State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) assertedthat in the year of 2009, only 13.3% ADRs were related to Chinesemedicines, and totally about 2600 categories were involved inthese reactions, among which, 99.5% were relevant to PCM, lessthan 0.5% to decoctions. In particular, 52% of the total ADRs wererelated to CM injections [48]. In the past years, the safety issue onCM injections was a hot topic, and questions such as whether CMinjection could be considered to be a traditional dosage form andhow to set up the quality control were discussed both in scientificresearch and the administration field. The issues about CM injec-tion products have aroused the high attention of the authorities[49]. The SFDA has set up a mandatory documentation system forCM injections, with such determinations as the basic ingredientsin CM injections must be clear, the single components of the ac-tive ingredient injection should not be less than 90%, and the sys-temic clinical trials should be a prerequisite for safety assessment[50].To evaluate the safety of CM is complicated by using conventionalmethodological approaches since CM products are complex,which includes chemical complexity, in particular in prescrip-tions containing multiple herbal medicines, the lack of knownsynergetic active ingredients, the risk of contaminants such aspesticides, heavy metals, and the addition of other ingredients(sometimes pharmaceuticals), deterioration and variation incomposition [30]. Furthermore, the interactions between CMand pharmaceutical drugs might be another issue related to thesafety of CM, and it should also be addressed [51].Any kind of medicines when used inappropriately may turn ben-eficial pharmacological actions into toxicity [52].

Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. application of CM could lead to more ADRs in clinical practice. CM herbs (CMM) and CM products (such as herbal extract andPCM) recorded in the Chinese pharmacopoeia (version 2010) ei-ther have been used for thousands of years for prevention andtreatment of diseases in China or passed a strict safety evaluation,and when applied or prescribed according to CM theory, theyhave been proven to be safe. Also the potent and toxic CMMs areincluded in the Pharmacopoeia with warning and precaution touse. In addition, all the CM products were proven to have highquality, efficacy, and safety with strict examinations, includingthe tests based on Good Agricultural Practice (GAP), Good Sourc-ing Practice (GSP), Good Laboratory Practice (GLP), Good Manu-facturing Practice (GMP), and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) [53].Unprofessional CM practice or improper application of CM wouldlead to unfavorable adverse events. For example, in clinical re-search, it has been reported that the side effects of a Tripterygiummultiglycoside preparation in RA patients with CM dampness-heat pattern were lower than in patients with CM yin-deficiencyof liver and kidney pattern [54]. One retrospective study also pin-pointed that the main factors related to safety problems of theNiuhuang Jiedu tablet are irrational drug use and drug quality[55]. Thus, to ensure clinical rational application of CM and im-prove the quality of CM products are the major steps for saferCM application in clinics. On the other hand, some ADRs in CMtreatment might be due to the misunderstanding of CM. In viewof CM, some ADRs can be regarded as a sign of CM patternchange, and CM pattern can be a predictive factor for effective-ness. Thus, it is important to explore the correlation betweenADRs and efficacy. In a RCT, it was reported that gastrointestinalADRs were inversely correlated with efficacy in conventional bio-medical therapy for the treatment of RA [56]. To better achievethe goal of further analysis and comprehension on ADR, detailedand particular ADR related efficacy analysis is essential in clinicalresearch.CM safety profile is essential for CM application in clinical prac-tice, especially in patients with chronic diseases since they oftenneed prolonged treatment with CM products. Though clinical ap-plication based on CM theory and strict quality control can im-prove the safer application of CM, CM safety has not been fullydetermined, and further studies are needed to explore the mech-anisms of CM products in order to decipher their toxic activities. Major Issues for Worldwide Application of CM ! CM has been influencing the health care system in China forthousands of years, and supplies about one-fifth of the medicalservices nowadays in China. More importantly, CM takes an ac-tive role in preventive and rehabilitative medicine in China.Though CM has been spread worldwide recently, there are stillsome obstacles for further application of CM in medical servicesworldwide. The major issues include the CM specific diagnosticapproaches and interventions. CM specific diagnostic approach: pattern classification CM pattern classification is applied to stratify the patients basedon CM information. CM pattern classification has been proven tobe more essential, as many CM physicians prefer to prescribeherbal formulae for patients based on this classification. Increas-ing numbers of medical researchers recognized that the combi-nation of disease diagnosis in biomedicine and pattern classifica-tion in CM is essential for the clinical practice, and it has been acommon practice model in China since it may produce a better clinical effect [57]. However, there are still some problems in theapplication of CM pattern classification for the treatment ofchronic diseases in the biomedicine field.The first is that the practice of pattern classification is very diffi-cult, since pattern classification is mainly based on symptoms(including self-reported signs), tongue and pulse diagnosis [58].Poor understanding in CM pattern classification will lead to theunsuitable application of CM products, and most of the products(such as PCMs) are used by biomedicine doctors and can be ob-tained from markets. Furthermore, the unsuitable application ofthe PCM will result in lower efficacy and even higher risks insafety. Therefore simplifying the pattern classification would bethe most important issue for better understanding of CM by bio-medicine professionals for further CM application. A recent studyshows that the symptoms, though diversified in a disease, can beclustered into specific groups with biostatistical approaches [59].Thus, it is possible for us to find some approaches to simplify theCM pattern classification and to guide the application of herbalproducts in future clinical practice.The second problem is the lack of CM pattern criteria for clinicalpractice in the treatment of diseases. In some RCTs, patients withthe same disease were recruited and received CM or conventionaltherapies, respectively, and the CM pattern classification wasignored. In these studies, conventional treatment tends to pro-duce a better curative effect than CM. This should be the majorreason why the RCTs failed to evaluate the real efficacy of CMsince CM could be used only to treat part of the patients with cor-responding CM pattern. Therefore, CM pattern classification cri-teria become the key issue both for RCT and clinical practice. Re-cently pattern criteria were recommended based on expert con-sensus and analysis of CM information obtained from the disease[60]. We believe that the CM pattern criteria, even primary crite-ria, could be very helpful for further application of CM productssince they could be revised during the application.CM pattern classification, as the key in CM diagnosis, should bewell defined with biomedical language and thus CM would takea more important role in the treatment of chronic diseasesworldwide. CM specific intervention: herbal mixture CM intervention using herbal formulae which consist of severalherbs is highly individualized. In the past decades, more scien-tists have been trying to elucidate the chemistry and mechanismof CM intervention in the treatment of disease. Though manyprogresses have been made, there is still a long way to go in theclarification of the mechanism through which an herbal mixtureworks in the treatment of a disease. Furthermore, the clinicalpractice in CM abides by \"multiple formulae for one disease based on the changes of CM pattern and adjusting the formulaebased on the change of symptoms \", and this makes it more diffi- cult to elucidate the action mechanism of an herbal mixture.Theoretically, there must be some core herbal combinations inthe treatment of one specific disease. We propose a hierarchicalanalysis algorithm known as discrete derivatives, which is basedon the frequency analysis of herbal combinations used in all pub-lished clinical studies in China [61]. This algorithm can retrievesimple and meaningful herbal combination networks from largedata sets. Taking \"RA\"as an example, the \"core \"herbal combina- tions used in the treatment of RA consist of 19 CMM: RumulusGinnamomi (Gui Zhi), Rhizoma Radix Astragali (Huang879 Jiang ...Planta Med 2011; 77: 873 -881Reviews This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. Qi), Radix et Rhizoma Clematidis (Wei Ling Xian), Rhizoma other CMM commonly used together with the corecomplex combinations are often added due to the changes of CMpattern or symptoms after initial treatment [62]. The under-standing of the chemical profiles and bioactivities of the coreherbal combination will help to elucidate the action mechanismof the herbal formula.Systems biology investigations and symptoms analysis of CMMformulae can be applied as a holistic approach in analyzing theircomplexity. This approach has become an important direction forthe elucidation of the action mechanism of herbal mixtures [63].Our previous study showed that therapeutic efficacies of Salvia and PN in multiple pathways ofbiological processes. SM plays a principal role and PN serves asadjuvant to assist the effects during the treatment of coronaryheart disease [64]. Thus, we recommend applying systems biol-ogy, including data-mining from prescription analysis and bio-informatics, for elucidating the mechanisms through which herb-al mixtures work in the treatment of diseases, and studies ofquality and adverse effects when CMMs are not used properly[65].With the quality, safety, and bioactivity of CM formulae andproducts assured and their mechanisms elucidated, the clinicaltrials of these medications with patients reported outcomes should be placed in a priority position for providing CM treat-ment worldwide. Conclusion ! In summary, CM has been widely used in China with its conven-ient accessibility, affordability, efficacy, and safety in the treat-ment of chronic diseases. CM practice with quality practitionersand CMM products should be shared worldwide in the treatmentof chronic diseases for which WM does not have adequate an-swers. Although CM pattern classification of diagnosis and treat-ment, as well as complexity of CM prescriptions may require fur-ther translation into conventional health care terms, the applica-tion of modern biomedical science, bioinformatics, and chemicalprofiling of CM prescriptions can be applied to provide new di-rections for clinical studies with evidence-based approaches forassessing CM products and practice. Eventually CM will play animportant role in integrative health care worldwide. Acknowledgements !
