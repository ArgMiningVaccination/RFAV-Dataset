Visit us at Twin Oaks Chiropractic and Acupuncture in Springfield, MO. What Is Acupuncture? Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine practice that involves the insertion of thin needles into specific points on the body. It is based on the concept of Qi (pronounced \"chee\"), which is believed to be the vital energy that flows through pathways called meridians in the body. The goal of acupuncture is to balance the flow of Qi to promote health and well-being. Certain areas of the body correspond to other areas. Our practitioner uses these pressure points to help you with your pain. Once the needles are in place, they release blockages in our main energy path. Several factors go into how this will happen. It may be hand motions done by the practitioner. It may be electricity used on the needles. Once active, they can give you pain relief. Natural Medicine Several people love acupuncture because it's a natural way to treat pain. It doesn't require any harsh medications. It uses your body's chemistry to help you feel better. When we use acupuncture needles, they push our body to release its pain-relieving chemicals. This chemical release helps fight your pain and discomfort. When you get this treatment, the only side effects are a little redness or soreness. You don't have to worry about major side effects or drug interactions. This treatment is simple, and it's considered an outpatient procedure. You can return to work or do other activities when you're done. There are multiple studies on acupuncture. It's shown to help patients with pain.
