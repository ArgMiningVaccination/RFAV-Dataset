It causes inflammation and congestion in the small airways (bronchioles) of the lung. Bronchiolitis is almost always caused by a virus. Typically, the peak time for bronchiolitis is during the winter months. Bronchiolitis starts out with symptoms similar to those of a [common cold](https://www.lybrate.com/treatment-of-common-cold) but then progresses to [coughing](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/coughing), [wheezing](https://www.lybrate.com/treatment-for-wheezing) and sometimes difficulty breathing. Symptoms of bronchiolitis can last for several days to weeks, even a month. For the first few days, the signs and symptoms of bronchiolitis are similar to those of a cold: - Runny nose [Stuffy nose](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/stuffy-nose) [Cough](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/cough) - Slight [fever](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/fever)(not always present) Bronchiolitis occurs when a virus infects the bronchioles, which are the smallest airways in your lungs. The [infection](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/infection) makes the bronchioles swell and become inflamed. Mucus collects in these airways, which makes it difficult for air to flow freely in and out of the lungs. Most cases of bronchiolitis are caused by the respiratory syncytial virus (rsv). Rsv is a common virus that infects just about every child by the age of 2. Outbreaks of the rsv infection occur every winter. Bronchiolitis can also be caused by other viruses, including those that cause the [flu](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/flu) or the common cold. Infants can be reinfected with rsv because at least two [strains](https://www.lybrate.com/treatment-for-strains) exist. The viruses that cause bronchiolitis are easily spread. You can contract them through droplets in the air when someone who is sick coughs, sneezes or talks. You can also get them by touching shared objects \u2014 such as utensils, towels or toys \u2014 and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth. Risk factors- Infants younger than 3 months of age are at greatest risk of getting bronchiolitis because their lungs and immune systems aren't yet fully developed. Other factors that are associated with an increased risk of bronchiolitis in infants, or more severe illness due to bronchiolitis, include: - Premature birth - An underlying heart or lung condition - A depressed immune system - Exposure to tobacco smoke - Never having been breast-fed \u2014 breast-fed babies receive immune benefits from the mother - Contact with multiple children, such as in a [child care](https://www.lybrate.com/childcare)setting - Living in a crowded environment - Having siblings who attend school or child care and bring home the infection Prevention Limit contact with people who have a fever or cold.
