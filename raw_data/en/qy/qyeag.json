Apparently, despite the health concerns, more than two-thirds of eligible voters participated, the largest percentage in more than a century. Advance news from our program director Laura Scappaticci: we will host an online Holy Nights experience again this year, December 24 to January 5. \"A Rose By Any Other Name\" will be led by the Sophia Group. Registration details will be announced by December 1st. Around 900 people registered for these nightly offerings last year, and that was well before the pandemic hit. Leaving a Legacy of Will We recently sent out a mailing to members about the Legacy Circle and planned giving options. The Anthroposophical Society in America's [Legacy Circle](https://anthroposophy.org/legacy) is a group of devoted friends, past and present, who have made, or intend to make, a bequest or other planned gift. Legacy giving supports the work of the Society beyond a person's current financial capacity, and the magic of this Circle is that it can only continue to grow, whichever side of the threshold you are on. It is the ultimate multi-generational conversation. To learn more, please contact Deb Abrahams-Dematte [ [email](mailto:deb@anthroposophy.org)] or (603) 801-6584.

Charles quotes Rudolf Steiner responding to a question from teachers in the first Waldorf school: \"the children need to be surrounded by fluid, living color.\" In a video on [his website, lazure.com](https://lazure.com/), Charles observes that a standard opaque painted wall has only one choice of each of color's four properties: hue, value, intensity, and temperature. The translucent paints of lazure walls have flowing variety in all four properties. The [twenty-minute video](https://lazure.com/) gives many insights into the visual-artistic work in Waldorf, and there is also [an informative interview](https://www.framedestination.com/blog/arties-eight/charles-andrade-spotlight) with Charles online. | | | | |The |[Physicians' Association for Anthroposophic Medicine](https://anthroposophicmedicine.org/Patient-Resources) has sent out an email appeal: \"It only takes two minutes to leave a comment urging the FDA to recognize homeopathy as a healthy, effective form of medicine. Anthroposophic medicine uses many homeopathic remedies. [You can send a comment here](https://homeopathychoice.org/fdacomment). Why are we trying so hard to get 100,000 people to send a comment to the FDA? Here's a quick background. The FDA is proposing to reclassify all homeopathic medicines. This would allow them to treat all homeopathic medicines as illegal, and withdraw some, any, or all of them at any time. As a response, our friends at Americans for Homeopathy Choice submitted a petition to the FDA urging them to change direction. This petition is supported by 20 leading homeopathy organizations. Now, we're submitting comments to the FDA in support of the petition. When you leave a comment through the AFHC website, it goes directly to the FDA, as well as members of Congress and other federal officials.\" There's a prefilled comment which you can edit however you like.

In my new Medium article ' |[To See with a Thousand Eyes](https://medium.com/lotus-fruit/to-see-with-a-thousand-eyes-277bad2f8b6f)' I show how the internet affects our ability to read and think deeply. In it, I explore how deep reading works to develop the breadth of our imagination and human empathy. In my opinion, these skills are becoming progressively degraded in the age of the internet as has been documented by such writers as Nicholas Carr in his book The Shallows: What the Internet is Doing to Our Brains. In it, I draw on anthroposophical concepts such as the role of the word in the development of human consciousness, the role of attention in the development of our identity, and how imagination is essential to our humanity. Deep reading can help free us from the algorithmic control mechanisms built into the web and restore the human imagination to its rightful place. I hope you enjoy it and I look forward to [any feedback, positive or negative](mailto:editor@anthroposophy.org), that you might wish to share. Mabuhay! (To life!)\" \u2014 Boyd contributed an article to our summer-fall issue of being human: \"The Key to Digital Freedom: Learning to Deal with Discomfort\"; the whole issue will be available to read soon at [issuu.com/anthrousa](https://issuu.com/anthrousa) | | | | | | ESSENTIAL ANTHROPOSOPHY The power to help in the world clearly will involve our abilities to perceive and to think as well as the strength and conditioning of our will, the power to take action. There is a spectrum of will from faint wishes and day-dreams and inclinations to firm intentions and active commitments. Our feeling life is the mediator here, as is also shown in our physiology, where the calm contemplation of the brain and nervous system, and the active work of the arms and legs and metabolism, are mediated by the rhythmic life of the blood circulation and breathing. Rudolf Steiner spent many years researching this \"somatic psychology.\" The feeling life belongs to the \"astral body,\" and Steiner's book Theosophy gives its foundation as an interplay of two forces. Sympathy expresses feeling-with or -toward and letting affinity have effect, while antipathy expresses feeling-against or -away from, and the assertion of separate identity. We take part in a soul world of seven regions in which the lower three involve antipathy as well as sympathy; these have a formal correspondence to solid, liquid, and gaseous states in the physical world. When sympathy works with strong antipathy it creates a region of \"burning desires,\" of sensual urges and self-serving instincts. A balance of sympathy and antipathy creates a region of fluid receptiveness to sensations. When sympathy prevails there is an outreaching interest which is made personal by the remaining antipathy. In the central region antipathy ceases to be a factor, and we experience greater or lesser degrees of pleasure, like warmth or its absence, and our sympathy begins to involve itself in our surroundings. Our \"comfort\" reflects the mix of pleasure and displeasure. Obviously this parallels the conscious ego-development of our present evolutionary stage. And three higher regions reflect intensified sympathy. Here is where our helping activity comes fully into its own. The three stages might be shorthanded as shedding light, sharing health, and giving life. It is a joyful contemplation to discover these higher activities already at work in the world, and it is a powerful motivation to imagine their further course. | | | | | | | | | | |A new website, |[TheLiteraryArts.com](https://theliteraryarts.com/), has just appeared as a meeting place for Friends and Members of the Section for Literary Arts & Humanities who participate in local Section meetings in Fair Oaks, California.

But many of us fear emptiness. When we first glimpse emptiness, we taste the death in it. It feels like an abyss, a sheer drop into eternity, a dangerous negation of all that is alive, visible, safe, and good. We prefer to remain in the realm of form, surrounded by things we can see and touch, things we imagine are subject to our control.
