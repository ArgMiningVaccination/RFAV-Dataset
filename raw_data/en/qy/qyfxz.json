Many chiropractors and other natural healing professionals disagree with their findings. In my practice over the last 12 years I have personally worked with many families whose children were diagnosed with autism. Three of those families stand out as clearly noting when the signs of autism began... almost immediately after the 18-24 month series of vaccinations. By the time a child is 18 months old they are supposed to have had 44 vaccines. By the time the child reaches school age (4-6 years old) they should have been injected with 77 different vaccines, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Whether or not the vaccine court recognizes the connection specifically between immunizations and autism, there are many other chronic diseases where vaccines have been implicated. The population of the U.S. is the most highly vaccinated group of people on the planet. And the sickest! The CDC states that nearly half of Americans suffer at least one chronic disease, everything from allergies to heart disease. 20% of Americans suffer from two or more chronic illnesses complicating their care and making it more expensive. They go on to report that these chronic illnesses account for 70% of all deaths in the U.S. So is there a connection between chronic disease and vaccination? Increasingly the evidence says \"Yes\"! Vaccines are the injection of disease organisms or parts of microorganisms deep into the body where they can move directly into the major systems and organs of the body. This is very different than the naturally contracted disease which is filtered through a series of immune system defenses which begin with the hairs and mucous membranes in our nasal/sinus tract and includes the intestines, lymphatic system and the highly specialized cells in our bloodstream which have by now been warned as to the invaders presence and have had time to prepare a proper defense. The natural exposure results in a \"total immune response\". Rather than a relatively brief, mild and rarely dangerous acute infectious disease, (measles, mumps, chicken-pox, pertussis, etc.) we seem to be contributing to long-term, life-long chronic illness. The point here is this - when we prevent the body from externalizing its poisons, that is, prevent it from having an acute reaction with fever, malaise, skin eruptions and the like, we drive disease deeper into the body where it is difficult or impossible for the individual to externalize it. And so we hold on to the toxic burden, the disease organism itself and the potential for disease to eventually manifest in another fashion. Hippocrates, the \"father of medicine\" stated \"Diseases are crises of purification, of toxic elimination. Symptoms are the natural defenses of the body. We call them diseases, but in fact they are the cure of diseases.\" There is no proof that vaccines have eliminated any childhood disease and there is no proof that vaccines are responsible for the decrease in death from childhood diseases. The death rate from these diseases had been deceasing for decades before the vaccines were introduced. For the most part the decreases in incidence were attributable to improved housing, better sanitation, better personal hygiene practices, a decrease in the virulence of microorganisms but most importantly to higher host resistance due to better nutrition. What we've not discussed so far is the contents of the vaccine aside from the disease organism itself and the effect the accumulation of these toxins can have on the body. Preservatives and contaminants found in all vaccines can include heavy metals such as mercury and aluminum, formaldehyde (used to preserve dead bodies), borax (ant killer), ethylene glycol (antifreeze), acetone (nail polish remover), latex, plus... monkey, cow, chick embryo, pig, sheep, dog and other animal tissues and cells often contaminated with animal viruses. It's these contaminants, especially the heavy metals, which Dr. Hugh Fudenburg, M.D. implicated in a talk he gave to the CDC in September 1997. He stated, \"The chances of getting Alzheimer's Disease is ten times higher if an individual has had five consecutive flu shots than if they had one, two or no shots\". Over the next few months I intend to delve deeper into this subject. Each month we'll explore a few of the many \"Questions All Parents Should Ask About Childhood Vaccinations\". Some of which will include: 1) Are vaccinated children healthier than non-vaccinated children? 2) Do the \"benefits\" outweigh the risks? 3) Are vaccines effective? 4) Are vaccine doses personalized? 5) Did vaccines eliminate childhood diseases? 6) What's in a vaccine? 7) Does good science support vaccination efficacy/safety? 8) Can you legally avoid vaccination? And many others, so stay tuned to this column for an in depth look at this controversial subject.
