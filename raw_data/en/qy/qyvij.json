Train-ing schedules can thus established based on a moreprecise knowledge of an individual's maximum capac-ities and the-time necessary to recovery from Parti:-cular exercise loads. We know that the use of drugsand vitamins are not the means toward successfulsports performance so that we can refute the Claimsof the hucksters who tell us that they are.The psychology of practice and competition hasbeen extensively explored and described in.a- volu-minous literature. National teams now have teampsychologists who work with groups and individualsto help them understand their motivations, towardsport and to overcome the problems and frustrationswhich may prevent them from reaching their ,goals.Experience has shown that it is equally importantfor the psychologists to work with the coaches aswell as the athletes.Some of the most remarkable contributions ofsports science have been in underStanding the prob-lems posed to the athletes by their environment.We know how the human body reacts to high ambientair temperature and humidity, to extreme cold andhigh wind Velocity, to low barometric pressure ataltitude and to increased pressure in underwateractivities and we know the counter measures thatcan be taken-And how to treat the injuries and ill-ness that occur when these measures are not takenor prove to be ineffective.Because injuries are inevitable concomitantsof sports, physicians have been provided with an.2normous volume of externally caused traumas and in-ternally generated overuse injuries to manage bysurgical and non-surgical means. As the result ofthis experience techniques of treatment have beendeveloped which now return the majority of injuredathletes to their sports, ordinarily without resid-ual disability. The demands of sport which require that function be restored to normal, or as close tothat as possible, have forced the development ofprocedures which are now applied regularly to non-athletes as well.Synchronized swimming as a recreational acti-vity has been applied only minimally so far to theuses /of handicapped persons, as a means of develop-ing Individual physical. fitness, and to the purposeof rehabilitating the convalescent ill and injuredthrough a pleasant, expressive, rhythmical exerciseprogram.This still awaits a more general knowledgeof the sport, and a,greater availability of time inexfsting pools, experienced instructors and fundsfor\\programs.Future growth in theses areas willemphasize the important interaction between thissport and the entire field of sports medicine. 4 WORK (EXERC1_SE) PHYSIOLOGY:USEFUL CONCEPTS FOR PHYSICAL FITNESSDonaldi. Kirkendall, PhD When the synchronized swimmer.takes her placeat the start of a competition, her training ideallyhas prepared her for all aspects of that competition.She must have achieved a level of skill in her tech-nique,s and a level of physical fitness necessary tocarry out her routine. Upper and lower body stren-gth, sufficient conditioning, significant body flex-ibility and physical power are but a few of thecomponents of fitness that the synchronized swimmermust contend with in her training. When Comparingperformances, the athlete who usually succeeds isthe one who can sustain performance at a higher andmore intense physical work level and, if performing.at a submaximal level, can perform more efficiently.All coaches are concerned with the condition-ing of athletes under their charge, for withoutphysical fitness, performance rapidly declines. Itis helpful to both coaches and most athletes to havean understanding of work (exercise) physiology andhow it applies to physical conditioning and perform-ance.Work physiology is that special area ofhuman physiology that examines the effect of physicalstress (exercise; athletic performance) on physio-logical function. In this section you will be in-troduced'to the major concepts involved, and subse-quent authors will provide some useful informationand programs specific,to the training of synchron-ized swimmers.We can classify any exercise on a basis of theinterplay of 3 factors; resistance (amount of.forcethe body must produce to overcome resistance),speed/power (the rate at which a movement is per-.formed; power = work per unit of time), and duration(length of time the activity is to be performed.)(Figure 1)It is advisable to orient yourself withthe graph realizing that exercises located near theorigin (intersection of the 3 axes) are the leaststrenuous and those farther out on any axis repre-sent more strenuous activities, with the boundariesdepicting maximal exercise. In the course of thisand other sections, you may find it useful and 5 necessary to refer to this figure. SPEED/POWER RESISTANCEDURATION Figure 1- INTERPLAY OF SPEED, RESISTANCE AND DURATION 1= Distance running, 2= Wei.ght lifting In order to perform physical work, it is necess-ary to provide the cells with a fuel. Nutritionalaspects of performance will be dealt with more comp-rehensively. in the section on nutrition*; however,as we ingest nutrients they are digested and absorbedby the stomach and intestines and affect physiology. *Ed. note:see Porcello, pp. 66-88 Three foodstuffs are considered in exercise;fats, carbohydrates, and proteins. Fats are brokendown to their component fatty acids and glycerol,reabsorbed in the intestine, first to the lymphaticsystem then to the blood stream and then adipose(fatty) tissue. Fats are stored until needed to fuelthe muscles for exercise. Carbohydrates are brokendown to simple sugars and reabsorbed, reassembledin the liver and muscles as glycogen after intes-tinal absorption and vascular transport. Proteinsare reduced to their component amino acids, absorbedand transported to the cells to be used as buildingblocks cf muscle and bone or as components of er-zymes, hormones and buffers., Proteins generally addlittle as a fuel for exercise.We perform work in one of 2 ways; aerobic, inthe presence of oxygen, or anaerobic, without oxygen.The intensity and duration of the exercise dictatethe system which supplies the major amount of energy.(Figure 2).In aerobic exercise, glycogen and fats 100 CONTRIBUTION TIME Figure 2PERCENT CONTRIBUTION OF THE RESPECTIVEMETABOLIC PATHWAYS 7 \" supply the fuel and in the process are broken down toCO,and H2O.The metabolism of these fuels producesa Nigh energy compound (ATP) which contains energystored within the chemical bonds of the molecule.When ATP is split, energy is liberated and work canbe performed.In the process, CO2 and H 20 are the subsequent end products. In anaerobic exercise a similar, if less efficient, process occurs exceptthat the end product is an acid; lactic acid to bespecific.Obviously, aerobic metabolism yieldsmore easily eliminated waste products. And, con- sidering the supply of fats in the body, can supplyenergy for extended periods of time. Anaerobic met- abolism, on the other hand, has specific limits on how long it can keep supplying energy (less than 1minute of sustained, maximal, totally anaerobicwork in the absolute, Lheoretical state); hoWever,it can supply energy very rapidly. Both systemsoperate in conjunction with each other and are nevercompletely independent of the other.So far we've seen the ingestion of nutrients,their storage as fuels and their being metabolizedfor work with or without oxygen. But how does the oxygen get to the cells to be used in metabolism?Oxygen is picked up from the lungs and attaches toa molecule in the red blood cell,. hemoglobin, forthe transport to the cells which are in need. The blood then passes to the left side of the heartand pumped to the body through arteries. They branCh ever smaller until capillaries are observed. Capill- aries, the smallest of vessels, are where the ex-change of gases, nutrients, and waste products takeplace.Oxygen is passed to the tissues and CO is picked up and transported through larger and la2 rger vessels and eventually reaches the right side ofthe heart where it is pumped to the lungs to beexcreted.This process must occur because the bodyhas, for all intents and purposes, no real ability.to store oxygen, and CO2 buildup could cause chemi- .cal changes that are not compatible with performance.COMPONENTS OF FITNESSIi, considering the concept of \"phyaical.fL Jess,it must be clear that no one component best represents8 the concept.The demands of the sport define theemphasis on the components necessary for success-ful performance. A marathon runner obviously needsa high degree of aerobic endurance when compared toa 100 meter sprinter while the reverse is true o2a speed/power component. In considering fitness,we see a number of components of which the coachneeds to be aware when designing a training program.Emphasis of the following elements will vary withrespect to each sport. Reference is also made tothe classification figure when visualizing some ofthe components.Aerobic Capacity: This more than any other vari-able has been utilized as an excellent (best?)measure of fitness, more specifically, endurance.Two factors are contained within; i.e., the abilityof the central cardiovascular system to transportoxygen to the working muscles and the ability ofthe working muscles to use the oxygen delivered.When the body is at rest, it is in what is referredto as a steady state; i.e., the energy demands ofthe body are being met by the oxygen supply. Ifwork is to be, done, with CO2 and H90 as the desiredwaste products, a \"-',ew, higher steady state is nec-essary.As more oxygen is needed to supply theworking cells, it is necessary to breathe more oftenand more deeply. Also, the heart rate increasesto move the oxygen rich arterial blood to the mus-cles faster.The body does not jump to this new,higher, working steady state; there is a periodwhere anaerobic means supply the energy and thismeans some buildup of lactic acid. This lactatebuildup is not usually decreased until the end ofthe exercise or during much less intense periods ofexercise.To rid the body of lactate, oxygen is con-sumed and lactate proceeds through aerobic metabolismto CO2and H2O.Thus, the reason behind extendedheavy breathIng following exercise, to partially ridthe body of lactate accumulated when adjusting tochanges in work intensity during the exercise.Activities which train the' aerobic system are thoseof low speed and resistance and high duration; e.g.,running, swimming, bicycling, rowing, cross - country.skiing.Most people in the field Advise that about 20-30 minutes of continuous exercise 3 day/week isthe minimum needed to place an adequate trainingstimulus on the aerobic system. Field tests ofaerobic power are available. Two of the bettertests include the 12 minute run (total distancecovered in 12 minutes) and 1.5 mile run for time(average values for women are about 1.25 mlles and15:00' respectively). The more aerobically fit ath-lete will run farther in 12 minutf. or faster forthe 1.5 mile run. At present, a similar swimmingtask has not been validated. However, followingthe 1:4 conversion (energy to 1/4 mile swimming =1 mile running)- might give n, a5 yet unvalidated,statement swmTing Capacity: perform explosive activitiel, of ,hort duration.While it is the least understood of the components,a couple of things art,, known. There are 2factorshere also, a power component for maximal, intenseshort term activities (less than 10 sec, the ATE' -PC system) and another for slightly longer (lessthan 1 minute) intense activites. Research indi-cates that the former factor, needed for activitieslike weight lifting competitions, is trainable, i.e.,we can indrease the body's ability to turn over ATPfor such requirements while it appears that the latterfactor is not. This means that neither training pro-gram used in research has been intense enough tocause a change or the methods for quantifying changesare not discrete enough. Until we get more conclu-sive information, it appears that the body alreadycontains sufficient capacity to perform explosiveefforts lasting under 1 minute. Consult Figure 2again.Remember that 'the energy systems are veryclosely integrated and that these time spans men-tioned are determined.in theoretical -situationswhere only that one system is functioning. Therefore,it should be fairly clear that because we cannotseparate these factors, it is very difficult tostudy.While this is true, it appears that resistiveexercises (strength training) interval trainingand/or circuit training seem to have positive effectson performance tests that supposedly measure anaero-bic power. 10 Strength:Strength is normally defined as the abilityof the muscle to provide a maximal force with a singlecontraction.Strength increases strength, the basis of which appearsto be a change in the size, not in the number ofmuscle fibers.Development of strength over the range of motionof a limb is quite important. This means thatstrength should be developed at each angle of motionthat the limb moves through. As a result, isometricsonly strengthen the muscle at the angle at which itwas trained.More traditional, isotonic, methods arebetter.Free weights, or machines (e.g., Universalor Nautilus) are isotonic means Proper executionof the movement will ensure that flexibility is notsacrified.Isokinetics (e.g., \u00b6ybex, Minigym) allowmaximum force to be generated at all ranges of motionat controlled velocities. One added benefit of iso-kinetics is the-reduced amount Jf soreness usuallyassociated with strength training. While free weightsappear to be the best method of increasing strength,for athletes new to lifting, the machines are pro-bably the easiest and safest devices for strengthtraining.Women should not shy away from trainingwith weights because they are afraid of \"bulkingup.\"In order to add a great deal of muscle weight,the hormone testosterone is needed. As women producelittle of this hormone, there are usually only slightincreases in muscle mass. Yet, they will still in-crease strength. While men will show greater abso-lute gains in strength, if the same results are com-pared on the basis of non-fat weight (weight of thebody minus the weight of fat) the women actuallyshow greater gains. This may be p4rtially due to thefact that women had little experience with strengthtraining programs and, therefore, have more room forimprovement.Details about weight programs can befound in sections (the amount of work that can bedone in a specific time span, i.e., force x 'distancetime) component is one which has considerableinterplay with the central nervous'ssystem and hered-ity.Production of power depends on the reception ofthe stimulus (e.g. hearing the starting gun), pro-duction of power (recruitment of the particularmuscle fibers specific to high power output) and theamount of high power fibers that a person was bornwith.Power is quite specific to the sport, that is,power for the shot put does not necessarily transferto the power needed for, say, soccer goalkeeping.Flexibility:The range of mevement through which ajoint moves is referred to as flexibility. Thiscomponent is particularly important in synchronizedswimmers.With little flexibility of the legs andhips, the proper execution of split positions can bequite difficult. It should be emphasized that flexi-bility appears to be specific to the joint and is nota general whole body trait. Detailed informationabout flexibility can be found in Burke's articleon warm-up and flexibility.*Basis of 'FatigueA major limitor of performance is not one easilydefined or measured, but here are a number of vari-ables which contribute to fatigue, which is mostevidenced by a loss of motor skill; i.e., an in-ability to correctly execute a skill.Lactic acid has been looked into extensively asa, cause of fatigue. One of the p-oblems with lactateis that it causes a change in the normal chemicalbalance (pH) of the system, and this change (decline)in the pH can hinder the ability of the cell to pro-perly produce energy. It is possible that thisculprit may be one of the major limitors of perform-ance in synchronized swimmers. Psychological fatigueis a factor, but is not considered in this section.In longer duration activities, like the marathon,*Ed. note:see Burke, pp. 16-28 12 losses of muscle glycogen, body water (dehydration),increased body temperature and mineral losses* allcontribute to the physiological aspect of fatigue.Due to the time element of the synchronized swimmingroutine and the nature of the sport (i.e., a watersport, therefore little chance of overheating becausethe water is helping to keep the swimmer cool),these sources probably contribute little to the feel-ing of fatigue perceived by the athlete.The Specificity of Training ConceptIt should be evident that a specific exercise_causes specific changes in the cells and the body.Endurance exercise (low power and resistance andhigh duration, 1 in Figure 1) causes increases in theaerobic component while high strength exercise (highresistance, low power and duration, 2 in Figure 1)train for increases in factors associated with an-aerobic fitness. No one method of training willincrease the body's capability to perform at all theextremes in Figure 1. The muscles respond to specifictypes of overload. For example, running on levelground places different demands on the body than notonly bicycling, but also uphill running as well. Asa result, a training program needs to encompass thecomponents as they are used within the sport. If asport is by nature endurance oriented, then powerand resistance are usually sacrificed, meaning thatone rarely sees a distance runner lifting heavy weightsnor do you often see .a 100 meter sprinter putting inextended miles in preparation for his event. Theytrain specifically for their event. This should notbe construed as \"playing your way into shape.\"Strength and flexibility training, for example, maybe necessary as supplemental training methods foroptimal performance. If the coach examines theperformance critically, the need for stressing therequired components becomes obvious. The adequateperformance of many of the skills depends on out-standing flexibility. Some of the dynamic, explo-sive movements demand that a certain amount of powerspecific training be incorporated into the trainingregime while the aerobic fitness of the performer is*Ed. to con- struct a training prolam that %;ill he specific for the event as this will usually hring .-tht the phy-siological preparation necessary for optimal per-formance. itisthe purpose of this volume to supplysome needed intorm,ition to help you construct thebest program ':or your personal situation. c',41 h.., REFERENCES Life, Wiley,1979.Mathews, D.K. and Fox, E.L.

Burke, Phi) This chapter is composed of information on suchtopics as(I)the eitects of warm-up on performanceand injury, prevention sore-ness, and (3)the importance of flexibility andflexibility exercises.WARM-UPMany coaches wonder how important warm-up isand what form and length of time should be spenton warm-up prior to competition and training. Thereare a number of physiological reasons why warming-upshould be beneficial. Besides an increase in thespeed and force of muscle contraction, ventilationand oxygen transportation is increased, and so isblood circulation. With these, \"second wind\" is moreeasily achieved and the strain on muscles, tendons,and ligaments is decreased.Astrand (1978) states warm-up would give thebenefit of higher muscle temperatures during swimm-ing and that the chemical processes used to produceenergy will be increased. For every degree rise inbody temperature metabolism within the muscle cellwill rise approximately 13%. At the higher temper-ature, the exchange of oxygen from the blood (hemo-globin) to the muscle would be increased. Nervetransmis ion travels faster at higher temperaturesand improves both the contractile force and contrac-tile speed in the muscle. All of these as well asother factors have been shown to be affected bywarm-up.There are two types of warming-up: active and\"passive.The first type is most commonly used and canbe subdivided into two subtypes: related and un-related.Related refers to performing the specificskills of synchronized swimming such as figures,movement progressions, the routine itself, or freeswimming.Unrelated warming-up usually consistsof exercising the large muscles of the body in waysnot related to synchronized swimming, such as cal-isthenics or flexibility exercises. Related warm-up 16 has the effect of raising body temperature and effect-ing the nervous system while unrelated works onprimarily raising the body temperature. Passiveheating by hot baths, hot showers, Turkish baths,diathermy, and massage have been found to have someeffect on increasing performance. When possible(if a pool is available) active warm-up should beused, however, unrelated and passive warm-up willbe of some use if no pool time is available beforecompetition.Warm-up should be intense enough to increasebody temperature, but not so intense that it willcause fatigue. Obviously, the intensity and durationof warm-up must be adjusted to the individual swimmer.Better performance results when a 15-30 minute ratherthan a 5 minute warm-up is used.There is also a psychological effect inherentin warm-up, since it helps the athlete to achievea state of mental readiness. Warming-up throughrelated exercises appears to improve coordinationby developing the swimmer's awarenessand will establish a neuromuscular pattern of per-formance.The warm-up should begin to taper off 10to 15 minutes prior to competition and end 5 to'10minutes before performance if. possible. This willallow recovery from any slight fatigue without losingthe effects of the warm-up. While active warm-upmay be impracticable before final competition (be-\"caase of bathing suit and make-up considerations)unrelated and passive warm-up should be used.One of the real values of warm-up is in itsuse as a preventative measure. It has been shownby Start and Hines (1963) that adequate warm-upprevents strains, muscle tears, and muscile sorenessthat would probably occur if the swimmekswent intofull performance without it. Morehouse an-&-Miller(1971) state that those muscles mostoften injuredare the muscles which oppose the strong contractingmuscles.When not prepared these opposing musclesrelax slowly, thus restricting free movement. Thusit seems that muscle injury is indeed a real possi-bility when vigorous exercise is not preceeded by 17 proper warm-up.In summary, the best available evidence justi-fies the following principles for warming up: 1.Warm-up should be hard enough to increasebody temperature, but not so difficult asto cause fatigue.2.Warm-up increases the speed and force ofmuscle contraction.3.Warm-up is important fOr the preventionof muscle soreness and injury.4.Warm-up brings on second wind more readily.5.Whenever possible, a related warm-up ispreferable so that a practice effect maybe achieved at the same time.6.If active, related warm-up is impossible,passive or unrelated warm-up can be used.MUSCLE SORENESSAt one time or another, every synchronizedswimmer experiences muscle soreness that can beattributed to such things as starting a weight train-ing program, a sudden increase in aerobic swimmingyardage or effort, or the addition of difficultfigures.The pain usually sets in between eightand twenty-four hours after exercise and is normallygone itt,a few days.One commonly held theory attributes the speci-fic soreness to tissue damage, such as microscopictearing of the muscle or connective tissue. Thishypothesis was developed by Hough in 1902, but wasneither proven by him nor anyone else since then.Some authorities attribute muscle soreness toincomplete removal of muscle metabolites. Eitherthe production is so great or blood flow is soreduced (or a combination of both) that there isan accumulation of substances that are toxic to themuscles and nerve endings. Such excessive fluidaccumulation might account for swelling of the mus-cle, making nerve endings more sensitive. This formof muscle stiffness is the type which usually occurs 18 after several days of hard practice. As a resultthe muscle becomes swollen, shorter and thicker.A good warm-up or massage can help reduce this sore-ness.Work by DeVries (1974) has led to the \"musclespasm theory\" of delayed muscle soreness. Thesequence of events may go as follows: 1. the syn-chronized swimmer works out hard; 2.there is temp-orary lack of blood flow to the muscles; 3.thisischemia (lack of blood flow) causes pain in the_nerve endings, probably activated by the release ofa \"P substance': across the muscle membrane intothe tissue fluid; a reflextoxic muscle ischemia and the circle is complete.Much of DeVries research leads to the use ofstatic stretching to redUce soreness. Electromyo-graphic equipment (which-records electrical activity.of the muscles), showed less activity in muscles afterthe use of static stretching. Symptomatic reliefseems to parallel lower electromyographic values.Recently work by Abraham (1977) has givensupport to the concept that exercise induced sore-ness may be related to the disruption of connectivetissue in the muscle and/or to their attachments.Tremendous stress is placed upon the synchronizedSwimmer's muscles and tendons performing eccentriccontractions during a-routine or while lowering aheavy weight.In contrast, during concentric(isotonic,isokenitic) contractions, only the con-nective tissues associated with the tendons arestretched.The tension developed during eccentriccontractions is, after all, greater than that possi-ble during other types of contractions, and this 'hasa greater effect on the swimmers connective tissue'causing muscle soreness.What does DeVries and Abraham's By following a sound pro-gram of warm-up and stretching, the swimmers may havea certain degree of control over muscle soreness. 19 To traLn the swimmer properly and avoid unduesoreness, the coach must stress the athlete's bodyto the correct degree and then allow it to recover.A progressive program calls for the continual ad-justment of the difficulty and intensity of theworkouts.When the swimmer is in top shape, addingsomething new such as weight work, hard intervals,or difficult figures should be done gradually.FLEXIBILITYKlafs and Arnheim (1977) consider flexibility,or the ability to move freely in various directions,one of the most important objectives in conditioningtheir athletes. Good flexibility will increase thesynchronized swimmers ability to avoid injury.Since it permits a greater range of movement withinthe joint, ligaments, and muscles these tissues arenot so easily strained or torn. It'also permits hera greater range of movement in all directions. Theredefinitely appears to be a relationship betweeninjury and joint flexibility. The \"tight\" synchron-ized swimmer performs under a considerable handicapin terms of movement, besides being much more injuryprone.Stretching also provides an excellent form ofactive unrelated warm-up.The range of motion, measured in degrees, arounda joint or group of joints is referred to as flexi-bility.For example, the flexibility of the elbowjo'int is the range of movement from full extensionto complete flexion. A synchronized swimmer's abil-ity to perform a swordalina rotation is dependentupon the flexibility around several joints includingthe knees, hips, and spinal column.Three factors limit flexibility. The first,the bony structures of the joint, cannot be affectedby stretching exercises. In some joints the bodystructures are the predominant limiting factor.Theelbow and knee joints are examples. Second, theamount of bulk surrounding the joint. An exampleis the restriction of elbow flexion by the mass ofthe biceps muscle. At most joints, however, the thirdfactor predominates. This factor is the degree of 20 extensibility of soft tissue around the joint:. Thesesoft tissues include the ligaments, tendons, andmuscles.Stretching of the soft tissues throughflexibility exercise gradually increases the distancethey can be lengthened, thereby improving the rangeof motion.The shoulders and hips are excellentexamples of joints where flexibility is only slightlylimited by the bony structures and can be greatlyincreased through stretching exercises. Interestinglyenough% a high degree of flexibility in one jointdoes not necessarily indicate a similar level inanother joint. The \"flexible\" athlete must work on all joints of the body.Some interesting aspects of flexibility arethat it can be systematically improved; it is nota difficult component of fitness to modify. Con- sidering these facts for such reasons as enhancedskill execution, possible injury. prevention - itwould appear that fifteen to thirty minutes ofstretching would be a valuable addition to a train-ing program.Two forms of exercise have been used to stretchmuscles and connective tissues, ballistic and staticstretching.The first method of ballistic stretch-ing puts the body part into motion and carries itthrough the range of motion until the muscles arestretched to their limits. Unfortunately, actionsof this kind elicit a reflex in the opposing muscles(antagonist muscles) which limit the range of motion.Static stretching involves placing the muscles attheir greatest possible length and holding thatposition for a period of time. Reaching down to touch the toes with the knees straight and thenmaintaining that position for approximately 30seconds is a static flexibility exercise.Both methods are effective in developing flexi-bility, but there are a. greater number of advantagesassociated with the static' method. There is lesslikelihood of overstretching and injuring a muscle.Static stretching seems 'to relieve muscle soreness,while the ballistic method may cause soreness. 21 liatha yoga 1H also an excellent means of appoach-ing static stretching. The liatha yoga approach Isstow, smooth, and coordinated; movements flow 10rhythmically controlled breathing. Although someof the positions in yoga appear passive or r2laxed,they arc actually posktive and dynamic. Slowlystretching'muscles to full length and then holdingthem in absolute stillness causes blood to circu-late evenly throughout the body. This allows therange of motion to be increased in all muscles, lig-aments, tendons, and joints. Special emphasis isplaced on increasing or renewing spinal flexibilityby stretching. Each pose is a means to feel inwardlyand discover your own areas of strength, flexibility,and energy.If you are. already stretching regularly,yoga can enhance the effects by giving .you a focus.Before portraying some static and yoga stretch-ing exercises, let's review some of the basic princi-ples: 1.Flexibility can be limited by bone structureor by soft tissues. When it is limited bythe soft tissues, great improvements can bebrought about by the proper stretchingmethods.2.Stretching by jerking or bouncing methodsinvokes the stretch reflex, which actuallyopposes the desired stretching.3.Static and yoga stretching is safer thanballistic methods because it does not imposesudden strains upon the tissue involved.4.Stretching provides an excellent form ofactive unrelated warm-up.5.The basic guidelines are as follows:Teach the athlete to stretch withintheir limits, without straining. Whenthey begin the stretch, the first 20to 30 seconds are spent in an easystretch, they should re relaxed.Next,have them go a little' further so thestretch becomes more intense but itshould not cause actual pain, Strainingwill keep them from relaxing, bothmentally and physically. 22 B.Do not.let them hold their breath whilestretching.Thin wilt only cause ten-,!lion and detract from the relaxed, state.C.Stretching Ls not a contest, the ath-letes should not compare themselves.D.Variety is the key, so why not createthree or four different programs.Below are a series of stretching exercises whichcan be used in a routine.

Detection of the injury canbe done in a'number of ways. Injury evaluation canbe simplified if the coach understands the mechanismor sequence of, the injury. Evaluation is continuedby methodically inspecting the injury.Injury evaluation can be simplified if we followan orderly sequence. This evaluation techniqueshould he used for every injury, no matter how severe.The following three steps should be followed:History:Take a good history pertaining to the injury 30 sequence.Ask the individual such questions as:How did it happen?When did it happen?Have you injured this area before? If so,what happened then?What kind of pain do you feel?Was it evaluated by a physician?Did you hear any noise when it happened?After you have collected data about the injury,then ask the athlete to point to the area that \"hurtsthe worst.\"If they are specific in their reaction,,it will make the evaluation somewhat less complicated.Inspection:Visual examination will give the evalu-ator pertinent information about the injury. Bylooking at the injury we can note any obvious de-formity, swelling, and skin coloration. It is ad-visable to compare the injured body part with theopposite body part if this is possible. When wecompare the \"good\" to the \"bad,\" we actually have agood basis of comparison.Palpation:PalpatingPalpating or feeling the injured areawith your fingers often can reveal several factors,namely the extent of poi1t tenderness and whetherthe oftencleAermine a 4eformity that maynot be noted in the visual. examination. While pa;.-pating the skin, be aware of body temperature. ---/Note if the area is colder or warmer than the restof the body.These can be important signs of circu-latory impairment (warmer).During might ask the individual?'*o gently movethe body part to her point of pain. Movement shouldnot be done if you suspect a fracture and/or dislo-cation.In less severe injuries, such as strainsand sprains, range of motion testing is done. Firsthave the athlete actively take the extremity throughpain free range of motion. Then passively take theathlete through range of motion to the point of pain.Lastly, manually muscle test the injured part throughrange of motion. Manual muscle testing can 31 distinguish which muscle or muscles are strained.Range of motion testing allows you to note any in-crease or decrease in motion and to compare strengthbetween the \"good\" and the \"bad\" extremity.The above three steps may seem involved buteven the most inexperienced trainer or coach canand should try to follow the three steps. Remember:H.I.P. - history, inspection, palpation. It willmake your evaluation easier. Collect basic informa-tion and as you become more aware of conditions yourevaluations will become better. It is most importantto take a good history. As a good history gives thephysician pertinent information, it will also enableyou to possibly eliminate certain problems and mostof all,if the injury is related to a certain techni-que the swimmer is using, maybe she needs correctionon that technique. Many chronic conditions occurand persist because the swimmer is not performingthe technique properly. If this is the case, thecoach can try to eliminate or lessen the problemthrough coaching.COMMON ATHLETIC INJURIES AFFECTING SYNCHRONIZEDSWIMMERS*Acute ConditionsStrain is a stretch, rip or tear in a muscle, musclefascia or tendon.Etiology:muscle imbalanceabnormal muscle contraction_abnormal range of motion (forceful)Symptoms:muscular spasmloss of muscle functionpainswellingindentation due to muscle tearSprain is an overstretching or a tear of ligamentsand connective tissue around a joint. *Information adapted from Klafs, C.E. and Arnheim,0.D.:Modern Principles instabilityContusion is a crushing of soft tissue (a brut // e).Etiology:compressive external force to softtissueSymptoms:skin discolorationpainswellingpossible limitation of movement --------due painDislocation isa total disunion of bone oppositionbetween articulating surfaces.Etiology:external force causing the joint togo beyond its normal range ofmotionSymptoms:loss of limb functiondeformityswelling and point tendernessSubluxation rs a partial or incomplete dislocation.Etiology:same as dislocationSymptoms:sensation that something \"slippedout\" and back inloss of limb functionswelling and point tendernessFracture is an interruption in the continuity of abone; a broken bone.Etiology:compression of bonecrushing a tendon of a muscle.Etiology:'improper care of muscle strainsequelae of acute strains to a muscle/tendonimproper performance techniqueoveruse syndromeSymptoms:pain muscle functionpain at tendon \"crunchy\" or raspy)swellingBursitis is inflammation of a bursa.Etiology:traumaoveruse in a abnormal fashionSymptoms:swellingpainlimitation of range of motionSynovitis is inflammation of the synovial membrane,often known as \"water-on-the-knee\" when the kneesynovia is inflamed.Etiology:traumaoveruse in an abnormal fashionSymptoms:swellingpainlimitation of range of motionChondromalacia is a degeneration of the back of thepatella (knee cap).Etiology:several minor or severe injuries tothe knee or patellaSymptoms:chronic painweakness in quadriceps muscle groupcatching or locking sensationpoint tenderness around patellaswellingSHOULDERThe muscles are the locations for most shoulderinjuries in swimmers.

It isimportant to check the opposite shoulder's range ofmotion so that you can compare the increase or de-crease motion noted on you evaluation.ELBOW, WRIST AND HANDIt is felt by the author that the bony struc-tures of the elbow, forearm, wrist and hand are notfrequently injured in synchronized swimming.

Muscle Testing of the Upper Arm 36 KNEEThe knee is often injured in synchronizedswimming due to the stresses applied to it duringthe eggbeater kick. This kick can traumatize theknee unless the knee is strong and the proper tech-nique is used.There are a number of injuries and conditionswhich occur at the knee joint. Evaluation for lig-ament, meniscus or cruciate injuries should be doneby an, orthopedic physician. When in doubt of yourevaluation, consult a physician. Fewer or even lesssevere injuries may be noted if the muscles sur-rounding the knee joint are strong. It is importantto condition the knee joints throughout the full rangeof motion.Often muscle injuries occur to a jointwhen a muscle group on one side of that joint isstronger than the muscle group on the opposite side.Therefore, equal conditioning should be done to bothsides of the knee joint or any joint within the body.To compare strength between the hamstrings and quad-riceps use the muscle testing techniquos,,in Figure8.*Manual muscle testing is a means to Compare eachknee's strength in the hamstrings or quadricepsmuscle groups.

V IMMEDIATE INJURY CAREAcute in\u00b0juries will need immediate treatmentfollowing your evaluation. Treatment phases can.bedivided into two categories--early phase and latephase.Early phase of injury _treatment involvesfour procedures: cold application, compression,elevation and immobilization. It is easy to rememberthe letters I.C.E. for ice, compression and elevation.These steps are designed to hinder swelling and de-crease 'effusion of fluids to the injury site.EARLY PHASE OF TREATMENTCold Application .. Cold application will cause capillary vasocon-striction thus decreasing the amount of blood flowinto an area.Along with vasoconstriction, cold willdecrease muscle spasm, inflammation and pain sen-sations.CompressionCompression is provided by the application ofan elastic bandage. Choose the correct size for thearea you are wrapping. I feel it is best to apply aspiral wrap with app.roximately 1/2 to 1/3 of thestrength taken out of the wrap for compression to anacute injury. ,Be,aware that the wrap may cause con-striction of blood vessels it applied too tightly.instruct the athlete that if she feels a tinglingsensation, lack of sensation or any other abnormalsensation, that she should remove the wrap and re-apply it with less pressure. Be sure the athleteknows how to apply,the elastic bandage. It is bestto remove itat, bedtime and rewrap the injury in themorning.ElevationElevation requires the injury be elevated abovethe level of the heart, if possible. This willprevent fluid accumulation at the injured area.Elevation enhances venous flow and will hopefully 39 4 minimize swelling in conjunction with ice and com-pression.ImmobilizationImmobilization varies dependent. upon the speci-fic injury.If a physician ordcrc complete immobili-zation of the upper extremity he will use a sling orshoulder immobilizer. Lower extremity immobiliza-tion is done with the use of crutches and joint immo-bilizers.Partial immobilization or rest may meanthe athlete does not perform an activity that aggra-vates an injury. Often times a few days, rest canmake a great difference when treating chronic condi-tions such as tendinitis or bursitis. Consult aphysician when immobilization and rest are indicated.SUGGESTED COLD THERAPIESIt is important to note the length of time coldapplications are used and the frequency of treatments.Ice bags, cold whirlpools, cold hydrocollators, iceslushes and ice towels are applied 20-30 minutes.After approximately 30 minutes the body reacts to thecold and begins vasodialation to warm the body backto normal temperature. Therefore, instruct theathlete to remove the ice after 30 minutes. Patienttolerance should be noted during the treatment. Ifshe complains of any side effects, such as extremepain, nausea or discomfort, remove the ice and selecta different.cold therapy. Cold therapy can be usedduring the first 1-72 hours, depending on the sever-ity of the injury.Ice BagsPlastic bags filled with ice are the most econ-omical cold modality. Commercial cold packs can bepurchased if .you do not have access to ice cubes.Apply the ice bag to the area using a wet towelor wet elastic wrap between the injury and the ice.Ice bags should be applied for 20-30 minutes, a min-imum of three times daily for the first 1-72 hours. 40 Cold WhirlpoolAverage temperatures for a cold whirlpool rangefrom 40 -60 F. Length of treatment time is 20-30minutes.Cold HydrocollatorsCold hydrocollators are commercial cold packskept in, a stainless steel unit at 10 F. They shouldbe wrapped in a wet towel and applied to the injuryfor.20-30 minutes, three times daily'for the first1-72 hours.Ice SlushA bucket of water filled with ice chips. Thismethod of cold therapy tends to be the most uncom-fortable.Ideally, treatment time is 10-20 minutes.The athlete will immerse the extremity in the bucket,remove when painful, and return it to the slush astolerated.This is used mostly for injuries to thehands and feet.Ice TowelsWet towels containing ice cubes or chips.Treatment time is 20-30 minutes, three times dailyfor the first 1-72 hours.Ice CupsIce cups are paper cups filled with water andfrozen.Peel the paper back, smooth the ice withyour hand, and rub ice directly onto the skin.Treatment time is between 7-10 minutes. This coldmodality can be used the second day of cold therapyif desired.Some therapists and trainers feel thatdue to the fact that the ice is rubbed directly.tothe skin, chilling is rapid, and the body in turnwill rapidly start vasodialation. If so, ice cupsare not indicated in the first 24 hours because wedo not want to increase blood flow to the area. 41 LATE PHASE OF TREATMENTThe last phase of troPtrPnt is designed to en-hance the healing procc-L, Llzbling the athlete toreturn to normal activIts. During the last phase,heat therapy, rehabilitaciye exercises and strength-ening programs are used.The heat therapies can be divided into twogroups:superficial heat and deep heat modalities.Most coaches and athletes have access to the super-ficial heat modalities. Deep heat modalities re-quire a physician's prescription and a physicaltherapist to apply them. Therefore,I will not gointo detail concerning the use of deep heat modal-ities.Superficial and deep heat modalites cause vaso-dialation of blood vessels thus causing increasedcirculation, relaxation and analgesia. Therefore,heat treatments will enhance healing. It is import-ant to begin heat therapy when you feel the bleedingand swelling have stopped. If you begin the heattreatment too soon you will cause increase edema.Late phase of treatment usually starts after 48-72hours, depending on the severity of the injury.Consult your physician when in doubt.SUGGESTED HEAT THERAPIESWarm TowelsPlace towels in sink under hot water, wring outand apply to injury. (If they are too hot to pick up,they are too hot to use.) Change as they cool down.Length of treatment time is 20 minutes, three timesdaily.Warm ShowerSuggest that your athlete stand in the showerfor 20 minutes, three times daily. This is ideal forshoulder and back injuries. It is suggested thatthey do this prior to entering the water if they havean injury to either the shoulder or back. 42 Warm WhirlpoolAverage temperature for a warm whirlpool whentreating an extremity is between 95 and 105 F.Full body whirlpools should never exceed 100 F.Treatment time is 20 minutes at least twice a day.Gentle exercise can be done while in the whirlpool.Warm tub soaks or the use of a bucket of warmwater can be substituted. Always check the temper-ature.What seems warm to you may be hot to another.Depend on a thermometer and not your hand.Hot HydrocollatorHot hydrocollators are commercial hot packs.They are canvas bags filled with a silicon material.They are kept at approximately 150 F in the hotpack unit.They should be wrapped in at least eightlayers of towelling. Length of treatment time is20 minutes, three times daily.Heating PadsHeating pads can be set at low, medium and high.Caution the athlete that the heat should be a \"com-fc:rtable warm\" sensati-on. Anything other than thatis too warm.Treatment time can be 20-30 minutes,three times daily. Warn your swimmers not to go tobed with the heating pad on. It is electrical andcan cause severe burns.Deep Heat ModalitiesDeep heat modalities include ultrasound, shortwave diathermy and microwave diathermy. All threeare good when applied properly and under a physician'ssupervision.Heat therapy can cease when the athlete feelsnormal, pain is diminished and normal range of motionis attained.It may be necessary to continue rehab-ilitative exercises even though you have stoppedheat treatments. 43 REFERENCES Brunnstrom, Signe.

Generally, participantsare in good physical condition with very few in-juries encountered in our sport that would requireextensive physical therapy treatment and /or sur-gery.However, we felt that it would be valuableto both coaches and competitors to discuss the abovementioned affectations and offer suggestions,corrections, and exercise programs to avoid furthercomplications Cr extensive injury.Weight training and flexibility programs areequally important in developing strength and en-durance and in prevention of injury. Since thesetopics are being covered in other sections of thismanual, they will not be discussed in any length,only, to emphasize that these two entities, in addi-tion to good coaching, nutrition and a strong watertraining program, seem to be making the differencein development of the top caliber swimmer. Briefly,I will mention that in observing the swimmers work-ing out on the various stations of the UniversalGym, the muscle groups that appeared weakest werethe' arm muscles, including the shoulder rotatorsand the deltoid muscles, the triceps and biceps ofthe upper arm, and wrist flexors/extensors. Allof these are extremely important to the skill ofsculling and more specifically, support sculling.The abdominal (stomach) muscles also showed weakness-es when the girls performed bent knee sit ups on theslant boards.These muscles are instrumental inmaintaining good posture and also strong, straightvertical positions in figures. Finally, the quad-ricep and hamstring muscle groups which are respon-sible for full extension in ballet legs and strengthin kicking (particularly eggbeater), and the tendon 45 and ligamentous structures surrounding the kneejoint, proved to be weak.POSTUREWhat is posture? Itis the proper balance andalignment of the spinal curves of the body in theupright position. If one were to drop a plumb linethrough a side (lateral) view of the body, it wouldcross the mid-ear lobe, mid-shoulder, midway betweenthe chest and back, mid-hip bone area, and slightlyforward of the knee joint and ankle bones. Inobserving alignment from a rear (posterior) orfront (anterior) view, the plumb line would coincidewith the midline of the body with fairly equal dis-tribution on either side of the line. If both legsare equal, the hip bones (pelvis) will be even aswill the shoulders.Evaluation of the synchronized swimmers at thetraining camp and at national meets, indicated manytypical posture faults including slight forwardhead, rounded shoulder, \"sway back\" (lordosis),protruding, stomach and \"back knees\" (hyperextension).One of the key factors for control of good postureis adequate abdominal strength and proper \"pelvictilt\" (flattening of the curve in the low back).The angle of the pelvis (hip bones) determines theangles of alignment of the upper curves of the spineand if properly controlled, will improve and main-tain a more erect posture. In more detail, commonposture problems view from the side, include:Forward Head - The head and neck are held for-Ward and downward with the chin pulled towardthe neck and the face downward.Round Upper Back - Also known as thoracic ky-phosis.The normal curve of the thoracic spineis increased and may be accompanied by a swayback and rounded shoulders.Round Shoulders - The shoulders are forwardwith the tip of the acromion forward of thegravitational line. The shoulder blades are 46 separated and their borders appear pointed orprominent.Hollow Back (Sway Back)- Also known as lumbarlordosis.The normal curve in the lu :tbar spineis exaggerated. The pelvis tips down in frontand the abdominal muscles become stretched. Wethen see the stomach protrude and the back mus-cles and posterior ligaments in the lumbar re-gion are shortened and become tight, holdingup the back of the sacrum (tail bone) and ro-tating the pelvis forward.Hyperextended (Back) Knees - In observing thelegs from a lateral view, the backs of the kneesare excessively curved (bowed) backward with noindication of even the slightest bend or flexat the posterior surface of the joint.Posture faults viewed from the bark (posterior)are generally termed as Scoliosis, a word derivedfrom the Creeks, meaning twisting or bending. Veryfew spines are straight laterally, and what is seen,are defined curves to one side or the other of thespine.The most common scoliosis is the \"C\" curve,which consists of a long convexity to one side. The\"S\" scoliosis consists of reverse curvatures, later-ally in one direction in the upper back and theopposite direction in the lower back. There can beunevenness of the shoulders with one lower'than theother and some rotation in the spine. This causesprominence of the ribs in the posterior aspect onthe side of the curve, with the corresponding shoul-der blade pulling away from the ribs. If there is adifference in leg length, or hip jont problems, thehips (iliac crests) will be uneven.A method of practicing good body alignment isperformance of the Standing Pelvic Tilt. Stand withyour back to a wall and with both heels about 10inches from the baseboard. You may begin with kneesslightly bent and the shoulders forward, if necessary.Flatten the low back against the wall by pulling upthe front of your pelvis, hold it as you straightenyour knees and-raise your shoulders. Walk one foot 47 atatime back toward the wall, maintaining thepelvic tilt until your heels are about 5 inchesaway.Hold this posture and walk away from thewall.THIS POSTURE SHOULD BECOME A HABIT.Contributing facto s to \"sway back\" postureof the lower spine with 'ynchronized swimmers couldbe the over emphasis on ached backs in split andwalkout positions in figures. Coaches often stressincreased flexibility of the spine without theaccompanying abdominal strengthening exercises tocounteract this extreme body position. The \"swayback\" posture is often comparable to the typical\"gymnast's walk.\" \"Back knee\" or hyperextended kneesin swimmers may stem from thestressing of fullextension in ballet leg positions which tends toover-stretch the hamstring musculature in the backof the knee.Forward head and rounded shoulderscan be a problem of the \"too tall\" adolescent affect-ed by peer pressure, and inner emotions also playsa role in this lazy posture. We see the shorter`girls stretching to their full height by standingon their toes, protruding the chest and arching thelow back.The full bosomed girls, affected by peerpressure or often assume a round7shoulderedposture for concealment. Muscular tension, parti-cularly in the neck, shoulder and shoulder bladesis occasionally experienced by swimmers before com-petition and can have an adverse effect on posture.The practice of relaxation techniques can aid indecreasing much of this tension.Perhaps, in some ways, our swimmers are tooflexible and we need to counteract this with amore intensive muscle strengthening program to pre-vent joint laxity, muscle weakness and poor bodyalignment.The coach can play an important role inspotting obvious posture faults and if in need ofprofessional advice, can contact a physical thera-pist who could conduct a postural screening evalu-ation and suggest appropriate exercises to correctthe problems.\"Good posture is a good habit. Oncewell established, it should take little voluntaryeffort to maintain it. Attainment of good postureshould not be regarded as a rigid disciplinary 48 measure, but rather as the development of a habitwhich Sont:ributes to the well-being of the individ-ual.\"Two basic exercises for increasing abdominalstrength are: 1.Pelvic Tilt - on floor with kneesbent and feet flat. Tighten the abdominal musclesand squeeze the buttocks together. Flatten the lowback against the floor by rocking the hips back(pelvis).Hold five counts and release. Do not pushdown with your feet or hold your breath. 2.Sit Up(Curl Up) - same position as above, doing pelvictilt first.Tuck chin and slowly raise your headand shoulders (curl up) and reach for your kneeswith both hands. Hold five counts while breathingout slowly.The feet may be hooked under and objectfor stabilization. You may also vary the positionof the arms by crossing them on the chest or puttingthe hands behind the head. If one has access to aweight training room, abdominal strength can he en-hanced by performance of the sit up on a slant board,hooking the feet under the cushioned pads for stabil-ization.When this is mastered, use of a 5lb. handweight held behind the neck can be employed for addedresistance.KNEE PAINThe most common irritation of the knee jointexperienced by our swimmers seems to be chondromal-acia of the patella (knee cap). This is a degenera-tive process, cause unknown, which involves the undersurface of the knee cap and the highest incidenceis found in young adults. Pain may be variable, ex-hibited as a catching, instability; a locking, pop-ping or crackling; a weakness or swelling in the kneejoint, or tenderness to pressure. Ruling out suddentrauma, arthritis or an injury related problem,possible causes that I see in the physical therapyclinic are as follows: postural faults in standingand walking, as with hyperextended knees; wearingearth shoes with a negative heel or heavy hikingboots; weak muscles and ligaments surrounding theknee joint which allows the knee cap to move freely;participation in a sport or strenuous activity for 49 which the unconditioned pOrtiOn Iiiunprepared.Ailof the above reasons may cause undue, stress on t. heknee cap, forcing It hack into the joint, allowing in-creased mobility without support and consquentlyIrritating the under surface of the patella (kneecap).This induces wear and Lear on the cartilagematerial within the joint. IL has already beenstated that synchronized swimmers are occasionallyconfronted with this irritation, resulting fromforceful knee extension in various figures withoutthe benefit of adequate strength In the quadricepand hamstring muscles. This Is the reason why weighttraining and progre,slve resistance exercise programsare so impootant for strength development and avoid-ance of injury.In order to correct o ehondromalacia irritationwith the presence of \"back kaee,\" I recommend walkingand standing with a slight bend in the knees, avoid-ing the \"snapping back\" action. Also important, isthe avoidance of negative heel (earth shoes andheavy hiking boots which tend to inc12.asepressureon the knee cap as the heel strikes Lhe ground inwalkiv:g, by 'forcing it further into the joint andproducing irritation. Any knee bending tape exercisesor activities, such as stair climbing, are traumaticto the joint ,Lod should be avoided until '.he pain hassubsided.The basic strength building program thatis us-d with a high incidence of .success is straightleg raises with graded weights, 'performed in three'positions:sitting, sidelying, and on the stomach.Exercises are to be done 10 times each (slowly),2-3 time,: a day. App-'cation of ice to the kneeis done ':,afore and/or after exercise if swelling orirritation ar' present. Since bending (flexing) theknee joint ;.end'. to cause irritation, avoid this act-ion in the ezefcise regime.Knee straio or sprains are also encountered inour sport.As explained in the basic anatomy term -inoloy, sprains may vary from a complete tear of aligaffient to a minor tear of a few fibers wiLhout theloLs of ligament stability. Strain may bv! considereda physical force on the tissues exceeding normV,Istress,but not causing deformity damage.The knee \"joint 50 suptains A sprain whoa a force is exerted that ex-ceeds normal range of motion of the joint. Abnor-mal motion includes abduction (outward) or adduction,(Inward) of the extended knees, excessive rotation,hyperextenlion or hyperfiexion or any cOmbination ofthe above.A contributing factor to knee strain in synchron-ized swimming is the eggbeater or alternating whipkick which Is used in routines or in a varied formin the breast stroke. Injury is usually to the tib-ial collateral ligament, part of the medial collater-al ligament located on the inner surface of the knee.The action of holding the hip and the knee in theflexed position, knee pointed forward to outwardwith the constant inward rotating whip of the lower-leg, produces a constant build-up of tension on thejoint and can be the cause of eventual strain. Thearea on the inner surface of the knee is usuallysore, with point tenderness evident %Men palpated.Treatment for this type of strain and other liga-ment strains usually consists of ice, pressure-wrapsand elevation when out of the water. Ultrasound,when ordered by the physician, has also proven valu-able in relieving the symptoms. Cortisone injectiononly plays a minor role and is used as a last resort.The kick itself can be modified so that there is lessstrain on the inner surface of the knee and occasion-ally, total rest may be necessary for a persistantproblem.4In addition to the previously mentioned straightleg raises, isometrics and short arc exercises arealso used in a strength building program. Quad Sets(tightening the quadricep muscles): With leg straighttry to flatten knee and tighten the muscle in frontof the thigh.Hold 5 counts; relax. Hamstring Sets:With the leg straight, push heel down into floor andtighten muscle in back of the thigh. Hold 5 counts;relax.Short Arc Quad - Large towel rolled under knee; keep-ing back of knee on roll, try and lift heel untilleg is as straight as possible.

The motions of externaland internal rotation at the shoulder joint in thepushing away-pulling action of the support scull,can cause undue stress on a joint and its surroundingmusculature which has not been properly stretched andstrengthenedto withstand these forces. In analyzingthe support scull action, the shoulder joint performsthe \"unnatural\" type movement that can place an un-believable amount of strain on the tendons of thejoint.\"Pain can result in any of three conditions:1.abnormal strain on a normal joint, 2. normalstrain on an abnormal joint, or 3. normal stressupon a normal joint when the joint is unprepared andgraded for that particular activity.\"2 The thirdcondition aptly applies to synchronized swimmers whohave not adequately prepared themselves throughstrength and flexibility training.Tendinitis is defined as an inflammation of'thetendon sheath, the tapering end of a muscle bellywhich attaches itself to a bony prominence. This af-fectation is responsible for 90% of shoulder painand disabilities.2 It is often classified in otherterms as bursitis, capsulitis or frozen shoulder.Inflammation of the biceps tendon seems to be the onemost prone to strain in the support sculling action,and to a lesser degree, the external rotator anddeltoid muscles are affected. The first symptom ispain which can vary in intensity. This is usuallyfollowed by some limitation in shoulder motion. Restand treatment at this stage may reduce pain and allowthe return of pain-free motion, although it may notbe necessary to completely eliminate activity. Iceis the preferred treatment to decrease irritationduring the acute phase, usually 2-3 days. This can52 he followed later by moist heat. Somellmesia HlIngis used to Immobilize the loInt,.but this should nothe prolonged as the shoulder joint will \"tIghten up\"causing further problems.

These are done at 10repetitions each, 2-3 times daily. in more severecases, analgesics such as muscle relaxants and ster-lod injections are employed by the physician.'['he hest method of avoiding shoulder strain anddiscomfort is an intensive shoulder and arm strength-ening program coupled with flexibility exercises.Increasing the strength and endurance of the bicepand tricep muscles and deltoid and rotator muscles ofthe shoulder joint can aid in preventing injury andimproving the sculling power of our swimmers.SWIMMER'S SHOULDERSince our synchronized swimmers participate inheavy swimming workouts in the early season and con-tinue them to some degree throughout the year, theyare also susceptible to a condition called \"Swimmer'sShoulder.\"The medical definition of the affectionis impingement of the humeral head and the rotatorcuff musculature on the gcromion process during ab-duction of the shoulder.'In the freestyle stroke, abduction of theshoulder occurs during the recovery phase when thearm is up or out of the water. At this time the'shoulder joint is also in external rotation andelbow flexion. During the pulling phase of the strokethe arm comes down into the water in adduction, in-ternal rotation and elbow flexion. In addition tothese two phases, 90-100 degrees of body roll occurs,with the swimmer rolling into the stroke, to get morereach and power on the pull.

Itis common knowledge that fat people floatbetter than thin people, and this is because fattissue isLess dense than other tissues.

Mean andstandard deviation are recorded. Height is recordedin centimeters (1 inch = 2.54 centimeters) and totalWeight and lean weight are in kilograms (2.2 pounds =1 kilogram).These results point out that the top synchronizedswimmers are from 20 to 22% body fat. But, is 20 to227 body fat the most ideal percent body fat for asynchronized swimmer? This question is now beingraised by many coaches. Should the girls remain atthis percentage and assume the fat adds in buoyancyor would a decrease in percent fat and increase inlean body mass (muscle) increase strength and execu-tion of figures. Thesequestions need to be answer-ed by further research. Of course, it should b re-membered that a routine requires a fair degree ofaerobic fitness and a high percent body fat may havea negative influence, on performance. At the presenttime it is safe to assume that the percent body fatof the girls should not be much above 227.Losing WeightIf you suspect that a particular athlete is over-weight, only three alternative methods are availablefor reduction of weight: 1.increased energy.ex-penditure and constant food intake, 2. decreasedfood intake and constant energy expenditure, 3. acombination of methods 1 and 2.In most cases, energy balance is altered tocreate a negative caloric balance of approximately1,000 kilocalories/day. Each week the athlete wouldlose approximately 2 pounds of fat (3,500 kilocalories 61. =1lb.fat).The caloric in,.ke can be reduced by500 to 800 kilocalories a day, and the hard trainingathlete, should never consume less than 2,000 kilo-calories a day. Lesser intakes of energy will resultin Increasing utilization of muscle mass as an energysource.Less than 2,000 kilocalories a day andswimmer will begin to feel sluggish, be moreto over-stress symptoms, and be susceptable to ill-ness.\"Fasting\" diets should have no place in theirprogram.In addition the swimmer should increase theirenergy expenditure by 250 to 500 kilocalories a day.Increasing the calories deficit through exercise isessential if weight is to be lost at a desired rateand as fat, while taking a 2,000 kilocalorie diet'.5The dieting athlete should observe the followingsuggestions: 1.Eat a well balanced diet.2.Eat smaller, but more frequent meals.3.Chew food slowly and thoroughly.4.Avoid fasting and fad diets.S.Replace water loss.6.Reduce carbohydrate intake.7.Decrease intake of solid fats.8.Keep protein intake up.9.Use unsaturated fats and oils.10. Emphasize intake of fresh fruits andvegetables.11. Snacks should be nutritious; no junk food.12. Supplement diet with a multiple vitamin andmineral tablet.Gaining WeightFor the synchronized swimmer who desires to gaidweight, the increased mass should preferably repre-sent muscles rather than fat. Simply adding bodyweight will not be to the swimmers advantage, unlessthe tissue can be utilized for increased performance.Thus the athlete should be encouraged to initiate aweight training program (if one is not already used)in conjunction with increased caloric intake. 62 A realistic schedule is important in any weightgaining program. An excess of 2500 calories is need-ed to gain one pound of lean body mass by the activeswimmer.If she IA already consuming 3000 caloriesa day, she can gain approximately two to three poundseach week if she is able to ingest 4000 calories aday.Itis important that they do not exceed morethan an extra 1000 to 1500 calories a day, if accumu-lation of excess fat is to be avoided. The high cal-oric diet should take, place only on days of vigoroustraining.Below are listed some guidelines to follow in a.weight gaining program: 1.Check the general composition of the foodthey eat.Protein should average 15 to20% of the diet. These levels will provideabundant protein to provide the amino acidbuilding blocks for new lean body mass.2.Check their living habits; are they gettingenough rest and sleep.3.Evaluate the diet in order to determine thecaloric intake. The reason for underweightmay be that the current caloric intake doesnot meet their daily needs.4.Protein supplements are not needed if theathlete is consuming a balanced diet.5.There are several high caloric food supple-ments on the market. For example, EnsurePlus (Ross Laboratories, Columbus, Ohio)contains 355 calories in an 8 oz. can, whichis composed of 14% protein, 31.5% fat, and54.5% carbohydrate. A can with each meal,along with the normal dietary intake, wouldbe an effective means tb-increase both cal-oric and protein intake.6.In recent years the use of synthetic anabolicagents (steroids) has received much publicity.The scientific literature is still not inagreement as to its positive effects of in-creasing muscle mass which will be of bene-fit to the athlete. Whais known is thatany female who takes them for as long as afew weeks may develop acne, deepening of thevoice, excessive body hair, and enlargement63 of the breasts (because some of the hormonesare converted to the female hormone, estrogen). Itis obvious that the use of these hormones hasno place in any athletics and will be detrimental tothe swimmer in the.long run. .REFERENCES 1.Fox, E.L.Sports Physiology, Philadelphia, W.B.Saunders Co., 1979. 2.Hall, L., Anthropometric Estimates of Body Densityof Women Athletes in Selected Athletic Acti-vities, Doctoral Dissertation, Ohio StateUniversity, 1977. 3.Katch, F.I. and D.K. and E.L., The PhysiologicalBasis Physical and Athletics,Philadelphia, W.B.

Priorto this time, the typical diet of athletes was pri-marily vegetarian and consisted of barley or wheat .porridge, fruits, vegetables and goat's milk. In450 B.C., a trainer named Dromeris of Stymphalus wasthe first to introduce the meat diet. He reasonedthat muscle was extensively used in athletic activityand, therefore, athletes needed to replenish this mus-cle by eating large quantities of meat. This philo-sophy became widespread and persisted without questionuntil 1866 when it was proven that physical exercisedoes not influence an athlete's protein requirement.Today many athletes still consume diets that are highin meat, even though scientific evidence has shownthat thi's particular practice will not improve athleticperformance.JuSt as the philosophy of the high meat diet isbased upon tradition, many other current dietary prac-tices are founded on misinformation. Some coachesexclude milk from pregame meals because of unfoundedbeliefs that it hampers endurance performance and in-creases respiratory mucus secretions. Fried foods andpork are often restricted because they are believedto be difficult to digest. In addition, bulky vege-tables and cereals are often avoided because they arealso thought to be poorly tolerated. Certainly a fewspices can be irritating for specific individuals;however, bulky vegetables and cereals are necessaryfor normal fecal elimination.%letary selection of athletes has been governedoo long on the basis of tradition or supersti-tion. \\Factors that need to be used in the planningof prcyier nutrition for the athlete include the nu-triticnal requirements of the individual. These re-quirements are based on age and sex, additional needsimposed by the type and amoult of activity performedand the effect of dietary supplementation on athleticperformance.Parents and coaches should assume the 67 responsibility of providing sound nutrition advice toathletes so that dietary practices may help ratherthan hinder the athlete's attempts to improve per-formance.BASICNUTRITION PRINCIPLES FOR ATHLETESWithin the last 10 years the American public hasbecome aware of the contribution that sound dietarypractice makes to physical and emotional well-being.The proper diet is certainly necessary for the healthof all people. This fact is especially true for in-fants, children and adolesc'nts who\\re still growingand require nutrients to support the vital growthprocess.When an individual participates in rigorousphysical activity, nutritional demands increase evenfurther.So, the nutrient needs of children and ado-lescents involved in athletic competition are compound-ed by the on-going growth process and the increase levelof physical activity. These children ald',teenagershave, perhaps, the greatest nutritional needs of anyspecific age group in the population. To help meetthose requirements, the athlete must start with know-ledge of the basic principles of nutrition andapplythis knowledge in selecting a good diet.ProteinProtein is the nutrient that is probably most \\misunderstood by athletes. Proteins are large, comple,xmolecules of plant and animal origin which are 'prim- \\arily made of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen.Each protein is a combination,of subunits called aminoacids which are linked together to form one largemolecule.There are approximately 20,major amino acidsthat may be combined in different patterns to formthe many different food proteins.When protein is digested, it is broken down intoindividual amino acids and absorbed for the body'suse in this form. Thus, it is easily understood thatthe body really requires amino acids for maintenanceof life rather than the large, complex protein-mole-cules, even though food proteins are the sources ofamino acids in the diet. Of the 20 major acids, nine 68 t- are known to be essential and the remainder are callednon-essential. An amino acid is considered to beessential when the body is incapable of synthesizingthat amino acid and it must be provided in the diet.Non-essential amino acids may be made by the body fromcarbon, oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen atoms and, there-fore, do not need to be supplied In the diet. Animportant point to remember is that all amino acidsare needed by the body but some (essential) must beprovided in the diet and others (non-essential) canbe made by the body.Protein performs three primary functions. Allof the cells that make up bodily tissues and organshave protein as an integral part of the cellularstructure.Other compounds in the body are alsoproteins such as enzymes and hormones which help toregulate the bodily processes that are crucial to life.Finally, proteins may provide energy when sufficientamounts of other energy-yielding nutrients are notpresent in the diet. Itis surprising to most athletes to find thatthey do not need more protein than an inactive individ-ual of comparable size and age. Muscular work doesnot significantly influence protein metabolism, soparticipating in athletic competition does not in-crease a person's need for protein. Athletes do,however, require more food energy or kilocalories tosupport the increased physical activity. If insuffi-cient food energy is provided in the diet, proteinwill be used as an energy source rather than forgrowth and repair of tissue. Consequently, athletesdo not need to eat great quantities of protein, butdo need to eat enough Nod energy to allow proteinto be used for growth and repair of tissues.CarbohydrateCarbohydrates are molecules of plant origin thatcontain carbon, oxygen and hydrogen and are smallerthan protein molecules. The diet supplies two typesof carbohydrate including the simple sugars and thecomplex carbohydrates. Sucrose or common table sugar,glucose and fructose are examples of the simple sugars. 69 Complex carbohydrates include the starches found inbreads, cereals, potatoes, pasta and rice.All carbohydrates are digested and absorbed inthe form of monosaccharides, which are the subunitsof the complex molecules. The function of thisnutrient isto supply energy for the body and thisis accomplished by sending glucose, a monosaccharide,into the bloodstream. The tissues may then receiveand use glucose as a source of energy. Dietary glu- cose is absorbed into the bloodstream from the digest-ive tract and remains intact as an energy source for thetissues.Other monosaccharides, such as fructose,.must be converted to glucose in the liver after theyhave been absorbed. The glucose is then releasedfrom the liver into the bloodstream to be used by thetissues.It is recommended that all people, including ath-letes, consume 50 percent of their food energy or kilc-calories in the form of carbohydrates. This nutrient is not stored in large quantities in the body; how-ever, the liver and muscles contain a small amount ofstored carbohydrate. Glycogen is the animal storageform of the nutrient just as starch is the plant stor-age form.Starch and glycogen are large moleculecontaining many monosaccharides. If too much carbo-hydrate and total food energy is consumed, the carbo-hydrate is converted to fat and deposited under theskin and around body organs.FatThe last of the three energy yielding nutrientsto be discussed is fat. A fat molecule containscarbon, oxygen and hydrogen and is primarily composedof three fatty acids. Fatty acids are the subunitsof fat just as amino acids and monosaccharides arethe subunits ',for protein and carbohydrate. Fats ofvegetable origin are mainly unsaturated, while animalfats are generally saturated. Fatty acids thatwill not accept additional hydrogen atoms are calledsaturated because the molecule is completely satur-ated with hydrogen. Similarly, unsaturated fats are so named because they will accept additional hydrogenatoms.70,:` There are three reasons why fat is needed in thediet.Fat-soluable vitamins which must he suppliedby the diet are found in fats of vegetable and animalorigin, so that fats act as carriers of these nutri-ents.Second, one fatty acid is considered to beessential and that is linoleic acid. Remember thatthe term essential signifies that the compound cannotbe made in the body and, therefore, must he providedin food.Most fatty acids can be synthesized fromcarbon, oxygen and hydrogen within the body. Theconsumption of one to two te:ispoons of corn or othervegetable oil per day will pide an adequate amountof linoleic acid in the diet. Third, fat is a 'veryconcentrated source of energy. it provides two and ahalf times the amount of food energy or kilocaloriesas do protein and carbohydrate on an equal weightbasis.Ten grams of protein and carbohydrate provide40 kilocalories each, while 10 grams of fat provides90 kilocalories.In the United States, 40 to 45 percent of the ki-localories in the average diet are supplied by fat.Many health professionals have expressed concern thatthis level of fat intake will contribute to theonset and incidence of heart disease and recommendthat only 30 percent of food energy be provided byfat.Table1 provides information concerning dietarysources of fat, as well as protein and carbohydrate.TABLE1- ENERGY PROVIDING NUTRIENTSNutrientProtein Carbohydrate FatsCommon Food SourcesMeat fish, poultry, eggs, cheese,peanut butter, nuts, dried peasand beans, milk.Breads, cereals, pasta, rice,potatoes, sugars.Butter, shortening, margerine,vegetable oils, cream, saladdressing. 71 VitaminsVitamins are organic compounds that are neededin small amounts to re7,ulate chemical reactions thatare necessary for growth and the maintenance ofThe known essential vitamins may be divided into twocategories.Vitamin C and the B- complex vitaminsire called water solubl.i and are not stored in verylarge quantity in the body. The fat soluble vitaminsinclude A,D,E,and K and are stored in greaterquantities than the wate-.- soluble vitamins. The speci-fic functions of the majcr vitamins are provided inTable 2.Notthat vitamns are not an integral partof the cellular structure, nor are they a source offood energy.Therefore, athletes do not requiregreater quantities of vitamins than sedentary individ-uals.The one excepi.ion to this statement is thiamin,which is part of the B- complex. The Food and Nutri-tion Board of the National Research Council-NationalAcademy of Sciences recommends that thiamin intakebe increased as food energy intake increases. Ath-letes consuming greater quantities of food than sed-entary individuals will, therefore, require a higherlevel of thiamin in the diet. Fortunately, thiaminis found in a variety of foods including pork, peas,beans, nuts, breads, and cereals, so that the athleteeating a varied diet will receive more thiamin asfood intake increases.Many athletes have adopted the practice of takingvitamin supplements. There is currontly no justifi-cation for this practice and there is in fact a po-tent.i..zard. As previously stated, the fat solublevitamins ire stored in the body and consumption oflarge quan sties of supplemuts can lead to toxicreaction.his problem is of particular concern withvitamins A a d D.

This category ofnutrients can be divided Into two sub - categories onthe basis of amounts Considered to be necessary formaintenance of health. The major or macro mineralsare sodiuM. potassium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium,sulfur and chlorine. These minerals are needed.inquantities greater than 100 milligrams per day.Micro or trace minerals are needed in quantities lessthan this amount and include iron, copper, iodine,fluorine, zinc, chromium, cobalt, manganese, moly-bdenum and selenium.The functions of minerals are three fold. Theyserve as integral components of specific tissues, forexample the deposition of calcium and phosphorus inhones and teeth. Minerals are also incorporated intoenzymes and hormones which help to regulate chemicalreactions in the body. Lastly, minerals play animportant role in regulating body processes that arenot controlled by enzymes 'or hormones. Descriptionof the individual functions of the majority of min-erals is provided in Table 3.Athletes consuming a varied diet including dairyproducts will receive adequate amounts of,minerals .to promote health and outstanding athletic perform-ance.The only mineral that may be provided in sub-optimal quantities is iron, if care is not taken toincorporate iron rich foods in the diet. All teenageand mature women experience an increase in the needfor iron as a result of the onset of menarche. Inaddition, a condition known as sports anemia may fur-ther compound the iron requirement of female adoles-cents.:;ports anemia is iron deficiency anemia andresults primarily from loss of iron in sweat. Theathlete 1.3rticipating in long endurance sports, is themain candidate for this condition, although athletescompeting in other types of sports have encounteredthe problem.Careful inclusion of iron rich foods inthe diet, such as liver, egg yolk, spinach and driedfruit will usually act as a preventative measure or 74 remedy the situation if it is present.In extremecases, a physician may be consulted to prescribe aniron supplement.TABLE 3- FUNCTIONS OF MINERALSMineralFunctionsCalciumContributes to the structure of bones andteeth.Permits normal blood clotting.Essential for muscular contraction.Needed for normal neural transmissions.PhosphorusContributes to the structure of bones andteeth.Necessary for the controlled re-lease of energy from protein, carbohy-drate and fat.MagnesiumNe,:.essary for all reactions in the bodythat require the use of energy.

The final nutrient of the six categories ofessential nutrients is water. Fifty to 60 percentof the body weight of most individuals is water and 75 this nutrient has many important_ functions to perform.Water Is considered to be a structural component ofblood, it.is the medium in which all the chemical re-tclionsinthe body take place and itcontrihutes tothe: regulation of body temperature. This last roleof water is particularly crucial to the athlete par-ticipating in rigorous activity in a warm environment.Desirable water Intake is ahout 2.5 quarts ofwater per clayfor an adult of normal body temperatureliving ina temperate climate. This wateris suppliedby foods and beverages, as well as drinking water.When a person isin water balance the 2.5 quarts ofwater consumed are offset with an equal loss of waterthrough urine, feces, perspiration and exhaled air.This balance of water and output is desirableand problems arise for the athlete who cl,,cones it:hy-drated.Fatigue and loss of strength ar^symptoms of mild dehydration and orpo:le ail of thepositive efforts the athlete has made or increa.;ingstrength and stamina. in more Fevore ca:, ,s of dtay-dratton, heat stroke and death nay occ..n.

Printing and Publishing Office,Washington, D.C.Selecting the DietNow that the basic principles of nutrition havebeen discussed, they need to be applied to the selec-tion of the diet. One method for selecting an ade-quate diet is to use the Recommended Dietary Allow-ances (RDA) proposed by the Food and Nutrition Boardof the National Research Council-National Academy ofSciences.The RDA are levels of intake of essentialnutrients considered to be adequate to meet the knownnutritional needs of almost all healthy persons.Essential nutrient allowances for females of variousage groups are provided in Table 4.The RDA are intended for use with groups of peo-ple to ensure that a nutritionally sound diet is beingprovided.Nutritionists and dietitians do, however,ise this tool in evaluating the nutritional contentof individual diets. T'tis method of evaluation is,rattier complex. In addition to the RDA, a food com-nsition book must be employed, so that the intakeof.each nutrient may be calculated for the day.A more feasible approach to dietary s_:lection isthe utilization of the Daily Food Guide.

The major or macro mineralsare soditi-M. potassium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium,sulfur and chlorine. These minerals are neeaed.inquantities greater than 100 milligrams per day.Micro or trace minerals are needed in quantities lessthan this amount and include iron, copper, iodine,fluorine, zinc, chromium, cobalt, manganese, moly-bdenum and selenium.The functions of minerals are three fold. Theyserve as integral components of specific tissues, forexample the deposition of calcium and phosphorus inhones and teeth. Minerals are also incorporated intoenzymes and hormones which help to regulate chemicalreactions in the body. Lastly, minerals play animportant role in regulating body processes that arenot controlled by enzymes 'or hormones. Descriptionof the individual functions of the majority of min-erals is provided in Table 3.Athletes consuming a varied diet including dairyproducts will receive adequate amounts of,minerals .to promote health and outstanding athletic perform-ance.The only mineral that may be provided in sub-optimal quantities is iron, if care is not taken toincorporate iron rich foods in the diet. All teenageand mature women experience an increase in the needfor iron as a result of the onset of menarche. Inaddition, a condition known as sports anemia may fur-ther compound the iron requirement of female adoles-cents.:;ports anemia is iron deficiency anemia andresults primarily from loss of iron in sweat. Theathlete 1.3rticipating in long endurance sports, is themain candidate for this condition, although athletescompeting in other types of sports have encounteredthe problem.Careful inclusion of iron rich foods inthe diet, such as liver, egg yolk, spinach and driedfruit will usually act as a preventative measure or 74 remedy the situation if it Is present.In extremecases, a physician may be consulted to prescribe aniron supplement.TABLE 3- FUNCTIONS OF MINERALSMineralFunctionsCalciumContributes to the structure of bones andteeth.Permits normal blood clotting.Essential for muscular contraction.Needed for normal neural transmissions.PhosphorusContributes to the structure of bones andteeth.Necessary for the controlled re-lease of energy from protein, carbohy-drate and fat.MagnesiumNe,:.essary for all reactions in the bodythat require the use of energy.

The final nutrient of the six categories ofessential nutrients is water. Fifty to 60 percentof the body weight of most individuals is water and 75 this nutrient has many important_ functions to perform.Water Is considered to be a structural component ofblood, it.is the medium in which all the chemical re-tclionsinthe body Lake place and itcontrihutes tothe: regulation of body temperature. This last roleof water is particularly crucial to the athlete par-ticipating in rigorous activity in a warm environment.Desirable water Intake is ahout 2.5 quarts ofwater per clayfor an adult of normal body temperatureliving ina temperate climate. This wateris suppliedby foods and beverages, as well as drinking water.When a person isin water balance the 2.5 quarts ofwater consumed are offset with an equal loss of waterthrough urine, feces, perspiration and exhaled air.This balance of water and output is desirableand problems arise for the athlete who cl,,cones it:hy-drated.Fatigue and loss of strength ar^symptoms of mild dehydration and orpo:le ail of thepositive efforts the athlete has made or increa.;ingstrength and stamina. in more Fevore ca:, ,s of dtay-dratton, heat stroke and death nay occ..11.

'WEIGHT TRAINING FREQUENCY Maximal is three timesper week,,minimal is per week.WORKOUT WEIGHT'- Maximum lift times SYNCHRONIZED SWIMMEli'Mary Jo Training techniques for the aynehroniied swimmerhave become very.progresalve in recent yearn. For anathlete to become one of the heat In her sport, shemust be trained better than the bust in her field.Muscular strength is one of the more important vnri-,ab.les in a well balanced program.Strength training is very demanding and requiresself - discipline. Superifision of the lifting is im-portant for motivation, for safety and for workingthe athleteto'her maximum. Whether the athleteworks with Iree weights, unlversal gym or nautilus,all of the concepts that will be stressed in thisarticle will apply to each area.There are many reasons why a female should workon muscular strength. Primarily, it provides the.power needed in baic movements by improving the dia-meter of the muscle, fibers and the size of connectivetissue.This concept also plays an important part inthe prevention of injuries that might no'mally occurif the athlete werejlot properly trained. Weighttraining will also improve endurance so that -'the mu's-'cles camwork longer without' fatigue setting in 'sorapidly.Another factor is that flexiliility improveswith the pre-stretching prior to working on theweights.Accordingly, im strength training by.in-creasing the mil,scle fiber size the percentage of bodyfat will' decrease. The advantages Of weight traininghave become .so importadt to most athletes that.manycoaches feel it is the most necessary part to anyprogram next o skill techniques.Fox and Matthews report that the strength of amuscle thatresults' from weight training is due toan increase in the cross-sectional area'of the fn- '4divrdual muscle fibers.1 This is further suppOrtedby M. Ikai and T. Fukunoga who demonstrated the re-lationship between cross-sectional area and the stren-gth of a muscle.2 As the belly of the muscle increase-es so does the'eendon which attach it to the bone.The increase in tendon size helps to-prevent oculsions,of the bone on a strong contraction. The muscle 90 strength and'Inereased London Hi4O aid in supportingjoints to give more stability. This was demonstratedwith two Ohio State flyneronfilod Swimmers on the1970-79 squad. With previous histories of ligament-Oliti sprain and patellar dislocation the two swimmersconcentiulted efforts on strengthening the quadricepsand hamstrings. Vow knee problems resulted after tenweeks of weight training. (Hart, iluggiert) inessence, ligameiv.s and tendons become stronger withweight training which provides a greater degree ofprotection to the Joints,Hotly composition changes following a weighttraining program will consist. of 1, little or no change in total body weight; 2, significant lossesof relative and 'absolute body fat; and 3, a signifi- cant gain in lean body weight. Throughout the sixmonth strength training program of the Women's Syn-chronized Swim Team 'at The Ohio State University,four underwater weighings were done to determinethe percent of body fat.Tha pounds of fat, lean body mass, percent ofbody fat, density in relation to water and under.-water weight.were charted and correlated with theindividual weight training charts. There is an in-dication, according to these particular team results,that as the strength gains increase the percentageof body fat decreases (Hart, Ruggieri)..Basic misconceptions of girls and women weighttrainingneed to be discussed. Since the female doesnot have the testosterone level of the male, it is notpossible to develop the big, buldging muscles often'associated with lifting weights.,.The development of the muscles do change due tohypertrophy.As the muscle groups hypertrophy thefatty tissue is replaced with firm muscle tissue.The female will actually lose inches on a weighttraining program. The statistics kept on the OhioState squad, demonstrated that the upper torso andwaist decreased from one to three inches throughouta six month-period. The athletes noted body changesof soft areas firming and the shape of theirfigure 91 improving,neneral concepts of weight training for..girls andwomen need to he established, The program shtmld hedesigned specifically for, the sport and then fox theindividual athletes, Training on weights may beginat apprOximately twelve years of age if supervised,Hproperly,The principle of overloading im a primary concepeN\\that must he practiced at all times, The principlestated simply in the strength, endurance and hyper.,itrophy of a muscle will increase only when the muscleperforms for a given period of time at its maximalstrength and anduraned capacity,3This must he pro-gressive in nature and the work of the muscle must heincreased throughout the program. The system of pro-gressive resistive exercise will show increases instrength after three weeks. Due to the overloadingprinciple, muscles must be giVen root on a plannedschedule.For an example, lifting could occur-threedays per week for three weeks and than take one weekoff.This is not for the purpose of eliminating mtS-cle soreness but to rest the muscles and give them achance to build tissue. It is also to the advantageof the athlete to have one to two days between lifdsso that fatigue doesn't set in.Designing the weight program specifically for thesport' is very important. The muscle groups must beevaluated to determine their relative function to theskills involved in the sport. This gives added stri-s-gth to the skill performance when muscles >ire isolatedand strength training applied. For an example, sup-port sculling requires primary muscles of the fore-arm and wrists to perform efficiently.When thesemuscles are worked, the strength in support scullingshows improvement. Included in the appendix of thisarticle is an analysis of muscle actions as used onthe universal gym and applied to synchronized swimmingskills. ,If the athlete is using free weights some ofthe movements are exactly the same. Any athlete orcoach should know what muscle groups are being usedat which stations when lifting, therefore, if aswimmer has a weak area, she can be guided to work 921 morn on that apootflo prohtom, Individual programashould ho dnoignod -tow for ,,n and onduranPo, All of tho otioratatla povformodfor tho wholo holy aro MAMP of woight training pro-gram that ho not up for tho synchronieodoW(MMOv oo Apoutfk! dtqAllo Mint umola mhortonm wIth va-rytng tonmion-WYTIOTTfttng a would befree weights and Uni'versaL gym.An Isotopic program M4ximum,10:4 two rit3/4maximum.

More muscle bundles arebrought in to use in this type of contraction whichdevelops more over all strength. This also allowsfor more overload than the three previous mentionedprograms.Another factor involved in isokinetic isthat these machines can duplicate many of the move-ments used in the water to give maximum benefit tothe dry land training program. Not all teams haveaccess to this type of equipment, therefore, a solid Iprogram using free weights or universal gym plus con-trolled stretching before and after lifting would bea good program.

Teams and individuals that haveaccess to the Universal and Nautilus weight (strength)training equipment are able to incorporate functionalstrength building exercises into their daily schedules.But what about those athletes who do not have accessto such elaborate and expensive machines? With aminimum of equipment and a little creativity athletesand coaches can devise their own strength trainingprograms.Below are some strength building exercises thatwere designed specifically for the elite synchronizedswimmer at the Olympic Training 'Center (Squaw Valley)Fall,'1979.There are twelve, different stations inthe circuit training program requiring a minimumamount of equipment. The circuit training programmay be run using a set time limit at each stationor by havingthe athletes perform a certain numberOf repetitions at each station. It is stronglyrecommended that athletes keep an accurate record oftheir own progress..

No.longer are we advocating that the training programsshould not be as,rigorous for females as they'are 'formales.And that females are not capable of reachingthe physical and mental peaks that. we have pushed ourmales to reach. The challenge of training our'femaleathletes is quickly becoming a science tomany.coaces.It isn't enough for women who currently arecoaching Ito just have a complete grasp, of the tech-niques ofd their,sport, they must alsohave a.thoroughbackground on training theories to give their athletesthe environment to reach their potentials.Synchronized Swimming is quickly becoming one ofthe more sophisticated of the 'sports for women dueto its recent gains in training theories. In thepast several years, a great deal of phySiOlogicalstudies have taken place at theHOlympic TrainingCamps and several universities. A Sports MedicineCommittee has been set up by the National AAU Syn-zhronized Swimming Committee whiAl.specifically dealsin data collection and analysis to help promote'better training techniques. The National Synchro'Swimming Coaches Academy (NAGWS) has developed aresearch committee that is collecting data on train-ing methods to b,e used to train high school andcollege synchron t ed swimmers.The general areas of conditioning and training.that. are ,currently being synchro swimmer's program,ahould be similar to that of the middle distance 113 swimmer,Most routine events are between three tofive. minuteassluration which physiologically placesthe emphasis on the aeorbic system. Several methodsof conditioning the synchro swimmers have been succ-essfully used. The following sample program has beenused for several years at The Ohio State University:'*Pre-Season - A great deal of over-distance swim-ming is used to progressively over'-load the swim-mers.All four competitive swim strokes alongwith many synchro stroke variations are usedduring this phase of the training. A typicalover-distance workout will include anywhere fromtwo to four miles of swimming four to five daysa week for four to six weeks. This over-:distanceworkout can be handled several ways; the follow-ing is a sample workout: 1.Warm-up 800 easy freeZ.Pulls - 400 individual medleyKick - 400 individual medleySwim - 400 individual medley3.Sdulling -4 x 200 using different strokes,4.Kicking Drills 3 x 400 vary kicks5.Synchro Drills6.Swim Down 800 back alternateSwim Down 80 free in ballet legs every 200The concept of over-distance swimming works wellin the early part of the season to help athletesover-load systematically and'slowly enough toprepare th6M for more resistance types of traininglater in the program.Fartlek or Speedplay - In' synchronized swimmingfartlek type of training can be very successful,1 during the first 25-30% of the season. Theessence of this type of training utilizes varyingthe 'speeds of swimming to accelerate the heartrate on a gradual basis allowing for a pacinorecovery'period. Synchro coaches can adapt this'system interspersing drills between 100-increase speed second100-time swim third 100 increases speed-re-turn to pace last 100 and repeat 8 times.3.500-alternate 1 lap ballet leg-2 laps timedfree-1 lap pace free4\".Synch minute fartlek swim nobreak repeat the following:400 breast 50% sprint-1 and 3 laps100 hard free400 back 50% sprint-1 and laps100 hard free400 fly 50% sprint-3 lap200 easy freecontinue to repeat series add head up free-style and breast stroke for variations.Any combinations of fartlek or speedplay drillscan be used.A great deal of stroke techniqueand kickinsg drills can be done via this system.Long Intervals - During the middle of the seasona program ofvcontrolling the time and the distancethe swimmers go and holding the heart recoverytime-to a certain rest interval is needed togenerally get into aeortic types of training. A\" minimum of 20-30 minutes of controlled long inter-val training 4-5 times a week seems advisablealong with all the technique drills and routineswimming.A coach can accurately assess herswimmers progress by taking heart rates before,during and after the hard sessions of the inter-val swim.A general rule to follow when usingthis method is to try and work the heart rate upto between 160-180 and hold it there for at least3 minutes, recover to around 140 and then- increaseagain.After the set of long intervals have beencompleted a heart rate recovery after 1 minuteshould be taken. Most athletes as they becomemore conditioned will recover to 100 BPM or moreafter 1 minute. 115 o workout;go1.400 free timed medium pace - rest 2 minutes2.a x split 75'a pace swim pull 1 lap, kick 1 -.lap, swim 1 lap, rotate strokes rest 2minutes.3.5 x-200 kicks'time each 200 decrease eachtime rest interval 30 seconds rest .2 minutes- check heart rates on 2 minute rests4.5 x 200 pull some - test 2 minutes'\"5.5 x 200 swim eome - rest 2 minutes6.2 x 400 I.M. timed heart rates at end7.Easy 200 breastA lot of extremely short distance swimming'andsprinting 50's and 100's is not advisable forsynchronized swimmers because of the need formoye_aeorhic training,- --------------Shorter Intervals - Just 'prior to peaking andtapering for Nationals a shorter programmay be instituted.Sample workout: Short repeats with 20 secondrest intervals.1.4 x 100:free (timed 100)2.6 x 100 kicks (vary kicks)3.6 x 75 kick one lap-, pull one lap, sprint onelap Water conditioning is very important to the syn-,chronized swimmer and must be consistent throughoutthe entire season. Often routines take priority overall conditioning and a balance should be maintained. ...Included below is a general list of conditioningterminology that will be of benefit to the coach.Types of Training: Fartlek,,Over-distarice,Interval, Repetition, Sprint. 116 Typos of repeats used:.Straight sets - repeated swims - time and restinterval constant.Decreasing distance - distance is decreased witheach set,Simulators - segmentation of distance with inter -spersed rests.Mixed sets - dintance'an rest interval are notconstant.Progressives - each successive repeat is faster.Regressives - each successive repeat is slower.Alternating progressive - regressive - increaseon odd numbered repeats, decrease on evennumbered repeats.Alternating---slow Cast - hard alternate witheasy repeat.Broken set - small number of repeats with a shortrest interval.

Both, however, had vis-ual acuities of normal range and no com-plaints of depth perception problems.A.number of correlations can be obtained fromthese resnits. 1.The amount of nearsightedness and binocularincoordination can attribute to the lack ofdepth perception expressed by some of theathletes.2.For those swimmers who wore their correctivelenses all or more than fifty percent of the\\time outside of their swimming, there wasmore difficulty in adjusting to the lack of'acute vision normally accomplished withcorrective lenses,* Therefore depth percep-..-tionlwas a moderate to severe concern. .Compensation to the visual lack of depthperception was achieved through various 128 adapting, i.e. \"looking for objects aroundto help.\"The most common method was re-peated practice of a routine with the aidof the coach's comments to indicate to theswimmer when she was not in alignment withother swimmers. One swimmer had been corr-ected by her coach so often, she now auto-matically stayed behind the line-up eventhough visually she did not see ..herself indine.Repeated instructions from her coachindicated she must be in line. The othermethod of compensating was through the useof parallax movement, that is moving thehead side to side using the object or ob-jects of alignment as reference points.This is a common method for those with re-duce& depth perception, who tend to usefamiliar objects, such as fire hydrants orlamp posts while parallel parking an auto-mobile.3.Those swimmers who utilized corrective lensesless than fifty percent of the time outsidepool activities adapted easier and fasterwithout corrective lenses-or were unawareof the concept. Two of the swimmers whowere amblyopes., using only one visuallygood eye since birth and one swimmer whowas strabismic, utilizing only one eye at atime since birth, had no complaints of depthperception problems, nor did their coaches.indicate any alignment difficulties. Thisfurther enhances the possibility of some formof depth perception as opposed to true depthperception derived from equal input throughthe two eyes to the brain can be a learnedprocess.Recommendations based on the preceding resultsand cozrelations indicate several alternatives forthose swimmers with moderate nearsightedness and/ordepth perception complaints. 1.For those moderately nearsighted swimmersstarting young, up to approximately agetwelve to fourteen, there is an advantage 129 to the coach if no corrective lenses areutilized while training in the pool. Oncean individual becomes sensitive to the im-provement in vision with corrective lensesand prefers to wear their lenses most of thetime outside of the pool axes, it will bemore difficult to train them without theirlenses.This difficulty,is related to bothconfidence and skill.2.Swimmers with moderate to high nearsighted-ness consistently lacked confidence whenentering the poor without corrective lenses.\"I know my eyes are not as good as the otherswimmers, apd I'm at a disadvantage.\" Coachesneed to be aware of this confidence level asit relates to vision problems. Most feltthey \"could do it, if they had to,\" but theywere more comfortable if given the opportunityto see clearly. It appeared more import tto the swimmers to see clearly during tra n-ing, not during competition. Coach Don VRossen formerly from University of Oregonreferring to speed swimmers was quotedb.\"I've seen a lot of injuries (such as split'heels) because of a slight miscalculation.We find that when our guys are using the masks(prescriptioned goggles) they attack the turnmore aggressively because they can see betterand their confidence is increased.\"3For those swimmers with high amounts of near-sightedness, hard contact lenses worn withgoggles appears to be a viable alternativeprovided the,fit of the lenses are accurateand the swimmer is comfortable with thisarrangement.Soft contact lenses are assumedinappropriate even with goggles since softlense materials will absorb the chlorine whichwill turn the Tenses a yellow color. There,is inevitable seepage of water even withgoggles.Hard scleral contact lenses arevery comfortable because they must cover thewhole eye to avoid \"popping out.\" They arealso very expensive and vision is not as good.Hard contact lenses as an alternative is notwithout limitations. The high unsuccess rate 130 rk can be attributed to the following complica-tions.a.Redness of the eyes due to the combinatiopof hard contact lenses and chlorine.b.Displaced lenses, as the swimmer rotatesher eyes during projections and under-water movement of the eyes with goggleson.cLenses popping out due to the exaggeratedand constant opening and closing of thelids during the removal of goggles as theswimmer's come in andOut of the water.Most swimmers prefer to remove goggleswhile their head is above water for bettervision.Blinking is severe because italso serveto wash away the unnecessarywater and chlorine.d.Due to the irritation of the eyes from thechlorine and the nature of the hard con-tact lens, there is aforeign body:sensa-tion which is more severe than usual.e.The fear by the swimmer of losing her con-tact lens in the pobl which has happenedto most of the swimmers who attempted thisalternative.Reports of \"never\" losing'a contact lens in the water6 must beviewed with extreme caution. There is a strong insecurity and therefore a lack'of confidence in their swimming abilityif they are pre-occupied with losing theirlenses.4.Because goggles are not allowed during ctu competition, it is highly recommended theswimmer wear the hard contact lenses with1goggles only'for the training session andallow at least one to two weeks for trainingwithout the lenses prior to competition.

Nesvig, EdD INTRODUCTION'As part of the Athlete Development Workshop pro-.giam for A.A.U. synchronized swimming teams sponsored.by its Sports Medicine Committee, groups were intro-duced to discuss coach-athlete and athlete-athleterelationships; It was one component of a psychologi-cally7based.regimen designed to assist athletes incoping with the results of/stress in high level com-petition.Other modules/include application of bio-feedback, use of relaxation techniques.and autogenicprocedures to improve performanceConducted in1977/1978,and 1979, these groupshave been utilized with the top 25 United StatesA.A.U. synchronized/swimming teams during week-long.workshops condueted/at the Olympic Trainirig Center,Squaw as well as with a speed'swimming team in /a large metropolitan area. Eraroup consisted of the coach, and. in somecases, an assts s or her. swimmers. meetingwith the faCilltator, (the, aut or uss concernsabout competition, practice, performance, team goand mutual' expectations. Usually there were 8-10swimmers in/each group plus the coach./PURPOSEEoui primary go)als and one secondary goal weredeterMiMed for the groups as sub'-goals of the more'global' one of improving performance levels for allpartieipantd: /1To explore the working relationship between/coaches and athletes and athletes to oneanother in terms of improving the collab6r-atioh in both directions.In terms of the group experience, the processcould range frOm simple self-disclosure todevelop a higber,level.of trust, to contract-'ing for actual behavioral changes or other*Ed. note:see Wenz & Strong-pp. 153-179 concrete agreements regarding pradtict rou-tines. 2.To effect a better understanding for coachesand swimmers of the similarities and differ-ences of their goals and behavioral operationsin relation to tole distinction and clarifi-cation.In the grOup this would necessitate discuss-ion of commitment to the sport, rewards andpayoffs, the decision-making process, howconflicts are resolved, etc. 3.To bring hidden feelings, misunderstandingsand personal agendas into the open.As the group discussion\" progresses theseissues normally unfold as mutual collabora-tion is encouraged by the group facilitator. 4.To integrate learnings from the other psy-chological components of the workshop pro-gram (relaxation, autogenic techniques, bio-feedback procedures) in relation to improvedperformance levels.Particularly when the focus is on collaborationof swimmers with one ano4her and coaches, anattemde to brldge the application andutilization of tec learned in othercomponents.The emphasis is onc- onimproving practiceS and competitive perform- \u00b0 ances through lowering stress levels. 5.To proVide data for improving the psychologi-cal components of the program is a secondary,go.11 of the groups.This data is collected informally by observa-tion facilitator directand indiramt :feedback a ramal written evaluation is done atthe end of the workshop, no attempt is made.formally to structure this in the group.' 136 For the purpose of this article, the discussion/ill center on the first four goals, which are pri-nary.A signi\\ficant section will be devoted toswimmers' motivation and their reasons for making aLong-term commitment to the sport. This will be based)n actual responses by the athletes to questions con-:erning their level of commitment, the pay-offs andrewards for them as swimmers.;ROUP STRUCTURE AND PROCESSDuring the late 60's and early 70's when the en-:ounter group movement flourished, the typical social!ntree was not \"What astrological sign are you?\" butlore relevantly then \"What group are you in now?\"'sychologically and growth oriented groups were givengreat deal of bad press, much of it deserved.Anyone who lived through that 'era is likely to have1 wide range of reactions and images when presented,'ith the generic term, \"group.\" Unfortunately many)f the images may be negative, may trigger off mem->ries of less than positive experiences with a groupLed by An unprofessional, poorly trained or unethicalTroup facilitator. The term may elicit associationsLike:therapy group, encounter group, confrontation;coup, rap group, support group, experimental group,tide -open group, counseling group, \"touchy-feelie,\")r sensitivity training. On the other hand, the wordmay have a positive valence, connoting pleasant mem->ries of a fruitful group experience resulting in;rowth or change. These reactions, whether negative)r pleasant, can result in a perception about groups/hich has the potential to significantly alter any!uture group experience. Our expectations are power-!ul determinants in influencing subsequent exposureoerceived similar experience.. Because of this,E made aeera_attempt to percep-:ions about eneral meeting)f coaches.A brief introduction was givenLnitial orientation meeting for athletes as well.leavy emphasis was given to the central purpose of:he group- an opportunity to discuss common concerns,;oals, worries and experiences related to high-level:ompetition.Here was a chance also for the team to 137 meet under more relaxed conditions without the usualtime pressures of a tight weekly training schedule.Following this description, they were told what:he groups are not. They are 'not counseling, therapyor encounter groups. .All participants were reassuredthat embarassing personal questions would not be ask-..Aed, their family history would not be probed and thatall questions would be answered as direCtly and hcn-estly as possible. Informal follow-up at meats andduring breaks gave me the opportunity to answer fur-ther questions of the coaches and athletes. Thesecontacts resulted in stronger rapport and served tolower any furt,her resistance to group participation.'At the beginning of each group discussion, thepurpose and goals, of the group were once again re-peated, the structure explained,sand the demystifi-cation ptocess gone'through. Feedback from'coachesand swimters indicated that this was not redundantor overemphasized, rather it was seen as valuable and;in/some cases,, essential to the group's direction andsuccess.The'next step in beginning the group 'Was'for me to make a personal statement which led intothe first phase of discussion. Following is an appro-ximation of it:I've been a sports nut most of my life,as a competitive tennis player, sports writerand fan and I have to tell you how impressedI am with the level of commitment I've ob-served in you synchro swimmers and coaches.I don't know of a sport with any higher levelof commitment from its athletes, practicingfive-six days a week, seven before meets,11 months out of the year. I've heard alsothat it means often two practices a day,many times standing around shivering by thepool or rehearsing in chilly water. So,I'm really curious to hear from you, whatis it about this sport that makes you will-ing to go through this?The responses were informative and enlightening.to mando-f-t-em-m re-revealing to the swimmers and 138 coaches.Many themes developed which were common toevery group, while others were idiosyncratic. Inanalyzing the.answers given to this global question,27 themes developed. Due to the overlap it might be more accurate to say there were consistently a dozenthemes which seemed to arise in each group. Some of the most often mentioned reasons included:It's an opportunity to travel around thestate, the U.S. and to other countries.I've made a lot of new friends, many very close and important to me.It feels good to excel in something.I've developed self-esteem and confid-ence I didn't have before joining theteam.It's fun performing for an audience.It keeps me in shape and slim.I enjoy the challenge of competition.After this opening-discussion other pre-determinedquestions were introduced by the leader to direct theflow of discussion. The questions were developed to provide a clear focus for the group and avoid meaning-less meandering.' In my experience many of the issuesthe questions were formulated t'o elicit, for example,contracting and conflict resolution, arose naturallyfrom -group members, requiring no prompting.If the discussion on level of commitment was slowin beginning, related questions were introduced, such.as, \"What are the rewards and payoffs for you in syn-chro swimming?\" and \"Why are you willing to sacrificeprecious time you could spend studying or on otherpleasures ?\" 139 DEVELOPING GROUND RULES FOR ASSISTING-ONE ANOTHER'Depc;nding on the issues raised spontaneously indiscussion, this topic would be approached next. Thestimulus question would be similar to this,How do you help out one another in practiceor before a meet? How about in practice orbefore a meet? How about during and aftercompetition?What have you found helpfulto you and in assisting a team mate?What is universally generated in discussion ofthis topic is an awareness of strong individual pre-ferences for giving and receiving feedback on perfor-mance.It was my observation that this was concreteand specific enough as well as universal to all parti-cipants' experience, that many areas were tapped. Infact, if there were no time constraints, this subjectcould be explored for the full two hours. Specificexamples of ground rules will be given later. Moreattention will also be given to what swimmers saycoaches do or say that is helpful to them.CONTRACTING BETWEEN COACHES AND ATHLETES AND ATHLETE-TO-ATHLETEContracting-was a topic that did not normallyarise directly, but often indirectly during groupinteraction.Since'it is a term not usually used inverbal interactions, it was introduced when partici-pants were talking about how discussions are made.Once the subject was broached, the leader would followup with,How are those decisions made? What chanceare you given to provide input? Is yourvoice considered or heard when decisionsare made that affect you?These and similar leading questions are used bythe facilitator to lead into an exploration of con-tracting.Principles of contracting and anecdotesillustrating them will be offered later. '1401 CONFLICT RESOLUTION 'This can be potentially.the' most explosive sub=. ject of all those mentioned. Likewise it can resultin healing wounds which have ()severely obstructed com-munication f.or an entire team.Many times current unresolved, conflicts are allud-ed to indirectly or are raised directly, by coach orathlete in another context, such as decision-making.Other times past misunderstandings which still aresimmering are brought into the open. Again,. if the, .subject is not hi-ought up, the leader-Will refer tosome other reference with a statement like;When you referred to your difference with - (name)I wondered hoW you handle disagree-.ments and conflicts on the team?As the facilitator response indicates, the.aetempt is to depersonalize the' that is,treat it as,a normal, inevitable occurrence 'on anyteam.The message is chat it is a predictable eventand there are effective ways to handle disagreements. .If it is clearthat an'unresolved conflict existsthat is haying -a present negative effect. on the team-or individual, it may be briefly used as an exampleof a conflict and how it might be dealt with. .In atleast three instances, it was my judgment that moretime was necessary than was available to sufficiently'explore the issue. In those cases a second sessionwas arranged for another time during'the workshop:Each of the preceeding sections which have beenintroduced will be given more detailed attention atanother point in this article along with examples and'anecdotes.SWIMMERS'AND COACHES' MOTIVATIONPreviously, an introduction was Made to thistopic detailing .swimmers responses. Not included inthat section were coaches answers'to'he question oftheir.willingness to make such .a significant contri-,'bution of their energy, time and resources to the , 141 sport.On the one hand their reasons were frequentlysimilar to the ,swimmers, like the opportunity fortravel, making friends, and the sense of excellingin,an activity. On the other hand, their role ascoach clearly dictates other-sources of payoff andrewards for hem, 4As one might expect there was seldom one compelling reason expressed as the major determinent apparent in staying with-the sport. Responsesunique tocoaches were: -The chance to work with good athletes who arealso nice kids. In my experience these girlsare the 'cream of the crop.'.I enjoy the teaching aspect of coaching'.It's an .opportgnity to deVelop my teachingability.Developing' a team from a group of basically.raw, inexperienced swimmers is a, personalchallenge.To continue the tradition of excellence andwinning that the (team name) have established.I can see instant, eSults froM my coachingand teaching. ..'Coaches in partiCular seemed to yelccime the permission given by the group structure to,be more per,sonal in revealing the complex motivators which keepthem involved despite very low pay and demandingschedules which complicate their lives. Almost without e'xception, .the team members were heating some ofthese reasons declared for the first .time by thecoach herself or himself. The impact was sometimesstartling, not only om'the athletes but on the coaches.as well'.For the coach, answering the question sometimes.,led to clarification of priorities \"You know, I .*realize now that I probably would have quit,before. 142 ., now if it weren't for my. compelling desireto seesynchro swimming become an Olympic sport.\" For theswimmer, listening to her coach reveal highly personalrevelations led to seeing her coach as a real person,not.in a narrowly defined role of the coach. \"Wow!\"one girl exclaimed' after her coach opened up, \"Ididn't know that before about you. I'm glad to knowthat.\"Here was the beginning of the breakdown of thestereotypes of coach as disciplinarian, administrator,slave driver, teacher.Some coaches engaged in a deep level of personaldisclosure as they talked. They talked poignantly of_coaching filliig a void in their lives left by retire-ment, relocation, or the death of a loved one. Theyspoke of coaching as a release or outlet for frustra-',tian in their professional careers apart 'from .coachingas a source of recognition. Others spoke of the, im-portance to them of the swimmers as their \"children.\" .As-the coaches displayed varying levels of self-disclosure and risk-taking, the seeds of ,collaborationwere sown.This modeling by the coaches enco6ragedthe athletes to do the same. It also was the beginn-ing of a new perception of the coach which made himor, her' more approachable, less formidable or distant.Other personal agendas were now more likely ,to bebrought into the open. A major goal of'the groupswas now being addressed.Coaches are certainly not immune to personal am--bition.. One coach mused abdut her desire to crackthe top five nationally and make her team eligiblefor a seeded position and.international competition.At the same time, as she talked about her affectionfor the girls, she ,displayed ler caring nature in adirect way never made clear or experiericed by ath-letes in practice. Again, the group process became,a vehicle for a previously unattained level of mutualUnderstanding.Other coaches shared the complex demands.on acoach.SsAmmers heard about their coach as a diplo--mat and politician who must deal 'with angry or pushyparents and boards: They heard about the demands of 143 )fund raising and endless details of lanning and co-ordinating meets,thrust upon the coach and assistants.They learned of coaches. own ego needs, that, to coina pun, \"Coaches need strokes too.\" iThis knowledge was beneficial in relation to thediscipline of practice; knowing in more detail thedemands placed on the coach made ft easier for ath-letes to accept demands placed upon them by the coach.They now knew on a more conscious, practical level .that they were not being singled but for extra work.Returning to the reward system operating forswimmers, coaches listening to their proteges discussreasons for commitment similarly resulted in the co-'aches acquiring a deeper level of understanding and aMore tolerant approach to their athletes' needs asnon-swimmers.The factors which contributed to aswimmer's desire to stay involved ranged from such'personal ones as faMily expectations (\"We're allswimmers'in our family.\") to prosaic, almost negativefactors (\"It beats watching TV and.being bored.\")Of special interest o me waswhat girls had tosay who had been competitors in other sports 'at schoolincluding:speed swimming, gymnastics, diving. For,several of them, the attraction of synchro-swimmingwas.an-integration of the elements of balleti gym -nastics, Swimming, diving in .one unique, esthetically-pleasing activity.Without attempting to 'organize them by category,.other.statements or motives for competing\"ran thegamut of personal recognition, group support, achieve-'ment needs, peer recognition, team loyalty and thedevelopment.of personal effectiveness. Further specirfic examples\" are:I need the discipline of daily workouts androutines.Being on the team is like being in a family.As a matter of fact, I spend more time with-them thn with my own family,. 144 I want to make the \"A\" team.I want to stay on the \"A\" team.like. the appeal of the form and beauty of:synchro.

So much has beenwritten and, said about personal development in ath-.-letics that it has become a cliche that wehave,cometo mistrust'.Without any behavidrat follow up asocumentation, it can b'e saisi that at least theselfeport of these athletes is a strong indicator of ac rry over effect fromjlatticipation in a sport tolife situations. Their reports indicatelhat learnin g. which occurs as a result of the rigors of prac-tide and competition generalizes td their daily life'problems.Personal and interpersonal effectivenessis enhanced as ''well as self-esteem, in Many dases,_Given the. limitations of self report and all of theblades inherent in this method,'neverthelese for thisgroup of athletes,qhere is a trend which supportsthe view that sports activitycan be positivelycorrelated with behavioral changes which effect non-sports segments of their livds. In turn, these dataare linked to cont!nuation!.=In the:8Port by theswimmers.Developing Ground Rules for AssistanceFallowing the discussion of commitment and moti-veion the sut'ject of how athletes helped one anotherwas introduced; this included daily practice, cOmpet-:itien,and post;-competition situations. Convcrsationcentered around giving eedbacl- in ,a helpful way aswell as dg the receiving of feedback fromIellow,'swimmers and ;.,oaches. This subject area, in my ob-servation, efeems to set' the stage fur the next area'of eentracting.. There appears to be eflew to ask-ing 'for feedback to be given in a different manner.:.or'at a 'particular 146i ,-t.1 Tat Lite introduction, examples of stimulus quen-tient! were mentioned. Once the group hegina.talkingabout techniciUes and metkpda they find helpful, theleader gdperate ground rules forgiving assiatance. , \\ ,A universal greustcd rule was: Be ornegative.(Bare a nota..6hould,be made-that whilethese prin.ciples My be well understood and effective- ,ly applied by the coaches and many swimmers, they arenot equally so for all team members, and thereforeworthy of repetition.) It is not much help, as manypersons noted, to say something vague like:.\"Youdidn't seem to have muchcrispness in your,turns:You seemed. \"laCkadaisical\" and \"crispness\" are'subjective and may have a specific meaning to theobserver, but to the swimmer being corrected, theymay, be too vague to be of asistance.Amore concrete specific rephasing,of the examplemight substitute \"It would be better if you wouldNI7urn more,quickly by,pshing off with more thrustfrom 'the edge of the pool.\" This example likewise.illustrates a second principle: Be constructive inoffering \"How about next-Itime. ...\".These. beginnings make the listener much more open tothe Concrete correction which follows.Another ground rule growing out'of the first twois:If possible, demonstrate the change desired.,r-Many movements in synchro-swimming are.extremely,:complex'and=difficult to describe, even for themostarticulate observer. Because of individual learningpatteins, modeling the correct technique may beessential.One person-may be able to- translate theword to the concrete physical movement designated,' 147 while another may need a demonstration to make Itclear.The next ground rule related to a frequent com-plaint voiced by swimm'ern toward their own peers, aswell as coaches.- This complaint concerned lack ofpositive reinforcement or praise. Swimmers grousedthat \"you always tell me when I screw up but younever say anything when I've done well.\" The ground'rule became;Give verbal praise when earned or de-served.The qualifiers earned or deserved were addedbecause the athletes wished it to be sincere, notused in a phoney way to give false encourageMent.These ground rilles'have dealt with giving feed-back but do not directly address the reciprocalnature of feedback. The same principles apply to thereceiver of the feedback in acknowledging or hearingthe correction nrpraiee. If the feedback is notunderstood; then the listener needs to be specificand constructive in requesting clarification. Con-versely, if the feedback has been useful, it assiststhe person to .know'' that it was:. This knowledge, makes.it easier for the person' to know if his or, her feed--back is on target. If the observer hears, \"Thatreally helped me to improve that drive. I've beenhaving trouble with that for weeks, and I couldn'tget the entry 'just the way I wanted it,\" it alsomakes it more likely the feedback given will risksuch an observation in the future.,,This latter point was reinforced through aquick exercise introduced .by 'the leader. Each per-son was asked to think of s yerson .who, in his or: -tier estimation, gives clear, direct, useful feedback,in short, someone who applies the principles justdeveloped.A reporting out of these, with examples,served as illustrations. It also provided''an effec-tive.sUmmaryof_the ground rules for givingtance.-ContractingThe summary also led naturally into an explora7,tion of contracting. Although seldom referred to ascontracting, the notion was frequently raised in the148 context of decision-making. The prinolplea of giving Iand revolving feedback werl to encem-parts teamhistuut, such as practice ETIO011, pi:inningroutines, determining A and IItonm members, solo andduet partners, and the selection of traVel squads.i'rinciples of contracting are an extension ofthose laid down on giving assistance and feedback.An InternatIng array of issues was typically raisedfor potential contracts from such .seemingly pickyitems as how soon before a,competitive meet costumesshould be worn, to more fundamental matters of'howmusic, for a routine will be chosen. Before gettinginto making actual verbal contracts, group memberswere,reminded that the goal of contracts is to im-prove team and individual performances. An extensionofthe feedback guidelines applied to contracts wouldspecify the-contingencies each person consider:concrete, observable behavior (actions or words),the specific behavior fo be changed,state constructively and positively the conditions,if possible or appropriate, indicate the timeelement involved.One of the first contracts worked out in thegroup.dealt with what to a non-swimmer might seeman..inconsequeatial problem; yet to the swimmer com-,peting on a highly ranked team, was .cause'for consis-tent p-re-competition tension on'the team. The ten-sion oftervresulted in the flaring of tempers and dis-tractien which, for some, led to a lower level of per-formance .than the offended individual might attainunder calmer conditions.The source of irritation was a-habit'one teammember had of not getting her hat and pins in place.until a few moments befo're the team formally begancompetition.- For the rest of the team, the norm wasto have this taken care of 15 or 30 minutes before-.hand., Nagging by other teammates or coaches resultedonly in more attention'' being paid'to this annoying ;.habit and less to essential last-minute preparations.'A standoff had resulted which was the source of much .unproductive gossip, name-calling,,and accusations-. 149 After hot the tdenttfted norm hrenkor and the teamdiseuseod the rennona for their n decided upon, n the spoolfiedi 1,The recalcitrant ewimmer agreed to have herhat and pine in place no Inter than 10 min-uteri before a meet.2,Team members agreed in turn to make no men-tion of the costuming until the 10.minutedeadline.3.If the deadline was not observed, other teammembers would be allowed'to point out herunrondinese until she complied.4,If the deadline was met, team members wouldthank her for her compliance.This example illustrates the principles, Itdeals with concrete; observable behavior (placinghat and pins on head), specifies the behavior .to bechanged, (observe the 10- minute'deadline), indicateswhat must be done in a positive statement (have hatand pins on head), rather than what must not be done,and finally, makes the element clear (10 minutesbefore each competitive'meet, not practice).A more complex,analysis of contracting, includingother principles, conditions, and follow up, did noteem appropriate for the group. Given the shortnessotime and other priorities for attention it was.ketat this level.Due 'to the uniformly positive evaluation of thegroups, almost 'every team agreed to continue withfollow-up meetings after leaving camp. The only ex-ceptions were those few teams of the 25 that alreadyhad regularly scheduled team meetings. Final nego-tiations took the form of a contract which includedtime, location, who shall attend (e.g., coaches, Ateam, B team, volunteer assistants), frequency andlength of meetings, agenda, and designated leader.This settlement was similarly used as an illustrationof contracting. 150 Confttot Resolution Etto tnevitabte on any athletic team during thecourme of a oeanon that varying dogr000 of to upon thin premtne,the runolution in to thegroup,From the cenfitctlin Itto dInpaosionte viowof conflict runolution can bu rUaced.If a conflict, either current or pant, is notrained by n group member, the facilitator will simplyinitiate the nubject through questions, reminders orother allusion to conflict or potential areas ofconfltet.Occanipnally a preount or impending con-flict (ma team was immediately focused upon as inthe previous illustration of contracting (placinghats and pins on before the meet).Before zeroing in on particular conflicts, a morewide-open conversation was encouraged on the negative.effects of unresolved conflicts. It was my observa-tion that every team was aware of the consequence interms ef morale and performance. What they were un-aware of was how to begin to resolve the conflict.In those instances, assistance was pievided in .identi-Eying and breaking down the sources of conflict.Once the sources of irritation were identifiedthey could then be approached.,If the irritant wasa particularly offensive rule or policy, the coach ora senior member of the team was asked to provide, /anunderstanding of the rationale behind it. FreqUentlyinformation alone was sufficient to either reselvethe individual's conflict or reduce it to the/pointof making it livable or acceptable. If the conflictwas interpersonal, however, it often requ4ed moretime than could be justified to devote to it in the\"initial group. If so, a follow-up sessiori wasScheduled-to continue the attempt at resolution.This was amicably accepted in three instances and aprivate meeting was arranged for the giroup.No reason was seen as too trivial for 151 nonsidoration an tonic an It had arona for HOMP,Tho ConehWhoovor athlotoii roaponsoa the \"What do wantmoat a conch?\"After mcottng with 25 LOAM!, Ihavefound that at least synchronized swimmers are expect-Lng a new brood of conch.

Athletes react to many things intheir environment (physical, social, psychological)called \"stressors.\" These include such things aswatching rivals warm-up, having parents or psycholog-ically significant persons in the Audience, listeningto scores of other swimmers and reactions to theirown mistakes.Some athletes let such concerns worrythem to the point of interferring with performance;they often do less well in competition than duringpractice.Other swimmers try to ignore such dis-tractions or may not be bothered by them.A fewswimmers actually use such stressors as motivatorsto perform well beyond what would be expected, andin rare instances, may perform in that super, spinetingling, unforgettable way. The stress response,then, is basically a person's psychological and phy-siological reactions interacting with each other ineither a helpful or harmful way. The typical rela-tionship between stress and synchronized swimmingperformance is shown in with too much etrena.An you can nee, optimal stress is an importantingredient In performance excellence.

Theyappear to swim in a seemingly relaxed, 'yet 14ghlyresponsive, fluid and controlled way, very much intune with themselves and the audience.Anxtety.Too much perceived stress, or poor copingwith stress, however, is often accompanied by anoverwhelming sense of anxiety. Family worries, arecent \"blow-up\" between coach and athlete, an ill-ness of a team member, personal or lamily expectationspoorly handled can create problems for the athlete.Anxiety responses are learned and may start early inlife.Sometimes anxiety is generalized to the pointwhere a person feels anxious all the time (traitanxiety).More often, for athletes, it is specifi-cally linked to a given competition, particular timesand/or circumstances within the competition sequence,or to specific worries and 'expectations the athletehas (state anxiety). It happens to everyone and we 154 all react bothphysiologically and psychologically toto anxiety arousing situations.What triggers anxi-ety (negativestressors), however, may differ foreach person facing a similar situation.

Is it possiblefor individual athletes to.nhange responses'to anxiety?gaily athleles can and do learn to effectively regulatetheir responses with training. For'ekample, slowingdown rapid rates of speech and breathing bring a senseof psychological calm. For some, elevated heart beats.and muscle tension may be lowered by psychologicallyrepeating or visualizing particular words or phrasessuch as \"I. feel relaxed, calm and in-control.\"Others may be able to control distractibility and in-:crease concentration by imaging the ideal or perfectperformance while in a muscularly relaxed, yet alertstate.Many athletes learn to enhance feelings ofconfidence and actual. performance through such psy-Chophysiological fine-tuning. It is not easy andrequires consistent practice outside the competitivesituation just like the learning of any new.skill.It is the achievement of an integrated mind-body pro-cess by incorporating both internal and externalawareness and feedback. .Synchronized swimmers are very familiar with theconcept of ,feedback. They receive it during everypractice and work-hard to increase performance basedon.the information they receive. Feedback (Figure .3)usually 'starts at an early stage with trial anderror learning. Feedback is then sought from'signi-ficant.others, such as coaches and teammates.' Theathlete gains even more detailed and refined Infor-matio by actually seeing herself in action - onVideotape, stop-action films, written reports, etc.The most refined and Often elusive dimension of feed-back is the awareness of her immediate psychologicaland-physiological fenctioning: heart rate; breathing,muscle tension, hopes and expectations, worries, etc.The athlete learns to shift from almost sole reli-ance)tn fnformatiOn from external sources to the in-clust n of internal mind-body information. The im-pact of\\this'shift may initially, generate its ownform of.,tension..

Thesewill be described in deeail later.Coaches and athletep who have participated in self-regulation or stress management programs have foundsome very clever ways to adapt them to their ownpurposes.You may wish to try some of the exercisesbefore_ involving others. It often helps coaches tofirst go through a program with someone who knows thetechniques and who can help them design a program'for-their home clubs. It needs to be pointed out that 'not all athletes need all procedures, others may notpractice them sufficiently to be able to use them in158 a pressure situation, and some \"do not believe inthem \" and choose not to participate. My colleaguesand I have worked with.coaches and athletes from age-10 -Eo the internationally experienced in severalsports.The results have been most gratifying andmany' participants have- adopted individualized formatsfor themselves that have proven very effective:' ' ,A k.eW.cautions need to be noted. Most peoplefind self- exploration and discovery fun and enjoyable;a Ver-y few may be too psychologically sensitive tothe procedures. Therefore, no athlete should beforced to participate. Be sure to seek feedback fromeach swimmer about her experiences; some may requirea quiet conference outside any group setting.Although the benefits are many, athletes takingprescribed medications should receive, clearance from-a physician before undertaking-deep relaxation.Relaxation may change the rate some medications aremetabolized and dosage may needto be monitored.Interestingly,.the need'for most medications tendsto drop with consistentlycpracticed relaxation.Another possibility is .that a person becomes'sO pro-ficient she actually learns to mask pain or othersymptbms that require treatment.'

We are all familiar with the factthat the human organism is equipped with automaticregulating systems, mechanisms and principles; heartbeat, breathing, body temperature, etc. It is possi-ble to use certain simple phrases to support or re-inforce the tendency of the organism to maintainhomeostasis or balance amongthe-systems rather thanlet stress and anxiety upset them.* Cold hands canbe warmed, heart rate lowered and breathing deepened.It was not until recently that the western world rec-ognized that much of the autonomic (automatic) nervoussystem could be altered by the person through a diff-erent kind of psychological focusing than is normallyexperienced.IT IS IMPORTANT TO REALIZE THAT THISIS NOT DONE BY FORCE OF WILL, BUT THROUGH THE USE OFVISUALIZATION AND IMAGINATION DURING RELAXATION. Itis necessary to have a casual, detached attitude,what might be called a \"creatively passive\" or ex-pectant attitude, toward the change being attempted.Simply use the phrase or word, visualize and feelthat it is happerring, and then simply \"let it happen,\"so that we will not interfere.with the body's tend-ency to cooperate.It has been found helpful to try to-V-Lsmalizeclearly the part of the body that is to be influencedbefore using the phrase relating to it. In this way,a \"contact\" appears to be set up with that particularpart of the body. This seems to be important instarting the chain of psychological events that leadto the desired physiological changes. These changesessentially result from the psychophysiological prin-ciple which affirms that \"every., change in the physio-logical state is. accompanied by an appropriate changein the mental-emotional state, conscious or unconsci-ous; which is then accompanied by a further change inthe physiological--S-rtate, etc.\" This principle, whencoupled with volition, makes possible greater mind-body cooperation and self-regulation.*Author's note: Much of the material in this sectionis adapted,-from Green, E.F.,'Green, A.N. & Walters,E.D.Outline of Verbal States in Autogenic FeedbackTraining.Topeka, Kansas: Meninger Foundation 16816 Q Concentrate on each phrase in whatever way seemsmost effective for you, repeating it verbally, orvisualizing it as if you are hearing it spoken; main-tain a steady flow of the phrhses for the durationof the exercise. ,The aim is to train certain mentalproceSses to operate in 'such a way that finally a very brief passive concentration on the phrase willaccomplish the intended physiological change almostinstantly.The use of words and pWtases .also help'get rid of distractions and help improve concentra-tion.The eyes should be gently closed and quiet.

Since you are \"in the water,\"notice the water temperature, the size of the,pbol, lane markers, pool sides and try to senseas much as possible actually being in the water.Now very slowly and carefully go through a figure(e.g., ballet leg) and sense every single moveyour body makes as you go through and completeeach movement. Notice what muscles you are using,Irow you are using them and the flow of muscle ac-\\i.vity as you go from onetheto the next..Notice how you are using the water to help you,how you are using your sculling technique toachieve height and control of the figure. Noticewhether you'are moving through the water orstay-ing in one spot. Pay,very close attention to-e-v-ery detail and move within your performance.The next rehearqal-is,done at normal speed.Whenmentally rehearing a routine, the swimmer'shouldalso try ..6-7)\"hear\" the music. It is important toexperience the location of, and distance from, everyother swimmer in the water fax duet and team routines; 172 a As soon as an error Ltinoticed d6ring mental rehearsal, immediately go back, correct it and go on to comptetethe merles of movements. if the error is not Immedi 'ately corrected, try the'eotire sequence agoio. Whenthe problem becomes repented, develop the proper tech-nique in the water before returning to mental rehear-sal.#5 Building Confidence: (This is similar to theVMBR described above. The swimmer images herself swimming an ideal performance ith confidence).Go through your entire performance from the timeyou walk on deck to the finish of the routine.Pay attention to a feeling of relaxed confidence,a sense of lightness and free flowing energy..Notice your reactions to the audience, swimmers,official's and other around you. Quickly scan your body for any tension, release.it and returnto the mental rehearsal. Notice anything thattends to distract you and continue to rele se antension that develops.Biofeedback.Biofeedback monitoring may be used toobjectively measure certain internal psychophysiolog-'ical functions assoeiated:wjth stress and anxiety(Brown, 1977). Biofeedback instruments may rangefrom the simple bathroom scale to highly sophisticatedelectroencephalography which measures brain waves.In other words, these instruments extend all the wayfrOm the very common- and praeticalto those requiringsophisticated technology and knowledge. The morespecialized techniques need to be used and appliedunder'very close supervision until the participants.becOme adept in monitoring and regulating their owninternal'reSponses. Ourfine-tuning model monitors'muscle activity through lectromyograph (EMG) read-Invi extent of pe\\ ripheral blood flow to theextremities-by measuring finger temperature (Thermal).Tires' two systems are seen as important 'measures of.ph7sidlogical components of stress. The underlying'principle is that a more relaxed autonomic responseallows greater blood flow -to the extremities and thatthe level of inhibiting muscle tension can become muchless.I'Istrumentation.aSsists in the demonsteationthat mw.tiie qnd blood flow responses (the autonomic 173 nervous system) are amenable to individual control.Thu athlete prst beComes sensitive to bodily respon-ses and then, after initial exposure under supervi-sioo, continues to monitor herself by using simplemonitoring devices.like the hand-held thermometer.There is often a need to check back with an expertfor maximum utilization. In virtually all instancesFMG readings are, lowered when desired, and in most'cases hand temperature is readily raised or at.leastpreVented from dropping in tense situations. If youhave interest in this facet of fine-tuning, please.contact a local psychologist or university for re-sources in your area.PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHERIt is important that athletes participating ina psychological \"fine-tuning\" program commit themsel-ves to a specific and consistent practice schedulewith periodic and timely review of the procedures,used.The learning process involved requires practice`and positive reinforcement. It must be individualizedand ultimately established as an integral part of theathlete's own training program. Once the proceduresmost. Nclpful to the individual are learned and becomealmost automatic, the less time is needed to make themwork under competitive conditions. The competitionstress inventory can be used to identify :the timeswhen the athlete must be able to apply theseself-regulation techniques most effectively. The attachedformat for'developing spent: on each activity.CONCLUSIONSMost athletes find that they, can quite easilylearn the procedures and are'able to make them apart of their training program.' Coaches generallyare impressed with the potential of the techniques,both in actual practice and in athlete performancelevels, and have. shared a number of instances of..in-creased performance in terms of anecdotal reports;Those athletes who are able to adopt the. psychologicalprocedures readily and in a consistent manner obtain' 174 the best pyrformance results. There isa clear shiftto focus to the Inciuslon of Internal feedback and anew sensittvity to internal functioning within thepsychophysiological area. Motivational levels areraised and expectations of self are clarified andbetter understood. One direct benefit that has beenclearly manifested is that sleep patterns are decided-ly improved the night immediately before competition.In addition, the objective data gathered from biofeed-back monitoring for the various groups of athletesshow a decrease in electromyographic levels on mus-cle tension and an'increase in hand temperature forperipheral blood flow in nearly all cases.The model presented here is not without somelimitations, however. Sporadic application by someathletes will give. only limited results. Others mayexperience difficulty in transferring the techniquesto actual competitive conditions. 'Ambivalence overone's ability and the desire to win may get in the .way-and limit performance. Sometimes the Meaning ofself-phrases varies from person to person and, there-fore, the same stimulus words may not always, workwell for everyone. They often need to be individ-ualized.After considerable use, the fine-tuning.Modelpears to have far more positive benefits than thefew' limitations pointed out above. The psychophysio-logical, effects result in much greater internal mo-tivation and control that then produce important per-1:ormance differences for athletes who are relativelysimilar in basic capability. There is also anaccompanying development of positive self-esteem inthe psych-..logical realm. Coaches who have partici-pated with their athletes often indicated a'desirefor further training. It is anticipated that fine-tunl.ng will continue to have an impact im the- devel-opment of athletes as they prepare themselves forcompetition in the future. 175 -I.L.:I) REFERENCES Brown, F,F.Stress and the Art of Blofoodback.

(rig. 1)The humerusarticulates with the shoulder girdle at the glenoidfossa of the scapula. Four joints Fig. 2 Ligaments and the Shoulder Of the above articulations the glenohumeral jointis frequently injured while swimming. The remainingthree articulations may be injured while swimming butmuch less frequently. Most injuries to those_articu-=lations occur during contact sports activities.The glenohumeral joint (Fig. 1) is a ball andsocket joint wherein the head of the humerus fits in-to the glenoid fossa of the scapula. The glenoidfossa is shallow and is deepened by a fibrocartila-ginous rim.Surrounding the joint is an articulatingcapsule which helps hold the head of the humerus inthe glenoid fossa. Glenohumeral ligaments also stability.Though the shoulder has numberous ligaments, theshoulder has a great freedom of movement. This canbe attributed to many things, one of which is theshallow glenoid fossa. This shallowness allows thehead of the humerus to move freely and permits agreat range of motion at the shoulder.- ---Several bursae are located around the shoulderjoint.Bursae are small sacs of fluid. Bursae aredesigned to decre\"ase friction. The most common in-jured bursa in the shoulder is the subacromial (sub-deltoid).(Fig. 2)Bursitis may occur in the. 181 shoulder often due to overuse.The muscles are the site for most shoulder injur-ies in swimmers. This can be attributed to the greatamounts of work and forces applied to the shoulderwhile sculling. The muscles stabilize the shoulderand compensate for the weakness seen in the bony andligamentous arrangement. Common muscle injuries in-clude muscle strains and tendinitis. Therefore, itis important to understand the basic muscle arrange-ment and muscle functions of the shoulder.The muscle can be grouped in to superficial anddeep muscles.The superficial muscles include supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor andsubscapularis compose the deep group. (Fig. 4)Thesefour muscles are often grouped together as the rotat-or cuff muscles. They are frequently strained due tothe extreme rotation and forces applied to the shoul-der.LOWER EXTREMITY ANATOMYKnee AnatomyThe knee is often injured,in synchronized swimm-,ing due to the stresses applied to it during the egg-beater,kick.This kick can traumatize the knee unlessthe knee' is strong Anterior aspectkres minorScapulaHumerus Posterior aspectFig.4 Deep Muscles of the Shoulder 188 The knee joint is a hinge joint capable of flexionand extension. Full range of motion includes fullextension (0 \u00b0) and greater than 90 oflexion.Minimalamounts of rotation is noted in the knee.The joint is formed by the distal end of the femurarticulating with the.proximal end of the tibia.(Fig. 6)The patella (knee cap) sits anterior to thisarticulation.The knee cap is located within the .quadriceps tendon and patellar ligament. The kneecap functions to protect the knee anteriorly and worksto increase leverage to the knee during extension.The bony arrangement of the knee joint is very weak.Muscles and ligaments stabilize the knee and compen-sate for its bony weaknesses.Medially and laterally the knee is supported bycollateral a loa,g, wide band of ligamentwhich supports the medial aspect of the knee. Themedial collateral ligament is -often sprained whilekicking in synchronized sw$.2ming, to the and Ligaments of the Knee 189Posterior aspect athlete injures the medial collateral ligament shedamages the medial meniscus because of the connectionbetween the two. The lateral (fibular) collateralligament attaches to femur and to thelateral proximal end_ of_the-fli-bula-and-ribia. (Fig.Fewer injuries are noted to the lateral collateralligament.There is a small amount of normal gliding anter-iorly and posteriorly noted by the femur on to thetibia.The cruciate ligaments are designed to pre-vent excessive anterior and gliding. Theanterior cruciate ligament prevents glidingof femoral condyle and theposterior cruciate arises from the back of the tibiaand extends forward, upward, and inward to attach tothe medial femoral condyle.* The two ligaments formand X as they cross to attach to the bones. (Fig. 6)The menisci are two oval fibrocartilages thatAttach to the superior aspect of the tibia. (Fig. 6)There is a medial and a lateral menisci in each knee.They are located between the femur and tibia. Theyfunction to deepen the tibia- superiorly and to abnorbforces applied through the tibia and femur.The knee joint is enclosed by a fibrous capsule.The capsule is lined with a synovial membrane whichsecretes synovial fluid. The synovial fluid lubri-cates the internal structures of the knee joint toenhance smooth movement. There are more than 18bursae within the knee joint designed to decreasefriction.Bursitis of the knee is not common in syn-chronized swimmers.Extra protection and support is given to the kneeby the muscles surrounding it.
