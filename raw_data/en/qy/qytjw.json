About Dr. Jeffrey C. Yuen Jeffrey C. Yuen is the 88th Generation Daoist Master of Yu Ching Huang Lao Pai (Jade Purity School), Yellow Emperor/Lao Tzu Sect, ordained by 87th Generation Daoist Master Yu Wen, Jeffrey's adoptive grandfather. Immersed in the practice and study of Daoism and the classics of Chinese medicine since early childhood, Mr. Yuen offers unparalleled knowledge of the rich, oral traditions that fully integrate physical, psychological, and spiritual facets of the medicine. Mr. Yuen is an esteemed faculty member of the American University of Complementary Medicine, Swedish Institute of Health Sciences, the New England School of Acupuncture, & Daoist Healing Arts, among other schools. He lectures internationally . TEACHINGS FROM THE TAOIST CANON: INNER ALCHEMY : Taoism is integral to the foundations of Chinese medicine, and the earliest Chinese medical texts are part of the Taoist Canon. In the Shang Qing tradition, cultivation of the spirit (inner alchemy) is considered an essential part of understanding Chinese medicine . Much of the Taoist Canon contains techniques for deepening one's understanding of reality. In the last class, we began to explore one of the most important revelations of the Shangqing Daoist tradition called the Da Dong Zhen Jing (Realized Scripture of the Great Cavern/Grotto) in relationship to energetic perception of color. Dr. Yuen also introduced us to meditation techniques to enable us to perceive colors emitted by people that are otherwise imperceptible . We further began to explore the implications of various colors and appearances of colors in health and disease. In this class we will review and continue our exploration of the Da Dong Zhen Jing, exploring the use of color on the residence of the \"divine\" energies located at acupuncture points. We will also explore how sounds are used to vibrate with the internal organs to invoke \"divine\" energies and how to channel these energies for healing. Due to the nature of questions in previous classes, AUCM will be filtering questions to those directly pertinent to the material Jeffrey is presenting. This is so that Jeffrey will be able to transmit all of the material he has intended for this module and we will all receive the complete transmission of the material. Some important notes: 1. This is a rare opportunity to learn this material from an authentic teacher. This series is the first time Jeffrey is embarking on teaching a more-than-cursory exploration of the Taoist Canon and its practices. As such, he is only going to be giving these teachings through AUCM at this time. Therefore, if you are interested in these teachings with him, this opportunity may not arise again . 2. It is a belief in both Taoism and Buddhism that the ability to actualize the teachings in these types of texts comes from a lineage of oral transmission. In commenting on the Taoist Canon, Jeffrey once said \"The Taoist canon is a compilation of thousands of years of insight into the exploration of the nature of reality and its transcendence . Taoist canons were meant to be orally transmitted or chanted for initiates. They were not meant for the public per se.\" Therefore, in giving these types of teachings, a teacher needs to have a specific intention to transmit the teaching to you (oral transmission). In other words, if you are interested in following traditional training, you should receive the instructions directly from Jeffrey and go through the meditations with him. As we do the meditations together, our energies can synchroni ze with his and learn how they are supposed to move. Reading them from notes or watching a recording is not believed to produce the same effect. 3. Finally, while Jeffrey is generously transmitting these practices authentically for the first time, this is with the understanding that the audience are medical professionals and are sufficiently versed in medicine and responsible enough not to injure themselves doing these practices. While Jeffrey has performed initiations into particular practices, Jeffrey is not inducting anyone into his tradition, nor is he taking personal responsibility for anyone's cultivation . He is, however, providing authentic tools and an authentic transmission for practices that have been used by some of the greatest Chinese medicine doctors and those that have achieved immortality. Jeffrey always does his best to answer questions, but a prerequisite for attending these teachings is a participant's understanding thats/he is accepting responsibility for her or himself. 4. Once again, AUCM has instituted a policy of only allowing questions directly pertaining to the material Jeffrey is presenting so that everyone can receive the complete transmission and teachings intended for this weekend together.
