Despite having the same potency, hydroxychloroquine is regarded as less toxic and more commonly used as a safer alternative to chloroquine.5 Idiosyncratic drug-induced hepatic impairment is one of the most challenging liver disorders to diagnose, owing to the huge number of drugs used in clinical practice, the availability of herbs and dietary supplements with hepatotoxic potential, the variety of clinical and pathological presentations, and the current absence of specific biomarkers. In most cases, the first sign of liver injury is the elevation of liver enzymes. Other less specific symptoms, such as fatigue, weakness, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, abdominal pain, pruritus, and skin rash, have also been linked to poorer clinical outcomes. Jaundice, encephalopathy, bleeding, and ascites are the symptoms of drug-induced hepatic impairment that may become clinically obvious when a serious injury has already taken place.6 Background of the Safety Issue Following a safety review published by the Japan Pharmaceuticals and Medical Device Agency (PMDA) on the risk of hepatic impairment associated with hydroxychloroquine sulfate, the National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency (NPRA) has initiated a safety evaluation on hydroxychloroquine, and extended it to chloroquine-containing products after a preliminary review of the literature evidence.7-10 According to the Japan PMDA's review, a total of two (2) cases of hepatic impairment, one (1) of which resulted in death, were reported in Japan across a period of three fiscal years. However, no causal relationship between hydroxychloroquine and the event could be established in these cases. Globally, in four (4) of the 21 cases reported worldwide, there was a reasonably possible causal relationship between hydroxychloroquine and the event. Of these, the causal links between the two (2) reported deaths and hydroxychloroquine could not be established.7 The mechanisms of hepatic impairment following the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are poorly understood. However, the hepatotoxicity effects may be caused by the reactive metabolites and oxidative stress initiated by these drugs or as the result of an idiosyncratic toxic or synergistic effect associated with inflammatory responses.11 Given that the liver is involved in the metabolism of both hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, the inducible liver injury can in turn affect their metabolism and excretions.8 As observed in the literature, the onset of hepatic impairment symptoms ranged between eight (8) hours and one (1) year after hydroxychloroquine administration. There have also been literature cases that led to severe liver failure, which necessitated a liver transplantation or resulted in deaths. In some cases, early treatment of hepatic impairment with steroids and discontinuation of treatment with hydroxychloroquine had resulted in complete recovery.12 Although its safety in hepatic impairment has not been well described, chloroquine is known to concentrate in the liver.9 In general, close monitoring of liver functions is recommended when using hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, particularly in patients at high risk for developing hepatotoxicity.8-10 Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) Reports To date, NPRA had received a total of 238 reports with 440 adverse events suspected to be related to hydroxychloroquine and 37 reports with 96 adverse events for chloroquine-containing products. In Malaysia, adverse events involving hepatic impairment, such as transaminases increased (9), alanine aminotransferase increased (5), aspartate aminotransferase increased (3), hepatic enzyme increased (2), and hepatitis (2), were only reported for hydroxychloroquine.13 Globally, hydroxychloroquine was linked to 483 adverse events involving hepatic impairment, while chloroquine was associated with 65 events, including liver injury, hepatotoxicity, hepatic function abnormal, and hepatic failure.14 Advice for Healthcare Professionals: - Be aware of the potential risk of hepatic impairment associated with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine use. - Use hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with caution in patients with underlying hepatic disease or alcohol misuse, or in conjunction with other known hepatotoxic drugs. - Consider monitoring liver function in patients treated with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, especially during the first 10 days of treatment to allow early detection of hepatic impairment. - Advise patients to seek medical attention immediately if they develop any signs and symptoms suggestive of hepatic impairment following the administration of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine. - Initiate prompt treatment in patients who exhibit clinical symptoms of hepatic impairment and elevated liver enzymes. Consider stopping hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine use and switching to an alternative therapy. - Report all suspected adverse events associated with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine-containing products to the NPRA.
