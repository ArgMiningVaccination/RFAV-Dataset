These sessions also provide participants with exposure to other researchers at Vanderbilt and the VA, insights into applying rigorous research methodology in study design and conduct, and recommendations for utilizing other institutional experts and resources to further strengthen their work. The longstanding WIP seminars are currently led by Bill Heerman, MD, MPH. Training Programs Research Fellowships and Junior Faculty Career DevelopmentThe Stakeholders, Technology, and Research (STAR) Clinical Research Network (CRN), led by Dr. Russell Rothman, launched a coordinated COVID-19 Common Data Model (CDM) at participating STAR CRN sites, in conjunction with the CDC and other PCORnet sites nationally. The COVID-19 CDM characterizes a cohort of COVID-19 patients nationally by organizing structured data on demographics and pre-existing conditions. The data are provided to the CDC COVID-19 Task Force and can be linked to Medicare, Medicaid, state health data and commercial claims, to facilitate large-scale research and public health reporting. STAR CRN is also a leader of the Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines, ACTIV-6, initiative, funded by the NIH, which is testing the role of repurposed drugs to treat COVID-19. The Healthcare Worker Exposure Response and Outcomes (HERO) program, is a registry of more than 55,000 diverse U.S. healthcare workers. An accompanying research initiative seeks to understand participants' experience with COVID-19 vaccines and the impact of the pandemic on their health and wellness. The Influenza and Other Viruses in the Acutely Ill (IVY) Network is a collaborative of 21 academic institutions and the CDC, focused on severe viral respiratory infections. In IVY-4, investigators led by Dr. Wesley Self are studying emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, and the epidemiology of other viral infections in severely ill adults.The Hospital Medicine ReEngineering Network (HOMERuN), of which VUMC is a founding member, has engaged hospital medicine groups around the country in a large clinical collaborative on COVID-19. Practice-based surveys on workforce planning, provider wellness, real-time hospital ward adaptation, clinical care pathways, discharge criteria, and follow-up protocols were conducted and disseminated rapidly to help inform and speed uptake of innovations into practice. The Critical Illness, Brain Dysfunction, and Survivorship (CIBS) Center collaborators study the cognitive function and physical outcomes of COVID-19 survivors to understand the relationship between COVID-19 and long-term health. Wes Ely, MD, MPH, Pratik Pandharipande, MD, MSCI, and CIBS colleagues lead national and international studies to assess risk factors and epidemiology of delirium and coma in COVID-19 patients while admitted to the ICU and to understand long-term cognitive function, PTSD, and depression in COVID-19 survivors. COVID-19 and Health Inequities The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted health inequities across the nation and the role of systemic racism in driving disparate health outcomes. CHSR researchers have evaluated the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on racial and ethnic minority communities, and are contributing to solutions by improving access to reliable information, telehealth services, and vaccination counseling. CHSR Responds to COVID-19 The COVID-19 pandemic challenged the global research community and brought unique opportunities to provide expertise and coordination that were essential to efforts in combating the virus. Below are some of the highlights of innovative research initiatives conducted by CHSR team members across the organization. A Learning Health System (LHS) systematically gathers and generates evidence to inform clinical practice, and applies the most promising evidence to improve patient care. Supporting the continued growth of the Vanderbilt LHS is a priority area for CHSR. We are proud to partner with many other programs and offices at VUMC which contribute to the LHS, including (but not limited to) the VICTR Learning Healthcare pragmatic clinical trials platform; Quality, Safety, and Risk Prevention (QSRP); clinical and research informatics programs; stakeholder engagement activities; implementation science initiatives; and training programs for embedded research. Together, we aim to \"learn from what we do and do what we learn.\" Pragmatic Clinical Trials test the effectiveness of interventions in the real-world environment, thereby generating rigorous evidence to guide clinical practice. CHSR collaborates with the VICTR Learning Healthcare platform to provide feedback on proposed pragmatic effectiveness trials, especially as it relates to incorporation of implementation science approaches. CHSR also supports pragmatic comparative effectiveness trials such as ADAPTABLE and PREVENTABLE through the STAR CRN and other research networks. CHSR actively partners with operational initiatives to help evaluate their effectiveness and identify opportunities for continued improvement and impact. CHSR faculty and trainees provide expertise in patient-centered outcomes research, comparative effectiveness research, implementation science, health communication, health behavior change, mixed-methods evaluation, survey research, qualitative research, community and stakeholder engagement. Examples of such partnerships include the Vanderbilt Discharge and Transitions (VDAT) initiative, Vanderbilt Hospital at Home (VHaH) program, Vanderbilt Familiar Faces (VFF) program, and Meds to Beds program. These partnerships seek to evaluate what interventions work best, for whom, and in what settings.Learning Health System H LHSTina Hartert, MD, MPH, Professor of Medicine in the Division of Allergy, Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine and colleagues are leading a nationwide study to determine the rate of novel coronavirus infection in U.S. children and their families.
