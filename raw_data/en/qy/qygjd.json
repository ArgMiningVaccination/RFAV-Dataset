Smilow Cancer Hospital's Integrative Medicine Program provides evidence-based guidance about a wide range of complementary therapies commonly used by cancer patients and survivors. Our program aims to address the serious physical and emotional symptoms often experienced by patients before, during, and after cancer therapy. Our team has expertise in the practice and evaluation of complementary medicine, and can guide patients to make effective decisions on integrative therapies throughout their treatment program and beyond. We collaborate closely with each patient's oncology care team to provide safe and effective care.
