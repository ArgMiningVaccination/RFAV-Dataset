[1](http://lup.sagepub.com/content/21/2/118.full#ref-1) This syndrome assembles a spectrum of immune-mediated diseases triggered by an adjuvant stimulus. [2](http://lup.sagepub.com/content/21/2/118.full#ref-2) - [4](http://lup.sagepub.com/content/21/2/118.full#ref-4) The use of medical adjuvants has become common practice and substances such as aluminum adjuvant are added to most human and animal vaccines, while the adjuvant silicone is extensively used for breast implants and cosmetic procedures. Furthermore, 'hidden adjuvants' such as infectious material or house molds have also been associated with different immune mediated conditions.\" \"In summary, research evidence shows that increasing concerns about current vaccination practices may indeed be warranted.
