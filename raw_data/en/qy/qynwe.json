The heart rhythm and the incidence of VPB, VT and VF significantly decreased in the extract groups (with the highest activity at 200 mg / kg) compared to the control group. The results showed that lemon balm has protective effects on the heart [11]. Joukar et al. investigated the effect of marijuana on cardiac conduction and fatal ventricular ar rhythmia. The results showed that PR, QTc and QRS intervals in lemon balm and amiodarone groups increased. PR and QTc were significant only in the amiodarone group and QRS was significant only in the group receiving 400 mg of lemon balm compared to the control group. During the reperfusion period, reduction of ventricular fibrillation significantly decreased in all groups (except for the 400 mg group) compared with the control group . The severity of arrhythmias also decreased, Mini Review Volume 3 Issue 2 Received Date: April 01, 2019 Published Date: June 19, 2019 DOI: 10.23880/jonam -160001 89 Journal of Natural & Ayurvedic Medicine Heidari M , et al .
