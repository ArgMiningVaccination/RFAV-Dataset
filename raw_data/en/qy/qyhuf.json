Chinese medicine and herbal medicine are i [n the news at the moment](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2007). There is a real risk that the government could endorse them by accepting [ the Pittilo report](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=235). In my view traditional Chinese medicine endangers people. The proposed 'regulation' would do nothing to protect the public. Quite on the contrary, it would add to the dangers, by giving an official stamp of approval while doing nothing for safety. The government's idea of improving safety is to make sure that practitioners are 'properly trained'. But it is the qualifications that cause the danger in the first place. The courses teach ideas that are plain wrong and often really dangerous. Why have government (and some universities) not noticed this? That's easy to see. Governments, quangos and university validation committees simply don't look. They tick boxes but never ask what actually goes on. Here's some examples of what goes on for them to think about. They show clearly the sort of dangerous rubbish that is taught on some of these 'degrees'. These particular slides are from the University of Westminster, but similar courses exist in only too many other places. Watch this space for more details on courses at Edinburgh Napier University, Middlesex University and the University of East London Just a lot of old myths. Sheer gobbledygook, SO much for a couple of centuries of physiology, It gets worse. Plain wrong. Curious indeed. The fantasy gobbledygook gets worse. Now it is getting utterly silly. Teaching students that the brain is made of marrow is not just absurd, but desperately dangerous for anyone unlucky (or stupid) enough to go to such a person when they are ill. Here's another herbal lecture., and this time the topic is serious. Cancer. Herbal approaches for patients with cancer. I've removed the name of the teacher to spare her the acute embarrassment of having these dangerous fantasies revealed. The fact that she probably believes them is not a sufficient excuse for endangering the public. There is certainly no excuse for the university allowing this stuff to be taught as part of a BSc (Hons). First get them scared with some bad statistics. No fuss there about distinguishing incidence, age-standardisation and death rates. And no reference. Perhaps a reference to the simple explanation of [statistics at Cancer Research UK](http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/help/default.asp?page=153) might help? Perhaps this slide would have been better ( [from CDC](#)). Seems there is some mistake in slide 2. Straight on to a truly disgraceful statement in slide 3 The is outrageous and very possibly illegal under the Cancer Act (1939). It certainly poses a huge danger to patients. It is a direct incentive to make illegal, and untrue claims by using weasel words in an attempt to stay just on the right side of the law. But that, of course, is standard practice in alternative medicine, Slide 11 is mostly meaningless. \"Strengthen vitality\" sounds good but means nothing. And \"enhancing the immune system\" is what alternative medicine folks always say when they can think of nothing else. Its meaning is ill-defined and there is no reason to think that any herbs do it. The idea of a 'tonic' was actually quite common in real medicine in the 1950s. The term slowly vanished as it was realised that it was a figment of the imagination. In the fantasy world of alternative medicine, it lives on. Detoxification, a marketing term not a medical one, has been extensively debunked quite recently. The use of the word by The [Prince of Wales' company](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=920), Duchy Originals recently [fell foul of the Advertising Standards Authority](http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/05/there-goes-my-knighthood.html), and his herbal 'remedies' were [ zapped by the MHRA (](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8035072.stm)Medicines and Health Regulatory Authority). And of course the [ antioxidant myth](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=90) is a long-disproved hypothesis that has become a mere marketing term. \"Inhibits the recurrence of cancer\"! That sounds terrific. But if it is so good why is it not even mentioned in the two main resources for information about herbs? In the UK we have the National Library for Health Complementary and Alternative Medicine Specialist Library (NeLCAM), now a [part of NHS Evidence. It ](http://www.library.nhs.uk/cam/) was [launched in 2006](http://www.uclh.nhs.uk/News/2006/May/NeLCAM+launch+-+NHS+Complementary+Medicine+website+goes+live.htm). The clinical lead was none other than [Peter Fisher](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22Peter+Fisher%22), clinical director of the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital, and the Queen's homeopathic physician. The library was developed with the School of Integrated Health at the [University of Westminster](http://www.dcscience.net/?s=%22University+of+Westminster%22) (where this particular slide was shown to undergraduates). Nobody could accuse these people of being hostile to magic medicine, It seems odd, then, that NeLCAM does not seem to thnk to think that Centella asiatica, is even worth mentioning. In the USA we have the National Center for Alternative and Complementary Medicine (NCCAM), an organisation that is so friendly to alternative medicine that it has spent a billion dollars on research in the area, though it has produced not a single good treatment for that vast expenditure. But NCCAM too does not even mention Centella asiatica in [its herb list](http://nccam.nih.gov/health/herbsataglance.htm). It does get a mention in [Cochrane reviews](http://search.cochrane.org/search?q=centella&restrict=cochrane_org&scso_colloquia_abstracts=colloquia_abstracts&client=my_collection&scso_evidence_aid=evidence_aid&scso_review_abstracts=review_abstracts&lr=&output=xml_no_dtd&sub_site_name=Cochrane_Reviews_search&filter=0&site=my_collection&ie=&oe=&scso_registered_titles=registered_titles&scso_newsletters=newsletters&scso_cochrane_org=this_site&proxystylesheet=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cochrane.org%2Fsearch%2Fgoogle_mini_xsl%2Fcochrane_org.xsl&btnG=Search) but only as a cosmetic cream and as an unproven treatment for poor venous circulation in the legs. What on earth is a \"lymph remedy\". Just another marketing term? \"especially valuable in the treatment of breast, throat and uterus cancer.\" That is a very dramatic claim. It as as though the hapless students were being tutored in doublespeak. What is meant by \"especially valuable in the treatment of\"? Clearly a desperate patient would interpret those words as meaning that there was at least a chance of a cure. That would be a wicked deception because there isn't the slightest reason to think it works. Once again there this wondrous cure is not even mentioned in either NELCAM or NCCAM. Phytolacca is mentioned, as Pokeweed, in Wikipedia but no claims are mentioned even there. And it isn't mentioned in Cochrane reviews either. The dramatic claims are utterly unfounded. Ah the mistletoe story, again. NHS Evidence (NeLCAM) lists [ three completed assessments](http://search.cochrane.org/search?q=centella&restrict=cochrane_org&scso_colloquia_abstracts=colloquia_abstracts&client=my_collection&scso_evidence_aid=evidence_aid&scso_review_abstracts=review_abstracts&lr=&output=xml_no_dtd&sub_site_name=Cochrane_Reviews_search&filter=0&site=my_collection&ie=&oe=&scso_registered_titles=registered_titles&scso_newsletters=newsletters&scso_cochrane_org=this_site&proxystylesheet=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cochrane.org%2Fsearch%2Fgoogle_mini_xsl%2Fcochrane_org.xsl&btnG=Search). One concludes that more research is needed. Another concludes that \"Rigorous trials of mistletoe extracts fail to demonstrate efficacy of this therapy\", and the third says \"The evidence from RCTs to support the view that the application of mistletoe extracts has impact on survival or leads to an improved ability to fight cancer or to withstand anticancer treatments is weak\". NCCAM [says of mistletoe](http://www.cancer.gov/cancerinfo/pdq/cam/mistletoe) - More than 30 human studies using mistletoe to treat cancer have been done since the early 1960s, but major weaknesses in many of these have raised doubts about their findings (see [Question 6](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/mistletoe/patient/21.cdr#Section_21)). - Very few bad side effects have been reported from the use of mistletoe extract, though mistletoe plants and berries are poisonous to humans (see [Question 7](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/mistletoe/patient/25.cdr#Section_25)). - The [U.S. Food and Drug Administration](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=454785&version=Patient&language=English)(FDA) has not approved mistletoe as a treatment for cancer or any other medical condition (see [Question 8](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/mistletoe/patient/28.cdr#Section_28)). - The FDA does not allow injectable mistletoe to be imported, sold, or used except for [clinical](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=44168&version=Patient&language=English)research (see [Question 8](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/mistletoe/patient/28.cdr#Section_28)). Cochrane reviews lists conclusions. [For example](http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab003297.html) \"The evidence from RCTs to support the view that the application of mistletoe extracts has impact on survival or leads to an improved ability to fight cancer or to withstand anticancer treatments is weak\". Anthroposophy is one of the highest grades of fantasy you can find. A post on that topic is in the works. \"Indicated for cancers . . . colon/rectal, uterine, breast, lung\". A cure for lung cancer? That, of course, depends on how you interpret the weasel words \"indicated for\". Even [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thuja_occidentalis) makes no mention of any claims that Thuja benefits cancer. NHS Evidence (NeLCAM) doesn't mention Thuja for any indication. Neither does NCCAM. Nor Cochrane reviews. That is not the impression the hapless students of this BSc lecture were given. In my view suggestions that you can cure lung cancer with this tree are just plain wicked. Pure snake oil, and not even spelled correctly, Harry Hoxsey's treatment centres in the USA were closed by court order in the 1950s. At least this time it is stated that there is no hard evidence to support this brand of snake oil. More unfounded claims when it says \"treated successfully many cancer patients\". No references and no data to support the claim. It is utterly unfounded and claims to the contrary endanger the public. Gerson therapy is one of the most notorious and unpleasant of the quack cancer treatments. The Gerson Institute is on San Diego, but their clinics are in Mexico and Hungary. It is illegal in the USA. According to the [American Cancer Society](http://www.cancer.org/docroot/ETO/content/ETO_5_3x_Gerson_therapy.asp) you get \"a strict low-salt, low-fat, vegetarian diet and drinking juice from about twenty pounds of fresh fruits and vegetables each day. One glass of juice is consumed each hour, thirteen times a day. In addition, patients are given several coffee enemas each day. Various supplements, such as potassium, vitamin B12, pancreatic enzymes, thyroid hormone, and liver extracts, are used to stimulate organ function, particularly of the liver and thyroid.\". At one time you also got several glasses of raw calf liver every day but after infections killed several people []](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Gerson#cite_note-mmwr-6) carrot juice was given instead. [Cancer Research UK](http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/help/default.asp?page=21853) says \"there is no evidence to show that Gerson therapy works as a cure for cancer\", and \"The Gerson diet can cause some very serious side effects.\" Nobody (except perhaps the Price of Wales) has any belief in this unpleasant, toxic and expensive folk-lore. Again patients are endangered by teaching this sort of stuff. And finally, the usual swipe at vaccines. It's nothing to do with herbalism. but just about every alternative medicine advocate seems to subscribe to the anti-vaccination lobby.. It is almost as though they have an active preference for things that are known to be wrong. They seem to believe that medicine and science are part of an enormous conspiracy to kill everyone. Perhaps this dangerous propaganda might have been ameliorated if the students had been shown this slide ( [from a talk by Melinda Wharton](http://www.cga.ct.gov/coc/PDFs/immunization/wharton_ppt.pdf)). Left to people like this, we would still have smallpox, diphtheria. tetanus and rabies, Take a look at [Vaccine-preventable diseases](http://wolfsden.wordpress.com/2008/08/27/vaccine-preventable-diseases/). This is the sort of 'education' which the Pittilo report wants to make compulsory. [Smallpox in Baltimore,](http://www.williams.edu/resources/chapin/exhibits/disturbing1.html) USA, 1939. This man was not vaccinated. Conclusion This selection of slides shows that much of the stuff taught in degrees in herbal medicine poses a real danger to public safety and to public health. Pittilo's idea that imposing this sort of miseducation will help safety is obviously and dangerously wrong. The Department of Health must reject the Pittilo recommendations on those grounds. Follow-up | | It seems that bits of good news don't come singly. First honours degrees in acupuncture vanish, Now a big chain of shops selling Chinese herbs and acupuncture has gone into administration. It seems that, at last, people are getting fed up with being conned out of their hard-earned money | | Herbmedic Barking A local newspaper, The North Herts [Comet reported](http://www.thecomet.net/content/comet/news/story.aspx?brand=CMTOnline&category=News&tBrand=HertsCambsOnline&tCategory=newslatestCMT&itemid=WEED31%20Mar%202009%2017%3A34%3A37%3A860) thus. Customers of Herbmedic, which trades under the name Herbs and Acupuncture, on Queensway in Stevenage have been left counting the cost after shelling out hundreds of pounds for treatment they never received. The company, which has practices across the country, is now in the hands of receivers, Macintyre Hudson. Sandra Emery, of The Paddocks in Stevenage, paid \u00a3350 for 10 treatment sessions, but only received one before the practice closed. She said: \"A standard course of treatment is 10 sessions, so most customers will have bought this package. Claudia Gois, of Walden End in Stevenage, paid \u00a3240 for 12 treatment sessions but only received four before the practice closed. She said: \"I went there on Friday and it was closed. There was no warning or anything. \"I got in touch with head office and they said it's very unlikely I will get money back. This report was on 1st April, The [company's web site](http://www.herbmedic.co.uk/) shows no sign of any problems, In fact they are still [advertising jobs](http://www.herbmedic.co.uk/company/career.html).

Download the whole [administration notice](/herbmedic-administrator.pdf) and the [company report](/herbmedic-annual-report.pdf). Criticisms of Herbmedic This chain of shops was investigated by the [BBC's Inside Out](http://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/southeast/series10/week3.shtml) programme. (September 25th 2006). \"We sent an undercover reporter to branches of the Herbmedic chain in southern England. On each occasion, the reporter claimed to be suffering from tiredness and was prescribed herbal remedies after a consultation lasting less than five minutes. The herbalists, who describe themselves as \"doctors\", didn't ask any questions about the patient's medical history or take any notes.\" This is so bad that even Andrew Fowler, a past President of the Register of Chinese Herbal Medicine, described it as \"malpractice\". \"Herbmedic has been investigated by the authorities in the past. In 2002, trading standards officers prosecuted the branch in Southampton for selling herbal remedies with 26 times the permitted legal limit of lead. And in October 2003, the Advertising Standards Authority banned Herbmedic from describing its practitioners as \"doctors\". Despite the ban, all three of the stores visited by Inside Out referred to the herbalist as the doctor.\" See also the BBC report [Herbalists' customers 'at risk'](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hampshire/5358338.stm), and a report in the Sunday Times, [Herbmedic accused of high-pressure selling](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/ireland/article4407695.ece). Read the [Advertising Standards report](http://www.cap.org.uk/asa/adjudications/non_broadcast/Adjudication+Details.htm?Adjudication_id=36792). Seven different complaints against Herbmedic were upheld. This is entirely consistent with my own experience. I went into one of their shops and asked about a cure for diabetes (hoping the be able to refer them to Trading Standards, but the young lady behind the counter had such a poor grasp of English that her reply was incomprehensible. She just kept trying to push me into having a consultation with \"the doctor\" who appeared to speak no English at all. I left. The chequered history of Herbmedic The company that his just gone into administration is Herbmedic Centre Ltd. It has been in existence for only two years. Its predecessor, known simply as Herbmedic, was dissolved on 13 March 2007, [Companies House](http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk/459ce1a95b4e1899bc2a3020f195c8a9/compdetails) said Company Filing History Type Date Description Order GAZ2(A) 13/03/2007 FINAL GAZETTE: DISSOLVED VIA VOLUNTARY STRIKE-OFF NOTICE FOR VOLUNTARY STRIKE-OFF 652a 16/10/2006 APPLICATION FOR STRIKING-OFF Another Chinese medicine chain seems to be having a few problems too Harmony Medical Distribution Ltd (\"specialists in acupuncture and holistic medicine\") seems to be still in business( [web site here](http://www.harmonymedical.co.uk/)), but several very similar companies have been dissolved, Harmomy Medics Ltd (dissolved 19 Sep 2006) ,, Harmony Medical Services (UK ) Ltd. (dissolved 6 May 2008) and Harmony Medical Services Ltd (dissolved 17 Oct 2008) Given this history of companies that dissolve every couple of years and then mysteriously reincarnate with a slightly different name, one wonders if this really is the end of herbmedic, or it is just a device for shedding bad debts. Is this just another \" [pre-pack administration](http://www.companyrescue.co.uk/company-rescue/options/Pre-Packaged-Administration.aspx)\"? Watch this space for more. What's the latest evidence on acupuncture anyway? A correspondent drew my attention to the [2009 Annual Evidence Update on acupuncture](http://www.library.nhs.uk/CAM/ViewResource.aspx?resID=311356&tabID=289) complied by the NHS Complementary and Alternative Medicine Specialist Library. This includes no fewer than 56 [systematic reviews and meta-analyses](http://www.library.nhs.uk/CAM/ViewResource.aspx?resID=311405&pgID=1). Although the reviews are complied by alternative medicine sympathisers, they seem mostly to be pretty fair. Well apart form one thing. Almost all of the reviews fail to come up with any positive evidence that acupuncture works well enough to be clinically useful. Only two come close, and they are the two singled out as \"editor's picks\". Perhaps that's not entirely surprising given that the editor is [Dr Mike Cummings](http://dcscience.net/?p=351). Again and again, the results are inconclusive: #8 is pretty typical Acupuncture for tension-type headache: a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials. This meta-analysis suggests that acupuncture compared with sham for tension-type headache has limited efficacy for the reduction of headache frequency. There exists a lack of standardization of acupuncture point selection and treatment course among randomized, controlled trials. More research is needed to investigate the treatment of specific tension-type headache subtypes. Vast effort and a lot of money is being put into trials, yet there are very few (if any) positive results. Very often there are no results at whatsoever. All we hear, again and again, is \"more research is needed\". At some point someone will have to decide it is all a charade and start to spend time and money on investigating things that are more promising. Follow-up A correspondent checked with Companies House to discover more about two of the directors of Herbmedic, Mr. Li Mao and Mr Xiao Xuan Chen. They have a chequered history indeed. [ [download the complete list](/herbmedic-directors.pdf)] Mr. Li Mao is, or has been, on the board of 31 different companies. Of these 6 are active, 5 are in administration, 14 were dissolved, 4 were liquidated and 2 are active with proposal to strike off. Not only is Her Medic centre Ltd in administration, but so is Dr China (UK) Ltd, and Great Chinese Herbal Medicine Ltd With record like that, my correspondent wonders whether they [should be disqualified](http://www.insolvency.gov.uk/directordisqualificationandrestrictions/whatisdisqualification.htm). Sense about Science have just produced a rather good pamphlet that exposes, yet again. the meaningless marketing slogan \"detox\". You can [download the pamphlet ](http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/index.php/site/about/282)from their web site. The pamphlet goes through the claims of eleven products. Needless to say, the claims are either meaningless, or simply untrue. - Garnier Clean Detox Anti-Dullness Foaming Gel \"Detoxifies by cleansing surface\" - MG Detox Shampoo Trevor Sorbie \"Deep cleansing and clarifying shampoo\" - Boots Detox Body Brush \"Ritualistic body brushing helps expel toxins through the skin\" - Innocent Natural Detox Smoothie \"Helps neutralise nasty free radicals which can cause damage to your body's cells\" - Vitabiotics Detoxil 15 day support \"Helps the body cleanse itself of toxins and pollutants caused by the excesses of a busy life\" - V-Water Detox \"Cleanse your system and whisk away the polluting nasties\" - 4321 Shape Up and Detox \"To drain off water and toxins\" and \"purify the body\" - Boots Detox 5 Day Plan Works \"in harmony with your body to flush away toxins\" - Farmacia Spa Therapy Detox range To \"rid your body of these damaging toxins\" - Crystal Spring Detox patches \"I'm the easy way to detox, just put me on one foot at night and take me off in the morning\" - Fushi Holistic and Health Solutions Total Detox Patch \"it acts as a toxin sink and absorbs impurities through your feet\" One nice thing about the pamphlet is that each item is written by a young scientist (including my close neighbour, Daniella Muallem). They are all people at an early stage in their career, but they care enough to spend time dissecting the rubbish spread by companies in order to part you from your money. Garnier, it's true, is a cosmetics company, so one expects nothing but lies You won't be disappointed on that score. That [least ethical of pharmaceutical companies](http://dcscience.net/?cat=66), Boots, appears twice The Boots Detox Body Brush is reviewed by a young chemist, Tom Wells. It turns out (there's a surprise) to be nothing more than an ordinary stiff brush. It seems that Boots' definition of \"detox\", for this purpose, is \"removing dead skin cells\" A totally shameless con, in other words. The Boots Detox 5 day plan consists if 5 phials of apple or strawberry flavoured goo containing two vitamins and one mineral, mixed with glycerol. In this case the young investigator, Evelyn Harvey, elicited a quite remarkable response from Boots. Well, have you tested the effects of that diet, with or without the detox product? Does the 'goo' stuff [the drink which forms part of the plan] add anything extra? Well, it's meant to kick start it. But has is been tested like that? No. Ok, I'm thinking I'll just try a healthy diet for a week, a bit more exercise, and not bother with buying the detox. Yes, that sounds like a better idea, to be honest I'd never do this myself. The media coverage The Radio 4 Today programme interviewed Ben Goldacre and the managing director of yet another product \"Detox in a box\" (following their usual policy of equal time for the Flat Earth Society). [Listen to the mp3](/detox-today-050109 Jan 05.mp3). When Ben Goldacre asked the MD for evidence for the claim made on the web site of Detox in a box, that their diet could remove cadmium from the body, it was denied explicitly that any such claim had been made. Not so. But by 10.02 the site had already changed So no apology for the mistake. Just a sneaky removal of a few words. That seems to be the only change though. All the rest of the nutribollocks is still there. For example There isn't the slightest reason to believe that it will \"improve our immune function\". There isn't the slightest reason to think that scavenging free radicals would do you any good, even if it happened. There isn't the slightest reason to think it will strengthen body's fight against cancer cells (that looks like a breach of the Cancer Act to me). \"Cleansing mucous\" doesn't mean much, but whatever it is there isn't any reason to think its true. \"Purify our blood\". Total meaningless bollocks. The words mean nothing at all. [I've been here before.](http://dcscience.net/?p=16) Ben Goldacre's own account is here \" [The barefaced cheek of these characters will never cease to amaze and delight me](http://www.badscience.net/2009/01/the-barefaced-cheek-of-these-characters-will-never-cease-to-amaze-and-delight-me/).\" The BBC web site does [a good job](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7808348.stm) too.
