California and federal law require that each licensed hospital conducts a Community Health Needs Assessment ( CHNA ) every three years. Since both CHOC hospitals are located within Orange County, serve many of the same populations and provide many of the same types of services, this CHNA covers both facilities. Hospitals can collaborate to complete an assessment if the assessment highlights differences in the characteristics and needs of each hospital's population. The 2022 CHNA, which will cover 2022 -2024, has three aims: Identify community health assets and issues Gauge and monitor the health of children and the factors that influence their health in Orange County Assist CHOC's Board of Directors and leadership team in setting priorities and alloc ating resources Methodology CHOC contracted with Health Management Associates (HMA) to conduct a comprehensive CHNA process. Secondary data were also analyzed, including public health and socioeconomic data. Primary data for CHOC's CHNA were collected by engaging with community members, stakeholders, and service providers through: A county -wide community health survey with 1,248 responses Three focus groups and one town hall 12 key informant i nterviews Health Priorities Health priorities were determined because both of the following were found to be true for Orange County in the CHNA: Community members expressed concern about the priority Secondary data pointed to either significant differences in Orange County compared to California and/or indicated a concerning or worsening trend regarding the priority Health priorities were selected using the following criteria: Can the partnership and/or a single organization influence the issue? Is there existing community will and/or opportunity to leverage or influence the issue? Is measurable change possible within three years? Page | 6 Based on results of the primary and secondary data analysis, the team identified two health priorities for Orange County . Health Priorities Primary Concerns Identified by the CHN A Mental Health Increase in depressive symptoms among students Increase in hospitalizations for mental illness in 2020, despite the overall decrease in hospitalizations due to the COVID -19 public health emergency Need for prevention, early intervention, and treatment for substance use among youth Access to Pediatric Healthcare Services Need for improved access to pediatric services (including pediatric specialists) from diverse providers who understand the county's racial, cultural, and linguistic needs of children and families Geographic dispari ty in access to pediatric health care Key Drivers of Health To effectively invest in prevention activities that improve population health, it is necessary to identify and understand which factors or drivers are influencing poor health outcomes in a community. This CHNA identifi ed four key drivers of health to consider when developing strategies to respond to the two health priorities. Key Drivers of Health Primary Concerns Identified by the CHNA Healthy and Affordable Foods Low participation in food assistance programs Proximity and affordability of food for low -income children and families Early Learning Opportunities and Success in School Low participation in childcare subsidies by eligible families Increased rates of chronic absenteeism Safe Neighborhoods Decreased sense of being safe at school among students Increased community violence Connectedness Low levels of connectedness at school among vulnerable students, including gay, lesbian, straight students, and Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) students Increased self-reported use of social media and screen time among youth as an important risk factor for youth mental health The issues identified in this CHNA are not new. CHOC and community partners have been working on these issues for many years. Orange County is getting better in some areas of health, while other needs emerge or persist. This CHNA helps shed light on some barriers that have a direct impact on health outcomes. CHOC's CHNA also serves as a resource to the broader community for communitywide health improvement efforts.

More than two million children across four counties count on CHOC to provide needed care, regardless of their family's ability to pay. In fiscal year 2020-2021, CHOC invested $158.6 million in community benefits, which are programs or activities that provide treatment and/or promote health and healing as a response to identified community needs. CHOC continues to invest in 68 different services to address six goals: 1. Healthcare Access: Increasing access to quality pediatric healthcare resources and information to low -income and medically underserved families throughout Orange County 2. Behavioral Health Access: Enhancing the community's access to behavioral health information and social and emotional services, targeting the medically underserved 3. Disease Prevention: I ncreasing awareness of disease prevention and promoting early intervention of major diseases that affect the community 4. Information Resource: Provid ing the community with resources for information and education on health risk behaviors 5. Injury Prevention: Actively contributing to reducing the number of unintentional injuries to young children, especially targeting low -income, diverse, and medically underserved populations 6. Community Action: Actively recruit ing, recogniz ing, and advocating for the importance of volunteer leadership and community assistance in providing care for children CHOC's Community Benefit Plan for 2020-2021 can be viewed here. Activities Since Last CHNA Figure 1 lists the community health needs identified and prioritized by CHOC's 2019 CHNA. To address the community health needs identified in the 2019 CHNA, CHOC developed an implementation plan with various strategies to address each prioritized need. Following are some of the activities launched since the 2019 CHNA. Figure 1: CHOC's 2019 health needs and priorities Page | 11 WellSpaces CHOC is partnering with schools across Orange County to develop WellSpaces. WellSpaces offer students a calming space on campus where they can practice mindfulness, meditate, do yoga, and learn about caring for themselves. There are 18 WellSpaces open in Orange County, with plans to create at least 12 more over the next 18 months. Early data shows that most students report an improved mood after visiting a WellSpace, and choose to participate in mindfulness activities, including speaking with counselors. WellSpaces are permanent spaces within a school, like the library or cafeteria, except that these spaces are constructed using biophilic design, a concept that aims to create a good environment for students. This focus on the natural world contributes to student health and productivity. COVID-19 Command Center During the COVID -19 pandemic, CHOC helped respond to community needs and helped prevent the spread of disease by moving fast to safely maintain access to critical health services, set up vaccination stations, screening and testing stations, migrate to hybrid/remote work, and establish a childcare program for hospital employees. In addition to these efforts to keep employees and patients safe, CHOC launched a toll -free line staffed by nurses to provide community members the most up-to-date information about COVID-19 and connect families with resources for pediatric health. Breathmobile and Wellness on Wheels CHOC's Breathmobile provides mobile asthma diagnosis, treatment, and education to children and teens. CHOC plans to expand on Breathmobile's long- standing success by launching a new Wellness on Wheels (WoW) program in late 2022. WoW will include advanced health screenings, regular wellness check -ups, guided play, nutritional education, obesity prevention, and mental health awareness for low -income communities. CHOC Foundation's Latino Advisory Council adopted WoW as a funding priority in 2021 and has raised more than $300,000 for the program through events and donations. Page | 12 Level 1 Pediatric Trauma Center In October 2021, CHOC at Orange was designated as a Level I pediatric trauma center by the Orange County Health Care Agency's (HCA) Division of Emergency Medical Services and verified by the American College of Surgeons (ACS). CHOC remains the only Level I pediatric trauma center in the county and is responsible for delivering the most advanced medical care to children who experience a traumatic medical event. As a Level I pediatric trauma center , CHOC also provides: Public education to the surrounding communities Continuing education for staff Training for future trauma clin icians and research to help develop and improve trauma care Screening and intervention program for people living with substance use disorders Humanitarian Medical Care for Unaccompanied Children Beginning in April 2021, hundreds of unaccompanied minors were moved from United States Customs and Border Protection facilities to a temporary shelter at the Long Beach Convention Center with the capacity to house up to 1,000 children ages four to 17. CHOC partnered with UCLA Health and UC Irvine Health to support the United States Department of Health and Human Services by sending more than 110 volunteers including physicians, nurses, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, technicians, and child life specialists. Various services were provided, including intake and ini tial screening, comprehensive physical screenings and short- term treatment plans, medication and vaccine administration, urgent and ongoing care, and COVID -19 surveillance testing. The children were also provided with clothing, food, and activities. CHOC played a critical role in keeping these children healthy and safe until they could be reunited with family or sponsors. Medical Intelligence and Innovation Institute (MI3) Summer Internship Program CHOC's MI3 Summer Internship Program gives students the unique opportunity to explore the future of healthcare and offers invaluable experience for young people interested in the healthcare field. The interns learn to problem solve and create solutions unique to hospitals. With more than 50 expert mentors across multiple fields, students are immersed in topic s relevant to the future practice of pediatric medicine, including genomic medicine and personalized medicine, Page | 13 regenerative medicine and stem cells, nanomedicine, robotics, and artificial intelligence. The program has completed its 10th year and has had more than 600 graduates. MI3 receives approximately 500 applications each year for its summer internship program, and up to 75 applicants are chosen to participate. CHOC's Belonging, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (BDEI) Office provides mentorship on BDEI principles and assists with recruitment to help ensure a diverse pool of applicants and participants . Many MI3 interns are current or former CHOC patients . Project S EARCH CHOC's Project SEARCH provides an 11-month unpaid internship workforce preparation opportunity for adults with developmental disabilities to build transferable employment skills in an integrated and inclusive environment. The program seeks to support individuals in developing skills that advance employment opportunities, provide pathways to careers, and help participants succeed in their community. Project SEARCH interns participate in four internship rotations, working in up to four different departments throughout CHOC. Each rotation is ten weeks long, with one week for review and preparation between rotations. Interns may also participate in employability -related community college/continuing education courses through Santiago Canyon College, provided onsite at CHOC during program hours. Page | 15 CHNA Methodology CHOC retained Health Management Associates ( HMA ) to conduct its 2022 CHNA and ensure this assessment meets California's revised hospital community health needs assessment and benefit plan requirements, the requirements for 501(c)(3) h ospitals under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Section 501(r) as well as the state's future requirement for hospitals to prepare and submit to the Department of Health Care Access and Information (HCAI) an annual equity report and health equity plan to reduce health disparities in the community . The equity report and strategy will consist of measurable objectives and specific timeframes to reduce disparities in the communities served by the hospital . Definition and Characterization of Primary Service Area CHOC's primary service area (PSA) is Orange County, California, based on the place of residence of most of its patients served. Statewide inpatient data was used to define CHOC's PSA. CHOC's target population is prenatal and neonatal infants, children, and youth through 21 years of age, and up to 25 years of age for patients diagnosed with certain rare conditions. Orange County has a total pediatric population of 782,110 children and youth (0-19 years). 1 Cities and ZIP codes within CHOC's PSA (Orange County) are provided in Appendix B. CHNA Goals The CHNA aims to identify and give a voice to the health needs of children and families in Orange County through comprehensive primary and secondary data collection, analysis, and reporting. Broadly, the CHNA aims to: Identify community health assets and issues Gauge and monitor the health of children and the factors that influence their health in Orange County Assist CHOC 's Board of Directors and leadership team in setting priorities and allocating resources CHOC's 2022 CHNA seeks to specifically: Define the patient population served by CHOC and the communities from which this population originates Page | 16 Determine community health needs and resources, including those related to pediatric inpatient and outpatient care Identify significant gaps that prevent the provision of pediatric primary and specialty healthcare services Identify areas of health inequity , including health status and access to care for patients who experience discrimination based on race, ethnicity, language, disability status, sexual orientation, gender identity, and pay er Identify community assets that improve the health and well -being of community members Address barriers to meeting the health and social needs of the community Meaningfully engage the Orange County community and build relationships with a broad and diverse group of stakeholders The following questions were answered: What are the most pressing health issues in the community , and how do these issues vary across the community? Why do these health issues exist in the community? What factors create or determine health issues? What resources are available to address these health issues? What are the health needs of the community from a population-based perspective? CHOC approached these questions by investigating the needs of infants, children, youth, and families, us ing a modified Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnerships (MAPP) framework to gather insights from patients and community members . This process does not rely on any single source of information, but rather the consideration of multiple data sources in analysis before arriving at findings, as shown in Figure 2. The CHNA team collected quantitative and qualitative data from primary sources (data collected first-hand through surveys, focus groups, and interviews) and secondary data sources (data collected by another entity or for another purpose). Quantitative data used in the CHNA is considered high-quality, population- based data that came from local, state, and national sources such as Vital Statistics and records from the California Department of Public Health and Environment, the United States Census Bureau, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, the California Healthy Kids Survey (CHKS), and the California Health Interview Survey (CHIS). Page | 17 The CHNA timeframe is 2022-2024. The CHNA was conducted between April and July 2022, and included the following key components: County -wide community health survey Community member focus groups and key informant interviews Secondary data review and analysis Findings from data collection and analysis will guide CHOC's CHNA implementation plan and community benefits plan, ensuring resources are focused on the assessment's most pressing pediatric healthcare needs. Community Health Survey CHOC gathered community opinions about crucial health issues and the quality of life in Orange County for children and families through an online community health survey. The survey was provided in English, Spanish, and Vietnamese, and was open from June 1 - June 21, 2022. To receive as many responses as possible from residents throughout Orange County, CHOC's marketing team, the CHNA Advisory Committee and a variety of community partners shared and promoted the online survey through: Social media posts, including Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram In-person distribution at community -based primary care clinics Email newsletters and other communications within their professional networks Figure 2: CHNA approa ch Page | 18 External mail blasts to Orange County -based collaboratives or coalitions and internal email and facsimile blasts to CHOC providers and associates Outreach to CHOC associates The community health survey generated 1,248 unique responses from across the community and not restricted to CHOC providers or patients, including : 745 responses from parents, guardians, and others caring for children (59.7%), of which 54 responses were from foster parents. This group of respondents will be collectively referred to as \"family\" in the CHNA. 215 responses from young adults 18 -24 years of age (17.2%) 145 responses from service providers (11.6%) 143 responses from healthcare professionals (11.5%) Most survey respondents received the survey by email (42%), 13% by Facebook, and 11% in the workplace.

Specifically, 45% lived within the county for 11 or more y ears, and 18% between 6-10 years. Age Compared to the United States Census, age groups 25-34 years, 35-44 years, and 45-54 years were overrepresented among the survey respondents. This overrepresentation is appropriate since the target population was families of children 0-24 years.

Community Member Focus Groups and Key Informant Interviews Conversations with community members took place throughout the CHNA process to validate community health survey findings and dig deeper into the challenges and needs of populations experiencing health inequity. The aim was to hear from key sectors that serve or have frequent contact with children, youth, and families. Outreach and engagement focused on representatives from physical health, behavioral health, specialty care providers, schools, human services, criminal justice, courts, probation, and community -based organizations serving youth and families. Although virtual and in-person interv iews and focus groups were offered, all participants opted for virtual conversations. Two central questions guided these discussions : What do you think is the root of the health issues you see in the survey data? What health issues do you think your community and its healthcare system can change for the better? Focus groups and interviews were carried out with individuals representing priority populations and geographic locations. These discussions were designed to gain a deeper understanding of families ' experiences from historically underrepresented communities in past assessments. Priority populations included in the CHNA are: Page | 25 Children Special Health Care Needs (CSHCN) Survey respondents who self-identified with the following demographics were emailed and invited to participate in one or more of the following focus groups Individuals who identify as LGBTQIA+ Sp anish-speaking individuals Mental health providers Parents, guardians , and others caring for children This outreach resulted in three focus groups being conducted: (1) Spanish-speaking parents guardians, and caregivers of children, (2) mental health provi ders, and (3) CHOC social wor k staff. CHOC and HMA worked with First 5 Orange County to extend focus group invitations to Spanish-speaking parent ambassadors and other community contacts. Nine mothers and two First 5 Orange County consultants participated in the Spanish-speaking focus group, which was held in the evening for participants' convenience. A CHOC social worker virtual focus group was conducted to gain an observer's perspective of the clinical care providers' interactions with families from under -represented groups. Participants spoke about access and barriers to care, as well as initiatives to improve the overall health of children and families in Orange County. A focus group discussion on the topic of mental health occurred with two individual s involved with the mental health system . They shared an in-depth perspective on youth mental health, the impact of the pandemic, and the role that CHOC is playing and can play in addressing the youth mental health crisis. In addition to the three focus groups, all community health survey respondents who volunteered to engage in post-survey interviews (n=757) were invited to a town hall event scheduled for July 6, 2022. See Appendix D for the presentation. Key Informant Interviews The community health survey and early conversations with community members identified access to services covered by insurance, challenges understanding how to navigate the healthcare system and community violence as key issues. To learn more, the CHNA team conducted additional interviews to dig deeper into root causes and strategies to mitigate these challenges. Virtual interviews were conducted with representatives from the Community Health Initiative of Orange County, Waymakers Orange County, and Orange County Department of Education - School Safety. See Appendix E for the Key Informant Interview Guide. Page | 26 Table 10: Key informant interviews Sector/Focus Area Number of Interviewees Behavioral health 3 County health 2 School -based health 2 Community health centers 1 Community violence 1 School -based violence 1 Insurance access/ navigation 1 Service provider for children with special care needs 1 Human trafficking 1 Secondary Data Data from several local, state, nationwide databases and public health sources provided a comprehensive picture of Orange County child and family health, including: Population characteristics, such as race/ethnicity, education level, income level, and employment statistics Health outcomes, including chronic disease prevalence and mortality rates Health behaviors, including physical activity, nutrition, alcohol, and drug and tobacco use Healthcare utilization, including hospital inpatient and outpatient data Access to care indicators, such as population to provider ratios and health professional shortage area designations Social determinants of health indicators, including affordable housing, food security, and access to childcare Particular attention was paid to data collected pre- and post- COVID -19. To the extent possible, data was obtained and analyzed at the sub-county geography and compared with state-level data and comparable data from prior years (trend analysis). Information Gaps Many social, economic, morbidity, mortality, and health outcomes data points (secondary data) are tracked and recorded at the county level, and not at the city or neighborhood level. A high percentage of health-related data lacks race and ethnicity, making it difficult to accurately under stand the breadth and depth of health disparity in a given location. For example, race and ethnicity data is often missing in surveillance data; and most health plans lack race and ethnicity data on non -White/Caucasian members. Hospitals and other providers are better at collecting these data. However, the data is often inaccurate because it is not self-reported by the patient but through observation of admitting or registration staff. Data are also commonly reported in wide age bands that include the age 18+ cohort, making it challenging to determine the effect of these indicators on CHOC's patient population. Page | 27 Additionally, there is increasing discussion in data collection and analysis regarding data equity and the concern that harmful decisions can be justified through data. Because data collection, sourcing, and research can be affected by biases, data scientists are working to develop equity standards that balance minority populations' privacy concerns with achieving reliability and eliminating unsuppor ted assumptions. Other limitations in qualitative and quantitative information include: Community Engagement: Opinions gathered from community representatives could differ from those of the broader Orange County population. While every effort was made to recruit a sample size representative of parents, guardians and other caregivers of CHOC's entire pediatric population, a diverse group of participants representing each of the unique cities within Orange County could not be guaranteed. This challenge is expected in metropolitan areas such as Orange County. However, the process deployed to complete this CHNA creates a solid foundation for an intentional community engagement process needed to meet the 2025 equity report and strategy. Data Lag: Although the data was valuable and allowed the identification of Orange County's health needs, older datasets may not reflect recent trends in health statistics and outcomes. This challenge was mitigated through comparison with community input and identification of poss ible discrepancies. Limitations of CHKS Data: Factors that can impact the quality, validity, and generalizability of the CHKS results include changes that occur in survey content, administration, and/or sample characteristics between survey administrations. Not all schools participate in CHKS, which limits the validity and representativeness of the results. However, even with a low response rate, the results provide an indication of what those students who did respond felt about the school and their experiences and behavior. Additionally, when interpreting the results, it is important to consider that changes in the results over time may be due to differences in the characteristics or size of the sample of students that completed the survey, changes in the questions themselves, or differences between time periods in which the survey was administered (for example, some risk behaviors tend to increase as students age, or may increase during holidays or social events). Page | 28 Community Health Survey: Important Fac tors for Healthy Kids Three in four families who responded to the CHNA community health survey rated the overall health of child(ren) living in their home as \"healthy\" (46%) or \"very healthy \" (28%). Figure 4: Please rate the overall health of the child(ren) living in your home. My child(ren) is/are Source: CHNA Community Health Survey, 2022. The community health survey respondents were asked to use one word that describes healthy children and families. Overwhelmingly, respondents described healthy children and families as happy, thriving, and mentally and physically healthy . Rarely, if ever, does one factor determine the health of a community and its residents. In 2020, the California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) found that 13.6% of Orange County adults reported the most important factor to health was genetics and medical care while 35.1% reported it was individual or environmental factors. 2 The remaining adults, more than half (51.2%), answered that these things are equal healthy (n=190) Unhealthy (n=37) Very unhealthy (n=13)Page | 29 Figure 5 : Most important factor to health as reported by CHIS, 2020 Source: CHIS , 2020. The CHNA community health survey asked respondents to identify the three factors they feel are essential characteristics of a happy, healthy, and thriving community for children and families. Access to healthcare providers (e.g., family doctors, pediatricians) was the number one characteristic across all respondent types. Families also prioritized low crime and safe neighborhoods. Safe, stable, and nurturing relationships within the family unit were ranked among the top three characteristics by both healthcare professionals and service providers.

The top three harmful behaviors, factors, and conditions contributing to injuries, violence, and poor health outcomes were community violence (e.g., gang violence, homicide), social isolation, and domestic violence, including intimate partner violence and elder abuse. Healthcare professionals ranked tobacco use, including vaping, among the top three, while service providers ranked overuse of technology/excessive screen time and child abuse/neglect. Community members ranked not completing high school and not using seat belts or child safety seats among their top three.

The factors were considered potential priorities when two conditions were met: Community members expressed concern about the health factor Secondary data, including public health and socioeconomic data, indicated significant differences in Orange County compared to California or indicated a concerning or worsening trend with that factor CHOC's 2022 CHNA was guided by three questions in selecting the final set of health priorities: Can a partnership or a single organization exert influence the is sue? Is there existing willingness and an opportunity in the community to influence the issue? Is measurable change possible within the three-year life cycle of the CHNA ? Based on results of the primary and secondary data analysis, the team identified two health priorities for Orange County: Mental health Access to pediatric healthcare services The team also identified four key drivers of health to consider when developing strategies to respond to the two health priorities. The four key drivers of health are: Healthy and affordable foods Early learning opportunities and success in school Safe neighborhoods Connectedness Page | 35 Priority 1: Mental Health The World Health Organization (WHO) describes mental health as \"a state of well -being in which the individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community.\" Mental health is not simply the absence of a mental disorder. People who do not have a mental disorder might differ in how well they are doing, and people who have the same diagnosed mental disorder might differ in their strengths and weaknesses , in how they are developing and coping, and in their quality of life. Mental health exists on a continuum and is influenced by biological, social, and psychological factor s, as described in Figure 7. Figure 7: Biopsychosocial factors Page | 36 The social influences on mental health include discrimination and social exclusion, poor education, unemployment or underemployment, lack of job security, poverty, food insecurity, lack of quality or affordable housing, lack of access to healthcare, and Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs). ACEs include experiences of child maltreatment, parental substance abuse, divorce, and domestic violence, among others. A large body of research confirms the harmful effect ACEs can have on the health and well-being of individuals. Children exposed to four or more ACEs are at four to 12 times greater risk for substance abuse, depression, and suicide. 3 Largely , these determinants stem from unequal distribution of opportunity. Issues of mental health can impact not only individuals and their families but also systems within the community, such as schools or the juvenile justice system. Poor mental health is a growing problem and identified as a health priority in both 2019 and 2022 CHOC CHNA s. More than half (52% ) of the community health survey respondents selected poor mental health as the problem with the most significant impact on the overall health of children and families in Orange County. This was identified as a problem less frequently among families (45%) compared to healthcare professionals (67%) and service providers (8 0%). Table 14: Percent of respondents who said a top problem impacting the overall health of children and families was mental health, by respondent type Healthcare Professionals (n=154) Service Providers (n=153) Families (n=1,028) All 45% 52% Note: Ninety -five respondents answered the survey from both the perspective of a provider and as a parent , guardian, or caregiver of children. Therefore, the total number of responses is greater than number of unique survey respondents of 1,248. Source: CHNA Community Health Survey, 2022.

Page | 37 In October 2021, American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry's (AACAP) together with the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the Children's Hospital Association , joined together to declare a national state of emergency in children's mental health, stating the \"worsening crisis in child and adolescent mental health is inextricably tied to the stress brought on by COVID -19 and the ongoing struggle for racial justice, and represents an acceleration of trends observed before 2020. Rates of childhood mental health concerns and suicide rates rose steadily between 2010 and 2020; by 2018, suicide was the second leading cause of death for youth ages 10-24.\"4 These sentiments were expressed by parents, guardians , mental health providers, school personnel, and others throughout the CHNA's community engagement process. School personnel reported that more students are suffering from anxiety, depression, and insomnia since the pandemic, and loneliness has \"skyrocketed\" along with the number of prescriptions written to treat these conditions. The consensus is that children and youth are not getting help for their mental health conditions. It was also an issue commonly tied to other concerns, like substance use and gun violence. Shared themes on mental health include: An identified need to pay attention to the mental health needs of younger children, not just adolescents The COVID -19 Public Health Emergency (PHE) as a source of stress for children, especially students Access to mental health services a s a major barrier for children to be and get well, especially those who are uninsured This CHNA identified three primary concerns related to mental health: 1. Increase in depressive symptoms among students 2. Increase in hospitalizations for mental illness in 2020, despite the overall decrease in hospitalizations due to the COVID-19 PHE 3. Need for prevention, early intervention, and treatment for substance use among youth Prevalence of Depression Among Children and Youth According to a COVID -19 survey conducted by the Orange County Healthcare Agency , Behavioral Health Services Division, in Fall 2020, almost 51% of parents indicated their child was potentially experiencing significant issues related to anxiety and depression. Specifically, approximately 20% of children were exhibiting elevated levels of disruptive behavior , and nearly 50% were experiencing elevated sadness or worry. The survey identified that COVID -19 was also taking a toll on Orange County adults ' well-being, finding that: More than 50% reported high levels of stress (59%) or anger (55%) Thirty -seven percent repor ted increased or new use of substances or gambling Twenty -eight percent reported an elevated level of serious psychological distress Thirty -one percent indi cated they were having a \"very\" or \"extremely\" difficult time coping during the pandemi c Page | 38 According to the CDC, being mentally healthy in childhood means reaching developmental and emotional milestones and learning healthy social skills and how to cope when there are problems.5 In 2022, according to the Orange County Early Development Index, approximately one in 10 kindergartener s (11%) exhibited anxious and fearful behavior upon entry into kindergarten.43 This rate has remained the same since 2015. During school year (SY) 2020-2021, 5.0 students per 1,000 county -wide reported having depression.32 Several Orange County school districts reported rates of 14.1 students with depression per 1,000 students in SY 2020-2021 - Huntington Beach, Irvine, Fullerton, Anaheim, Placentia-Yorba Linda, and OCDE Special Education. The CHKS suggests that in 2017-201 9, the percent of Orange County students who reported experiencing depression-related feelings ranged from 24.6% among 7th grade students , to 34.6% among 11th grade students , and 36.4% for non-traditional school -based students. Orange County rates were lower than California.56 The percent of students in grades 7, 9, and 11 who reported experiencing depression-related feelings had increased between 2011-2013 and 2017-2019, except for non-traditional students in California. 56 Figure 8: Students who reported experiencing depression-related feelings, by grade level Note: Depression- related feelings were defined as when a student felt so sad or hopeless almost every day for two weeks or more that they stopped doing some usual California 2011-2013 2017-20197th Grade 9th Grade 11th Grade Non-TraditionalPage | 39 In 2017-2019, BIPOC students were more likely to report depression-related feelings than their White/Caucasian classmates. Black/ African American students in Orange County have higher rates of depression-related feelings compared to their peers in California.

Students who identified as gay, lesbian, or bisexual (as defined by HKCS) were more than twice as likely to report depression-related feelings than their heterosexual classmates (63.5% to 27.0%) in 2017-2019. 56 This disparity is comparable to student experiences across California. Figure 9: Students who reported experiencing depression -related feelings, by race and ethnicity, 2017- 2019. Hospitalizations for Mental Health Mental health is a leading health indicator (LHI) of Healthy People 2030 (HP2030). The HP2030 primary objective for mental health is to increase the proportion of adolescents with major depressive episodes (MDEs) who receive treatment. The earlier young people get treatment for depressi on, the more effective it can be in preventing more severe, long-term problems in adults. However, many adolescents with depression do not get treatment.6 In 2020, in Orange County, 12.7% of youth ages 12-17 years reported receiving psychological/emotional counseling in the past year, and this percentage has remained stable since 2016.19 In 2019, there were 4.9 hospital discharges for mental health issues per 1,000 Orange County youth ages five to 19 years .i,7 This was lower than California's rate of 5.3 per 1,000 youth.

Nationally, suicide rates (all ages) increased 3% between 2000 to 2018 and declined in 2019 and 2020.In 2020, suicide was among the top nine leading causes of death for people ages 10-64. Suicide was the second leading cause of death for people ages 10-14 and 25-34. 8 In 2018-2020, in Orange County, suicide was the second leading cause of death among youth ages 1-19 years , with 47 deaths . The number of deaths in Orange County due to suicide has increased from 33 deaths in 2012-2014, despite a 6.1% decrease in the population ages 0-17 years between 2012 and 2019. Figure 14: Number of suicide deaths for children (1-19 years ), by age group and number of deaths, 2012-2014 to 2018-2020 Source: HCA, 2020. Suicide deaths, however, account for only part of the problem. The number of people who think about or attempt suicide is even higher. In 2020, an estimated 12.2 million people in the United States seriously thought about suicide, 3.2 million planned a suicide attempt, and 1.2 million attempted suicide.9 Those who survive suicide may have serious injuries, in addition to experiencing depression and other mental health problems. According to The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's ( SAMHSA') 2020 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, about 11% of young adults (ages 18-25) report that they've had serious thoughts about suicide, and about 1% to 2% report a suicide attempt during the prior year.

Substance Use and Mental Health Youth struggling with emotional problems sometimes turn to alcohol or drug use to help them manage painful or difficult feelings . Substance use may help mitigate mental health symptoms like hopelessness, anxiety, irritability, and negative thoughts at first.11 However, since a youth's brain is still developing, the substance use can exacerbate these symptoms and result in abuse or dependence more quickly than with an adult.11 A 2016 study of 10,000 adolescents found that two-thirds of those who developed alcohol or substance use disorders had experienced at least one mental health disor der.12 Among the types of health problems listed in the community health survey, drug addiction was ranked to have the most significant impact on the health of children and youth by 21% of respondents, with alcohol addiction ranked 10 th by 10%.

The number and percent of adolescents receiving substance use treatment services provided by the Orange County Healthcare Agency's (HCA) Behavioral Health Services reflect that treatment for marijuana use is the most common, followed by methamphetamine and \"other\" substances (e.g., inhalants, amphetamines, sedatives, stimulants and over the counter drugs). Since 2015- 2016, treatment services for substances counted in the \"other\" category has increased, while treatment for methamphetamines and alcohol decreased. HCA Behavioral Health Services predominately serves youth ages 15-17; h owever, the proportion of youth substance users ages 13-14 years increased between 2015-2016 and 2019-2020, from 10.3% of adolescents served to 19.9% of adolescents served. iii iiiData reflects the trend of adolescent utilization of services provided by ADAS and its contract providers rather than the absolute number of adolescents needing services or using alcohol or other drugs in Orange County.

Source: HCA, 2019/2020. Alcohol Patterns formed during adolescence play a critical role in health throughout adulthood. According to research by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, adolescents who begin drinking at a young age are more likely to develop alcohol dependence than those who begin drinking at age 21. Alcohol use also impairs judgment and can lead to other high-risk behaviors such as driving while intoxicated. As part of the CHKS , self-reported binge drinking rates had decreased between 2013-2015 and 2017-2019 in Orange County and California. In Orange County, 9th grade (14-15 years ), and 11th grade (16-17 years) students were less likely to binge drink when compared to students in non-traditional programs (e.g., students in all grades attending an program ). In 2017-2019, non-traditional program students in Orange County had higher binge drinking rates compared to their peers in California, 24.0% and 13.0%, respectively. Figure 17: Percent of students who binge drank in the past 30 days Note: Estimat ed percentage of public -school students in grades 7, 9, 11, and non-traditional programs who have consumed five or more drinks of alcohol within a couple of hours in the previous 30 days .

Vaping and Cigarette Use In Orange County, in 2017-2019, 9% of Grade 9 students , and 13% of Grade 11 students , reported at least one day of e-cigarette use in the past 30 days .56 These rates were higher compared to California, where 6% of Grade 9 and 11% of Grade 11 students reported at last one day of e-cigarette use in the past 30 days. Vaping is more prevalent than cigarette smoking in both Orange County and California. In 2015-2019, 3% of 9th and 11th grade high school students in Orange County and California reported smoking cigarettes at least one day in the past 30 days.

The most dramatic changes in Orange County drug and alcohol -related mortality rates were among youth. Between 2019 and 2020, there was an 80% increase, from one death to nine, annually, for youth ages 10- 17 years. For young adults 18-24 years, there was a 15% increase from 34 to 85 deaths annually.

Drug and Alcohol Deaths Among Youths and Young Adults : The Impact o f Synthetic Opioids During the Pandemic. Among youth ages 10-24 years, the most frequent type of drug and alcohol substances present at the time of death were opioids/opiates. Among youth ages 10-17 years, opioids were noted in seven deaths (78% of deaths) in 2020, and in 2021 that number rose to 19 (95%) .13 Other substances present were alcohol, cannabis, sedatives, stimul ants, and cocaine. None of these other (non-opioid) substances, however, was present in more than five deaths in either year. Note that one death can be counted towards two or more substances because multiple substances can be present at the time of death. Among young adults ages 18-24 years, between 2017 and 2019, opioids were present in approximately 8% to 9% of drug and alcohol -related deaths .13 In 2020, opioids were noted in 89% of deaths, rising even higher to 94% in 2021. 13 The presence Asian/Pacific IslanderPage | 54 was also common, with 37% of deaths in 2020 involving sedatives, and 26% involving stimulants in that same year. Other drugs and substances, including cocaine, cannabis, and alcohol, were each present in approximately 25% of deaths or fewer for both 2020 and 2021. Most opioid-related overdose deaths among youth and young adults were accidental. 2021 demonstrated the highest number of opioid-related overdose deaths for individuals under 25 years (n=99), of which 99% were accidental (n=98) and 1% was intentional (n=1) .13 Table 20: Percent of opioid-related overdose deaths among youth and young adults by intent, 2017 to 2021 Source: HCA. (2022). Drug and Alcohol Deaths Among Youths and Young Adults : The Impact of Synthetic Opioids During the Pandemic. The increase in opioid drug-related deaths was driven by synthetic opioids (excluding methadone), which saw nearly a 547 % jump from 2017 (n=15) to 2021 (n=97) with the sharpest increase in 2020 (n=79). A specific concern raised in the HCA analysis was fentanyl -involved overdose deaths among youth and young adults. Young adults experienced a 550 % increase in fentanyl -involved overdose deaths from 2017 (n=12) overall fentanyl -involved overdose deaths increased within the 5-year timeframe from 1.1 per 100,000 persons to 9.4 per 100,000 persons.

Adults who died of an overdose were most frequently between ages 25-54 years and in their child-rearing years. In Orange County, in 2021, 6% (n=803) of drug and alcohol related deaths were among adults ages 25-54 years. 13 Substance use in the household is considered an adverse childhood experience and associated with health risks and disease for children in these household later in life. The loss of a parent from drug and alcohol use has a profound effect on children. A recent longitudinal study found that bereavement by sudden parental death was Intent 2017 2018 2019 | 55 associated with an increased incidence of depression, primarily during the first two years, along with post-traumatic stress disorder and functional impairment.14 Although Orange County has experienced one of the lowest all -drug death rates per 100,000 residents in California, the rate increased from 12.2 in 2016 to a high of 19.5 in 2020, a 71.4% increase.15 Table 22: Age adjusted drug death rate per 100,000 residents by drug type, 2016 to 2020 Drug Deaths by Type 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Percent Change: 2016 to 2020 Percent Change: 2019 to 2020 All Drug Deaths 12.2 10.9 11.9 11.2 19.5 60.2% 74.9% Heroin 1.4 1.7 1.9 2.2 2.4 68.1% 9.0% 8.5 7.5 7.5 7.5 15.5 HCA.

Page | 56 Priority 2: Access to Pediatric Healthcare Services Access to affordable, quality healthcare is vital to physical, social, and mental health. Access to care allows individuals to enter the healthcare system, find care easily and locally, pay for care, and get their health needs met. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (formerly known as the Institute of Medicine) define access to healthcare as the \"timely use of personal health services to achieve the best possible health outcomes.\"16 Lack of health insurance, poor access to transportation, and limited healthcare resources (e.g., physician shortages) are examples of barriers to care. Experiencing these barriers may mean inconsistent access to healthcare, longer wait times, and delayed car e. In Orange County, in 2016-2020, 3.3% (24,253) of children were uninsured, representing a drop in uninsured rates by 56.0% since 2010-2014 (7.4% or 53,894). Compared to the year prior, the percentage of uninsured children remained constant (3.3% in 2015-2019).17,iv Orange County had the same rate of uninsured children (3.3%) compared to California (3.3%) and a lower rate than the United States (5.2%). As outlined in Figure 22, Hispanic or Latino/a children continued to have higher uninsured rates than other racial/ethnic groups, with 5.2% uninsured in 2019, compared to Asian children (3.2%), White/Caucasian children (3.1%), and Other races (1.3%).18 Source: U.S. Census. 5 -year estimates 2015 -2019. Table B01001. ivAnnual variations are not as obvious 5-year estimates and limits the ability to interpret the impact of outstanding circumstances that occurred in a single year. The findings are consistent with the assertions that health insurance coverage was not greatly impacted from 2019 to 2020 and instead remained constant. To learn more, see Johnson, Ben & Hashida, Corey. 7 May 2021. \"Impact of COVID -19 on H ealth Care Access.\" Legislative Analyst's Office Figure 20: Percent uninsured children in Orange County, 201 9 3.2%5.2% 3.1% 1.3% 0.0%2.0%4.0%6.0% Asian Hispanic or Latino/a White/Caucasian OtherPage | 57 In addition, the California Health Interview Survey (pooled estimate for 2016-2020) estimates 9.2% of Orange County children did not have a usual source of care to go to when they were sick or needed health advice. Most Orange County children who had access to a usual source of care went to a doctor's office (74.5%), while 14.3% usually went to a clinic or community hospital . 19 The proportion of children who regularly visited an Emergency Department, urgent care center or some other location and those without a usual source of care was 11.3%. Approximately 5.8% of Orange County children experienced a delay or lack of medical care, and 3.3% experienced a delay or lack of needed prescription medications. During the COVID -19 PHE, states received increased Medicaid funding on the condition that they would postpone disenrollment if the federal PHE remained in effect. This has allowed Orange County residents to maintain stable Medi -Cal coverage during the pandemic. While the end of the federal COVID -19 PHE is uncertain, California will have to redetermine eligibility for millions of Medi -Cal enrollees. Key informants spoke to the need for education by providers, hospitals, and health plans to for families around insurance re-enrollment. The CHNA top concerns related to a ccess to healthcare was: 1. Need for improved access to pediatric services (including pediatric specialists) from diverse providers who understand the county's racial, cultural, and linguistic needs of children and famil ies 2. Geographic disparity in access to pediatric health care Family Perspective on Access to Care When asked to consider access, cost, availability, quality, and options in healthcare, 48% of family survey respondents were either neutral or disagreed with the statement, \"I am satisfied with the healthcare system in my community .\" Note that the survey questions around access to care and barriers was in response to overall pediatric care in Orange County and not specific to CHOC providers. Experiencing barriers to care may be one reason for dissatisfaction with the healthcare system. Eighty -six percent of the survey respondents indicated they have experienced barriers to care, and this rate was similar across all priority populations. Among respondents who did experience barriers, the number -one barrier in getting services to support their child's(ren's) healthcare and wellness was long wait times to get appointments (43%), followed by needed evening or weekend appointments (28%), and overly complicated application forms to get health insurance (27%). These three barriers were also cited as the most common barriers to getting services among the priority populations. However, not finding a healthcare provider that understood, valued, and respected their culture, and not finding providers that looked like them, were elevated to among the top three barriers among BIPOC and LGBTQIA+ survey respondents. For example, among BIPOC survey respondents, the second most common barrier was not finding a healthcare Page | 58 provider that understood, valued, and respected their culture (31%). For LGBTQIA+ survey respondents, not finding providers that looked like them was ranked among the top three concerns . Table 24: Barrier(s) experienced in getting services to support child's(ren's) healthcare and wellness , by priority population Note: Green fill denotes the top three barriers selected by each priority population. Source: CHNA Community Health Survey, 2022. In focus groups and key informant interviews, the number -one barrier to care mentioned was healthcare staffing shortages, followed by long wait times for an appointment. Other concerns stated were s hort encounters, transportation barriers , fear of discrimination, language barriers , lack of childcare, COVID -19 related barriers, navigating and dealing with health insurance, prescription costs, including high copays, and stigma (for mental health services). Nearly half (47%) of survey respondents reported avoiding or delaying necessary healthcare services because of fear or discomfort. A person or family may avoid getting healthcare services if they feel their healthcare provider (e.g., doctor, nurse, dentist, pharmacist, midwife, clinical social worker) will not listen to their concerns due to who they are or who their children are. The most common reasons respondents reported avoiding or delay ing healthcare was because they were worried that they or their child(ren) would be treated unfairly due to their ethnicity, insurance status, disability, and income. Page | 59 More than two in three family survey respondents reported they experienced (with any healthcare provider) at least one time when: They felt like a doctor or nurse was not listening to what they were saying (65%). A doctor or nurse \"acted as if they were better than you\" (59%). They were treated less courteously than others ( 59%). Focus group participants were asked to elaborate on the experiences identified in the survey. There was an understanding among participants that the clinicians' workload is likely a major contributing factor in unsatisfactory interactions. Regardless, feelings of being unheard create frustration for families. Figure 21: How often did any of the following things happen to you while getting healthcare services for you or your child(ren)?

Provider Perspective on Access to Care From the provider perspective, access to behavioral health services and primary care providers, care coordination, navigation, and referrals across all healthcare services were the top three barriers to accessing care for families . Safe transition of adolescent patients to the adult healthcare system, programs to address maternal health outcomes, and programs and services addressing chronic diseases (e.g., heart disease, diabetes, arthritis) were less likely to be ranked as top barriers to accessing care. 33%54%55%56%59%59%65% 0% 25% 50% 75% 100%A doctor or nurse acted as if they are afraid of you.

However, when prompted to think about the most vulnerable children and families engaged with social workers, one issue freque ntly cited was language barrier s. Participants shared that it is not uncommon for families to resist requesting an interpreter because they feel the request may seem ungrateful and disrespectful to the physician. In these situations, participants have observed that the pediatric patient becomes the interpreter for the parents/caregivers. This is not optimal, since a child's vocabulary is limited by their education and life experience, and children lack the maturity, cognitively and emotionally, to manage the stress of accurately providing complex information through interpretation. Both families and providers mentioned the struggle to find providers who can take new patients . Families with an established relationship with a clinician often wait months for an appointment. These experiences are shared by many families, regardless of health insurance type. Providers expressed that families may have \"the best of the best insurance\" and still wait months for an appointment. Wait times are significantly longer when families attempt to access behavioral health and specialty services , such as applied behavior analysis, occupational therapy, and physical therapy . Access to Care for Childr en with Special Healthcare Needs and Children Enrolled in Special Education The barriers noted by community survey respondents, including both providers and families, are often exacerbated or more abundant among families of Children with Special Healthcare Needs (CSHCN). These barriers include long wait times to get appointments, needed evening or weekend appointment, and complicated application forms for insurance coverage and benefits. In 2016-2019, 13.5% of children ( ages 0 -17 years) had special healthcare needs in Orange County . This was lower than in California at 14.1% .20 In 2020, 124.2 per 1,000 Orange County students were enrolled in special education, primarily due to a l earning disability (37.3 per 1,000), followed by speech or language impairment (29.4 per 1,000), and a utism (23.6 per 1,000). Enrollment in special education for speech or language impairment, autism, and other health impairment was higher in Orange County than in California.

Enrollment in special education services increased between 2016 and 2020 in both Orange County and California.

A notable resource in Orange County that improved access to care for CSHCN, is the Orange County Children's Screening R egist ry initiative. With the passage of the California Healthcare Research and Prevention Tobacco Tax Act of 2016 (Proposition 56) in January 2020, California began offering incentives to Medi -Cal providers for completing certain behavioral and development screenings annually for child and adolescent patient populations . A developmental screening is the use of a standardized set of questions to see if a child's motor, language, cognitive, social, and emotional development are on track for their age. The Orange County Children's Screening R egistry initiative is in response to Proposition 56. On average, three new medical practices gained access to the registry per month in 2020. Since then, about one per month have joined. Cumulatively, 32 total practices were added in 2020, eight in 2021, and four in the first quarter of 2022. This is an important indicator of increased access to developmental screening. It should be noted that the Registry data does not represent all pediatricians in Orange County .21 Among Orange County children (1 year or older) in 2020, 73.1% of parents reported their child(ren)'s doctor, other health providers, teachers or school counselors had done a developmental screening. 28 20.523.6 15.620.3 2.9 0102030405060 2016 2020 2016 2020 Orange County CaliforniaAutism Emotional Disturbance Intellectual Disability Learning Disability Other Health Impairment Speech or Language ImpairmentPage | 65 Figure 26: Percent of children who have received a developmental screening, Orange County Note: * Statistically unstable . Source: CHIS, 2020. In Orange County, developmental screens included assessments for developmental delays in communication, gross motor skills , fine motor skills , problem solving, and personal -social (as measured by the Ages & Stages Questionnaires\u00ae-3 (ASQ -3); social emotional well-being (as measured by the ASQ SE-2); a utism as measured by the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers ( M-CHAT ), and the Parents' Evaluation of Developmental Status (PEDS) tool. Developmental delays were the most common concerns identified, followed by social emotional well-being, autism, and a positive score on the PEDS. The average monthly percent of unique children screening at risk for developmental concerns is highest for developmental delays with a 2019-2022 average screening positiv ity rate of 15% . On average, 8% of screens using PEDS, and 5% of ASQ SE -2 for social emotional well -being, indicate risk. Compared to screening results in 2020 and 2021, the percentage of screens indicating risk for social emotional well -being and a positive score on the PEDS 66 Figure 27: Average monthly percent of unique children screened to be at risk for developmental concerns Source: Orange County Children's Screening Registry, March 2022. With implementation of the O range County Children's Screening Registry, referrals to Help Me Grow, an organization which connects children and families to developmental services, are higher. This is also true for referrals to other organizations/programs, increasing from 41 referrals per month to a high of 77 referrals per month in 2020. Since 2020, referrals to other organizations have decreased. Most referrals were for developmental services, autism ser vices, and therapies.

Through both the community health survey and focus groups, families described the challenge of long wait times to get appointments and a lack of healthcare providers and social services in Orange County to meet their child's need. Providers through the community health survey ranked \" programs that help youth develop social, ethical, emotional, physical, and cognitive skills needed during adolescence and to transition into adulthood\" as the second-most -needed program in the community they serve. Together, this suggests that access to the necessary resources to meet an identified developmental need continues to be a challenge in Orange County. 2847 42 4177 2065 4461 0255075100 Referrals to Help Me Grow from other organizations Referrals to Other Organizations/Programs2018 2019 2020 2021 2022Page | 68 Health Behaviors and Outcomes Health issues or concerns identified by the community or in the secondary data, but that did not meet the prioritization criteria, are summarized in this Health Behaviors and Outcomes secti on.

Access to maternal and infant healthcare can help mitigate health risks and promote positive outcomes . v Table 26: Maternal and infant health22 Births In 2020, there were 30,862 Orange County births. This number of births reflects a 19.0% drop from 38,121 in 2016. The largest proportion of births were to people ages 30- 34 years (35%), followed by 25-20 years (23.4%), 35-30 years (23.0%), and 20-24 years (10.3%). Births to teens ages 15- 19 years was 2.2%. In 2020, the average age of first birth was 29.5 years which was older than five years ago at 29.8 years in 2016. Prenatal care In 2020, Orange County's rate of pregnant people receiving early prenatal care was 88.2%. This rate was returning towards the 10-year high of 88.7% in 2011, and remained higher than California (85.8%) in 2020. 93.1% of White/Caucasian pregnant people received early prenatal care followed by Other (90.2%), Asian/Pacific Islander (87.1%), Hispanic or Latino/a (85.1%) and Black /African American (82.5%) pregnant people. The prenatal care rate for Asian/Pacific Islanders increased 4.2% from 2019 to 2020, while this rate for Black/African American pregnant people decreased by 4.0%. Low weight births Of births in 2020, 6.2% (1,900) were low birt hweight infants, a decrease from 2019 (6.8%, 2,374). Compared to 2019, the total births decreased 11.7% from 34,963 births. By race/ethnicity, the percent of low -birthweight infants within each group were: Black/African American and White/Caucasian (5.0%) infants. Percent of low weight birth infants decreased across all race/ethnicity groups between 2019 and 2020, except Asian/Pacific Islander which remained constant. vAll Maternal, Infant and Child Health data were provided by the Orange County Health Care Agency, Family health Division unless otherwise noted. Page | 69 Preterm births Preterm births accounted for 8.3% of the 30,862 births to Orange County residents in 2020. This percentage was slightly higher than in 2016 at 8.0%. By comparison, the rate was higher in California (8.8%). The percentage of preterm births in Orange County was highest among Black /African American infants (12.3%), followed by Hispanic or Latino/a (8.7%), White/Caucasian (6.8%) and Asian/Pacific Islander (6.6%) infants. The percentages increased i n 2020 for Black/African American infants compared to 2019 and decreased for Hispanic or Latino/a and White/Caucasian infants, while remaining constant for Asian/Pacific Islander infants. Breastfeeding In 2020, 67.6% of Orange County women were exclusively breastfeeding at time of hospital discharge compared to 69.7% of women in California. Exclusive breastfeeding at time of discharge was highest among White/Caucasian women and American Indian women at 82.4%, followed by multiracial (79.3%), Black (65%), Pacific Islander and Hispanic or Latino/a (61.4%), and Asian (58.7%) women. Exclusive b reastfeeding three months after delivery decreased in 2019 - 2020 to 53.6%, after a nine year high of 58.7% in 2017/18. Child immunization In 2021, 96.1% of Orange County children in childcare centers had up -to- date immunizations (4:3:1 schedule) at their time of enrollment, compared to 87.6% in 2013. In 2021, 96.3% of Orange County kindergartners had up -to-date immunizations, an 8.6% increase from the 10 -year low of 88.7% in 2013. Savanna School District had the lowest percentage of kindergartners with up-to-date immunization levels at 91.4% in 2021, followed by Capistrano School District (93.2%). Los Alamitos School District had the highest percentage of kindergartners with up-to-date immunization levels at 99.4%. Maternal mortality In 2020, maternal mortality per 100,000 live births in Orange County was 6.5 (2 deaths) compared to 11.4 (4 deaths) in 2019. In 2018, there were 17 maternal deaths for every 100,000 live births in the United States \u2014 a ratio more than double that of most other high-income countries. In contrast, the maternal mortality ratio was three per 100,000 or fewer in the Netherlands, Norw ay, and New Zealand .23 Infant mortality In 2020, there were 77 infant deaths in Orange County. The infant mortality rate was 2.8 deaths per 1,000 births in 2020 and had remained stable since 2016 at 2.7. This rate wa s lower than California's rate of 3.7 per 1,000 births. Infant mortality rates (per 1,000 live births) were highest among Hispanic or Latino/a (3.7) infants, followed by White/Caucasian (2.3) and Asian/Paci fic Islander (1.0) infants. Page | 70 Injury and Death Injuries, both unintentional and intentional, were ranked by survey respondents as health problems significantly impacting overall health of children and families. Specifically, injuries (physical or emotional) from domestic violence or abuse were ranked 5th, fire-arm related injuries ranked 9th, unintentional injuries ranked 11th, and suicide ranked 12th. There were 121 deaths for children ages 1-19 years in Orange County in 2020.vi The mortality rate was 13.0 deaths per 100,000 children ages 1 -19 years in 2020. Teens (15-19 years ) have the highest mortality rate at 28.0 per 100,000 youth. Mortality rates increased between 2019 and 2020 for all age groups after a four -year decline between 2016 and 2019.

This was lower than California's rate of 14.7 in 2020. The unintentional injury death rate (e.g., accidental poisoning, motor vehicle accident, or drowning) increased 31.9% from a rate of 4.7 per 100,000 youth ages 1 -9 years in 2011 to 6.2 per 100,000 youth in 2020. Over half (58.9%) of all youth deaths were injury -related in 2020 , which was a significant increase from 2019 (42.9%). 2020 had a larger portion of unintentional poisonings (19.0%) among all youth deaths compared to 2019 (3.8%). Gun-related injury In 2020, the number of youth (ages 0 -19 years) killed by guns was five, a 62% decrease from 13 deaths in 2016. In 2020, three deaths were homicide and two deaths were suicide. There were no accidental gun- related deaths among youth in 2020 . Child abuse injuries (physical or emotional )25 In 2021, 25,860 youth (0 -17 years) were the subject of one or more child abuse allegations in Orange County. Allegations were substantiated for 17.7% (4,572) of these children. In 2021, substantiated child abuse allegations occurred at a rate of 6.5 per 1,000 youth 0-17 years in Orange County, which was lower than California's rate (6.3). Substantiated allegations in Orange County decreased 17.7% from 7.9 per 1,000 youth in 2012 compared to a 30.8% decrease from 9.1 per 1,000 youth in 2012 for California. Children under six made up the greatest proportion of substantiated child abuse allegations. Children less than one year of age comprised 14.2% of substantiated child abuse allegations, and children one to five years old made up 29.6% of substantiated allegations. Children six to 10 years old made up 25.5%; children 11 to 15 years old represented 23.4%; and youth 16 to 17 years old were 7.4% of substantiated allegations. In 2021, most (71.9%) substantiated child abuse allegations were du e to general neglectvii, followed by at-risk/sibling abuse (9.0%), severe neglect (8.1%), sexual (3.4%), (0.6%) , and emotional abuse (0.5%).viii viiGeneral neglect is the negligent failure of a parent/guardian or caretaker to provide adequate food, clothing, shelter, or supervision where no physical injury to the child has occurred. viiiA child is counted only once, in category of highest severity. Page | 72 Chronic Health Conditions In the United States, more than 4% of school -aged children and adolescents have at least one chronic health condition, such as asthma, obesity, other physical conditions and behavior/learning problems.26 The healthcare needs of children with chronic illness can be complex and continuous and include both daily management and addressing potential emergencies. Community health survey respondents ranked cancer, the COVID -19 pandemic, eating disorders , and diabetes within the top 10 health problems that have a significant impact on overall health of children and families. Poor eating habits (such as overreliance on fast food), an important risk factor for some chronic health conditions, was ranked the third-most -risky health behavior. Table 28: Health risk behaviors for chronic disease ix,27 Obesity Trends in obesity rates among students in grades 5, 7, and 9 have remained the same between the school years (SY) 2013/14 and 2018/19. Approximately one in three students are considered at risk of obesity (5th grade, 36.6%; 7th grade, 34.9%; and 9th grade, 31.4%). Orange County 5th grade students of color are disproportionate ly impacted by obesity . This is particularly true for Hispanic or Latino /a and Pacific Islander students at rates of 48.5% and 44.5%, respectively, in 2018/19. Physical activity In 2018/19 the rate of Orange Count y students meeting all fitness standards increased with age and were higher than for California as a whole: 28.5% of Orange County 5th grade students were meeting fitness standards , compared to 42.2% of 9th grade students. In 2020, 15.5% of Orange County teens spent eight or more hours on sedentary activities on typical weekend days. This was higher than in 2019 at 12.0% and 3.0% in 2016.x,28 Nutrition In 2020, 36.5% of teens had five or more servings of fruits/vegetables daily, which increased from 21.9% in 2019. Among children, the rate of eating five or more servings of fruits and vegetables (excluding juice and fried potatoes) was higher in 2020 at 40.2%, increasing from 29.8% in 2019. 29 The rate of children and teens eating five or more servings of fruits/vegetables daily decreases among children and teens living below poverty. For children, it dropped to 12.6% , and for teens, it dropped to 27.1% .30 ixAll health risk behaviors for chronic disease data are from California Department of Education, DataQuest, unless otherwise noted. x 2016 value of 3.0% is statistically unstable and should be interpreted with caution. Page | 73 Tobacco and e- cigarette (vaping) use During 2017 -2019, 2.1% of Orange County grade 11 students reported some level of cigarette use during the past 30 days. This rate was like California, at 2.3%. Among grade 11 students, 12.9% had used e -cigarettes in the past 30 days.31 Oral health Among Orange County youth ages 3 to 11 years, in 2020, 67.8% had visited a dentist within the previous 6 months. In 2019, this rate was higher, at 84.0%.28 Table 29: Chronic disease prevalence Asthma School districts assess the rate of asthma among students. The median rate of students per 1,000 with asthma in Orange County was 75.7. School districts with a rate of 87.5 students with asthma per 1,000 or higher had the highest rates compared to 75% of the other school districts in Orange County. In school year 2020 -2021, these school districts were Newport- Mesa, Huntington Beach, Irvine, Capistrano, Fullerton, Los Alamitos, and Lowell Joint.32 Diabetes School districts assess the rate of Type 1 diabetes among students. The median rate of students per 1,000 with diabetes in Orange County was 2.0. School districts with a rate of 2.5 students with diabetes per 1,000 or higher had the highest rates compared to 75% of the other school districts in Orange County. In SY2020-2021, these school districts were OCDE/Special Education, Capistrano, Los Alamitos, Savanna, Irvine, Saddleback Valley, and Fullerton Joint Union.32 Page | 74 Teen Sexual Health WHO defines sexual health as a state of physical, emotional, mental and social well-being in relation to sexuality; it is not merely the absence of disease, dysfunct ion or infirmity. In 2017- 2018, 87.1% of California teens had never had sex. This was an increased from 81.7% in 2011- 12. Orange County estimates are not available.33 Table 30: Teen sexual health22 Teen birth22 In 2020, 698 Orange County births were to females ages 19 years and younger, a 42.3% decrease from 1,210 births in 2016. The teen birth rate in Orange County in 2020 was 6.9 births per 1,000 females ages 15 to 19, a decrease of 36.7% from 10.9 births per 1,000 in 2016. At 6.9 births per 1,000 teen (ages 15 -19) females, Orange County has a lower teen birth rate than California (11.0). In 2020, Hispanic or Latina/o teens had the highest birth rate (13.0 births per 1,000 teen females), followed by Black/African American (8.0), White/Caucasian (2.2), and Asian/Pacific Islander (0.6) teens in Orange County. In 2020, the fi ve cities with the highest birth rate per 1,000 teen females were Buena Park (17.2 per 1,000 teens, n=29 births), Stanton (17.0, n=19), Santa Ana (15.5, n=187), Anaheim (11.9, n=145), Placentia (10.8, n=18), and Fullerton (10.3, n=48). Sexually Transmitted Infections 34 In 2021, there were 145.8 cases of chlamydia per 100,000 youth ages 10 - 17 years, which was a 30.0% decrease from a rate of 208.5 per 100,000 youth in 2017. The number of cases in 2021 was 481, down from 697 cases in 2017. Most cases (94.8%) were among youth ages 15-17 years. In 2021, there were 34.3 cases of gonorrhea per 100,000 youth ages 10 -17 years, which was a 3.2% increase from a rate of 33.2 per 100,000 youth in 2017. There were 113 cases of gonorrhea in 2021, up from 111 in 2017. The vast majority (96.5%) of gonorrhea cases were among youth ages 15- 17 years. In 2021, there were three cases of syphilis per 100,000 youth ages 10 -17 years, which was an increase from a rate of zero in 2017. The number of cases in 2021 was 10, and all were among youth ages 15 -17 years. Page | 76 Key Drivers of health To effectively invest in prevention activities that improve population health, it is necessary to identify and understand which factors or drivers are influencing poor health outcomes in a community. One of the most influential drivers of health is access to social and economic resources. Economic and social insecurity are associated with poor health, as poverty, unemployment, and lack of education affect access to healthcare services. Employment provides income that increases choices in housing, education, healthcare, childcare, and food. Family and social support can serve as protective factors that counter the effects of limited income and ability to accumulate financial resources. Research has shown that individuals who have greater social support or who live in neighborhoods with stronger social cohesion live longer, healthier lives than individuals who experience isolation. Without access to economic opportunity and social support within the community, people and families struggle to thrive. Because of the complexity that accompanies population health - the fact that most health problems are connected to many elements and are actively changing - solutions to these problems often happen through trial and error and vary by community. These factors must be considered when looking at the health data and when considering the strategies for addressing priority health needs. In recognition that there are many factors that drive health outcomes, the CHNA identified four key drivers of health: Healthy and Affordable Foods Early Learning Opportunities and Success in School Safe Neighborhoods Connectedness Appendix G provides detailed data tables of the measures used to define issues for each driver of health. Page | 77 Healthy and Affordable Foods Access to foods that support healthy eating patterns contributes to lifelong health. Unfortunately, there are barriers to, and disparities in, the accessibility and availability of foods that support healthy eating patterns. Low -income and minority communities often lack convenient sources of affordable, healthier foods. When healthy foods are not available, people may settle for foods higher in calories and lower in nutritional value. 35 The food issues captured in the community survey , coupled with secondary data obtained for this CHNA, surface two areas of concern: 1. Low participation in food assi stance programs 2. Proximity and affordability of food for low -income children and families Participation in Food Assistance Programs In 2019, 10% of Orange County children (70,970) experienced food insecurity .36 Of these children, 73% were income eligible for federal nutrition programs (incomes at or below 18% of poverty).36 Figure 30: Percent of children experiencing food insecurity and eligibility for food nutrition programs Source: USDA, Map the Meal Gap, 2019. The CalFresh Program, known nationally as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) , provide nutrition assistance to people in low -income households by increasing their food-buying power.

In 2019, on average,57.4% of people and children eligible for WIC were receiving that benefit every month nationally, lower than California at 68.9% per month. Both rates have dropped from a high in 2011, when the national rate was 63.5% and the California rate was 82.5%.37 There are four WIC agencies serving Orange County. Eac h agency has a caseload allocation. The percent of the caseload served was 97.5% in September 2021. While the caseload allocation was decreasing, the percent of the caseload served has been improving since 2019. This is one indicator to understand to what extent the percent of people and children eligible for WIC are receiving the benefit. 38 Figure 31: N umber of participants served by the WIC program in the month of September Source: HCA, 2021. WIC participation in Orange County was increasing since a 10-year low in September 2019, from 27,666 participants to 58,807 participants in September 2021\u2014an increase of 112%.38 Of these participants in September 2021, 17.0% (10,004) were infants. Between July 2020 and June 2021, over 91,000 ( 12.9%) Orange County children (0-17 years) received CalFresh. This was a 35.2% decrease from the 10-year high of 19.9% between July 2014 and June 2015. The percentage of children in California receiving CalFresh was higher at 19.1% .39 In a single month (January 2022), the greatest proportion of CalFresh beneficiaries under 18 in Orange County were children ages six to 12 years (40.8% or 35,939), followed by 13 to 17 years (29.8% or 26,317) and birth to of ParticipantsPage | 79 Figure 32: Percent of Orange County children Receiving CalFresh, by age group, June 2020 to July 2021 Source: California Department of Social Services, CalFresh County Data Dashboard, 2021. There was a larger gap between who was eligible to receive CalFresh and who received that benefit in Orange County than there was in California. In 2020, i t was estimated that 36.0% of people in Orange County who were eligible for CalFresh were not receiving that bene fit compared to 19.6% in California.39 This gap had increased since 2016 in Orange County from 29.1% while it was closing in California.

Children who enter school with basic knowledge of math and reading concepts , as well as communication, language, social competence and emotional maturity , are more likely than their peers without such skills to experience later academic success, attain higher levels of education and secure employment .41 This CHNA identified two areas of concern: 1. Low participation in childcare subsidies by eligible families 2. Increased rates of chronic absenteeism Early Learning Opportunities Childcare/daycare assistance was the most-selected service needed but not received by 30% of survey respondents. This is not surprising given that two in three (66% or 122,448) Orange County children five years and under have all available parents in the workforce, largely due to the high cost of living. 42 In Orange County, there are approximately two infants/toddlers in Orange County per licensed slot. Even if only one third of infants and toddlers in Orange County required childcare, there would still only be enough licensed capacity for one in seven children. High-quality care supports children's emotional, social, and cognitive development, but availability and affordability of early learning opportunities is a challenge in Orange County .42 The average annual cost in Orange County for a family with two young children in full -time care is $26,150, and the share of median family income needed for childcare is 26%. According to First 5 Orange County, 10% of median income is considered \"affordable.\" More than half of Orange County children birth to four years are eligible for state or federal subsidy, based on income (53.0%, n=56,817). However, just 6% of eligible children received these subsidies .42 Page | 83 Table 31: Infants/Toddlers served in subsidized childcare in Orange County Measure Estimate Total infants/toddlers se rved by state and federal ly-subsidized programs 3,514 Overall % eligible served 6% % of children for whom a licensed slot is available Preschool age children (3 -4 years) 70% Infants/Toddlers (0 -2 years) 5% Source: First 5 Orange County. (2020, October 7). Orange County Child Care Landscape Analysis : Phase 1 Report Findings . One of many important factors that influence kindergarten readiness is to what extent the child has early education opportunities. Additional factors include family and community support and environment. In 2022, 52.7% of children in Orange County were developmentally ready for kindergarten, an increase from 48.2% in 2013-2015.xiii,43 Figure 36: Percen t of children ready for kindergarten Source: Orange County Early Development Index, 2022. Children are considered developmentally ready for school if they are on track in all five areas assessed. These areas include language and cognitive development, general knowledge and communication, social competence, physical health and well -being, and emotional maturity. Among kindergarte ners, the areas of greatest vulnerabilities are language and cognitive development (71% on track or ready for kindergarten). Physical health and emotional maturity are where children are most likely to be ready (81%), though one in five students are not. xiii 2019- Figure 37: Percent of Orange County children ready for kindergarten by subdomain, 2022 Source: Orange County Early Development Index, 2022. In 2022, Hispanic and Latino/a and African American/Black students had the lowest rate of readiness for kindergarten (57.8% and 52.8%, respectively). Asian, Multiracial, and White/Caucasian students had the highest rates of readi ness (66.4%, 64.2%, and 61.9%, respectively). Between 2015 and 2022, each group's readiness for kindergarten was helping behavior, anxious and fearful behavior, aggressive behavior, hyperactive and inattentive behaviorPhysical Health & Well-being: Physical readiness for school day, physical independence, gross and fine motor skillsSocial Competence: Overall competence with peers, respect and responsibility, approaches to learning, readiness to explore new thingsGeneral Knowledge & Communication: Communication skills and general knowledgeLanguage & Cognitive Development: Basic literacy skills, interest in literacy/numeracy and memory, advanced literacy skills, basic numeracy skills Ready Somewhat Ready Not ReadyPage | 85 Figure 38: Percentage of Orange County children ready for kindergarten by race and ethnicity, 2015, 2018, and 2022 Source: Orange County Early Development Index, 2022. Success in School Third grade academic achievement is an important measure of success in school. For students, third grade is the year that the focus of reading instruction shifts from learning to read, to reading to learn. This is also the year when students start utilizing the decimal system to perform multi -digit number calculations, an important foundation for future success in mathematics. In 2019, nearly three out of five (59%) Orange County third grade students met or exceeded the statewide achievement standard in math, an eight -percentage point increase from 2015 (51%) . California was lower at 50%. 44 Also in 2019, over half (56%) of Orange County third grade students met or exceeded the statewide achievement standard for Engl ish Language Arts (ELA), a 10 -percentage point increase from 2015 (46%) and higher than California at 49%.44 Disparities exist in ELA and math achievement by economic status . In 2019, approximately 40% of socioeconomically disadvantaged students in Orange County met or exceeded the statewide achievement standards for ELA (30%) or Math (42%), compared in ELA (74%) and Math (76%) .xiv,44 This disparity was closing between 2015 and 2019. For ELA, the percentage of economically disadvantaged students who met or exceeded ELA standards increased by 14 percentage points compared to a six -percentage point increase among students who were not economically disadvantaged. For math, the percentage of economically disadvantaged students who met or exceeded math standards increased by 11 percentage points compared to a four -percentage point increase among students who were not economically disadvantaged. Figure 39: Achievement in mathematics and ELA among third grade Orange County students, by socioeconomic status Source: California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress, 2019. Education provides benefits to both individuals and society. Compared to high school graduates, dropouts earn lower wages, resulting in lower tax contributions and more utilization of public benefit programs. They are also at higher risk for criminal involvement and health problems .45 The Orange County cohort high school dropout rate for 2021 was 4.0%, which was lower than California at 9.4% .46 Since 2017, the dropout rate had decreased in Orange County from 5.3%. The highest rate for the 2021 school year was among Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander students (8.2%), American Indian/ Alaska Native (7.6%), and Black/ African American (6.4%) students . 46 xiv A socioeconomically disadvantaged student is one whose parents have not received a high school diploma or who is eligible for the free or reduced-price lunch program (now called the National School Lunch Program) . 68%74%72%76% 25%39% 31%42% 0%25%50%75%100% 2015 2019 2015 2019 English Language Arts MathNot Economically Disadvantaged Economically disadvantagedPage | 87 Figure 40: High school dropout rate, by race and ethnicity Note: The number of cohort students in 2021 is represented by the n value.

These include lower test scores, increased risk of dropping out, and less access to health screenings and other support services .47 Research suggests the reasons for chronic absenteeism include poor physical or mental health, limited transportation, difficulties with housing or food, and a lack of safety \u2014 which can be particularly acute in disadvantaged communities and areas of poverty .48 Improving access to healthcare is one important strategy to drive improvements in chronic absenteeism. In 2021, more than 41,000 (9.0%) Orange County kindergarten through high school students were considered chronically absent.49 While this rate increased from 2017 (7.7%, n=38,360 students), it remained lower than California at 14.3%. Chronic absenteeism is highest among kindergarteners and high school students . Figure 42: Percent of Orange County students chronically absent, by grade level, SY 2020-2021 Source: California Department of Education, DataQuest, SY 2020 -2021. Among different race and ethnicity groups, Pacific Islander and Black/African American students were most likely to be chronically absent (17.7% and 15.7%, respectively). At 2.1% and 2.8% , Asian and Filipino students, respectively, were least likely. Since 2017, chronic absenteeism has increased for Pacific Islander (4.4 percentage points), Hispanic or Latino/a (3.4 percentage points), and Black/ African American (1.7% percentage points) students. xvi Defined as the number and percent of students who were absent for 10% or more of the enrolled instructional days, regardless of the reason (excused and unexcused absences).

In the SY 2020-2021, chronic absenteeism rates were highest for foster youth (30.7%), followed by insecurely housed youth (21.6%), socioeconomically disadvantaged youth (16.4%), students with disabilities (13.0%), English learner s (13.0%), and students in Safe Neighborhoods The physical and social characteristics of neighborhoods impact health outcomes. A neighborhood is the built environment where we live, work, and/or play. It includes our homes, buildings, streets, and open spaces.50 A neighborhood influences a person's ability to make positive choices for their health. This may consist of being physically active, eating a healthy diet, and having cultural foods available that may represent a region, such as kimchi, seaweed, and dim sum from Asia, or represent a colonial past, such as the fusion of West African and East Indian food traditions throughout the Caribbean. 51 Neighborhoods also influence access to support systems for connection, inclusion, and resources. Personal and community safety was a concern among survey respondents. One in three survey respondents rated \"low crime and safe neighborhoods\" as the second most essential characteristic of a happy, healthy, and thriving community for children and families. \"Injuries (physical or emotional) from domestic violence or abuse\" was ranked a \"top health problem most damaging to children's health\" by one in five survey respondents. Three in 10 survey respondents ranked bullying, including cyberbullying, as the number - one \"harmful behavior, factor, and condition contributing to injuries, violence, and poor health outcomes.\" More than one in five survey respondents ranked community violence (e.g., gang violence, homicide) as the second \" most harmful behavior, factor, and condition contributing to injuries, violence, and poor health outcomes.\" While more than half of all respondents agreed with \"the community is a safe place to live,\" just 45% of LGBTQIA+ respondents agreed. Generally, LGBTQIA+, Hispanic or Latino /a, BIPOC, and families of CSHCN respondents were less likely to be satisfied with their community compared to all respondents.

Decreased sense of being safe at school among students 2. Increased community violence Community Safety The reported violent crime rate in Orange County , at 224.1 per 100,000 residents in 2020, was lower than California.xvii,52 While Orange County's violent crime rate per 100,000 declined between 2017 and 2019, it increased in 2020 and wa s higher than the rate of 219.5 per 100,000 in 2016. Figure 44: Crime rate per 100,000 related to violence (yearly r ate) Source: Federal Bureau of Investigation, Crime Data Explorer, 2020. While the violent crime rate had increased, the juvenile arrest rate per 100,000 youth decreased between 2016 and 2020. Committing a delinquent or criminal act and status offenses (actions that are illegal only because of a youth's age\u2014such as truancy, underage drinking, and running away from home) are reasons why some children and youth become involved with the juvenile justice system. Early interactions with the juvenile justice system are important opportunities to intervene and prevent further criminal activity into adulthood. 53 Orange County's juvenile arrest rate in 2020 was 628 per 100,000 youth under 18 years, a decrease of 53.7% from 2016. 54 This rate was higher than California at 616 per 100,000 youth, which had a steeper decrease of 59.2% from 2016. xvii Includes homicide, criminal sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, and aggravated battery 219.5229.4217.7207.7224.1444.8 453.3 447.5 CaliforniaPage | 93 Figure 45: Juvenile arrest rate per 100,000 youth under 18 years old Source: California Dep artment of Justice Demographic Research Unit, Criminal Justice Statistics Center, 2020. Between 2016 and 2020, there was a 64.6% decrease in the total number of juvenile arrests in Orange County, dropping from 4,523 arrests to 2,053 arrests .54 Juvenile arrests for misdemeanors as a proportion of total arrests decreased since 2016, while felony arrests and status offenses as a proportion of total arrests increased. This suggests that the severity of the crime was increasing among juveniles. 1,355 1,128 817 790628 2018 2019 2020Orange County CaliforniaPage | 94 Figure 46: Change in the type of juvenile arrests in Orange County Source: California Department of Justice Demographic Research Unit, Criminal Justice Statistics Center, 2020. Compared to other youth offenders, gang members are more extensively involved in serious and violent criminal behavior. While the number of juvenile cases in Orange County decreased 66.0%, from 203 in 2016 to 69 in 2021, the proportion of juvenile prosecutions that were gang- related was higher in 2021 at 6.0% Number of Juvenile ArrestsPercent of Arrests % Felony Arrests % Arrest for Status Offenses % Misdemeanor Arrests Total # Juvenile ArrestsPage | 95 Figure 47: Number of gang-related cases and prosecutions and rate per 100,000 youth with gang-related prosecutions in Orange County Source: Or ange County District Attorney's Office, 2021 . The rate of juvenile gang-related prosecutions declined from 21.2 per 100,000 youth (0-17 years) in 2016 to 8.5 per 100,000 in 2021. In 2021, Hispanic or Latino/a youth represented the highest percentage of juvenile gang- related prosecutions (93.0%), followed by Other/Unspecified (5.0%), and White/Caucasian (1.7%) youth. Hate Crime In California, a hate crime is defined by the Attorney General as a criminal act committed, in whole or in part, because of one or more of the following actual or perceived characteristics of the victim: disability, gender, nationality, race or ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or association of a person or group of persons with one or more of the preceding actual or perceived characteristics. A hate incident is a behavior motivated by hate or bias toward a person's actual or perceived disability, gender identity, nationality, race or ethnicity, religion, or sexual orientation, but is not criminal in nature. If this type of behavior escalates to threats being made or carried out against a person or property, or becomes an incitement to commit violence, it would be classified as a hate crime. 55 Orange County experienced 112 reported hate crimes in 2020, a 35% increase from 2019. In the last five years, hate crimes have risen steadily, with the largest jump occurring between 2016 to 2020. In 2020 alone, there was an alarming 69% increase in the total number of hate incidents reported. Among the 263 reported cases, there was a 114% increase in anti -Semitic hate incidents, a 180% increase in incidents motivated by anti -Asian hate, and a 23% increase in incidents motivated by anti -Black/African American hate. 55 It is important to note these crimes were instigated by people of all ages and was against all ages (not just instigated by juveniles) . 154 115102 98 104 6049 55 25 25 15 9 050100150200250 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021Number of Cases Number of Juveniles Filed for Gang Related Crime Number of Juveniles Filed for Non-Gang Related CrimePage | 96 Perceived School Safety Indicators of school safety are based on student reports regarding their perceived level of safety when at school. In the CHKS, students identif y their level of safety from very safe, safe, neither safe nor unsafe, unsafe, and very unsafe. The percentage of children who reported that their school was safe or very safe ranged from a low of 60.5% of students in 9th grade to a high of 65.0% of 11th grade students.56 Perceived rates of school safety were higher in Orange County as compared to California in 2017-2019. However, the perceived rates of school safety decreased between 2013-2015 and 2017-2019. Across grades 7 th, 9th, and 11th, students were less likely to feel safe at school in 2017-2019. Figure 48: School perceived as safe or very safe Source: CHKS, 2017- 2019. There are two noticeable disparities in rates of perceived school safety. Between 2017-2019, only 48.2% of Orange County's gay, lesbian, and b isexual students reported feeling their school was safe or very safe, compared to 66.0% of s traight students. This disparity is reflected in the California-level data as well; however, in Orange County the feeling of safety was increasing between 2013-2015 and 2017-2019 among g California 2013-2015 2017-20197th Grade 9th Grade 11th GradePage | 97 Figure 49: Percent of students who reported feeling safe or very safe at school, by sexual orientation Source: CHKS, 2017 -2019 .

Bullying Bullying is any type of repeated, aggressive behavior that one person (or a group of people) directs at someone else with the goal of causing physical or emotional pain. Bullying behaviors are also purposeful. Accidents happen and they may result in physical harm; however, bullying is not accidental or unintentional. 57 Bullying has been recognized as a common contributing factor to depression and anxiety in teens and young adults. Teens and young adults who are regularly subjected to ridicule and mistreatment are likely to suffer from low self-esteem, which can lead to depressi on-like symptoms. Additionally, teens and young adults who are bullied can develop anxiety over having to socialize with peers and excessive worries over how they are perceived by others . 57 Self-reported rates of bullying were lower in Orange County compared to California and had decreased between 51: Experienced any harassment or bullying at school at least one time in the past 12 months , by grade level Source: CHKS, 2017- 2019.

Human Trafficking of Children and Youth in Orange County Human trafficking, which includes the coercion and exploitation of another person for labor, services, or commercial sex acts, is often an invisible crime impacting children across the state. California has the highest levels of known human trafficking victims in the nation. In 2003, the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) Crimes Against Children Unit (CACU) identified 13 United States cities with a high incidence rate of child prostitution and designated these locations as High Intensity Child Prostitution Areas. Three of these cities are in California: San Diego, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. This effort led to the development of human trafficking task forces across the United States, including a task force in Orange County. (U.S. Department of Justice Office of Inspector General, 2009) Accor ding to the 2021 Orange County Human Trafficking Task Force's Human Trafficking Victim Report, between 2019 and 2020, Waymakers and the Salvation Army served a total of 357 trafficking survivors. 58 Of these, 28% Lesbian, Bisexual StraightPage | 101 Figure 53: Percent of human trafficking victims by age, Orange County Source: Orange County Human Trafficking Taskforce. ( 2021 ). 2021 Human Trafficking Victim Report. Survivors of trafficking are often left to live with health consequences such as untreated chronic disease, sexually transmitted infections, injuries, and mental health disorders .59 A 2022 study conducted in Orange County titled \"Youth Survivor Perspectives on Healthcare and Sex Trafficking\", found that youth survivors faced many challenges seeking medical care in the county , including unequal treatment and lack of provider training on how to identify and provide care for trafficking survivors .60 Recommendations from this study include more extensive provider training and trauma-informed protocols. A key informant interview noted that most of the organizations responding to child trafficking in Orange County are non- profits, and there is a need for more healthcare professionals to be involved in child trafficking awareness efforts. Additionally, they noted today's concept of human trafficking is remarkably different than 15 years ago. In 2005, California passed the state's first human trafficking laws, which did not broadly define activities that today are understood to be human trafficking. T hrough a voter initiative (Proposition 35) , laws governing human trafficking were expanded to include definitions for acts that qualify as human trafficking, such as coercion and duress. Proposition 35 describes the signs that a person may be controlled and forced into human trafficking . These signs include a person who shows signs of trauma, fatigue, injury, or other evidence of poor care; is withdrawn, afraid to talk, or their communication is censored by another person; or does not have freedom of movement may be a victim of human trafficking . 12-13 102 Connectedness Being connected, both socially and in community, has been linked to healthy development and well-being for children.61 Social connectedness is the measure of how people come together and interact, interrelate, or share resources. It is the sense of belonging with others, and that someone is welcome and accepted as they are. One in 10 community respondents identified social isolation as a \"harmful behavior, factor, and condition contributing to poor health outcomes.\" More than half (54%) of survey res pondents strongly or somewhat agreed with the statement \"there are networks of support for individuals and families during times of stress and need. \" Generally, this was the same for the CHNA's priority populations , except for LGBTQIA+. Less than half (4 5%) of the LGBTQIA+ respondents agreed with this statement. Table 33: Percent of respondents who agree (strongly, neutral) with statements about the quality of life in Orange County Percent of respondents who agree or were neutral with statements about the quality of life in Orange County All Respondents (n=838) BIPOC (n=242) Hispanic of CSHCN (n=528) There are networks of support for individuals and families during times of stress and need 54% 53% 54% 45% 50% Source: CHNA Community Health Survey, 2022. Community connection helps to build a sense of self, while also teaching children about respect, trust, and community participation. For youth, connections include developing a relationship with a trusted adult, and participating with entities such as schools, community organizations, religious institutions , and sports groups that are safe, stable, and are open to all. In Orange County, in 2015-2019, 4.0% of youth 16-19 years are neither working nor enrolled in school. This has decreased since 2010-14 when it was 6.2% . 62 Rates in Orange County are lower than California and the United States. This CHNA identified two areas of concerns: 1. Low levels of connectedness at school among vulnerable students, including g ay, lesbian, and s traight students , and BIPOC s tudents 2. Increased self-reported use of social media and screen time among youth as an important risk factor for youth mental health Page | 103 School Connectedness School connectedness is the belief held by students that adults and peers in the school care about their learning as well as about them as individuals. This connection is an important protective factor thought to reduce the likelihood of youth engagement in risky behaviors, including early sexual initiation, alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use, and violence and gang involvement. Connection has shown to improve likelihood of academic achievement, defined by higher grades and test scores, school attendance, and completing school. 63 School connectedness is measured with five questions about feeling safe, feeling close to people, feeling included at school, being happy at school, and about teachers treating students fairly. Orange County students were more likely to report feeling a high level of school connectedness in 2017- 2019 as compared to 2013-2015, and more so than other students in California.56 During both time periods, high levels of school connectedness decreased with increasing grade levels. Figure 54: Percent of students with high level of school connectedness , by grade level Source: CHKS, 2017- 2019. In Orange C ounty, gay, lesbian, and bisexual students reported lower levels of school connectedness (37.1%) compared to straight students (53.3%) in 2019.56 Both groups experienced an increase in 9 Grade 11 Non-TraditionalPage | 104 Figure 55: Percent of students with high school connectedness , by sexual orientation Source: CHKS, 2017- 2019. Overall, BIPOC students are less likely to feel connected to school than their White/Caucasian peers . This is the case in both Orange County and California. Figure 56: Percent of students with high school connectedness , by race and Another Group Asian Hispanic or Latino/a Multiracial Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander White/CaucasianPage | 105 School connectedness is related to health outcomes among students. For example, students with greater school connectedness are less likely to report having depression-related feelings and are more likely to feel safe at school. One in five students (19.5%) with a high level of school connectedness in Orange County experience depression-related feelings compared to one in two students (53.0%) with low levels of school connectedness .56 In 2019, 85.8% of students with high school connectedness also felt safe at schools compared to 26.7% of students with low school connectedness reported feeling safe at school. Figure 57: Percent of students who reported experiencing depression-related feelings or reported feeling safe at school, by level of school connectedness, Orange County, 2017-2019 Source: CHKS, 2017- 2019. In both Orange County and California, students with lower school connectedness reported higher rates of bullying compared to their well -connected counterparts. For example, from 2017- 2019, 42% of students with lower school connectedness reported \"some\" bullying as compared to 21% of highly connected students . 56 Connectedness with Adults at School Having one or more caring adult in a child and youth's life is an important protective factor against negative social and health outcomes. In many cases, these caring adults are the child's parents; but other relatives, neighbors, friends of parents, teachers, coaches, religious leaders, and others can play this role. One measure of connectedness is connectedness with an adult at school. The extent to which students have caring relationships with an adult in school is measured by level of agreement with three statements: having a teacher or other adult at school who cares about the student, who notices when the student is not there, and who listens when the student has something to say. Students are less likely to report having high levels of connectedness to an adult as compared to having high levels of connectedness with their school . 19.5%38.7%53.0%85.8% 44.0% 26.7% 0%25%50%75%100% High Medium LowPercent of Students Who Reported Experiencing Depression-Related Feelings Percent of Students Who Reported Feeling Safe At SchoolPage | 106 Levels of connectedness to adults at school vary by race/ethnicity and sexual orientation.

Social Media and Screen Time While school is the primary environment where children first develop social skills and experiences, social media and screen time can also impact a child's social connection 107 This impact can be both positive and negative. Social media plays a major part in our everyday lives, and most young people spend a large part of their day engaging on one or more social media platforms. Social media can have many positive aspects such as: Helping connect with loved ones who may be scattered around the world Connecting with people who have similar interests or passions Providing a platform to share stories and experiences Connecting with people who are exploring their identities and accessing resources not made available at home or school With these benefits come risks. Research has linked social media use and depression among youth.64 It is also a risk factor for experiencing cyberbullying.65 Approximately one in seven community health survey respondents (15%) ranked social media, including excessive or inappropriate use, and one in eight (12%) ranked overuse of technology/excessive screen time, among the top three \"harmful behaviors, factors, and conditions contributing to injuries, violence, and poor health outcomes for youth.\" In 2020, in Orange County, 50.2% of teens (13-17 years) reported they \"almost constantly\" use the internet. This is compared to 28.6% in 2019.29 Figure 59: Percent of Orange County teens (13-17 years) by how often they use the internet Note: *Statistically unstable. Source: CHIS, 2020.

A recent study analyzed millions of websites and social platforms early in the COVID -19 pandemic.66 Between December 1, 2019, and March 25, 2020, the study found a 70% increase in bullying and abusive language among kids and teens on social media and chat forums, a 40% increase in toxicity on gaming platforms, and a 200% spike in traffic to hate sites. Victims of cyberbullying are at risk of depression, anxiety, substance abuse, low self-esteem, poor school performance, and an increased risk of suicidal behavior. Many times, victims of cyberbullying may start to isolate themselves and feel increasingly alone. Except for students in non-traditional programs, Orange County students in grades 7 through 11 had slightly lower rates of cyberbullying compared to California, although the rates have been increasing.56 For example, cyberbullying among grade 7 students in Orange County increased from 17.5% in 2013-2015 to 0%25%50%75%100% 2019 2020Less than a few times a day A few times a day Many time as day Almost ConstantlyPage | 109 Figure 61: Percent o f public -school students who had mean rumors o r lies spread about them on the internet b y other students at least once in the previous year, by grade level Source: CHKS, 2017- 2019.

Anaheim, Fullerton, Orange, Santa Ana, and Tustin have traditional downtowns dating back to the 19th century, as well as newer commercial development. Coastal towns and attractions like Disneyland bring children and families to the county from around the world. Several universities are also located in Orange County, including the University of California, Irvine (UCI), Chapman University, and Cal ifornia State University Fullerton. There are significant political, demographic, economic and cultural distinctions between North and South Orange County, divided by the Costa Mesa Freeway. North Orange County, including Anaheim, Fullerton, and Santa Ana, was the first part of the county to be developed and is culturally closer to Los Angeles County. This region is more diverse and densely populated, and includes more renters, fewer homeowners , and more registered Democrats than Republicans , compared to South Orange County. There are notable exceptions to these general trends, such as the presence of more Republican registered voters in Yorba Linda, and higher-income residents in Anaheim Hills and Villa Park. South Orange County is more residential, wealthier, more Republican, less racially diverse, and more recently developed. Irvine, the largest city in the region, is an exception to some of these trends, being a major employment center and having an Asian plurality (Irvine's Asian population is predominantly East Asian, compared with Westminster's which is predominantly Southeast Asian). Another distinct region of Orange County is the Orange Coast, which includes the six cities bordering the Pacific Ocean. These are (from northwest to southeast): Seal Beach, Huntington Beach, Newport Beach, Laguna Beach, Dana Point and San Clemente. The demographic characteristics of a population are important in understanding the health risks, challenges, strengths, and opportunities of Orange County. Aspects such as age, race, and ethnicity are closely linked to health outcomes. Socio-economic factors such as income, language, and education are likewise associated with health risk, protective factors, and outcomes. This section reports key Orange County demographics. More detailed demographic tables are provided in Appendix H. Population Change Assessing t he shifting population is important in identifying potential impacts on healthcare providers, healthcare access, and utilization of community resources. Births are one driver of population change. The birth rate in Orange County was 46.4 per 1,000 people (ages 15-50 years) in 2016-20 20, and lower than California (48.3 per 1,000) and the United States (52.9 per 1,000).67 Since 2011-2015, the birth rate has dropped from 48.3 per 1,000 people in Orange County. The five-year average number of b irths in Orange County Page | 111 dropped 6.4% between 2011-2015 and 2016-2020, from 37,955 births to 35,539. In 2020 alone, there were just 30,862 births in Orange County .68 Between 2022 and 2027, the pediatric population is projected to decrease 4.8%. This is higher than the projected 2.9% decrease in California. The adult and older adult population is projected to increase 1.4% in Orange County .1 Age The median age in Orange County was 38.1 years in 2015-2019, which is significantly higher than in 2010 -2014 at 36.7 years.69 In 2022, youth ages birth to 19 years made up 24% of the Orange County population. Table 34: Orange County growth by age cohort, 2022 and 2027 Population Cohort by Age Orange County Source: ESRI, 2022. Race and Ethnicity Understanding race and ethnicity composition can help reveal health disparities , including higher rates of chronic disease, healthcare access, premature death, and other factors that affect the health of the community's population. Among California's 58 counties, Orange County ranked 9th in racial and ethnic diversity, based on the United States Census Bureau's Diversity Index . The index measures the probability that two people chosen at random will be from different race and ethnicity groups. Nearly 30% of Orange County's population is foreign-born70. Population projections indicate that t he overall pediatric population in Orange County is decreasing and becoming more racially and ethnically diverse. This matters because the prevalence of health disparities will increase without a concerted effort to identify and mitigate the factors contributing to disparity .

In SY 2019-2020, 124.2 Orange County students per 1,000 students were enrolled in special education, a 14% increase since SY 2015-2016 with a rate of 109.1 per 1,000 students .73 Table 38: Special education enrollment Source: As cited in KidsData.org, California Dept. of Education, DataQuest & Special Education Division, SY 2019- 2020 . Household Characteristics Orange County's population has decreased since 2019 and is projected to decrease another 0.03%, from 3,203,504 in 2022 to 3,198,933 in 2027.1 Average household size is also decreasing; however, the total number of Orange County households is projected to increase during this same period.

There were 1,263 households with a foster child.74 Table 40: Children (0-17 years) in households by relationship to householder Source: U.S. Census, 5 -year combined estimate 2015- 2019, Table B09018. Single -Parent Households Adults and children in single-parent households are at risk for adverse health outcomes, including mental illness (e.g., substance abuse, depression, suicide) and unhealthy behaviors (e.g., smoking, excessive alcohol use, food insecurity). Children in single -parent households are at greater risk of severe morbidity and mortality than their peers in two-parent households . 75 Mortality risk is also higher among single parents. In 2015-2019, about one in four Orange County households (24.4% or 177,665) with children birth to 17 years were single-parent households. Of these, 17.4% were single-mother/female- caregiver Son-in -law or daughter -in- law, and other.

Language Spoken Limited English p roficiency (LEP) is a term used to describe individuals who do not speak English as their primary language and who have a limited ability to read, speak, write, or understand English. Two thirds of Orange County households (447,323) with children ages birth to 17 years speak at least one language other than English.77 Table 42: Children (0-17 years) by household language Household Language Spoken California Orange County Number Percent Number Percent 5 -year combined estimate 2015- 2019, Table B 16004. Among these households, 10.8% or 48,174 households speak English less than \"very well\". This rate is slightly higher compared to California at 9.3% .77 Language influences access to services and is an increasingly important consideration for service delivery.

Poverty Child poverty has various negative effects on the physical and mental health of children. Poverty is linked to substandard housing, homelessness, inadequate nutrition, food insecurity, inadequate childcare, lack of access to healthcare, and generally unsafe neighborhoods. The implications for children living in poverty include greater risk for poor academic achievement, school dropout, abuse and neglect, behavioral and socioemotional problems, physical health problems and developmental delays. In Orange County, approximately 17.1% of children (ages 0-17) live in poverty, and 5.6% (37,448) of children live in deep poverty . 78 In April 2021, 245 Orange County children and youth (0-24 years) were considered homeless .79 When cost of living and a range of family needs and resources, including social safety net benefits, are factored in, poverty among Orange County's children jumps to 23.5%, surpassing California's rate of 18.6% .80 Table 44: Orange County children (0-17 years) living in poverty Children Living in Poverty Orange County California Number Percent Number Percent Poverty (<138% is d etermined 664,207 8,327,708 Source: U.S. Census, 5 -year combined estimate 2015- 2019, Table C17002.

Educational Attainment Educational attainment is one of the most influential drivers of health and known to impact health outcomes, mental health, and care access.81 As reported in the 2021 America's Health Rankings report, health disparities in mental and behavioral health are evident between those without a high school diploma and those who have graduated college. In 2015-2019, nearly three in 10 (28.7% or 91,226) Orange County households with children (0-17 years) had a householder with a high school diploma or less.78 Table 46: Households with children (0-17 years) by householder educational attainment Householder Educational Attainment California Orange County Number Percent Number Percent Less than 12th grade or no schooling 651,980 16.7% 47,968 15.1% Regular high school diploma or GED 696,185 17.8% 43,258 13.6% Some college, but less than 1 year 207,108 5.3% 13,466 4.2% 1 or more years of college credit, no degree 621,774 15.9% 42,317 Source: U.S. Census, 5 -year combined estimate 2015- 2019, Table B15002.

This includes a focus on the needs or deficits of the community that should be addressed, and also the strengths and assets that can be used to meet those same community needs and improve quality of community life. The CHNA defines strengths and assets to include both healthcare and social care supports. Community health survey respondents were asked to what extent they agree \"there are enough social services in the community to meet the needs of our children and families\" and \"there is broad variety of affordable healthcare services in the community .\" More than half (54%) were neutral or disagreed with each statement, suggesting that these kinds of resources are not adequate and/or families lack awareness of the resources. Community discussions also suggest that awareness or knowledge of resources is a significant barrier. Service providers, who are often the first to identify a need, expressed challenges with making the link to resources for a family or individual . Table 47: Percent of respondents who age, neutral, or disagree with statements about the quality of life in Orange County Source: CHNA Community Health Survey, 2022. Except for the respondents who identify as Hispanic or Latino/a, the CHNA's priority populations were more likely to disagree that there were enough social services and/or a broad variety of affordable healthcare services in their own communities.

The capacity assessment starts with mapping community social care assets. Community health survey respondents were asked where they go for social care. The top three places families go include government agencies (29%), community -based organizations (28%), and community health centers (24%). The next-most -selected responses were personal resources, including friends or community members (22%) and family members (22%).

The most abundant type of programs offered in Orange County can be categorized as Care programs (e.g., animal welfare, community support services, daytime care, end-of-life care, navigating the health and social care system, residential care, support network, physical safety), followed by H ealth (e.g., dental, vision, medical, health education, mental health, sexual health), and Education (e.g., help pay for school, preschool, screening and exams, and skills and training). 82 Fewer programs are offered under the categories of Transportation (e.g., bus passes), Goods (e.g., clothing, home good, medical supports, personal safety, toys and gifts), and Legal support (e.g., mediation, representation, translation and interpretation). More information is needed to understand to what extent the number of programs offered meets the demand.

Counts are as of June 8, 2022. Source: Data shared by findhelp on 6/8/2022. Community health survey respondents were asked to select services they needed but did not receive to assess areas of shortage in both healthcare and social care. Childcare/daycare assistance was the most commonly selected service which was needed but not r eceived, by 29.7% of survey respondents, followed by mental health (27.8%), and financial assistance (e.g., unemployment, CalWORKs/TANF, Social Security) 1,775 1,331 1,038 913 427389338 322 118 05001,0001,5002,0002,500 Care Health Education Money Food Housing Work Legal Goods TransitPage | 123 Figure 66: Percent of survey respondents by type of service needed and/or received Source: CHNA Community 75% 100%Physical healthcare because of sexual assault or physical abuseTreatment or counseling for alcohol, tobacco (including vaping), or other drug addictionTransportation assistance servicesHousing servicesWork-related/employment servicesChildcare/daycare assistance (including CCCAP)Services emotional or delinquent behaviorFinancial assistanceFood information, training, or classesMental health servicesLow- or no-cost dental/oral health services Yes, this service was needed and received Yes, this service was needed but not received No, we did not need this servicePage | 124 Population to Provider Ratios The CHNA includes provider -to-population ratios as part of the resource assessment . The ratios provide a baseline on the availability of providers compared to the population size for different services. Although the relationship between the number of health providers in an area and improved health outcomes is supported in literature, the way care is organized and coordinated may be just as important to health outcomes .83 Population-to-provider ratios for dentists, primary care, and mental healthcare are reported. Oral Healthcare Provider Ratios Untreated dental disease can lead to serious health effects including pain, infection, and tooth loss for children and youth.84 Lack of sufficient dentists in a community is only one barrier to accessing oral healthcare. In 2022, there were 5,362 dentists in Orange County.85 This equates to a ratio of 146 youth (0 -19 years) per dentist (146:1). Overall, in California, the children per dental provider ratio was worse at 216 :1. Dentist ratios should be interpreted with caution. There are some dentists who are purely cosmetic and may not take Medi -Cal. There are only 859 dentists noted in the California Medi -Cal Dental Program. Figure 67: Number of youth per professionally active dentist, 2022 Source: U.S. Health Resources & Services Administration , National Provider Identifier Files, 2022. Pediatric Primary Care Provider Ratios A lack of primary care presents barriers to preventative care and good health. The supply and accessibility of primary care physicians, the type and lack of insurance coverage, poverty level, transportation obstacles, and cultural and language competency affect access. In 2022, Orange County had 1,254 primary care pediatricians .85 This equates to a ratio of 624 youth (0-19 years) per pediatrician (624:1). Overall, in California, the children per pediatric primary care provider ratio wa s worse at 696:1 while better in the United States at 564:1. 146:1216:1227:1 0.050.0100.0150.0200.0250.0 Orange County California United StatesPage | 125 Figure 68: Number of youth per pediatric physician, 2022 Source: U.S. Health Resources & Services Administration , National Provider Identifier Files, 2022. Physicians are not the only providers of primary healthcare. Other professionals can serve as sources of routine, preventive care, including nurse practitioners (NP), physician assistants (PA), and clinical nurse specialists. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) projects that the primary care NP and PA workforces will grow far more rapidly than the physician supply in the next 10 years and could help alleviate shortages as demand increases . 86 In 2020, the ratio of population (all ages) to primary care providers other than physicians was 1,350:1 in Orange County. This ratio ranges from 1,1120:0 to 730:1 in California. In California, the ratio of population to primary care providers other than physicians was lower at 1,370:1.86 On average, the number of encounters per primary care physician (PCP) (all ages) was higher in Orange County (1,317 encounters per PCP) than California (963 per PCP).87 Except for children ages four years and younger, Orange County PCPs serve more youth than PCPs in California. Orange County PCPs are more likely to serve a Native American or Asian patient compared to PCPs in California. 624696 564 0100200300400500600700800 Orange County California United StatesPage | 126 Table 49: Visits rendered per primary care physician, 2021 Source: Department of Health Care Access and Information, 2021.

Page | 128 Mental Healthc are Provider Ratios Early diagnosis and appropriate services for children and their families can make a difference in the lives of children with mental disorders.89 The number of mental health providers in a community is an important indicator of the availability of services, including screening, referrals, and treatment, Long before COVID-19, children's mental health and access to mental health services were frequent topics of conversation in Orange County, the state, and nationwide. The shortage of providers qualified to provide mental health and/or substance use disorder treatment services to children, youth, and young adults existed before the pandemic and continues to worsen. According to the AACAP Workforce Maps by State, Orange County is deemed to have a severe shortage (14 per 100,000 children) of child, and adolescent psychiatrists, and the average age of these providers is 52 years old. In 2022, there were 18,198 mental health providers in Orange County. Mental health providers are defined as psychiatrists, psychologists, licensed clinical social workers, counselors, marriage and family therapists, mental health providers that treat alcohol and other drug abuse, and advanced practice nurses specializing in mental healthcare. 85 This equates to a ratio of 176 people per mental health provider (176:1). Overall, in California, the number of people per mental health provider ratio was the same at 176:1 and worse than the United States at 263:1. Not all mental health providers serve children and adolescents. For example, only 4,000 out of more than 100,000 United States clinical psychologists are child and adolescent clinicians, according to APA data. 90 In 2018, there were 78 child psychologists (not including federal physicians) in Orange County.91 This equates to a ratio of 10,010 children per child psychologist (10,010:1). Note: Youth (0- 19 years) population estimates are based on United State Census 2018 single year estimates (Table S0101).

Page | 130 School Based Nurse Ratios According to the National Association of School Nurses, the ideal ratio of nurses per 10,000 students is 13.0.92 In Orange County, the most common ratio was 4.3 nurses per 10,000 students. The number of school nurses per 10,000 students ranges from zero in Anaheim Union High and OCDE/Special Education, to 11.7 in Anaheim Elementary School .32 Figure 72: School nurse FTE per 10,000 Orange County students Note: Data on total FTE credentialed school nurses and total number of students in the OCDE 2020- 2021 Year End Report was used to create the nurse ratio per 10,000 students. Anaheim Union High reported no credentialed school nurses but did report 4 school readiness nurses. It is important to note that the ratios are not reflective of the rac e, ethnicity , and language spoken of the population in each region. Source: OCDE 2020- 2021 Year End Report Race/Ethnicity Nationally, BIPOC patients are less likely than White/Caucasian patients to report being the same race as their healthcare providers .93 This misalignment may lead to strained patient- provider relationships and is thought to contribute to disparities in health outcomes. Historical medical mistreatment of BIPOC in the United States has contributed to a mistrust of healthcare providers within these groups. According to research collected by The Urban Institute and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, racial alignment between patient and provider is associated with greater likelihood of patients agreeing to and receiving preventive care, better patient experience ratings, and higher ratings on patient-reported measures of care quality . 93 The most recent report on Orange County's healthcare provider cultural background is from 2013 by the Medical Board of Calfornia titled 2013 Cultural Background Survey Statistics .94 No data currently exists on the diversity of Orange County's healthcare provider workforce. Effective July 27,2021, through Assembly Bill 133, HCAI is required to collect and report provider race/ethnicity data from healthcare licensing boards. As providers renew or initiate a license, data on the diversity of the healthcare workforce is now being requested, by specialty, including, but not necessarily limited to, data on race, ethnicity, and languages spoken. 95 Healthcare Facilities Proximity to healthcare facilities is an important factor driving positive health behaviors and outcomes for children and families in Orange County. The resource assessment therefore also considers the availability of key healthcare facilities, including Federally Qualified Health Centers , community health centers, Orange County Health Care Agency Child and Youth Services behavioral health clinic locations, and the number of neonatal and pediatric hospital beds. Federally Qualified Health Centers Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) are safety net providers that primarily provide services typically furnished in an outpatient clinic. FQHCs include community health centers, migrant health centers, healthcare centers for unhoused individuals, public housing primary care centers, and health center program \"look -alikes.\" They also include outpatient health programs or facilities operated by a tribe or tribal organization or by an urban Indian organization. FQHCs are one important community resource to ensure the at-risk and underserved population health needs are met. As reported by HRSA, the 28 million people served nationally by FQHCs include one in nine children and one in three people living in poverty.96 According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), in 2021 there were 48 Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) in Orange County, or seven per 100,000 children. 97 FQHCs are community -based organizations , recognized by CMS , that provide comprehensive primary and preventive care to medically underserved areas and populations, regardless of ability to pay. By comparison, California had 1,486 FQHCs or 17 per 100,000 children. Page | 132 Community Health Clinics Community Health Clinics in Orange County are an important resource for at-risk and vulnerable population to access healthcare, including primary care, behavioral health, dental and vision. The Coalition of Orange County Community Health Centers directory suggest there are 42 health centers in Orange County.98 These cl inics offer family practice (29 locations), pediatrics (24 locations), dental (19 locations), behavioral health (16 locations) of which four offer medication-assisted treatment, reproductive health (15 locations), and vision (6 locations) services. The locations are not mutually exclusive. Child and Youth Behavioral Health Clinic Locations HCA's Children and Youth services provides a broad range of services for behaviorally, emotionally, or mentally disordered children and adolescents which include evaluation, therapy, medication management, crisis intervention and collateral services to parents and families. There are 23 child and youth behavioral health clinic locations in Orange County. The locations are dispersed throughout Orange County, with six locations in South Region (Laguna Beach (1), Dana Point (1), San Clemente (1), Aliso Viejo (1), Lake Forest (1), and Mission Viejo (1)), six locations in East Region (Orange (1), Santa Ana (5)), three locations in the West Region (Westminster (1), Foundation Valley (2)), and two in the Central Region (Costa Mesa (2)). School Based Health Clinics School -based health centers (SBHCs) are uniquely situated to bring health care professionals and educators together to address the multifaceted needs of children, yo uth, and families. Some SBHCs serve only students, while others also serve family members or the broader community surrounding the school. According to California School -Based Health Alliance, there are nine school -based health clinics (SBHCs) in Orange County. California has 300. In SY 2020-2021, there were 49,858 public school students per every SBHC in Orange County. 46 This ratio was higher than in California at 19,641 public school students per every SBHC. In California, the child per SBHC ratio rages from 1,845 students in Mariposa to 81,000 students in Sacramento per SBHC. Neonatal and Pediatric Beds Orange County has fewer Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) beds per 100,000 children under 18 years at 458, compared to California at 514. 99 The number of Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) beds per 100,000 children and Pediatric Acute beds per 100,000 population in Orange County is comparable to California.

For instance, low -income families often live without a safety net, caring for sick children and working multiple jobs to meet basic needs. Many also face impossible choices , such as leaving children alone at home because childcare is unaffordable , or not filling prescriptions to be able to feed their family. The COVID -19 PHE pulled back the curtains on social structures and systems . Arguably, the most important reveal is the ability to understand how health, education, economy, and environment are inextricably linked. The disparities in how low-income and BIPOC communities experienc ed the COVID -19 PHE helped bring attention to these social determinants of health. CHOC had a central role in caring for Orange County children during the COVID -19 PHE. With the county's c linicians, healthcare facilities and families fearful of exposing their children to the virus , preventive care became a lower priority for families. However, the reality that children need consistent access to clinical care pushed healthcare providers and pay ers to embrace telemedicine technology and find a way to make it work at scale. T his breakthrough demonstrated that remote office visits could work in a traditional -care setting, with related benefits. Staying home for a medical appointment meant families did not need to find transportation or take half a day off work to get routine care for their children. With this shift, clinicians could reserve in-person visits for the most critical patients.

The CHNA provides valuable data to direct resources toward high-risk populations, identify opportunities to enhance care delivery, inform patient engagement initiatives, and direct overall strategic planning. Community benefits are free or subsidized programs and services provided to meet identified community needs and to serve the public interest. Investments should be made from the perspective of doing the greatest good for the greatest number of people. The health and well -being of children and adolescents in our region depend on our ability to understand and address the needs of our community and work together to meet them. It is hoped that this CHNA will support CHOC in forging new partnerships and collaborations to meet community needs and will be a resource for all of us working to improve the health and well - being of children, teens and families in Orange County . The findings from this CHNA will guide our Board of Directors and leadership in developing a plan to invest resources into the community that: Maximizes the community benefit and impact of prioritized investments Informs the way we deliver care helping us to meet families where they are Promotes collaboration with our partners to build a workforce that reflects the communities we serve Supports partnerships with community groups that can help our providers better understand the realities facing the children and families in our care Aligns our efforts to improve access to pediatric and adolescent mental healthcare in the county Educates internal and external stakeholders about the importance of considering the impact of key health drivers such as Healthy and Affordable Foods , Early Learning Opportunities and Success in School , Safe Neighborhoods , and Connectedness , as we develop programs to address the identified CHOC CHNA Health Priorities of Mental Health and Access to Pediatric Healthcare Services CHOC welcomes community comments on the 2022 CHNA.
