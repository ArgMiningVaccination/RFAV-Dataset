Employers must be willing to focus on the behavioral choices of nurses, not merely the fact that an error occurred or that a bad outcome resulted.REPORTINg ENVIRONMENT \"Just Culture\" is a term which was coined by David Marx, who is well known for his work in patient safety and safe systems design in a variety of fields. although his work is not specific to health care professionals, the principles are certainly applicable. a major principle of \"Just Culture\" is that discipline needs to be tied to the behavior of individuals and the potential risks their behavior presents more than the actual outcome of their actions. It realizes that human beings are fallible, but do have control over their behavioral choices. It is about creating a reporting environment where staff can admit to making a mistake or seeing a risk, so that preventative measures can be implemented and patient safety maintained, while holding staff accountable for their behaviors. BEHAVIOR NOT OUTCOME \"Just Culture\" places focus on evaluating behavior not outcome and distinguishes between normal errors, unintentional risk-taking behavior, and intentional risk-taking behaviors. the Board realizes that often environment and systems need to be looked at, as well as the nurse who is being reported, if we are truly to improve patient safety and the quality of care for the patients in the District. the Board developed guidelines for reporting practice-related incidents to the DC Board of Nursing to \"provide a mechanism for employers of nurses and the Board to come together to promote a culture in which we learn from practice errors while properly assigning accountability for behaviors, consistently evaluating events, and complying with mandatory reporting requirements.\"NOT \"BLAME-FREE\" Nurses must realize that this is not a \"blame-free\" response to all errors. It focuses on the behavioral choice of the nurse, the degree of risk taking, and whether the nurse deliberately disregarded a substantial risk. It holds the nurse who makes unsafe or reckless choices that endanger patients accountable for those choices. We know that nurses in the District are committed to their patients and want to consistently give quality care to our residents. as a Board, we expect that you hold yourselves accountable for knowing and practicing within the DC Nurse practice a ct while continually striving to improve the quality of care in your facility and the District of Columbia. thank you for choosing nursing and for being committed to caring. E. Rachael Mitzner, BSN, MS, RN Chairperson DC Board of Nursing E. Rachael Mitzner, BSN, MS, RN 6 District of Columbia Nurse: Regulation Education PracticeLBgT ALLIANCE REqUESTS CULTURAL SENSITIVITy TRAININg a representative from the lBG t (lesbian, Bi-sexual, Gay, t ransgender) alliance asked the Board to include training in the Nursing assistive p ersonnel (Nap) curriculum that would focus on working with this population; particularly for home health aides coming into the home, so that Naps are aware of sexual orientation and gender issues. at its april meeting the Board approved a curriculum that addresses cultural sensitivity regarding the lBG t population. this curriculum will be incorporated into the model curricula for Nursing assistive personnel programs. TRAINED MEDICATION EMPLO yEES (TME) the Board held a meeting with t rained Medication Employees (tME) trainers and employers to discuss the initiation of electronic testing for certification for tME applicants. MEDICATION AIDES REgULATIONS Setting-specific information was removed from the regulations. previous draft regulations included language regarding the regulation of Ma -Cs (Medication aide- Certified) in intermediate care facilities, assistive living facilities and schools. Revisions focus on regulatory and training requirements for Ma -C no matter the setting. once certified, the Ma -C is expected to follow the policies of the setting in which they administer medications. JUST CULTURE AND DISCIPLINE REPORTINg gUIDELINES the Board is often asked by employers: a t what point is it appropriate to report a nurse to the Board for the purpose of possible disciplinary action? t o answer this, the Board developed Discipline Reporting Guidelines to provide a mechanism for employers of nurses and the regulatory board to come together to promote a culture that promotes learning from practice errors while properly assigning accountability for behaviors, consistently evaluating events, and complying with mandatory reporting requirements. the framework the Board has chosen to use in making disciplinary decisions is \"Just Culture.\" the Guidelines will provide an overview of the \"Just Culture\" principals and how the Board will work with nurses and employers of nurses to implement these guidelines. [p age 8] HIV/AIDS TO BE REqUIRED FOR CONTINUINg EDUCATION Mayor Vincent Gray has asked boards to require hIV/aIDS education as part of their Continuing Education requirements for licensure renewal. the Board agreed that as we develop new regulations we will require all persons under the authority of the BoN to have a minimum of 2 (two) hIV/aIDS contact hours per renewal period.

On the other side of the coin, it is about having a well-established system of accountability. A \"Just Culture\" must recognize that while we as humans are fallible, we do have control of our behavioral choices. The principle behind a \"Just Culture\" is this: Discipline needs to be tied to the behavior of individuals and the potential risks their behavior presents more than the actual outcome of their actions. A \"Just Culture\": Places focus on evaluating the behavior, not the outcome; Requires leadership commitment and modeling; Distinguishes between normal error, unintentional risk-taking behavior and intentional risk-taking behaviors; Fosters a learning environment that encourages reporting of all mistakes, errors, adverse events, and system weaknesses (including self-reports); Lends itself to continuous improvement of work processes and systems to ensure the highest level of patient and staff safety; Encourages the use of non-disciplinary actions whenever appropriate (including coaching, counseling, training and education); and Holds individuals accountable for their own performance in accordance with their job responsibilities but does not expect individuals to assume accountability for system flaws over which they had no control. \"Just Culture\" encourages discussion and reporting of errors and near misses without fear of retribution. It is a culture that focuses on the behavioral choices of the practitioner, not merely the fact that an error occurred or that a bad outcome resulted from an error. \"Just Culture\" recognizes that perfect performance is not something that can be sustained, and errors will occur. It recognizes that the threat of disciplinary action does Not prevent individuals from making errors. In a, \"Just Culture\", there is agreement that even the most experienced and careful nurse can make a mistake that could lead to patient harm. there is recognition that nurses will make mistakes and that perfect performance is impossible. \"Just Culture\" is not a \"blame-free\" response to all errors. It focuses on the behavioral choice of the nurse, the degree of risk-taking, and whether the nurse deliberately disregarded a substantial risk. It holds the nurse accountable who makes unsafe or reckless choices that endanger patients. In fulfilling its mission to safeguard the public's health and well being by assuring safe quality care, the Board is committed to nursing practice regulation that is prompt, fair, and appropriate to public protection. the Board believes protection of the public can be facilitated by fair and just treatment of nurses who are involved in practice events. the Board reacts promptly to complaints and allegations of violations of the health occupations Revision a ct and Board of Nursing regulations. all allegations are evaluated with respect to the merits of the individual case and the potential harm to the public. the Board's responses to substantiated violations fall within a continuum of remedial and disciplinary action. the Board believes protection of the public is not enhanced by the reporting of every minor incident that may be a violation of hoRa. this is particularly true when there are mechanisms in place in the nurse's practice setting to identify nursing errors, detect patterns of practice, take corrective action, and monitor the effectiveness of remediation on deficits in a nurse's behavior and practice including judgment, knowledge, training, or skill. the purpose of this guide is to provide a mechanism for employers of nurses and the board to promote a culture that promotes learning from practice errors while properly assigning accountability for behaviors, and consistently evaluating events. as healthcare facility nursing leaders and DCBoN staff review and discuss events, these guidelines, will be utilized so that matters are handled as consistently as possible. The review of a practice issue by the employer may result in: 1. Consultation Only - Employer supports nurse and no further action is needed. 2. Employer Directed Corrective Action - Employer addresses incident with nurse through system intervention, internal disciplinary processes, and/or individual remediation. 3. Formal Reporting - Employer submits report/complaint to Board. Board then conducts inquiry and/or investigation according to established policies and processes.guidelines for Reporting Practice Related Incidents to the Board of Nursing9 e-mail: hpla.doh@dc.gov web: www.hpla.doh.dc.govNON-REPORTABLE INCIDENTS Definition: Employee has failed to follow employment policies. they are generally not reportable as violations of hoRa and therefore would not be addressed by the Board. there may, however, be circumstances that could merit the Board's attention. Nothing in these guidelines is intended to prevent or discourage direct reporting of a potential violation to the Board of Nursing. please contact the Board's practice Consultant with any questions about specific situations. Examples of Non-reportable Incidents: No Call-No Show. failure to complete a 2 week notice (abrupt termination). Refusal to accept an assignment. Rudeness or inappropriate verbal interactions with patients or staff. \"Nodding\" or falling asleep momentarily, unless this is a pattern of practice, or results in patient neglect or harm. falsification of employment application (unless falsification relates to licensure status). failure to follow agency policy (unless this is alSo a violation of practice act). failure to submit agency paperwork in timely manner (unless jeopardizes patient care versus reimbursement only). Mental/emotional problems or issues that do not impact or relate to the nurse's practice. Information related to mental or physical conditions of a nurse, when you are providing care for the nurse (which means information is protected). Systems IssuesDefinition: Incidents that are primarily the result of factors beyond the nurse's control. Criteria: Some incidents, whether minor or significant, may be the result of or influenced by systems factors, as well as by individual factors. organizational and nursing leaders are responsible for evaluating and addressing system impact on any incident or event, regardless of reportability. opportunities for system improvements may exist independent of, or in conjunction with, opportunities for individual improvement. EXAMPLES OF SySTEMS ISSUES : Malfunctioning equipment. Staffing/work hour issues. HUMAN ERROR Definition: Nurse inadvertently did something other than intended or other than what should have been done; a slip, a lapse, or an honest mistake. Examples of Human Error: one time medication error (wrong dose, wrong route, wrong patient, or wrong time). failure to implement a treatment order due to oversight. REPORTABLE INCIDENTS Definition: Employee demonstrates at- risk or reckless behaviors. a t-risk behaviors may be reportable if it is determined that the nurse does not appreciate the risk and has a pattern of at-risk behavior. Reckless behavior is reportable as violations of hoRa and therefore would be addressed by the Board. EXAMPLES OF AT-RISk, AND RECkLESS BEHAVIORS At-Risk Behavior Definition: Nurse makes a behavioral choice that increases risk where risk is not recognized or is mistakenly believed to be justified; nurse does not appreciate risk; unintentional risk taking. Generally the nurse's performance and conduct does not indicate that their continuing practice poses a risk of harm to clients or other persons. Examples of At Risk Behavior: Exceeding scope of practice. pre-documentation. Minor deviations from established procedure. RECkLESS BEHAVIOR Definition: Nurse makes the behavioral choice to consciously/willfully disregard a substantial and unjustifiable risk. Reckless nurse behaviors MUSt be reported to the Board. Examples of Reckless Behavior: Nurse leaves workplace before completing all assigned patient care (and does not report to another nurse) because he has a date waiting. Nurse observes patient starting to climb over bedrails but walks away without intervening. Nurse makes serious medication error, realizes it when patient experiences adverse reaction, tells no one, denies any knowledge of reason for change in patient condition, and falsifies documentation to conceal error. The District of Columbia Board of Nursing wishes to thank the North Carolina Board of Nursing for its graciousness in allowing the adaptation of its \"Guidelines for Evaluating and Reporting Practice Violations to the Board.\"10 District of Columbia Nurse: Regulation Education PracticeIMPORTANT NOTICE REgARDINg CRIMINAL BACkgROUND CHECk (CBC) Note from DC BoN Staff: Since the initiation of CBCs, we have received numerous inquiries from licensees concerning past and recent arrests/convictions. to address these issues, we recommend: If YoU ha VE haD aN aRRESt oR CoNVIC tIoN at aNY tIME IN Y oUR paSt , INDICatE \"YES\" oN Y oUR applICatIoN.

Substance Use Disorders in Nursing: A Resource Manual and Guidelines for Alternative and Disciplinary Monitoring Programs is designed to provide practical and evidence-based guidelines for evaluating, treating and managing nurses with a substance use disorder. The result is a comprehensive resource of the most current research and knowledge synthesized from both the literature and the field. It is the hope of the National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN) that this manual is a helpful tool that can be used to implement better practices in helping the healers to heal themselves and at the same time helping to protect the public. While the manual was developed for alternative to discipline programs and boards of nursing in an effort to enhance program content and its delivery, it also provides essential theoretical and practical guidelines for clinicians, educators, policymakers and public health professionals. To download the manual, visit www. ncsbn.org/2106.htm. CoIN Committee chair Kate Driscoll Malliarakis was a member of the NCSBN Committee that developed this publication.

Relative to our small population, the District of Columbia has the highest rate of hIV in the United States. It is not just a \"young\" or \"gay\" disease. the hIV rate among DC residents in their 60s is equivalent to the prevalence of the virus in residents in their 20s. The highest rate of new diagnoses is among african american heterosexual females between the ages of 40 and 49. In March and April 201 1, the pensylvania/Mid a tlantic aIDS Education and t raining Center\u2014howard University local p erformance Site (www.pamaaetc. org)\u2014presented seven continuing eduction sessions on the topic of \"the Nurse's Role in preventing, Diagnosing and t reating hIV/aIDS, hp V and other Sexually t ransmitted Infections.\" the interactive program was attended by nurses, social workers, long t erm Care directors, retirees, a local pastor and other participants from throughout the region. NURSES AS RESOURCES \"Nurses are the resource that family members and community members come to,\" according to conference coordinator Marilyn Johnson, MaS, who serves as Director of provider outreach for the pennsylvania/Mida tlantic aIDS Education and t raining Center (paMaaEt C). \"We organized this program to break down cultural biases and internal barriers. If we don't break down these barriers, no one else will.\" Reminding attendees of how, in the late 1980s, gay rights advocates fought for hIV/aIDS medications and treatment support, and how, during the Civil Rights Era, african americans, \"stared down dogs and water hoses,\" for civil rights, now is the time for DC to strongly advocate for the health of our community. Ms. Johnson urged attendees to challenge their own assumptions and discomforts in thinking about hIV. the diagnosis of hIV, she said, should not be any more stigmatized than a diagnosis of diabetes. \"Urge your friends and relatives to be tested. When someone asks you 'Why would I want to be hIV tested?', you could ask them 'Why wouldn't you want to be tested?' Each one of us is one sexual encounter, or one finger stick away, from hIV.\" We must speak to each other and young people about hIV. Children today are not only bombarded with sexual images in advertising, some are exposed to the sights and sounds of the sexual activity of parents who bring \"guests\" home. Young people, old people, and those in-between need to know about hIV and StDs (now called Sexually t ransmitted Infections, StIs). SEXUALL y TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS \"Sexually t ransmitted Infections are a huge epidemic in DC,\" according to Bruce W. furness, MD, a CDC medical epidemiologist embedded at the DC Doh. \"StIs are hidden epidemics\" he said, because often they have no symptoms (that is why he advocates calling them infections rather than diseases). StIs are portals which lead to an increase of hIV infection because genital ulcers breakdown skin; hIV can enter through an open sore or inflammation. White blood cells are the cells the hIV virus likes the most. hIV attaches to white blood cells. \"Doh has surveillance data on chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis in DC,\" Dr. furness told attendees. ChlaMYDIa, \"the silent sexually transmitted infection,\" is the StI most commonly reported to the CDC, and it can cause infertility. Residents between the ages of 15 and 19 have the highest rate of chlamydia. Sexually active persons under 26 should be screened annually. the medication used to treat chlamydia will vary depending on the client's ability for adherence. the more-expensive medication azithromycin can be given in a single dose, but the cheaper medicaton doxycycline requires a seven-day dose. Clients should be re-tested in three months. The Nurse's Role in Preventing and Treating HIV and STIs Article and Photos by Nancy Kofie Dr. Bruce W. FurnessBASIC FACTS hIV can be transmitted via blood, semen, pre-seminal fluid, vaginal fluid, or breastmilk. the Centers for Disease Control and prevention (CDC) defines \"epidemic\" as an infection rate greater than 1% of population. the hIV test does not test for the presence of the virus, but tests for the presence of antibodies that have developed over time (about 3 months) in response to the infection. 17 e-mail: hpla.doh@dc.gov web: www.hpla.doh.dc.govGoNoRRhEa can lead to inflammation, disease and infertility. The CDC says it costs $1.1 billion to treat gonorrhea and its complications. Gonorrhea can cause a thick yellow or green discharge at sight of sexual contact, or there can be no symptoms at all. Dr. furness noted: \"one problem is that a lot of adolescent females cannot distinguish normal discharge from abnormal discharge. they are still getting to know their bodily changes.\" When treating Gonorrhea, as with tuberculosis, drug resistance can be an issue. \"We are running out of antibiotic choices for treatment because of resistance. If an individual has gonorrhea, we treat them for chlamydia as well.\" Dual treatment is used due to drug resistance. SYphIlIS is known as the 'great imitator, ' Dr. furness said. \"It has symptoms indistinguishable from other diseases; it is often misdiagnosed.\" When a client is infected, 21 days later the patient gets a single sore or chancre that is round and firm, but painless. Sometimes clients experience alopecia [hair loss], or reddish brown spots or a rash on their palms and soles of their feet. (Syphilis ulcers and rashes can imitate scabies and herpes). If untreated, tertiary syphilis attacks the heart and brain. this StI affects all races of men, but few women. IN THE SCHOOLS \"We are screening in the District's high schools to target asymptomatic individuals,\" he said. \" after a talk with students, we give students the option to submit a urine specimen.\" With StI testing in the DC high schools, there is a 6-8% positive rate, he said, and we retest in 3 months to detect repeat infections. Nationally, about 40% of infected teens become reinfected.\"We earn the teens' trust. Not only do teens have a lack of knowledge, but teens often cannot access medical treatment without parents finding out. Fifteen to 19 year-olds have the most barriers to treatment for StIs.\" t eens need to know StIs can be transmitted through oral sex. No parental consent is needed for StI-testing for individuals 12 years old and older (in DC and nationally). In DC, 12 and up can get StI testing, family planning services, and mental health services without consent. UTILIz INg ALTERNATIVES alternative method of notification: \"a s technology changes, we at Doh are going to have to change,\" Dr. furness said. this is especially true as Doh addresses the activity of some MSMs (men who have sex with men) who find sexual partners via the Internet. Sometimes, an infected individual will not know the address or phone number of a sex partner, just their email address. Doh staff contact individuals who have been exposed to StIs via email if no other contact information is available. alternative to clinic visit: through patient-delivered partner therapy, a patient can carry medicine to a sexual partner who refuses to come into the clinic for treatment. \"It is legal in the District and it is encouraged by the CDC,\" Dr. furness said. 72-hours prophylactics: Dr. furness also spoke about pre- and post- exposure prophylactic medications that can be taken within 72 hours of exposure or anticipated exposure. he also enthusiastically advocated the use of hp V vaccines. ROBBER AND SHOOTER \"hIV and StDs are like a robber and a shooter,\" clinic physician John hogan, MD said. \"I like to rob and you like to shoot,\" he said, half-joking, assuming the persona of a criminal: \"We make each other worse.\" Dr. hogan reviewed the various types of StIs, and recommended hepatitis B testing for any client with jaundice (yellow skin, yellow eyes). he noted that hepatitis C has occurred as a result of unsanitary tattoo parlors, and that herpes can occur when party-goers share sex toys. BE NONJUDg MENTAL \"present yourself as nonjudgmental when speaking to patients,\" Dr. hogan said, \"when they share information about what they do for money or fun. By your tone of voice and demeanor, let the patient know that you do not look down on them for such activities. ask tough questions in a respectful manner, and be willing to handle honest answers when they are given. Some of your patients may participate in sex parties,\" he said. this is part of the patient's history. he encourages his patients to bring their \"toys\" to the clinic, some which feature knobs and spikes. \"find out if they are using toys which can break the skin in sensitive areas of the body, such as the anus. find out what they did and what products (lubricants) they used, and if they travel Continued on page 18 Marilyn Johnson, MAS, Dr. John Hogan, and Anna White.18 District of Columbia Nurse: Regulation Education Practiceabroad for fun, or travel 'back home' to visit relatives. air travel has made some diseases more common in the US,\" he said. RISk + RIS k = M ORE RISk ask your client about their non-sexual activities. ask: \"Do you smoke? Drink? how much?\" a smoker is more likely to drink, and \"persons who consume five drinks in one day are more likely to abuse illegal substances. abusers are more likely to have risky behaviors such as sharing needles and having sexual activities without a condom,\" Dr. hogan said. \"there is one big obstacle in fighting hIV today. p eople don't have any fear,\" Dr. hogan said. \"they don't remember days of the aIDS quilt and the heavy death rate in the days before protease inhibitors.\" LEARN FROM yOUR PATIENTS If a patient is adherent, conscientiously taking his medications, taking good care of himself, ask: \"What caused the transition? What made it click?\" Dr. hogan has seen homeless drug-addicted patients get clean, get a home, and get a job. like Socrates, Dr. hogan said, \"I ask questions. I have never been in jail, but I can speak with a patient I trust (who has been incarcerated) to learn about the transition from jail to release. What I was taught in books did not prepare me. let your patients teach you how to practice.\" gENDER CONSIDERATIONS female p atients: f emale clients who date older men may be unable to assert themselves with their partner. Dr. hogan requests that female patients ask their boyfriends to accompany them to the clinic; if the boyfriend arrives in the clinic, Dr. hogan himself calls upon the boyfriend to be tested. Male p atients: Men often do not come in when initial symptoms surface because they are \"waiting for it to hurt,\" Dr. hogan said. ask your patients about the number of sexual partners they have had in the last 30 days. If a man says seven, 10 or 15 women\u2014his actions pose a public health threat. gET FAMIL y INVOLVED \"have a plan for keeping your patient engaged in treatment,\" Dr. hogan said. a great tool for adherence to treatment is to get the patient's family involved: \"If a patient does not want to tell his or her family, I ask them, 'Who in your family have you told? Who in your family do you trust?' tell the patient to bring a trusted person with them to their appointment. t ell the relative: 'We have bad and good news. the bad news is that your (son, daughter, etc.) is hIV positive. the good news is that they are seeing a doctor, taking their medication, and the medication is working. ' Show the relative the lab results, it works over 90% of the time,\" Dr. hogan said. \"If the patient has not yet told anyone in his or her family, help them to formulate a plan to do so.\" WOMEN MORE VULNERABLE \"Women are more likely to get hIV from a man than vice versa. Semen has more hIV than vaginal fluid,\" said Crystal Waters, MSN, fNp-BC, a f amily Nurse practitioner at the Women's health Center of the howard University Center for Infectious Disease Management and Research (CIDMaR). a woman's vulnerability goes beyond physiology. according to Ms. Waters, younger women are particularly vulnerable to problematic love relationships (and hIV) because their romantic relationships are more critical to their overall happiness than is the case for older women. \"they are more interested in preserving the relationship than anything else\u2014including their own wellbeing,\" Ms. Waters said. With younger women, sex may be traded for help paying the bills. \"Many late-entry patients have delayed seeking hIV or StI testing or treatment because of a fear of domestic violence.\" qUIC k TIPS FROM MS. WATERS piercings: ask patients, \"Do you have any piercings I cannot see?\" Communication: Do not take for granted that the patient understands. a young person may say \"yes, I am monogamous with one partner, but not with the other.\" Douching: Discourage douching. Douching washes away the natural protections hIV and StIs. Empower: 'No gloving, no loving. '\u2014Empower young women to require condom use with this slogan. She must know that she has the power to make condom use non-negotiable. DC Doh's hIV, aIDS, hepatitis, StD, and t uberculosis a dministration (hahSta): Clients needing condoms or dental dams should contact hahSta. (Clinic location: DC General Hospital Campus, 1900 Massachusets a venue, SE, Building 8, 202-698-4050.) WOMEN B EyOND 50 With women beyond their 20s, who came-of-age decades earlier, the problem Continued from page 17 Nursing Practice Crystal Waters, MSN, FNP-BC19 e-mail: hpla.doh@dc.gov web: www.hpla.doh.dc.govmay be getting them to understand that StIs or StDs are the same thing as veneral disease. You might ask if they have had an StI, and they will say \"no\" although they have had \"V.D.\" another problem with women in their 40s and 50s is that they think they are not at risk. \" african americans are half of hIV/aIDS cases, and aIDS is the leading cause of death of african american women in many age groups.\" TREATMENT \"an hIV positive client's medication regimen has to be tailor-made,\" Ms. Waters said. \"Some drugs cannot be taken during the first trimester of pregnancy.\" If a patient becomes pregnant, you have to reevaluate the drug regimen.\" f or the medication to work, the patient must be motivated to take the medication. a dherence is very important. \"We also counsel women to use condoms once testing is done. their partner might have a different strain of hIV.\" LIFESPAN Ms. Waters noted that the lifespan for living with HIV ranges from 19 to 25 years: black women - average lifespan of 20.6 years after diagnosis. black male - 19.9 years. white women - 22 years. white male - 25 years. latino women - 24.2 years. Latino men - 24.6 years. OTHER THOUg HTS Ms. Waters asked attendees to keep in mind that \"the Downlow\" (closeted men with male sex partners) is not a phenomenon restricted to african americans. there is an equal presence of non-gay-identified MSMs (men who have sex with men) in white and latino communities as well. \"hIV patients are living longer,\" she said, \"but there is a lot more inflammation: more cardiac risk, a higher level of cholesterol. hIV positive men can father children without passing on the hIV infection, she said. \"hIV is present in semen, not the sperm. 'Sperm washing' is a process in which a sperm can be safely removed from the semen.\" MAgIC JOHNSON , SEROCONVERSION , STIg MA, AND SALIVA lisa fitzp atrick, MD, MpN, an infection disease physician and associate professor at howard University, sought to dispel two common myths regarding hIV positive retired NB a player Magic Johnson: Lisa FitzPatrick, MD, MPN It's a New Day...

Medicaid pays for the medicine, and because of aIDS Drug assistance programs (aD ap) we don't have a waiting list.\" She spoke about a patient who is a crack addict: \"he told me: 'first thing in the morning I take my medicine, ' even if he later gets high on crack. he is adherent. he has even put on weight and he's got a job now.\" She also spoke of a homeless patient who sleeps with his medication. \"one-pill-a-day medication revolutionized treatment and adherence.\" a CDC-trained medical epidemiologist Dr. fitzp atrick noted: \"the virus is very crafty. We have to hit it at multiple targets.\" HISTOR y Dr. fitzp atrick told attendees about the history of hIV/aIDS, beginning with a June 1981 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) on five young gay men with pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Initially, aIDS was thought to be a disease only effecting the 4hs\u2014homosexuals, heroin addicts, hemophiliacs and haitians. She also noted the effectiveness of the gay civil rights group ACT UP. (See 1993 movie \"And the Band played on\" for dramatization of this period). Noting another important historical turning point, Dr. fitzp atrick said, \"We started to see the mortality rate decrease when in 1996 a doctor discovered protease inhibitors.\" SALIVA Some attendees wondered if hIV can be transmitted by saliva. \"hIV can show up in saliva if a patient has bleeding gums from oral health problems. It can be transmitted by oral sex, but saliva is a low risk.\" the hIV swab test does not test for hIV in saliva itself; it tests for the antibodies that develop in response to hIV. THE WINDOW \"We must identify people in window period,\" Dr. fitzp atrick said. \"We need your voices. hIV is no longer a silo issue.\" Clients test negative during the 12-week period of seroconversion, however, during that time they are hIV infected and highly infectious. the test is not positive because the body has not produced the antibodies the hIV test detects. During this 3-month window period, known as a cute Retroviral Syndrome (aRS), nonspecific symptoms may occur, such as fever, flu symptoms, feeling weak and tired, unexplained rash on trunk and arms, anemia, and swollen lymph glands. If you have already hIV tested a patient who is not improving, he or she may need to be tested again to see if antibodies have developed. During aRS, the patient will have an extremely high viral load. THE THIRD RAIL the issue of confidentiality is \"the third rail issue in hIV t reatment,\" Dr. fitzp atrick said. as a practitioner, you are not permitted to tell the patient's spouse or family members that he or she is hIV positive. You cannot even tell the expectant father if a pregnant woman is infected with hIV. \"this is a challenge,\" she said, \"We have had people who have had HIV 10 years and they still have not told anyone.\" What if a family member blatantly asks you if the patient is hIV positive Dr. fitzp atrick says: \"have the family member come into the room with patient, and corner the patient into answering the question.\" OPT-OUT TESTINg W ORkS \"hIV is a treatable chronic disease, just like diabetes.\" the stigma should not deter testing. \"opt-out testing is working in DC,\" she said. \" as the health care professional, you can say: 't oday, as our standard of care, we will be testing (say the usual list of tests, include hIV test). If you don't want any of these tests, let me know.\" TALkINg THE TALk If you, as a health care practitioner, have difficulty discussing sexual matters, you could benefit from participating in role-playing sessions. (If you do not feel comfortable, it is going to come through to the client). a ttendees learned about the art of the chat from speaker anthony Cook, lGSW, hIV prevention Manager at a walk-in clinic at Congress heights. Mr. Cook guided attendees toward developing an effective speaking style\u2014nonjudgmental yet encouraging clients to become empowered towards healthier behaviors. \"You will have conversations that make you feel uncomfortable, but do not react. a non-response gives them (clients) permission to share information about themselves.\" When asked about his most effective method for getting clients to practice safer sex, Mr. Cook said the most effective way to gain client compliance is to provide the information in a nonjudgmental manner and then \"put the onus on them.\" only the client can control his or her behavior. p eople change when they come up with their own Nursing Practice Continued from page 19 Anthony Cook, LGSW21 e-mail: hpla.doh@dc.gov web: www.hpla.doh.dc.govplan. Mr. Cook suggested a question you may pose to your client at the end of your talk: \"Based on what we've discussed, what can you do today to make yourself safe?\" ORIg IN AND STRAINS Gebeyehu t eferi, MD, of Unity health Care, provided details on the initial development of the hIV virus. the first name given to the disease now known as hIV/aIDS was Gay-Related Immune Deficiency (or \"GRID\"). It was identified in 1983. Dr. Teferi noted that determining the epidemiology of hIV (and other infections) is difficult because you must go back 5 - 10 years to figure out what happened. also, viruses change to try and survive. \"they mutate,\" Dr. t eferi said. \"their purpose is to live.\" there are many strains of hIV. there is hIV1 and hIV2. hIV1 is subdivided into strains M,N,o and p; strain M is subdivided into even more substrains (see chart below). \"the subtypes are unevenly distributed throughout the world,\" Dr. t eferi said. \"the more virulent subtype, D, is found in East and Central africa. Individuals with a subtype D infection pass away in 1 to 3 years. D is a mean killer. It is more effective at binding to immune cells.\" Condom use is important for those who are already hIV infected because, \"a patient may be doing well on medication, then gets a superinfection from someone with a more virulent strain of hIV.\" Dr. t eferi said the precursor to hIV appeared in 1931, and the first death from HIV/AIDS occurred in 1959. He reviewed the theories attempting to pinpoint the origin of hIV (which leapt to the human population from the nonhuman primates with the Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV). theories: page 22 Gebeyehu Teferi, MDROLE PLAyINg Remind your clients that hIV can be transmitted through blood, semen, pre-seminal fluid, and vaginal fluid\u2014during oral sex, vaginal sex, or anal sex and/or needles during IV drug use. hIV can also be transmitted through breast milk during breastfeeding. Below are some suggested lines to say during the conversation: \"tell me what you know about hIV.\" \"Do you always use condoms?\" \"look at the expiration date. Condoms do have an expiration date.\" \"Who is responsible for bringing condoms in the house?\" \"What kind of material are your condoms made of?\" \"are they kept in a certain place?\" [If condoms are kept in a place with a hot temperature, they may be damaged. Never wear two condoms at one time, this can cause them to tear and put both parties at risk of hIV, StD, and or pregnancy]. \"Do you think your partner has other partners?\" \"Have you been tested for HIV? Do you have 20 minutes? We are not singling you out. In the District, one in 20 people have HIV, Which is why we encourage everyone to be tested.\" Before administering the test, explain the procedure for administering the test and the possible results. \"are you ready for the results?\" (If test is positive, explain that a physician will see the client to determine the viral load and CD4 or t cell count. Explain what these terms mean). If the client is not in a monogamous relationship, you can ask in a nonjudgmental way: \"Can you minimize the number of partners you have? Is that an option?\" When the client comes in on a subsequent visit, ask: \"how did that work out?\" (the safer sexual practices). Urge client to have a conversation with their partner: \"has your partner been tested? If your partner questions why you've gotten tested, or why you want him (or her) to be tested, let them know that one in 20 people in DC have HIV.\" at every session ask: \"Do you have any questions?\" Good conclusion to initial talk with client: \"Considering what we have discussed, what can you do when you leave today to keep yourself safe?\" Urge client to come back for follow-up and to bring their partner to their next visit. 22 District of Columbia Nurse: Regulation Education Practice(chimp or monkey meat). hunters' exposure to animal blood during butchering. people having sooty mangabey monkeys as pets. Exposure to virus via an oral polio vaccine grown in chimp cells. Some early vaccines contained Simian virus SV40, discovered in 1960. \"take all of these theories with a grain of salt,\" Dr. t eferi said. Dr. t eferi said he does not believe that the transfer to human beings was the result of sexual activity between humans and animals. At the end of 2008, there were 16,513 people living with hIV/aIDS in DC (3.2% of the population). \"fifty percent of people living with aIDS are african american,\" he said, \"a group which is just 12% of the US population. MSM (men having sex with men) is still the number one method of transmission.\" f or black males, the infection rate was 7.1%. Dr. teferi noted these statistics, but reminded attendees that white residents should not be unconcerned about possible hIV infection because for white residents there is an infection rate over 1%, which is still considered an epidemic. DETECTIVE WORk Dr. t eferi urged health care practitioners to consider all possibilities if an hIV patient's condition is not improving with medication. he told of a case where the client was obtaining the medicine but not taking it, but chose to use prayer alone to fight the disease. PERSONAL JOURNE y attendees had the chance to hear the story of a man who has been hIV positive for more than 20 years. Wayne Dicks shared his personal history as a self-confident young gay man, who had sexual relations during high school with football players and other \"down low\" types. Born into a military family, Wayne attended the South Carolina military school, the Citadel upon his father's orders, despite the fact that Wayne was a straight-a student who wanted to become an interior decorator. Wayne excelled at the Citadel, eventually joined the military, and was stationed in Germany as a helicopter pilot. one day he went to the ER for lumps under his arms, was soon diagnosed with GRID, he was told he only had two years to live, and was discharged from the military in one day, with no benefits. THAN k gOD FOR FAMIL y It now has been 25 years since that incident. Initially, his parents didn't know he had hIV and he was too ashamed to tell them. f ortunately, when he did tell them, they were supportive. Gaining their support was empowering: \"I could tell everyone,\" he said, \"It was such an ego booster.\" Disclosure can be a boost for hIV positive individuals. \"When you have the power to disclose your illness\" it helps the patient so much. \"thank God for my family,\" he said. he earned a graduate degree from the University of South Carolina School of public health, although he added, at that time in South Carolina, people's attitudes toward hIV/aIDS was \"so prehistoric,\" many did not want to hear his message. WORk WITH TRANSg ENDER HEALTH Mr. Dicks spoke about his work with North Capitol Street's t ransgender health Empowerment Center. Everyone needs to break down internal barriers\u2014even an openly gay man like Mr. Dicks. Initially, he said, he was \"afraid of transgenders\" because of rumors that they could be violent, \"but they are some of the nicest people. they have amazed me with their stories.\" he said he was surprised to hear that transgender prostitutes are the penetrator during the sexual encounters with \"down low\" clients, not the other way around. \" and they don't believe in protection\u2014it's a quickie and down-low men are not prepared.\" transgendered individuals \"need a lot of special care,\" he said. \"put yourselves in their footsteps.\" he noted the difficulties transgendered youth face in using high school restrooms, as an example. Mr. Dicks has been with the same partner for 20 years, and he urged health care professionals to take CE courses: \"We have to learn about the people we serve.\" Did you know? \"Cheeking,\" Mr. Dicks says, is the act of applying a condom to a male sex partner using one's mouth, without him knowing that you are doing so. IN THE DENTAL OFFICE Dentist Derrick K. Eiland, DDS, is a participant in paMaaEt C's pilot program in which three dentists are providing hIV swab testing for patients. In addition, he is an expert at spotting hIV-related symptoms in the oral cavity. \"the mouth is one of first places hIV manifests,\" Dr Eiland. \"oral hairy leukoplakia (a nonpainful white plaque on the side of the tongue) is very common in patients with hIV. Continued from page 21 Nursing Practice Wayne Dicks23 e-mail: hpla.doh@dc.gov web: www.hpla.doh.dc.govEncourage patients to look inside their mouths to see what is normal and what is abnormal. If you see something that is not normal (in a patient's mouth), refer them to an oral pathologist who can identify the condition with a swab or biopsy. Urge the patient to be hIV tested. If you ask the patient to be tested for hIV out of a place of love and caring, they will be receptive to the idea.\" TALk TO yOUR PATIENTS Don't be afraid to learn new things about people's lives. \" a lot of things go on I didn't [previously] know about,\" he said. \"If a patient says 'I don't have sex\u2014I just touch. ' Well, let them know that that can be risky behavior.\" the patient who is \"touching\" or \"being touched\" may be doing so during oral-sex practices. Does either partner have warts? Dental disease? Bleeding gums? human beings are complicated beings, Dr. Eiland reminded attendees. \"I talk in natural language that the patient can understand. I don't judge or condemn. I accept and love.\" DIVERSITy OF SEXUALITy Dr. Eiland's 24-hour dental office serves a diverse clientele. \"prostitutes come in with their pimps. a prostitute with her mouth bleeding, from a toothache, will be expected to go right back out on the street and perform oral sex.\" Be willing to step out of your comfort zone. \"When you treat a 6-foot-4 transgender patient with breasts and wig, you may have to step outside of your comfort box.\" Be willing to do that. Keep your ears open. If a male nursing home patient mentions, \"I got a little friend that comes and tightens me up,\" Dr. Eiland said, that older gentleman may have just confirmed that he, too, is a good candidate for hIV testing. \"Young ladies have children and need money,\" Dr. Eiland said. human nature dictates that most people delay seeking dental treatment until they feel it is absolutely necessary. Some people will function with sores in their mouth for quite a long time without going to the dentist. \"Nobody likes going to the dentist-it is what it is,\" Dr. Eiland told attendees. Early detection of hIV is important, he said, because treatment works. \"p atients are living longer with hIV, and they can do well on treatment,\" Dr. Eiland said. having an education, conventional attire, and a high-status job, however, do not necessarily equate to a willingness to be hIV tested. Dr. Eiland told of an instance at a meeting where he and fellow dentists were learning to do hIV swap testing and each had the opportunity to be hIV tested themselves. the dentists didn't want to be tested: \"I don't want to know,\" they said. Dr. Eiland reiterated a message that other speakers also asked attendees to advocate in the community: Condoms should be used during oral sex! TEENS \"She just got me so gah!\" a dolescent Reproductive health Specialist, Kerriann peart of CItY YEaR began her talk by giving an example of a teen expression which provides information in a language you might not understand (e.g. \"gah\"=frustrated). Do you know what a teen means when you are told that a girl or boy is a \"rolla\"? (has many sex partners.) \"You don't have to speak slang,\" Ms. p eart said, \"but do understand it.\" If you don't know something don't be afraid to ask teens, said Ms. p eart, the hIV/aIDS outreach prevention and Education program Manager at the organization. adolescence is characterized not just by physical changes, she said, but by mental and emotional changes as well. She asked that attendees use accurate language when speaking to teens about hIV. \"there is no difference between 'full-blown aIDS' and a diagnosis of aIDS. Just say aIDS. the notion of 'full-blown' perpetuates stigma and ignorance\" . Use clear language with teens and ask them to explain the language they use. talking to t een Girls: Girls will often say, \"I want to have sex because he loves me,\" and they don't think their boyfriend could possibly have hIV because \"he looks good, he has a nice car, and he has Gucci shoes.\" Ms. p eart asks girls to recognize that, despite their emotions, \"your body is not ready\" . \"having honest discussions about the physical and emotional changes that occur once engaging in sexual activity is essential in supporting young girls and boys, to make healthy sexual decisions.\" talking to t een Boys: t alk to boys, but not at the kitchen table--go to where they are: on the corner or on the basketball court. \"Boys crave challenges,\" Ms. p eart said. You might ask: \"Now that you know this information about hIV and StDs, how will you talk to your girlfriend about this issue?\" \"What is also important with educating boys and young men is having honest male figures around who can impart healthy sexual knowledge to these youth. It is one thing for me as a young woman to educate boys, but for a boy hearing the same information from a young man creates much more of an impact.\" Condom tips: check the expiration date; check package for holes, and do not tear open package with teeth.

Eiland, DDS Kerriann Peart24 District of Columbia Nurse: Regulation Education PracticeNursing Practice LgBTqIA You may know what \"lol\" stands for (laughing out loud), but do you know what lGBtQI stands for? lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, transgender, Questioning (or queer), Intersex. Some add an \" a\" at the end: lGB tQIa (a = asexual). RESPECT THE y OUNg Check your biases at the door when speaking to young people. \"When speaking to teens, be a blank slate,\" Ms. p eart says, \"let the teen write on that slate. When I speak in a non-judgmental manner, they let me know where they are.\" also keep in mind that some teens may be in same sex relationships but do not consider themselves to be gay or lGB tQI. \"Young people look at things in snapshots\u2014just the \"right here, right now. their actions do not determine their identity. We have to move away from such preconceived notions as they cause youth to become isolated and potentially increase their risk.\" \"Youth know quite a bit and we must respect and honor them,\" Ms. p eart said. let teens know it is okay to be empowered and define boundaries. She noted that the young people who are most vulnerable to hIV are teens who are homeless, mentally ill, who have no parents or support, and are faced with socio-economic and cultural barriers. SENIORS AT RISk Dorcas Baker, RN, BSN, a CRN, Site Director of the Johns hopkins University local p erformance Site aIDS Education and t raining Center, put it simply: Working with older adults with a focus on hIV is her area of passion. \"the face of hIV is aging. With advanced treatment, people are living longer with hIV. Most patients in Maryland are in the 40-49 age group. Older people are being newly diagnosed.\" the CDC designates individuals who are 50 or older as \"older adults.\" t oday, about 25% of those with HIV are older adults; by 2015, 50% of those with HIV will bemore than 50 years old. \"Yes, they have sex,\" Ms. Baker, says of older adults. \"Yes, they are at risk for StIs, and yes, they do drugs. older adults are sexual beings. they have Viagra and Cialis. Sexual activity may not happen that often, but it does happen.\" as healthcare professionals, we must open our eyes. t raditionally, the hIV test has been the last possible consideration for some practitioners. \"they will test for everything else first,\" she said. In Ms. Baker's practice, the oldest person she has seen newly-diagnosed with hIV was 94 years old, and the lady's husband had died 15 years prior. gETTINg TO kNOW yOU Many older adults do not see themselves at risk for hIV. If you don't ask them if they are sexually active, they will not volunteer the information. as a health care professional, become adept at gently weaving the topic of sex into the conversation. Broach the topic casually through a series of questions, Ms. Baker says: \" any relationships or dating?\" \"Do you go out?\" \"Do you drink?\" \"Do you \" are you sexually active?\" EARL y DETECTION \"We want to find them faster,\" Ms. Baker told attendees. Early diagnosis is key because older adults respond differently to hIV medications: \"It is harder to get t cells up,\" Ms. Baker said. on the plus side, however, the vast majority of \"older adults are very adherent. A 2005 study found that 95% of HIV positive older adults had a 95% adherence rate. their viral load lowers because of good adherence, but it takes longer for their t cells to build up.\" Note: check with the hIV physician to find out if the patient is taking Viagra or Cialis, which works against some hIV drugs. STUBBORN SENIORS for those few who don't want to take their medications, use your creativity. Ms. Baker spoke about a patient who did not want to take his four hIV drugs. She encouraged him to be adherent by appealing to his veteran's values and military spirit. \"Can you win a war with just the Navy?\" she asked him. \"No,\" he said, \"You need the army, air f orce and Marines.\" So she referred to his four hIV medications as the army, Navy, air f orce and Marines. after that pep talk, he was adherent. at the informational programs she holds in Baltimore, when seniors balk at hearing about hIV Ms. Baker asks: \"Do you have a sister? Do you have grandchildren? You can help somebody with this information.\" this call to help others appeals to seniors who might otherwise refuse to listen to a discussion on hIV or another sex-related topic. DRUg CATEgORIES Jose f ernando Chavez, MD, of the Unity health Care anacostia health Center, informed participants about the medications we currently have at our disposal to fight hIV. there are over 25 HIV drugs that fall within five major Continued from page 23 Dorcas Baker, r N, BSN, AC protease inhibitors (pIs); and fusion inhibitors. Some medications are boosters to make other medications more effective. HIV DRUg S \"We are able to treat 90% of those diagnosed with hIV. We cannot cure hIV, but we can control it,\" physician Dr. Chavez, told attendees. \"Why can't you cure hIV?\" a participant asked. there is no cure because the virus is integrated into the hIV positive patient's DNa, Dr. Chavez said, \"and once it is integrated into your DNa, the virus will only die when that cell dies.\" PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS \"practitioners must chose medications from two different classes to control mutant viruses,\" he said. \"In prescribing medications, we have to consider the patient's characteristics.\" Drug interaction can be a huge concern, he said. You have to consider any non-hIV drugs the patient may be taking. the patient may want to take the same medication as someone they know. \"She may want to take the same medication her sister takes. Explain to the patient that the regimen that your sister is taking may not be right for you.\" prescribers must consider factors such as: Is the patient pregnant? or, would the patient be capable of adherence if the medication has to be taken more than once a day? MEDICATION ADHERENCE Dr. Chavez says health care practitioners must \"assess adherence, even if there are no problems. p atients become complacent, and stop taking their medications. Do counseling at every single visit.\" If a patient is getting hIV treatment, then their partner needs to be tested also and/or in treatment. \"Early intervention is key because the older and higher the viral load, the more rapidly the patient will deteriorate,\" Dr. Chavez said. HIV patients can live more than 20 years with the disease, and they may bear children without passing on the infection: \"Unity has many pregnant hIV patients and no babies born with hIV,\" he said. FIFTH VITAL SIgN temperature, pulse/heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate are the four vital signs. opt-out hIV testing should be the fifth vital sign, according to Carolyn D. thompson, Ma, who is Deputy Bureau Chief, prevention, for the DC Department of health's hIV, aIDS, hepatitis, StD, and tuberculosis a dministration (hahSta). hIV testing should be routine. OPT-OUT HIV TESTINg opt-out testing is simple. Inform the client that they will be tested. Name all tests, including the hIV test, and then let them know that they should speak up if they would like to opt out of any test. the worst way to offer an hIV test, however, is to ask: \"Do you want an hIV test?\" Most people, for whatever reason, will be inclined to decline. opt-out testing, which hahSta promotes, is a necessity in DC because: \"one-third to one-half of all people infected are unaware of their status,\" she said. \"When people are aware of their status, they are less likely to engage in high risk behaviors, and medications are available.\" all age groups should be tested for StIs and hIV. hahSta tests for StIs in the high schools. \"the same behaviors that lead to StIs lead to hIV,\" Ms. thompson said. In the District, a separate written consent is not necessary and no pre-test counseling is required to test for hIV. however, \"linkage to care is extremely important,\" Ms. thompson said. \"We do not support self-testing because then there would be no linkage to care, and the public health department would not know about the positive result. We want to get as much community input as possible. We want hIV testing to be just as routine as the flu shot. We need everybody who is hIV positive to be in care.\" Ms. thompson urged attendees to be accepting of those with a different sexual preference: \"Gay youth with self-acceptance are more likely to use condoms,\" she said. \"those rejected early seek love in all the wrong places. We should make it so people don't have to build separate worlds away from their family, friends and neighbors\" she says. RED CARPET PROg RAM \"there are people we never see because they do not have a medical home,\" Ms. thompson said. \"the ER is their medical home. hahSta 's Red Carpet Entry program provides medical care to DC residents diagnosed with hIV within the first 48 to 72 hours of diagnosis.\" the DC Department of health wants all persons newly diagnosed with hIV to visit an hIV specialist right away.

Each class of drug attacks the virus at different points in its life cycle\u2014so the client taking hIV meds, will generally take three different antiretroviral drugs from two different classes. taking more than one drug also protects against hIV drug resistance. When hIV reproduces, it can make copies of itself that are imperfect\u2014and these mutations may not respond to the drugs.
