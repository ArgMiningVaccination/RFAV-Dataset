It is the sum total of the knowledge, skill, and practices based on the theories, beliefs, and experiences indigenous to different cultures, whether explicable or not, used in the maintenance of health as well as in the prevention, diagnosis, improvement or treatment of physical and mental illness.", "sitename": "World Health Organization: WHO", "date": "2018-08-27", "cleaned_text": "Traditional medicine Communities and families in the Western Pacific Region use traditional and complementary medicine extensively for a variety of health problems, from minor ailments to life-threatening diseases. It is sometimes the only available and affordable option, especially in remote or under-served areas. Thus, it plays an important role in primary health care. Traditional and complementary medicine is a health practice with strong historical and cultural roots. Since it has often evolved as part of a particular cultural heritage, the forms of traditional medicine vary widely across the Region. Some forms are highly developed and well documented. They are based on systematized knowledge, comprehensive methodology and historical experience. A number of less complex traditional medicine practices also exist within small and sometimes isolated ethnic groups, based largely on local experience. The knowledge may not be documented, often being transmitted orally from generation to generation. In the Western Pacific Region, traditional and complementary medicine is used extensively for various health conditions, but its practice varies widely across different countries. Evidence over the years has shown the important role of traditional and complementary medicine in improving quality of life. In the context of the rapidly ageing population and an increase in noncommunicable diseases in the Region, the promotion and development of traditional and complementary medicine can help bring a shift from disease-oriented to person- and community-oriented approach to health. However, the availability of and access to traditional and complementary medicine vary across countries in the Region, and their evidence-based use is not fully optimized. WHO plays an important role in supporting Member States to harness the role of traditional and complementary medicine for health and well-being. To help improve the access to safe, effective and culturally accepted services, especially for populations that are hard to reach, WHO developed the Regional Framework for Harnessing the Role of Traditional and Complementary Medicine for Achieving Health and Well-being in the Western Pacific. The Regional Framework, developed in close collaboration with Member States, stakeholders, partners and experts, identifies four strategic actions and key action areas to achieve this vision, namely: - promoting the role of traditional and complementary medicine for health and well-being in national policies; - strengthening context-specific mechanisms to ensure safety, quality and effectiveness of traditional and complementary medicine services; - improving coverage and equitable access to traditional and complementary medicine services; and - supporting documentation, research and innovation for traditional and complementary medicine services.
