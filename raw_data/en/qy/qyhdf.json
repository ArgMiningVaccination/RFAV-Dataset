It is based on the theory that disease results from an imbalance of the body's life force (prana). It aims to restore balance within the body. The balance of prana is determined by equilibrium of the 3 bodily qualities (doshas): vata, pitta, and kapha. Most people have a dominant dosha; the specific balance is unique to each person.

Uses for Ayurveda After determining the balance of doshas, practitioners design a treatment specifically tailored to each patient. Ayurveda uses diet, herbs, massage, meditation, movement, and therapeutic detoxification (panchkarma)\u2014typically with enemas, oil massages, or nasal lavage\u2014to restore balance within the body and with nature. Possible Adverse Effects In some of the herbal combinations used, heavy metals (mainly lead, mercury, and arsenic) are included. Several studies found that Ayurvedic herbal supplements contain heavy metals in doses that could cause toxicity ( [4](/professional/special-subjects/integrative,-complementary,-and-alternative-medicine/ayurveda#v39504528) [ References Ayurveda, the traditional medical system of India, originated > 4000 years ago.
