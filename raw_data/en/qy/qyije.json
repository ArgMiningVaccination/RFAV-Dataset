These are the health concerns that keep most people up at night. But there's another major threat that rarely makes the list: [Sepsis](https://feinstein.northwell.edu/news/the-latest/study-targets-sepsis-drug-nih-grant). It's shockingly common: About 1.7 million adults in the United States develop sepsis every year, nearly as many as the 1.9 million who are diagnosed with cancer annually. And it's dangerous: Sepsis takes roughly 350,000 lives each year, which happens to be more than the deaths from diabetes and stroke combined. Yet, outside the medical community, few people are familiar with sepsis or understand what it is. Simply put, sepsis is an overreaction to infection. Immune cells that normally work to protect the body from invading or harmful bacteria start destroying normal, healthy cells. As the attack spins out of control, it can damage the heart, lungs, kidneys and other organs. It can even be fatal. The disaster unfolds quickly. It can take as little as 12 hours from the earliest signs of infection to organ failure and death. For years, Northwell Health has made sepsis a clinical and research priority. The health system was motivated partly by internal statistics: In 2010, sepsis was the most common diagnostic classification for patients who died at a Northwell facility. Another spur was the recognition that the disease poses a major threat to Americans and people around the world. Northwell's efforts to combat sepsis include: And these have paid off. Sepsis-related mortality at Northwell has plummeted over the past decade, and many of the changes responsible for that success have been adopted at other hospitals across the country. The health system's efforts have already saved thousands of lives, and the work is continuing. Here, a look at key moves that are helping to bring a major killer under control. In the spring of 1985, a tiny patient named Janice spent 25 days in the burn unit of a New York City hospital. The 11-month-old had been playing on the kitchen floor when, in a split second, she crawled between her grandmother's feet just as the woman lifted a huge pot of pasta off the stove. Her grandmother stumbled, and Janice was doused with boiling water .The child's doctors did everything they could to treat the burns that covered more than 75% of her body. Janice underwent major surgery and [skin grafts;](https://www.northwell.edu/plastic-surgery/procedures/skin-grafts-for-wounds) was on and off a respirator; and received gallons of intravenous fluids. She seemed to be recovering, but suddenly, as her medical team began to talk about discharging her, Janice's heart stopped. She had developed sepsis \u2014 and it had taken her life. One of the doctors in that burn unit was a surgeon-in-training, [Kevin J. Tracey, MD.](https://feinstein.northwell.edu/institutes-researchers/our-researchers/kevin-j-tracey-md) Consumed by the need to know exactly what happened to his young patient \u2014 and frustrated by the lack of answers to fundamental questions about sepsis \u2014 he decided to shift his career toward research. It was the start of a commitment that would bear fruit at Northwell. Dr. Tracey's scientific path eventually led him to a research lab at North Shore University Hospital. There, he and his colleagues focused on the molecular basis of inflammation and identifying the mechanisms by which neurons control the immune system's response to injury and infection \u2014 work that helped shed light on the mysteries that obscured severe sepsis at the time Janice was hurt. That lab became part of what is now Northwell's Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research (FIMR). In 2005, Dr. Tracey was appointed president and CEO. \"Identifying ways to prevent and combat sepsis became a major research priority for the Feinstein Institutes and Northwell,\" he says. Prompted by an analysis of mortality rates at its facilities, Northwell formed a task force to tackle the sepsis problem on all fronts. \"First, we had to increase awareness among clinicians and the general public of how to recognize sepsis so it could be stopped,\" says [Martin Doerfler, MD](https://www.northwell.edu/about/leadership/martin-doerfler), senior vice president of clinical strategy and development and associate chief medical officer at Northwell. \"We also needed to work on a strategy to shorten the time to sepsis diagnosis and time to treatment.\" Led by Dr. Doerfler and [John D'Angelo, MD](https://www.northwell.edu/about/leadership/john-dangelo-md), senior vice president and regional executive director for Northwell's central region, the task force reviewed medical records of thousands of cases to pinpoint the key signs of sepsis: fever, difficulty breathing, low blood pressure, fast heart rate and mental confusion. The next step was to develop a treatment protocol, including early administration of fluids and antibiotics, and implement it across Northwell's hospitals. \"We put together a clinical algorithm,\" says Dr. Doerfler. \"It's clear. It's concise. And it ensures that the clinicians who are encountering patients know what to do in the shortest time period possible.\" The task force also turned its attention to a previously overlooked set of patients. Sepsis had long been seen as a problem primarily for patients in the intensive care unit, explains Dr. Doerfler. But the Northwell team began to recognize that the majority of patients who ended up septic and dying in the ICU actually came in through the [emergency department](https://www.northwell.edu/emergency-medicine) (ED), generally because of a severe infection. That meant such cases needed even more aggressive treatment to minimize the progression to sepsis. Northwell's Feinstein Institutes hosted an international symposium, bringing together scientists, physicians, policymakers and other sepsis experts from 18 countries to develop the first worldwide consensus on best practices to fight the disease. Out of that 2010 collaborative came the [Global Sepsis Alliance](https://www.global-sepsis-alliance.org/about) \u2014 a nonprofit charity that, today, encompasses more than 100 organizations from all over the world, working together to provide global leadership to reduce the worldwide burden of sepsis. One of the alliance's many successes: In 2012, it established September 13 as World Sepsis Day to raise awareness of the disease and help ensure prompt treatment. Northwell began partnering with the [Institute for Healthcare Improvement](https://www.ihi.org/about/Pages/default.aspx), a recognized leader in health care process refinement, to test new ways to prevent sepsis and manage its most harmful effects. All of Northwell's emergency departments began reengineering processes to decrease \"door-to-doctor\" time in the ED, identify and remove impediments to the early administration of antibiotics, track and modify steps to get blood test results back to physicians within 90 minutes and start fluids quickly. One afternoon, a 12-year-old boy from Queens named Rory Staunton stumbled while playing basketball in his gym class and scraped his elbow. The injury seemed insignificant, but became worrisome. \"He had developed a 104-degree fever that wouldn't come down,\" recalled his mother, Orlaith Staunton. Doctors in the emergency department of a Manhattan hospital thought it was just a stomach virus and sent Rory home. The next day, as his symptoms worsened, the Stauntons brought him back to the hospital. On April 1, 2012, three nights after he was first sent home from the ED, Rory died in the intensive care unit. The cause was severe septic shock brought on by infection. \"We had never heard of sepsis until our son was dead,\" said Ciaran Staunton, Rory's father. Yet every one of his symptoms indicated the condition. \"If anybody had said 'could this be sepsis?' he would be alive today,\" added Orlaith. \"All he needed was IV fluids and antibiotics, and he would be alive today. Rory died because of the fact that no one had identified his infection.\" In their grief, the Stauntons made it their mission to raise sepsis awareness \u2014 working with Northwell, which for years had been implementing sepsis protocols and guidelines. \"If every hospital in New York had the same standard of awareness that Northwell hospitals already had in place, we believe our son would be alive today,\" said Ciaran. Together, the Stauntons and Northwell founded [End Sepsis ](https://www.endsepsis.org/about/)(originally named the Rory Staunton Foundation for Sepsis Prevention) to increase awareness, improve infection education and promote rapid diagnosis and treatment. As a result of this effort, in late 2013 New York became the first state in the nation to require all hospitals to adopt sepsis protocols known as Rory's Regulations. In the spring of 2013, a year after Rory Staunton died, a 9-year-old boy named Ryan Barnett was brought to his local hospital, vomiting and in pain. Doctors told his mom, Kathleen Theune, that he had a stomach virus and sent Ryan home. But his symptoms worsened and his parents brought him back to the same hospital the next day, where blood tests suggested sepsis. The progression was frighteningly familiar \u2014 except that, this time, the clinical team contacted Northwell's Cohen Children's Medical Center for help. \"As soon as Northwell heard Ryan's symptoms, they put a team in the ambulance to come get him,\" says Theune. Ryan was in septic shock, recalls [Peter Silver, MD](https://www.northwell.edu/about/leadership/peter-silver-md), then chief of pediatric critical care at Cohen Children's Medical Center. His organs were failing, and he had slipped into a coma. \"To this day, I remember being in the intensive care unit, having conversations with Ryan's family about how he might not survive,\" Dr. Silver says. Following Northwell's sepsis protocols, the team treated Ryan aggressively, providing IV fluids and antibiotics. It worked: Within 24 hours, Ryan turned the corner. About a week later, he was discharged. \"I'm so grateful that [Cohen Children's](https://childrenshospital.northwell.edu/departments-services/pediatric-intensive-care-unit/programs-services/pediatric-sepsis-septic-shock) had guidelines in place to treat Ryan,\" says Theune. \"The quality of care and attention Dr. Silver and his team gave my son is the reason he is alive.\" With the implementation of sepsis protocols and guidelines and other task force efforts, Northwell reduced sepsis-related mortality across the health system by almost 70% between 2008 and 2018. Another analysis shows that between 2015 and 2019, steps taken by the New York State Department of Health and hospitals throughout the state saved more than 16,000 lives. Still, Northwell continued to work to refine its protocols. After an investigation showed that hospitalized patients with sepsis or septic shock had nearly twice the odds of dying as emergency department patients with sepsis, the health system launched a broader roll-out of its sepsis protocols, making sure they reached not just ED teams but all hospital clinicians. \"The changes made at Northwell represent a culture shift at every level of the organization,\" says Dr. Doerfler. Dr. Doerfler worked with the Home Care Association of New York to help develop a sepsis screening and intervention tool for home care clinicians. This innovative instrument ensures that home care nurses, therapists and other clinicians know when to assess for infection and other signs of sepsis, and includes an algorithm to guide their next steps \u2014 aligning with the hospital-based sepsis screening requirements set by Rory's Regulations. The fight against sepsis expanded even further, tackling the problem during and after pregnancy. Pregnancy-related infection or sepsis is the second leading cause of maternal death in the United States. On World Sepsis Day in 2021, Northwell and End Sepsis, in association with the New York State Department of Health, hosted a webinar to help spread the word and reduce preventable deaths among new and expectant moms. For all the progress made so far, there is more to be done. One need: Drugs that can specifically target sepsis. Right now, therapies rely on supporting the body's organs, by using medication to manage low blood pressure, for example; doctors also use devices like mechanical ventilators to help manage symptoms. Recent studies, however, suggest some of these treatment approaches may ultimately do more harm than good \u2014 ventilators can damage the lungs, and norepinephrine, commonly used to boost low blood pressure, may interfere with the immune response to infection. [Last year,](https://www.northwell.edu/news/the-latest/feinstein-institutes-researchers-identify-potential-drug-to-treat-sepsis) researchers at the Feinstein Institutes found that a different blood pressure drug performed well in animal studies. Other work, by researcher [Haichao Wang, PhD,](https://feinstein.northwell.edu/institutes-researchers/our-researchers/haichao-wang-phd) is focusing on ways to damp down the immune system's overreaction by altering the activity of proteins in the body. A colleague, [Ping Wang, MD](https://feinstein.northwell.edu/institutes-researchers/our-researchers/ping-wang-md), the Feinstein Institutes' chief scientific officer, is investigating new treatment strategies for sepsis in newborns, among other things. And scientists at the Feinstein Institutes are also examining brain connections and nervous system signaling during sepsis \u2014 mapping that could identify new targets for [bioelectric medicine](https://www.northwell.edu/news/insights/vagus-nerve-unlocked-by-bioelectronic-medicine), an emerging field that taps into the nervous system to treat disease and injury without the use of pharmaceuticals. Still, the importance of the changes so far can't be underestimated. A decade after surviving sepsis, Ryan Barnett, now 19, is a sophomore at Pepperdine University in California. He doesn't remember much about his time at Cohen Children's but he feels forever indebted to Dr. Silver and the ICU team. \"I look at each day as a gift,\" says Barnett. For Dr. Silver, now Northwell Health's senior vice president, chief quality officer and associate chief medical officer, Ryan and his family will always have a special place in his heart. \"Because of our sepsis protocols, Ryan got the treatment he needed \u2014 and it made all the difference in the world,\" he says. \"I think every clinician on the team that treated him feels honored that we were able to be there.\" As for Dr. Tracey, now the Karches Family Distinguished Chair in Medical Research, he has his eye on the future. \"Researchers worldwide are still just beginning to unravel the underlying mechanisms of this complex condition,\" he says. \"But I'm hopeful that Northwell's work will continue to contribute to the understanding of sepsis. We will always keep patients like Janice, Rory and Ryan in mind, and we will continue to open new avenues of research in the lab, clinical trials "}
