Updated March 13, 2023 After careful consideration and following the masking guidance of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the NYS Department of Health, patients and visitors are encouraged but no longer required to wear masks inside all hospitals, buildings and facilities of Stony Brook Medicine with one exception. The Long Island State Veterans Home continues to require that all employees, volunteers, students and visitors wear a mask when in a resident or registrant care area. Stony Brook Medicine continues to enforce the applicable [New York State Department of Health](https://regs.health.ny.gov/volume-title-10/content/section-261-prevention-covid-19-transmission-covered-entities?utm_campaign=1235571_COVID-19%20Vaccine%20Requirement%20for%20Health%20Sciences%20Students%20April%202023&utm_medium=email&utm_source=StonybrookMedicine&dm_i=540J,QHDF,FVHEU,38CXM,1) and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services mandates requiring vaccination against COVID-19 for students, volunteers, faculty and staff in our hospitals and healthcare facilities. To ensure the safety of our patients, healthcare providers and staff, it is imperative that we continue to take all necessary measures to prevent the spread of the virus. The COVID-19 vaccination requirements also cover all students enrolled in our Health Sciences schools, which means that students must have received a COVID-19 vaccine unless they have a medical exemption or religious accommodation. Additionally, students enrolled in any program or course or who are participating in a clinical placement or internship held at a third-party location must continue to comply with all health and safety guidelines, including any COVID vaccination or testing protocols that are in place at the third-party site. Due to the emergence of many omicron variants, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has withdrawn its approval for use of the most recently available monoclonal antibody (bebtelovimab) as it offers no noticeable protection.
