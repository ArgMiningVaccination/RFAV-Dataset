That's exactly what Nicky Kinnaird should provide for shoppers wandering around her well-edited beauty emporium, [Space NK](http://www.spacenk.co.uk/)\u2014she has a story about each hand-selected item she stocks in her store. But first, let's back up. Every good tour starts with an introduction. Space NK founder Nicky Kinnarid.The Belfast-born Kinnaird, 44, who started her career in real estate, has always loved scouring the globe for innovative objects and products. To showcase her favorite things, she launched Space NK\u2014her dream lifestyle store\u2014in London's Covent Garden, in 1993. \"It was a combination of young fashion-design labels and accessories,\" she says. It even had a juice bar. (\"England wasn't ready for [the juice bar]. If I would have done it five years later, it would have been a huge success.\") The beauty bit started out as a tiny fraction of the shop and grew over a three-year period to occupy a quarter of the floor. Spotting the trend, Kinnaird decided to narrow her focus. It helped that she had always been passionate about scents and grooming. \"From my earliest memory, I can think of having amazing fine fragrances in the house,\" she says. Plus, growing up, Kinnaird spent a portion of every year on the Spanish coast, where she experienced the flavorful smells of local markets\u2014\"the olive-oil bars of soap, the bottles of lavender water, amazing citrus colognes.\" To expand her beauty business, Kinnaird knocked on doors the world over to find elixirs that met her exacting standards, using her discerning taste to select skin- and hair-care products, makeup, fragrances, and home scents. \"It's being able to mix around but being very aware of the specific strengths of the lines and what is appropriate for very specific skin types and skin issues,\" she says. \"I don't believe that any one brand offers the top solution for everything.\" Soon Space NK sprouted five London locations, but Kinnaird's big break came when she opened a shop within a Harvey Nichols department store in Knightsbridge. \"That's when I think it became a little more obvious that we existed,\" she said. Today there are 55 locations in the U.K. and also a spa. Kinnaird often works with the brands as they finalize their lines. \"They send samples to me, asking questions such as What do you think of this texture?' That, and using me as a sounding board for advice on product lines,\" she says. \"There's a lot of history with a lot of creators of the brands.\" In 2007, Kinnaird debuted her first stateside store, in New York City's SoHo neighborhood, and she has since opened three more shops (in Short Hills, New Jersey; in Scarsdale, New York; and on Columbus Avenue, in New York City). This month, Space NK is exploding into nine Bloomingdale's locations, in New York, Massachusetts, and California. \"The Bloomingdale's partnership enables us to bring Space NK to a much wider audience faster than we could ever grow organically ourselves,\" she says. \"It's actually remarkably similar to how we grew in London.\" If you can't make it to one of Space NK's stand-alone stores in the U.S. or the U.K., or if the Bloomingdale's closest to you isn't getting an outpost, here's a guided tour of the well-curated SoHo shop by the curator herself. Kinnaird explains her reasons for selecting certain lines and points out their \"hero\" products.
