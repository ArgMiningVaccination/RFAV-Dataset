If you answered \"YES\" to any of the above, then you should consider taking Ad\u00ebeva Immuno-Detox Prime. Why does our immune system weaken with age? - The thymus gland trains immune cells to become efficient killers of viruses, bacteria, and other germs and enhance their ability to kill emerging cancer cells - By age 45 our immune system weakens, largely due to progressive shrinking of the thymus gland, which starts at puberty Can nutrients strengthen the immune system? - Clinical studies prove that Reishi Mushroom Extract and Astragalus are the two most powerful immune-supporting nutrients discovered to date - These nutrients help restore a more youthful function to the immune system - They have even restored immune counts and efficiency in cancer patients undergoing radiation and/or chemotherapy treatments What about your detoxification system? - Just like immune cells, the detoxification system in our body becomes less efficient as we age - This permits more toxins (including cancer-causing agents) to build up in our body as we age, creating health risks Can nutrients boost detoxification function? - The Indole-3-Carbinol (found in broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables), as well as the unique flavonoid (silymarin) found in Milk Thistle, are known to boost detoxification function to more youthful levels - Milk Thistle can also regenerate damaged liver cells, protect liver cells against environmental toxins and boost levels of glutathione - a vital detoxifying and antioxidant agent How do we maintain our immune and detoxification systems during adult life? Take 1-2 capsules of Immuno-Detox Prime each day, which contains effective dosages of: - Reishi Mushroom Extract - Astragalus - Indole-3-Carbinol - Milk Thistle (80% silymarin content) This supplement turns back the clock, strengthening immune and detoxification function, vital to survival and well being. Other Lifestyle Measures To Support Immune and Detoxification Function: - Drink alcohol in moderation or eliminate it completely - Don't smoke - Take a high potency Multi-Vitamin and Mineral each day, containing boosted levels of antioxidants, and a B-50 complex - Do a moderate amount of exercise each week - Consume at least one cruciferous vegetables daily (broccoli, Brussel sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, turnips, bok choy) - Consume 5-7 fruit and vegetable servings per day - At the first sign of cold also consider Orega-Sept Capsules "}
