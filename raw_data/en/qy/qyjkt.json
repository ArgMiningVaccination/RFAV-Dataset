Box 149347 Austin, Texas 78714-9347 Effective Date: March 15, 2006 PREFACE This Field Inspection Manual consists of the Texas Food Establishment Rules in a format designed to promote uniformity in the appli cation of the rules. The current Texas Food Establishment Rules, or \"TFER\", were adopt ed by the Texas Health and Human Services Commission in February 2006 and became effectiv e in March 2006. All critical items are underlined to assist the user in verifying those portions of the rules that are critical and non- critical. Also, the respective Item Numbers ha ve been assigned to the critical items that correspond to the retail food insp ection form. The appropriate Item Numbers are placed next the applicable subsections and para graphs. The Item Numbers are not re-listed unless there is a change in Item Number within the subsection or paragraph or th ere is a new page. This will promote and ensure uniformity in the applicati on of the TFER when us ing the inspection form found in the rules. A comprehensive index is al so provided to enhance the use of the Manual. These item interpretations were developed with input from the Southw est Region FDA Regional Food Specialists, critical item interpretations in the 2001 an d 2005 FDA Food Codes, and the staff of the Food Establishments Group. We would like to specifically acknowledge Sandra Sugarek and Zachary Holbrooks of the Policy, Standards, and Quality Assurance Unit, Food Establishments Group for their fine work in revising and editing this Manual. i TABLE OF CONTENTS \u00a7229.161 Purpose.............................................................................................................. ................1
