He seems to remind me [his father] that I have been driven and controlled by individualism, materialism and sensationalism. He seems to tell me that I worry too much about my individual accomplishments, what I should say and how people would respond or react to what I say ... an d so forth .\"2 \"I feel that therapy is good only if its goal is to help the autistic person to fully develop into a whole happy person. Therapy that focuses on the forcing of repeated actions ... is degrading .\"3 \"In the first grade, the class was directed to print the letters of the alphabet. As I printed them, I drew complete letters on the paper, copying as I had seen them in newspapers and books. The teacher and everyo ne else in the class only drew line figures of letters, and I thought I was in a room full of nonconformists, who drew incomplete letters as though they were right and the whole world was wrong .\"4 \"It is com mon for me and other people with autism to be unable to say the words to describe what is bothering us. It's also hard for us to figure out that other people don't experience the world the same way we do .\"5 \"I do want to stress that people with autism should be helped to the point where they can help themselves. We need the best treatment and education we can get .\"6 \"I feel close to my mum, stepfather, and sister, and sometimes I do things with them.... Most of the time, I prefer to be alone to pursue my interests .\"5 \"I don 't want to be like anybody else. I don 't necessarily see the idea of NT [neurotypical] as perfection. He y regular people do stupid mean and often evil things that people with autism would never do .\"7 \"I am proud of who I am and autism is part of who I am. In fact, you can 't separate the autism from what I do, thin k or am .\"6 \"I am tired of having to do 100% of the changing, and there is no change with most people without autism .\"7 \"It is not wrong to think in a different way.\"6 \"It's like attacking a seven -headed monster; you don't know which head to attack first.\"1 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline v \"My mum came to school at the beginning of each year and talked to both the students and the teachers about autism and about me. I think that helped everyone understand me better. I especially liked it when she talked about all the things I am good at.\"5 \"Education should be equal for all. And appropriate for all, but it must be chosen individually. If adaptations and supports are needed so that children with autism can learn, make them. If methods or materials need to be provided so that children with autism can succeed, provide them. Segregation of any kind is wrong.\"6 \"People who know the details about my autism are usually more comfortable dealing with me. Also, the more information my teachers have, the more ideas they have to help me learn.\"5 \"I am sick of social skills groups ... Why can't someone go to the bar with me or to chess club?\"10 \"Many adults with autism belie ve that positive family involvement and support help individuals with autism develop the skills necessary to be as successful as possible as adults. I think it was the work of many people who loved me that got me where I am now .\"7 \"I couldn 't cope any more so I left him sleeping, went to the shopping centre because I really, really needed a break.

Research has shown that if properly developed, communicated and implemented, guidelines can improve care. The advice in thi s guideline is based on epidemiological studies and other research evidence. Where no evidence is available, but guidance is needed, recommendations for best practice have been developed through a systematic consensus process. The recommendations in this g uideline do not indicate an exclusive course of treatment or serve as an absolute standard of care or education. While guidelines represent a statement of best practice based on the latest available evidence (at the time of development), they are not inten ded to replace the professional 's judgment in each individual case. Purpose of the New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline This guideline is intended to provide guidance on autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in both children and adults in New Zealand. T he guideline is an evidence -based summary that covers the identification and diagnosis of ASD , and ongoing assessment and access to interventions and services for individuals with ASD. It seeks to provide the best evidence currently available to assist inf ormed decision -making to improve the health, educational and social outcomes for individuals with ASD. The guideline is intended for use by primary care practitioners, education professionals, policy makers, funders, parents, carers, specialists and any ot hers who make provision for individuals with ASD. Overview New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 3 About the New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Foreword The New Zealand Government is proud to launch the 2016 edition of the Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline. This Guideline is an opportunity to better understand how best to support people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and their families. It also provides a framework to improve services for people with ASD, based on robust and reliable information. The Guideline is the world's first Living Guideline in this area to acknowledge the whole of a person's life - from early intervention and diagnosis, to community living for adults . Being a Living Guideline means there are regular updates for topics where new, significant research has emerged. Every year since 2009, a topic for update has been identified and the new evidence critically reviewed. This review is then considered by a small advisory panel to inform their revision and development of new recommendations. The 2016 edition of the Guideline incorporates the panel's updated recommendations and the rationale for each of the seven completed update topics. By regularly updating the guideline it can be more responsive to the needs of the people it has been written for, ensuring it has real meaning to those who use it . The Guideline has had input from individuals with ASD, parents of children with ASD, medical, educational and community providers, government agencies, and New Zealand and overseas researchers. It represents a ground breaking collaborative effort and a significant achievement by all contributors. The Ministry of Health's clarification of eligibility for people with A SD has meant that since April 2014 people with ASD have been able to access Disability Support Services. The Ministries of Health and Education have also been working together to ensure that people with ASD and their families receive a coordinated service. The 2016 edition of the Guideline affirms the Ministries' commitment to having meaningful, contemporary resources to support people with ASD and their families. We commend the release of this updated edition of the New Zealand ASD Guideline and its goal of improving services to people with ASD and their families. Hon Hekia Parata Hon Peseta Sam Lotu-Iiga Minister of Education Associate Minister of Health Overview 4 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Preface I was b orn into a rural South Auckland family 60 years ago. I took my first steps at 22 months of age and many sounds terrified me. I refused to touch sticky substances such as buttered toast. I had many othe r developmental delays and differences but also some above average skills such as reading and writing. Many of these differences were long -lasting and the challenges of adulthood made some of them more noticeable. My collective characteristics were not rec ognised as a case of Asperger Syndrome (a form of Autism Spectrum Disorder - ASD) until my accidental encounter with an autism specialist when I was forty -three. New Zealanders should no longer have to experience such scenarios. Because of increasing aware ness of ASD, to which this Guideline makes a significant contribution and is a world first, individuals with this different way of thinking can be recognised, supported and valued. Scientific knowledge of the human brain and body is far from complete. Full understanding of Autism Spectrum Disorder (or, if you prefer, \"autism spectrum difference \") is still some years away. So the NZ ASD Guideline is a foundation for future 'living guidelines '. It does not contain everything that is known, or is yet to be dis covered, about ASD, but is an excellent introductory one -stop -shop from which interested people can get information and increase their understanding. I look forward to, and work towards, the day when all individuals who would benefit from an ASD diagnosis can get one; when children and adults with motor skill difficulties are not forced to participate in sports and then laughed at, but are instead helped to improve their basic coordination; to a time when professionals in all fields upskill themselves to a t least a basic level of Autism -friendliness, and can also admit when they don 't know everything about ASD; and when ASD is not automatically seen as a problem, but is valued for its contribution to a resource pool of people thinking outside the square. Looking back in time at some unique individuals, it appears that an above average proportion of exceptional achievements have been, and are being, made by individuals with ASD, whether they, or the world, know they are on the autism spectrum. Information abo ut high -functioning autism (researched in 1943) was not disseminated for 50 years, so many individuals with ASD did not get the diagnosis when they should have, in early childhood. This backlog of people has only recently begun to be correctly diagnosed, t hus giving a misleading impression of ASD being both a \"new\" condition and an epidemic. I believe we have long existed in significant numbers, but our differences have not always been recognised as ASD. When I told my mother about the ASD Guideline, she sa id \"If only we had had this book when you were growing up. \" I offer this resource to my own ever -patient mother; to all other parents and family members of individuals with ASD (both diagnosed and not yet identified); to professional people in all careers; and last but not least, to all of us who have the \"autism spectrum difference \" ourselves. Jen Birch Dave Lennard Adults with ASD Adults with ASD Overview New Zealand Autism S pectrum Disorder Guideline 5 Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline development process Background In 1998, the Government commissioned a review of autism services, now known as the Curry Report, across key sectors. The review identified gaps in services and made a number of recommendations to improve the quality of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) related services. Key issues included a lack of coordinated services and cross - government leadership difficulties. This led to the establishment of the Autism Services Interdepartmental Working Group (ASIWG) in 1999. The Ministries of Health and Education and the Department of Child, Youth and Famil y were represented in this group. ASIWG was set up to implement the recommendations of the review and agreed to oversee the development of an ASD Guideline. In September 2002, in response to the recommendations in the Curry Report, the Ministry of Health a nd the Ministry of Education, in conjunction with the Paediatric Society of New Zealand , started work on scoping an ASD Guideline. For the first time in New Zealand, the ASD Guideline was seen as a way of providing evidence -based information for health, disability and education professionals and social service agencies for the provision of services for people with ASD, their families and whnau. The ASD Cross Government Officials Group was established in July 2004 to replace ASIWG. The purpose of the group was to improve the progress being made in the development of ASD initiatives and to oversee the completion of the ASD Guideline. The Senior Officials also provided regular updates for their respective Ministers. An ASD Guideline Steering Group was convened in December 2002 to help guide the work of the guideline project team. The purpose of the group was to ensure the perspectives of service users were included in the ASD Guideline, promote awareness of cultural and migrant issues and help build the credibi lity of the project within the community. The Steering Group members include representation from: adults with ASD; parents/families of people with ASD; the Paediatric Society; the Faculty of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry of the Royal Australia and New Ze aland College of Psychiatrists; disability provider organisations; Needs Assessment Service Coordination (NASC) services; Child, Youth and Family; Pacific advisors; school principals; early intervention services; the Ministry of Education, Special Educatio n (GSE); and the Disability Services, Mori Health, Clinical Services, and Mental Health directorates within the Ministry of Health. The members of the Steering Group are listed in Appendix 2. The Ministries of Health and Education jointly funded the ASD G uideline. Primarily, this involved funding the work of the three workstreams set up to develop the ASD Guideline. The Paediatric Society of New Zealand led the Assessment and Diagnosis workstream guideline development which was funded through a contract fr om the Ministry of Health. The Ministry of Education, Special Education (GSE) funded the Education workstream. The Disability Services Directorate in the Ministry of Health funded the Support and Transition workstream. Work was coordinated by a Project Man ager in the Ministry of Health with support from Technical Editors who were independently contracted to carry out specific work. The Project Sponsors were responsible for overseeing this work and allocating the funding in the project. Overview 6 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Structure of the ASD Guideline The guideline is divided into eight parts. Part 1 covers the identification and initial assessment of children, young people and adults with ASD. Part 2 focuses on how best to provide support to people who share their lives with individuals who h ave ASD. It also outlines the personal health needs of people with ASD. Part 3 covers educational principles and interventions for children and young people growing up with ASD and guidance for education sector organisation and management. Part 4 covers th e management of behavioural, emotional and mental health difficulties that can be experienced by people with ASD and provides evidence -based guidance on how these difficulties can be prevented, minimised or alleviated. Part 5 focuses on the support needs o f people with ASD within the community setting, covering a variety of aspects from transitioning from secondary school into adulthood to dealing with the criminal justice system. Part 6 focuses on the requirements for professional learning and development for individuals or groups who come into contact with people with ASD, from awareness raising to highly specialised training. Parts 7 and 8 cover the perspectiv es and experiences of Mori and Pacific people with ASD and explore issues of information needs, diagnosis, assessment, support, access, services and treatment decisions for these populations. Process of development The ASD Guideline was originally written in separate sections by three workstreams and experienced Mori and Pacific researchers. The three workstreams, each with a particular expertise, were set up to represent different aspects of ASD and the different contexts in which people with ASD live, l earn, work and play. Workstream 1 was led by the Paediatric Society of New Zealand under contract to the Ministry of Health. It addressed assessment and diagnosis in children and pharmacotherapy in children. Workstream 2 was led by the Ministry of Educatio n and addressed management in the education sector and professional learning and development issues for professionals and parents. Workstream 3 was funded by the Ministry of Health and focused on issues in older children and adults, including diagnosis, as sessment and interventions, as well as support across the age spectrum. Stakeholder reference groups were set up to provide input to these workstreams from a wide range of providers and agencies. The output from this process has been merged and integrated to provide a coherent approach to management issues. Mori input has been overseen by a Mori Advisory group set up by the Ministries of Health and Education. A series of nationwide hui were undertaken to gain further Mori input. Pacific input has been pr ovided by a fono and the subsequent work of a Pacific researcher. Separate chapters on Mori and Pacific perspectives are provided to guide management of ASD in a culturally appropriate manner. Separate methodologies were followed by the different contribu tors to the ASD Guideline. A detailed description of the methods used by the workstreams to develop the guideline is provided in Appendix 1. The process that was followed by the Mori and Pacific peoples ' teams is described within their chapters. In brief, Workstream 1 adapted the National Autism Plan for Children 200311 developed in the United Kingdom, for New Zealand circumstances to inform the assessment and diagnosis of children in Part 1 of the guideline. Th e development of all other parts of the guideline has been based on broad evidence -based principles (development of practice questions, identification and appraisal of evidence to Overview New Zealand Autism S pectrum Disorder Guideline 7 answer the questions, development of evidence tables and graded recommendati ons based on the body of evidence). The workstreams contributed different parts to the merged guideline. The contributions are as follows: Part 1: Workstream 1 (for young children) and Workstream 3 (for young people and adults) Part 2: Workstreams 2 and 3 Part 3: Workstream 2 Part 4: Workstreams 1 and 3 Part 5: Workstream 3 Part 6: Workstreams 1, 2 and 3 Part 7: Mori Guideline Development Team Part 8: Pacific Peoples ' Guideline Development Team Appendix 1 The lists of practice questions that were developed to inform the comprehensive searching that was undertaken for this guideline and the evidence tables that formed the basis of the development of recommendations can be accessed on the Ministry of Health website http://www.health.govt.nz/our -work/disability -services/disability -projects/autism -spectrum - disorder -guideline/supporting -materials -asd-guideline Recommendations have been graded according to the system used by the New Zealand Guidelines Group. Recommendations: Grade The recommendation is supported by GOOD evidence (where there are a number of studies that are valid, appli cable and clin ically relevant). A The recommendation is supported by FAIR evidence (based on studies that are mostly valid, but there are some concerns about the volume, consistency, applicability and/or clinical relevance of the evidence that may cause some uncertaint y, but are not likely to be overturned by other evidence). B The recommendation is supported by EXPERT OPINION only (from external opinion, published or unpublis hed, eg, consensus guidelines). C No recommendation can be made. The evidence is insufficient (either lacking, of poor quality or conflicting and the balance of benefits a nd harms cannot be determined). I Where a recommendation is based on the clinical and educational experiences of members of the Guideline Development Team, it is referred to as a good practice point. Good Practice Point: Where no evidence is available, best practice recommendations are made based on the experience of the Guideline Development Team or feedback from c onsultation within New Zealand. Further details of the proces ses that were followed are provided in Appendix 1. Overview 8 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Living Guideline process A Living Guideline process was established in 2009. This process ensures that the guideline is regularly updated and refined to reflect new research findings and changing user nee ds. Updates within the living guideline process are required when the recommendations in the first edition of the guideline are no longer considered valid in view of new evidence . A small multidisciplinary team form the Living Guideline Group (LGG), an adv isory group responsible for i dentifying topics for update, considering new evidence , and reporting on any implications for guideline recommendations. Membership of the LGG is listed in Appendix 2. Every year since 2009 , a topic within the guideline has been prioritised for update by the Living Guideline Group . A systematic review is undertaken involving the identification and critical appraisal of new research published since 2004, the date that final literature searches were conducted for the guideline's first edition . An assessment of the quality, quantity, consistency, applicability , and clinical impact of all the studies form s the body of evidence . This is considered by the LGG at a face -to-face meeting. The wording and evidence grading of relevant curre nt recommendations and good practice points in the guideline are reviewed and revised. New recommendations and good practice points are also developed. A comprehensive Supplementary Paper describing the systematic review and LGG decisions is prepared for e ach updated topic.12-18 These are published annually on the Ministry of Health (www.health.govt.nz/our from the first seven updates have been incorporated into this new edition of the guideline. Future topic updates will continue to be made available electonically via the Ministry of Health website. Marita Broadstock ( INSIGHT Research Ltd) prepares the systematic reviews and Supplementary Papers, and directs the living guideline process . The first three updates were undertaken under the oversight of the New Zealand Guidelines Group. The entire living guideline process is funded by the New Zealand Ministry of Health, and sponsored by the Ne w Zealand Ministry of Education. How to read the new edition The Living Guideline process leads to the development of revised and new recommendations and good practice points for each annual topic update. In this edition of the guideline, revisions for the first seven completed update topics have been incorporated into the tables . New recommendations and good practice points are indicated through the addition of a sub - level to the numbering (eg, new Recommendation 4.3.5a is inserted after existing Recommend ation 4.3.5). Summaries for revisions for each update, as well as the Living Guideline Group 's rationale and any additional supplementary text , are provided in Appendix 10 . The first edition of this guideline was prescient in recognising the movement towar d considering autism as a spectrum condition. In the guideline 's title and frequently throughout the text and recommendations, the term Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has been used. This terminology is consistent with the current version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, the DSM -5.18 In the DSM -5, subtype diagnoses of Asperger disorder, Autistic Disorder, Childhood Disintegrative Disorder (CDD), and Pervasive Developmental Disorder - Overview New Zealand Autism S pectrum Disorder Guideline 9 Not Otherwise Specified (PDD -NOS) are now replaced by the term Autism Spectrum Disorder or ASD. The implications of the DSM -5 for the guideline were considered by the Living Guideline Group in their S upplementary Paper16 (summarised in Appendix 10.5 ). In this edition of the guideline, references to previously used diagnostic subtypes have been retained to reflect their application in research studies, as well as their continued currency in the community. T he Livi ng Guideline Group advise that, in view of the DSM -5, where the terms Asperger syndrome and PDD -NOS are used in the Guideline they should be read as referring to ASD. Consultation To finalise the draft of the first edition of the New Zealand Autism Spectru m Disorder Guideline, a four -month written consultation process was undertaken from December 2006 to March 2007. Feedback was sought from across the health, education, disability and social service sectors. The consultation process involved a mail -out on request of the draft ASD Guideline and a submission booklet. These documents were also available on the Ministry of Health website, with links from the Ministry of Education website. At the same time, an expert peer review process was undertaken with nine i nternational experts in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The suggestions and references from both processes were analysed to determine whether they provided additional evidence to inform the recommendations of the guideline. Where appropriate, modifications and amendments were made to the draft ASD Guideline. A report on the analysis of 108 submissions received from the open consultation process was provided to all submitters on request. A full list of all individuals and organisations that consented to have their names published is provided in Appendix 3. A focused consultation process was also conducted for the annual updates as part of the living guideline process. Details are provided within each Living Guideline Group Supplementary Paper .12-18 Acknowledg ements The following individuals and groups made additional contributions to the development of the ASD Guideline to those listed in Appendix 2.

Overview New Zealand Autism S pectrum Disorder Guideline 11 Executive summary Based on recent overseas data, ASD (autism spectrum disorder) is thought to affect more than 40,000 New Zealanders. It imposes significant and often se rious disability on the individuals affected and creates major stresses for those who care for or educate them. Since its first description over 50 years ago, it has been the subject of intense research and a great deal is now known about how to ameliorate the disorder, although there is no known 'cure '. This guideline addresses identification, assessment, diagnosis, interventions and services for individuals with ASD. These topics are covered in separate parts of the guideline, according to the following structure: Part 1: Diagnosis and initial assessment of ASD Part 2: Support for individuals, families and carers Part 3: Education for learners with ASD Part 4: Treatment and management of ASD Part 5: Living in the community Part 6: Professional learning and development Part 7: Mori perspectives Part 8: Pacific peoples ' perspectives The term ASD is used to refer to a condition that affects communication, social interaction and adaptive behaviour functioning. In the DSM -518 four pervasive developmental disord er subcategories specified in the diagnostic manual 's predecessor, the DSM -IV,21 are now subsumed into one broad category of autism spectrum disorder. These subtypes were autistic disorder, Asperger 's disorder (Asperger syndrome), childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD), and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD -NOS). The name pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) has now been changed to Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD ), the term used throu ghout this g uideline (see Appendix 4 and Appendix 10.5 for details on diagnostic criteria and changes made under DSM -5). The spectrum of autism disorders is now recognised as covering a wide range of severity and intellectual ability. Those diagnosed with ASD all display (or have in their lifetimes displayed): impairment in social communication and social interaction restricted, repetitive patterns of behaviour, interests, or activities. These are all -encompassing features which cause clinically significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of current functioning , although their intensity may vary. Overview 12 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Part 1: Diagnosis and initial assessment of ASD Part 1 of this guideline focuses on the diagnosis and initial assessment of children, young people and adults with ASD. The earlier the diagnosis of ASD is made, the greater the impact early intervention has, resulting in fewer challenging behaviours and better outcomes for families and whnau. The identification of children with ASD usuall y occurs through parents and their general practitioner (GP) or, at a later stage, through a child's teachers. It is important that primary care professionals monitor developmental milestones at Well Child visits to ensure early identification. All health care and education professionals need to be responsive to alerting signals of possible ASD and be receptive to parental concerns about their children. Professional concerns about more able children with ASD may not develop until children are exposed to the greater social demands of early childhood education or the primary school environment. The guideline provides key signs for identifying ASD in children in separate age bands: 1 to 3 years and 4 to 8 years. Diagnosis is also important in young people in th eir teens and in adults, although for some of these people diagnosis may only be of academic interest. Others, however, may suffer undue stress, miss out on effective treatment options and receive inappropriate medical, psychiatric and educational interven tions if diagnosis is missed. Telling a person that they have been diagnosed with ASD should be undertaken sensitively, giving the person ample time to ask questions, to understand what is being said and to voice concerns. Families, whnau and support peop le may need to be involved in diagnosis disclosure, especially when a young person is involved. Assessment is the process of gathering information about the health, education and care needs of a person with ASD and his or her family. This results in an identification of needs and a plan of action to meet the identified needs. ASD is a developmental disorder. Its presentation will vary with age and will vary over time in any individual. In New Zealand, there is currently inconsistent and inequitable access t o assessment and diagnosis. Young people and adults have no clearly identified pathways for assessment. Multidisciplinary assessment through specialist ASD services is recommended for all people suspected of having ASD. The multidisciplinary team approach leads to more robust diagnosis and assessment, more accurate planning of future services and supports, and reduces repetition and redundancy in the assessment and diagnostic process. Professionals providing assessment and diagnostic services for children, young people and adults with possible ASD also need to fully consider other possible diagnoses (such as the differential diagnosis). Clinical judgment may be aided by the use of assessment tools, checklists and rating scales. Suggestions for diagnostic too ls and the role of cognitive assessment in individuals with ASD are found in Appendices 5 and 6. However, the applicability of diagnostic and assessment tools to a New Zealand population has not been established and research is required to determine this. Overview New Zealand Autism S pectrum Disorder Guideline 13 Key recommendations for diagnosis a nd initial assessment Grade 1. Early identification of children with autism spectrum disorder is essential. Early identification enables early intervention and is likely to lead to better function in later life. Early identification is achieved by: a. comprehensive developmental surveillance of all children so that deviations from normal development are recognised early b. valuing and addressing parental concerns about their child 's development c. prompt access to diag nostic services. B 2. All District Health Boards (DHBs) should have in place processes that ensure: a. referral pathways for children and adults who may have ASD or another developmental problem are clearly understood by professionals b. services are coor dinated within and across sectors c. multidisciplinary, multiagency assessments are provided d. all services are provided in a timely manner. C 3. All children suspected of having ASD or another developmental problem should have an audiology assessment. 4. Preferably, a multidisciplinary team of health care practitioners experienced in ASD should undertake diagnostic assessment of young people and adults suspected of having ASD. In the absence of an assessment team, a health care practitioner trained an d highly experienced in ASD may undertake diagnostic assessment. B 5. Diagnostic assessment of young people and adults should be comprehensive and involve the person concerned in interview and observation. C 5.1 Standardised ASD assessment interviews and schedules should be used . The intellectual, adaptive and cognitive skills associated with ASD should be seriously considered and, where possible and appropriate, formally assessed (see Appendix 10.5 ). B 6. Health care professionals must have a good under standing of the different forms of expression of ASD symptomatology across developmental stages and the symptomatology of common coexisting and alternative conditions. B Overview 14 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Part 2: Support for individuals, families and carers Part 2 deals with the needs of p eople who share their lives in personal and professional capacities with people with ASD. It also deals with the health support needs of people with ASD. The needs of people who share their lives with individuals with ASD are extensive. ASD is sometimes re garded as a 'hidden ' disability that affects every aspect of a person 's day -to-day life, including social inclusion. Typically, family and whnau are key people in the lives of the person with ASD. Their additional needs for support must be considered to ensure that they, too, enjoy social inclusion to the degree that other community members take for granted. Advocacy, rural and cultural issu es are also discussed. Provision of information on ASD is seen as crucial by parents and families. It should take a variety of forms and take into consideration differing needs, both geographic and cultural. Effective educational programmes for parents and families lead to improved outcomes both for people with A SD and their carers, families and whnau . The health care needs of a person with ASD can be complex and the appropriate management of these needs is exacerbated by the symptoms of ASD itself. Specific health care needs, such as poor dental hygiene, sleep disturbance, gastrointestinal sympt oms, sensory impairment and unpredictable drug reactions, underscore the importance of a comprehensive medical assessment for people with ASD. In New Zealand, the health care of children with ASD is usually monitored by a general practitioner (GP), paediat rician and/or other child -health professionals, but specialist input usually ceases when the person reaches adulthood. Some adults with ASD avoid visiting health or related services because of anxiety or fear, previous negative experiences and/or social an d communication difficulties. Thus, some people with ASD need support to manage their physical wellbeing appropriately, and health care professionals require knowledge of ASD and how it affects their clients to be able to provide optimum health care servic es. Since ASD is a heterogeneous condition with a wide range of impairment, age at diagnosis, intellectual ability, personal needs and health status, a range of customised supports and services will be needed. An individualised approach to service delivery is particularly important and the need for service coordination is paramount. These challenges will need to be addressed. Key recommendations for support for i ndividuals, families , whnau and carers Grade 1. The values, knowledge, preferences and cultura l perspectives of the family and whnau should be respected and evident in services and resources. C 2. ASD -related counselling and/or advocacy services and education should be available to all family members and carers. C 3. Family members need to know how to find and access information and support. Health authorities and support groups must work together to develop appropriate support services for adults and their partners to ensure sources of support and information are available. C Overview New Zealand Autism S pectrum Disorder Guideline 15 Key recommendations for support for i ndividuals, families , whnau and carers Grade 4. A key service t o support families and whnau is the provision of information about ASD. Information needs to be accessible to all people, including translated material, easy to-read versions and developmentally appropriate information. Support groups and government should work in close associa tion to ensure all information is kept up to date. C 5. Individualised support should be available to people with ASD who require assistance to manage their physical wellbeing and health care. C 6. Medical and health care practitioners should take into a ccount the symptomatology of their ASD clients/patients and adapt their practices and procedures accordingly. C 7. All children should be fully immunised including the MMR vaccine (Measles, Mumps and Rubella) in accordance with the New Zealand Immunisatio n schedule. There is no scientific evidence to support the contention that this vaccine has a role in the causation of ASD. A 8. Health -promotion campaigns should ensure that people with ASD are included as a specific target group. C 9. Sensory issues in people with ASD should be identified and appropriately assessed by occupational therapists with experience in ASD. These assessments should lead to specific recommendations. B 10. Methodologically rigorous research is needed to examine the effectiveness of current evaluation methods and treatments used to address sensory issues. B 11. Family support services should be flexible and timely. Families and service users should have direct involvement in planning and implementation of service provision. C C 12. A coordinated approach to planning and implementing services should be developed to meet the identified needs of an individual with ASD, including linkage or integration and coordination of multiple services. Overview 16 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Part 3: Education for learners with ASD Part 3 aims to provide best -evidence guidance for professionals who work with children and adolescents with ASD in educational settings. Overall, the evidence is clear that, regardless of the intervention, implementation across home, early childhood educati on, school and community settings is important to the outcomes. Given the diversity of individuals with ASD, a wide range of support and intervention is required. It is unlikely that there will ever be a single approach or solution that will meet the needs of all learners with ASD, so models should be chosen to fit the characteristics of the person and the learning situation. Most overseas educational intervention programmes are based on three broad models: discrete trial training (DTT), approaches that dra w on recent behavioural and developmental research, and developmental (social pragmatic) approaches. Some comprehensive programmes have used elements of all three models and they each have something to offer in certain situations. However, no one approach has been shown to be more effective than another. Currently, special education practice in New Zealand emphasises participation and development, rather than treatment or 'fixing ' the child. There is good agreement that best practice for learners with ASD i s not achieved by teaching in isolated settings away from other children, and that the quality of an intervention is at least as important as its duration. Generalisation of learning is crucial and is best achieved by working collaboratively with both teac hers and parents. Other characteristics of successful learning programmes are also discussed. Section 3.2 looks in detail at a number of different curriculum areas for children and young people with ASD in the educational setting and how they influence lea rning. It covers: communication and literacy skills social development sensori -motor development cognitive development and thinking skills self-management skills and addressing challenging behaviour. For each of these areas, the ASD Guideline assesses the evidence for effective interventions and the implications for professional practice and the classroom. Strategies for supporting young people in secondary school are also discussed. The decision that parents must make about where to place their child with ASD within an educational setting is important and parents need to be given balanced information about the different options. Members of staff need to have a positive attitude, expertise in ASD, and understanding and willingness to work in a team with the family /whnau . Transitions for learners with ASD need to be carefully planned to minimise stress. Overview New Zealand Autism S pectrum Disorder Guideline 17 Key recommendations for education for learners with ASD Grade 1. Interventions should start early, as soon as significant developmental delay is recognised, and be proactive. The child or young person 's programme should be individualised and designed to engage the child or young person and provide a highly supportive environment. B 2. Services should be available to ensure a young child is appropriately enga ged across a variety of home, educational and community settings in goal -directed activities for 15 to 25 hours per week. B 3. Formal assessments should always be supplemented by informal assessments which include observations across a variety of setting s and activities and interviews with significant adults. C 4. Generalisation and maintenance needs to be carefully planned. The learning of new skills should take place in the child or young person 's usual environment, ie, with their usual carers and teac hers, and with access to peers who do not have ASD. B 5. There is no evidence that any single model is effective for teaching every goal to all children with ASD. Models should be chosen to fit the characteristics of the child and the learning situation. B 6. Spontaneous communication, socialisation and play goals should be a priority. A 7. The child or young person 's particular interests should be incorporated whenever possible. C 8. Children and young people should receive carefully planned and system atic instruction tailored to their individual needs and abilities. B 9. Interventions should be monitored and evaluated on an ongoing basis. Where there is no evidence of progress within a few months, changes should be made to the curriculum or interventi on goals, the time set aside for instruction, the intensity of the instruction (such as lower teacher -child ratios) or increasing consultation and support for staff. A 10. Educational interventions should incorporate principles of positive behaviour suppo rt, particularly a focus on understanding the function of the child 's or young person 's behaviour. A 11. All transitions for students with ASD should be carefully planned and the child or young person and the new environment carefully prepared. B Overview 18 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Part 4: Treatment and management of ASD Part 4 covers the management of behavioural, emotional and mental health difficulties that can be experienced by children, young people and adults with ASD. Although some of these difficulties can be prevented or minimised by interventions with a totally educational component, other interventions with a different focus may also be required to manage these particular difficulties in people with ASD. People with ASD are at risk of developing behavioural and emotional difficult ies from childhood. Once problem behaviours have become established, they are not likely to decrease without intervention and are more likely to worsen than improve. Problem minimisation and avoidance early in life is essential. Long -term difficulties may arise if the communicative, social and ritualistic/obsessive aspects of ASD are not attended to. The first step in treatment of behavioural, emotional and mental health problems is comprehensive assessment which takes into account the family, whnau , social and cultural context. Components of comprehensive treatment plans include those that address behavioural needs, educational interventions, psychosocial treatments, communication and the suitability (or not) of medication. The mainstays of tr eatment are supportive, educational and behavioural approaches. No medication has been identified as a cure for ASD and the use of behavioural and environmental strategies for managing challenging behaviour should always be considered before using pharmaco therapy. However, a number of medications may be helpful in significantly improving various target symptoms and associated conditions. There is very limited information on long -term safety, particularly of some of the newer medications and there are additi onal challenges when the person with ASD has a co -morbidity. When prescribing medications, clinicians should consult other appropriate references for comprehensive information on adverse effects and interactions. Clinicians prescribing these drugs need to keep up to date with current literature. Even after the use of well -implemented behavioural strategies or medications, a small number of people with ASD will develop serious or dangerous behaviours. Strategies for these situations are discussed. The role o f clinical services is also outlined. Key recommendations for treatment and management of ASD Grade 1. Treatment should encourage functional development, teach skills for independent living , and minimise stress for the person with ASD , and their family an d whnau. B 2. Pre-treatment assessments should gather detailed information on behavioural, emotional and mental health difficulties, address differential diagnosis, screen for medical conditions and address environmental issues. B 3. Treatment plans sho uld be comprehensive, and include behavioural needs, educational interventions, psychosocial treatments, communication, environmental and systems issues and the suitability (or not) of medication. B 4. Professionals, people with ASD, family, whnau and ca rers should work together to evaluate treatment approaches before and during implementation. C Overview New Zealand Autism S pectrum Disorder Guideline 19 Key recommendations for treatment and management of ASD Grade 4.1 Facilitated and structured social skills groups should be considered for high functioning children and young people with ASD ( see Appendix 10.6 ). B 5. All behavioural interventions should be of good quality and incorporate the following principles: person -centred planning, functional assessment, positive intervention strategies, multifaceted interventions, focus on environment, meaningful outcomes, focus on ecological validity and systems -level intervention. C 5.1 Interventions and strategies based on applied behaviour analysis (ABA) principles should be considered for all children with ASD (see Appendix 10.1). A 5.2 Early intensive behavioural intervention (EIBI) should be considered as a treatment of value for young children with ASD to improve outcomes such as cognitive ability, language skills, and adaptive behaviour (see Appendix 10.1). B 6. The feasibility of establishing publicly funded, ASD -specific behavioural services should be investigated. C 7. SSRIs (eg, fluoxetine) may be effective for some children with ASD and high anxiety and/or obsessive symptoms. However, in the absence of quality evidence, these drugs should be used with caution and care ful monitoring. There is insufficient evidence to make any recommendation in relation to the use of other types of antidepressants. B 8. The antipsychotic medication risperidone is effective in reducing aggressive behaviour, irritability and self -injuriou s behaviour in children with ASD. It should be used with caution because of the high risk of adverse effects and the uncertainty about long -term effects. Monitoring for side effects should be carried out on a regular basis. B 9. A number of other medicati ons may be helpful in significantly improving various target symptoms and associated conditions. The choice of medication will be guided by the clinician 's assessment of the symptom to be targeted by the intervention. Clinicians and interested others shoul d refer to the full discussion of pharmacotherapy in ASD in the guideline. C 10. When severe behaviours are evident, people with ASD need to be assessed for co -morbid conditions such as seizures, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety di sorders, depression, and gastrointestinal problems ( see Appendix 10.4 ). C 11. In severe or life -threatening situations, medication may be the optimum therapy. C Overview 20 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Key recommendations for treatment and management of ASD Grade IMPORTANT NOTE FOR PRESCRIBERS: As prescribing information may change during the currency of this guideline, we have deliberately not provided full information about the status of medications in relation to registration, funding and manufacturers ' recommendations. All prescribers must ensure that they are informed of current information in relatio n to the medications that they use, and should be aware when they are using medications that are 'off-label '. All medications should be used with caution and patients should be carefully monitored while taking medication. Clinicians are expected to prescri be safely and should be knowledgeable about potential interactions. In particular, prescribers need to keep up to date with current literature, especially in relation to newly reported adverse effects, and 'black box ' warnings. C Part 5: Living in the com munity Part 5 identifies the support and transition needs of people with ASD and their families and whnau as they relate to community living. This is mostly focused on older children, adolescents and adults with ASD. Transition from high school to further education and/or work (paid and unpaid), and from these activities to retirement, can cause significant stress and anxiety for the person with ASD. The transition from secondary school into further and post -compulsory education should be carefully planned , with support needs clearly identified. Providers of further education need to have knowledge of the specific educational needs of people with ASD to maximise the opportunity for educational success. Young people and adults with ASD often experience diffi culty securing and maintaining work. The work prospects and experiences of people with ASD improve if their ASD characteristics (both as strengths and as support needs) and cognitive ability are taken into account. Positive work outcomes (eg, increased cha nces of finding work, maintaining work and having good working relationships) for people with ASD (including those with intellectual disability) are more likely when best practice supported employment services are involved. These services can also help emp loyers to adopt more positive and flexible attitudes towards their employees with ASD. For some people with ASD, further education and/or work may not be a goal. For these people, access to meaningful daytime activities and opportunities to participate in recreation and leisure options are important. Recreation is a powerful tool for promoting independent functioning, community inclusion and proficiency of life skills. Common barriers to participation for people with ASD include negative community attitudes , lack of support, difficulties in communication and low income. Strategies to promote community participation are discussed, together with the particular difficulties in exploring recreation options experienced by children, adolescents and adults with ASD . Overview New Zealand Autism S pectrum Disorder Guideline 21 It is commonly believed that people with ASD and other disabilities have a higher likelihood of contact with the police, courts and criminal justice system than other people, but there is little real evidence of this. People with disabilities have an inc reased risk of being victims of crimes, but there is no evidence of an association of people with ASD with criminal behaviour. Given the nature of ASD, young people and adults with ASD are likely to experience difficulties when in contact with the police, courts and the criminal justice system , and they require particular support needs to prevent inadvertent victimisation and undermining of legal and criminal justice processes. The guideline provides advice for the person with ASD when having contact with t he police, advice for the family and whnau and support persons of young people and adults with ASD when having contact with the police and courts, and ASD -specific knowledge for police, courts and criminal justice personnel. Key recommendations for livin g in the community Grade 1. Careful and timely attention should be paid to planning for people with ASD leaving school and moving into further and post -compulsory education, work (paid or unpaid) or vocational services. C 2. Providers of further and post -compulsory education should ensure that their members of staff are aware of the specific educational needs of people with ASD. C 3. Work (paid and unpaid) should be considered an option for all people with ASD, regardless of their intellectual ability. Any k nown support needs of people with ASD, including cognitive ability, should be taken into account when transitioning into any work environment . Supported employment service s for people with ASD should be developed (see Appendix 10.3). B 4. Vocational s ervices of a high standard should be available to people with ASD who are not ready or able to access post -compulsory education and work. B 5. All children and adults with ASD should have access to leisure facilities and meaningful activity tailored to th eir needs and interests, supported by person -centred plans designed by staff who have received specialist education for the role using strategies to promote social inclusion. Plans should be regularly evaluated. B 6. Leisure and recreation planning should be included in a student/young person 's transition programme and this information shared with post - school providers. C 7. Where a child or young person is provided with a respite service, the environment needs to be structured and predictable, and it nee ds to support the function of the child in communication, personal independence and safe leisure skills. B 8. People having regular contact with children and young people with ASD should be screened for safety, and paid staff should be appropriately train ed, supported and supervised. C Overview 22 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Key recommendations for livin g in the community Grade 9. People with ASD should be taught social skills and be educated in community safety, strategies to keep safe when out at night and what to do if they are abused. C 10. If people with ASD are abused, they should receive s ervices from Child, Youth and Family (CYF), Victim Support, Accident Compensation Corporation ( ACC Sensitive Claims Unit) and other similar agencies. C 11. Families, whnau, carers and professionals should ensure that measures are undertaken during the ch ildhood of the person with ASD to prevent the characteristics of ASD developing into behaviour that leads to victimisation or criminal offending. C 12. Young people and adults with ASD should be taught their legal rights , and be prepared in advance with i nformation should they ever have contact with the police and legal authorities . Appropriate resources and training should be developed to assist with this. C 13. People with ASD involved in disputes within the Family Court are advised to seek assistance f rom solicitors and advocacy services with knowledge and experience in ASD. C Part 6 : Professional learning and development Part 6 discusses the professional learning and development needs of the many different individuals who interact with and provide ser vices for people with ASD. Parents, specialists, education, health and other disability professionals and paraprofessionals who work or live with individuals with ASD can improve the outcomes for those individuals if they have the necessary skills develope d through education. This education will range from awareness -raising to specialised education. Some principles of effective professional learning and development are discussed. It is recommended that professional learning and development in ASD be coordin ated nationally and standards and required competencies be developed. Key recommendations for profes sional learning and development Grade 1. All professionals who come into contact with children, whether in health care services, early childhood education centres or primary schools should receive training on 'alerting signals ' of possible ASD. C 2. Education and training of local health care professionals in the administration of standardised autism, Asperger syndrome and ASD assessment interviews and sche dules should be provided. When reporting the results of ASD -specific tests, caution should be exercised as New Zealand norms have not yet been established. C 3. Norms should be developed for autism, Asperger syndrome and ASD assessment tools specifically for the New Zealand population. C Overview New Zealand Autism S pectrum Disorder Guideline 23 Key recommendations for profes sional learning and development Grade 4. Professional education curricula for people working in health, education and social services should include knowledge and awareness of the difficulties partners of those with ASD may experience. C 5. Social service st aff members should have adequate education in child - welfare issues relating to parents who have ASD. C 6. Professional learning and development should be consistent with evidence and principles of quality provision. B 7. Agencies should ensure that memb ers of staff have current and ongoing good quality education in ASD and those agency procedures should incorporate best practice in ASD. C 8. Different professional groups and multidisciplinary teams should be given the opportunity to train together. C 9. In addition to workshops and seminars, all professionals and paraprofessionals who are learning new skills should be offered opportunities for practice, coaching and feedback. C 10. Distance learning opportunities should be developed for those working away from main centres. C 11. Priority for professional learning and development should be given to those who provide a specialist or consultancy service and support and education to others. B 12. Identification, education and support of ASD consultant p ractitioners should be a priority in each region. Consultant practitioners should be skilled in evaluating programmes and translating research into practice. 13. The development of a coordinated national plan for professional learning and development s hould be undertaken. This should include standards for professional learning and development and competencies for professional roles. Overview 24 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Part 7 : Mori perspectives Part 7 identifies the issues of concern to Mori. A full literature search was undertaken to identify evidence -based information relevant to Mori and ASD. As a complement to this, five hui were conducted throughout New Zealand in 2005 to provide an opportunity for Mori to contribute their views and perspectives about ASD. From these hui, a descriptive analysis identifying the main issues raised was undertaken. Recommendations were then developed on the basis of the findings of the litera ture review and the main themes from the hui. Key recommendations for M ori perspectives 1. Information packages in appropriate and relevant language about ASD using a range of media should be developed. This information could be distributed through Mor i, mainstream and community providers of health, education and disabili ty services. 2. The appointment of a kaiarahi (guide) who would work in conjunction with, and be supported across, the health, education and disabilities sectors involved with ASD sh ould be considered. 3. A programme of empirical research that would provide baseline information about Mori and ASD should be developed. Part 8 : Pacific peoples ' perspectives Part 8 identifies the issues of concern to Pacific peoples. A pan -Pacific approach is taken to highlight broad principles, although the cultural diversity of Pacific cultures is acknowledged. Recommendations were developed from public reports, guidelines, published statistics and consultation through a fono. Key recommendations for Pacific peoples ' perspectives 1. A programme of research that would provide baseline information regarding ASD and Pacif ic peoples should be developed. 2. A targeted recruitment and development strategy to support increasing the capacity and capa bility of the Pacific ASD -related workforce should be developed. 3. A strategy should be developed aimed at improving the cultural competency of the mainstream workforce to acquire knowledge and understanding of Pacific cultural values and world views a nd appropriately apply this to their work. Overview New Zealand Autism S pectrum Disorder Guideline 25 Introduction Background People with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have often remained undiagnosed and unsupported in New Zealand communities. However, there is an increasing awareness of ASD among health, education and social service professionals, parents and the general public. A nationally consistent standard of practice for the assessment, diagnosis and management of children, young people and adults with this condition should improve access to health, education and social service professionals. Definition Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a condition that affects communication, social interaction and adaptive behaviour functioning. As specified in the current version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders , the DSM -5,18 all people who are diagnosed with ASD share characteristics in two domains: impairment in social communication or social reciprocity , and impairment in restricted, repetit ive patterns of behaviour. Although these features are characteristic of all people with ASD, it is a very heterogeneous condition affecting a very diverse group of individuals with a wide range of severity , disability and intellectual function. The divers e support needs expressed by people across the autism spectrum require that a wide range of services and approaches be employed. In the latest edition of the diagnostic manual DSM -5,18 four pervasive development al disorder subcategories (specified in the manual 's predecessor, the DSM -IV)21 were subsumed into one broad category of autism spectrum disorder. The subsumed subtypes were autistic disorder, Asperger 's disorde r (Asperger syndrome), childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD), and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD -NOS). The name pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) has been changed to A utism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The term ASD is used widely internationally and this guideline's first edition was prescient in recognising the movement toward considering autism as a spectrum condition. Increasingly people in the autism community prefer to use identify -first language to refer to themselves as being autistic, autists or Aspies. This recognises autism as a central part of their identity, rather than being a person \"with autism\". Others prefer to describe themselves as being on the spectrum, or as having autism or Asperger's. ASD is sometimes defined as autism spectrum difference rather than disorder. In the UK, the term Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC) is gaining favour as an official term instead of ASD. For clarity and consistency with the first edition of the guideline, the acronym ASD is re tained in this edition to capture all of these varied terms for autism. However it is recognised that autistics have the right to self-refer and be referred to as they choose. It is understood that the term s \"high functioning \" and \"low functioning \" to desc ribe groups of people with ASD is considered unhelpful and divisive by many on the autism spectum. In this guideline, the term \"high functioning \" has sometimes been used (when citing research) to define people with higher cognitive functioning either as es tablished by intelligence tests (generally indicated by full IQ scores of 70 or above), or through the diagnosis of \"high -functioning autism \" or Asperger syndrome (under DSM -IV criteria). It is acknowledged that th ese distinctions may no longer be used cli nically in light of the removal of Asperger syndrome as a separate diagnostic classification in DSM -5.18 Overview 26 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Prevalence There is no definitive information on the prevalence and incidence of ASD in New Zealand. Recent data (2006) from the United Kingdom reporte d a total prevalence of all ASDs of 116.1 per 10,000 children, with a prevalence of autism of 38.9 per 10,000 children .22 Boys are affected about four times more frequently than girls .23 There is a wide range of prevalence estimates which points to the need for earlier and more accurate identification of the symptoms of ASD. The earlier the disorder is diagnosed, the sooner the child can be helped with interventions. T here is evidence from overseas studies that many children with significant ASD are not being identified until after they start school .24 Generalising these prevalence data across the whole population of 4 millio n means that it is estimated there are more than 40,000 individuals in New Zealand who have ASD, although many adults may not have received a diagnosis. Considering the impact on families and others in contact with these individuals, ASD represents a signi ficant health, educational and social issue in New Zealand that needs addressing with adequate service provision. There is currently international indications that the incidence of ASD may be rising. It is not clear whether this change is due to an actual increase in incidence, or to increased awareness, or to changes in interpretation of the diagnostic criteria. There is ongoing research into autism incidence, prevalence and the reasons for these changes. In planning services, the figures quoted in this guideline should be regarded as conservative. Scope This guideline addresses all aspects of ASD, including diagnosis and assessment, educational provision and other interventions and services that provide support for individuals and their families and whnau . The recommendations are based on the best evidence currently available, with the broad purpose of assisting informed decision -making to improve the health, educational and social outcomes for individuals with ASD. Throughout the ASD Guideline, the emphas is is on services being provided in a way that focuses on the needs of the child or adult in a family -centred context. The scope of the guideline is comprehensive and no international guideline has been found with such a broad scope. The breadth of this gu ideline has required an intersectoral approach to development to ensure that health, educational, social and all other relevant aspects are considered. Impact analysis An impact analysis has been funded by the Ministries of Health and Education. The primar y purpose is to assess the likely impact of implementing the key recommendations in the guideline, which in turn will assist government decisions regarding its implementation. To achieve this, the impact analysis used objective and prospective analysis, identified and prioritised the recommendations at a thematic level, and acknowledged the challenges for consideration in planning implementation. More specifically, the impact analysis involved the following: a survey of current service provision, supplement ed with interviews and focus group meetings identification of gaps in services and changes that would be required for implementation an outline of legislation and policy implications a thematic analysis of actions required to implement key recommendations.

Part 1: Diagnosis and initial assessment of ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 29 Part 1 Diagn osis and initial assessment of ASD \"My son is autistic. He struggles to communicate.\" Part 1: Diagnosis and initial assessment of ASD 30 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Part 1 Diagnosis and initial assessment of ASD This section of the ASD Guideline covers the princi ples of identification, diagnosis and initial assessment of individuals with ASD. The earlier the diagnosis of ASD is made, the more impact early intervention has, resulting in fewer challenging behaviours and better outcomes for families .25 For the purposes of assessment and diag nosis in children, this guideline divides the population of children into three age groups, according to developmental stage and most likely mode of presentation to services. Ages 1 to 3 years - children who present at this age usually have significant language delay and behavioural issues. Referral is usually to a paediatrician, a child development service or specialised early intervention service provider. Ages 4 to 8 years - children who present at this age may have milder symptoms of autism spectrum dis order or may have been missed for earlier diagnosis. Greater than eight years - children who present at this age usually present to Child, Adolescent and Family Mental Health Services with emotional or behavioural issues. Alternatively, they may present wi th school performance difficulties to Special Education Needs Coordinators (SENCOs), Resource Teachers of Learning and Behaviour (RTLBs), Ministry of Education, Special Education or paediatricians. Occasionally, they may present via the courts. Although ea rly intervention may have been undertaken because of concerns about learning and development, most children require a diagnosis to access appropriate management modalities and support services, and to assist the family /whnau with appropriate information t o plan their lives. It is therefore essential to diagnose those children with an autism spectrum disorder early in order to provide early intervention and family /whnau support. International research demonstrates improved cognitive and functional outcomes for children who were diagnosed at younger ages and who then received appropriate early intervention educational support .25 Experienced clinicians are able to make the diagnosis in children with moderate to sev ere ASD by the age of two or three years. The children with less severe ASD may not come to attention until they are at early childhood education services or at school. These children tend to have better language skills but can still have significant needs . Much of the literature on ASD centres on the early diagnosis and early intervention of young children with ASD. However, there are also undiagnosed young people and adults with ASD. Some seem to manage well26 27 while other undiagnosed people and their families endure great stress, and they can be misunderstood, blamed, teased, bullied, poorly supported and miss out on effective treatment options ,28 or receive inappropriate medical, psychiatric and educational interventions. Some receive psychiatric or intellectual disability services or both, yet without the recognition of their ASD, services are not appropriately tailored to their individual needs ( see section 4.8 : Mental health, forensic and disability services ). For some individuals who have not received an ASD diagnosis, their behaviour may lead to legal difficulties. Should their difficulties not be appropriately ident ified and taken into account as a mitigating factor, an inappropriate custodial sentence may result (see section 5.3 : Contact with the justice system ). Part 1: Diagnosis and initial assessment of ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 31 ASD advocacy agencies ,29 30 professionals26 28 31 32 and published accounts by people with ASD33 34 suggest that the assessment and diagnosis of young people and adults with ASD is important because it: prevents or rectifies misdiagnosis assists in the ide ntification of appropriate educational options and placements assists in vocational choice, and identifies support which may facilitate vocational success provides access to appropriate resources, support and assistance enables appropriate environmental support facilitates contact with other people with ASD assists in the identification of support needs of families and whnau helps people with ASD to understand themselves helps people with ASD to understand other people helps other people to understand the person with ASD, including families, whnau , partners and employers prevents future problems minimises isolation by providing access to the ASD community may lead to the identification of the broader phenotype of ASD in family members. Formal criteria for the identification and diagnosis of people with ASD are provided in Appendix 4 with respect to the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM -IV-TR). These criteria were revised in the latest version, the DSM -518. Imp lications of these changes for the guideline were considered by the Living Guideline Group and are summarised in Appendix 10 .5. Part 1: Diagnosis and initial assessment of ASD 32 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 1.1 Identification and diagnosis Summary of recommendations Recommendations: Grade 1.1.1 Early identification of children with autism spectrum disorder is essential. Early identification enables early intervention and is likely to lead to better function in later life. B 1.1.2 A formal whole population screening programme for the identification of ASD is not recommended. B 1.1.3 Health and education professionals should take regular opportunities (at least at 8 -12 months, 2 -3 years and 4 -5 years) to discuss the child's development with parents as part of 'surveillance' to detect and respond rapidly to any developmental concerns. C 1.1.4 Age of detection/diagnosis of all developmental problems, including ASD as a specified disorder, should be audited. C 1.1.5 Parental inquiries regarding developmental concerns about their child must be taken seriously and addressed appropriately . B Good Practice Points: 1.1.6 At each health or educational professional encounter, concerns should be elicited regarding child development. 1.1.7 All health and education professionals involved in care of children should know referral pathways for those children about whom concerns are raised. The benefits of the early identification of children with ASD are well recognised by parents and professionals (Recommendation 1.1.1 ). Identification of some health conditions is undertaken by 'screenin g', which is defined as the formal identification of a previously unrecognised disease or condition by the application of tests, examinations or other procedures that can be applied to a whole population. However, the United Kingdom National Autism Plan fo r Children (NAPC) review of the literature found no supporting evidence for implementation of a population - screening tool for identification of people with ASD11 (Recommendation 1.1.2 ). Their findings supported the consensus that parents or professionals with knowledge of normal development can identify ASD. Early identification of ASD can only take place with regular developmental surveillance by parents and/or health and early education professionals. Part 1: Diagnosis and initial assessment of ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 33 1.1.a Early childhood Early surveillance The Tamariki Ora Schedule currently includes developmental surveillance which is undertaken at all contacts with a Well Child nurse.35 Developmental surveillance is a shared paren t-health professional activity which uses both parties' knowledge about the child to monitor the child's ongoing development. On occasions, the surveillance process may identify children whose developmental progress varies significantly from the expected p athway. Regular surveillance enables early identification of areas of developmental concern. To facilitate early identification of children with ASD, best practice in New Zealand requires adherence to procedures currently employed by health care practition ers: proactive monitoring, or surveillance, for developmental milestones at all Well Child visits eliciting parental or carer concerns about development and behaviour at each contact with a health care (or education) professional (as recommended in the Wel l Child Handbook) .35 This requires that all professional encounters with young children, including contacts with daycare providers and early childhood teachers, should be viewed as opportunities to elicit devel opmental information and concerns (Recommendations 1.1.3 and 1.1.4, Good Practice Point 1.1.6 and 6.1 Professional learning and development ). Although many parents are aware by 18 months that their child is different, formal diagnosis of autism has often b een delayed in the past .36 Retrospective surveys in the United Kingdom have indicated that 60% of parents report that they were first to suspect a problem, compared with 10% who remembered that it was the health visitor, while for 7% it was the school staff who first acknowledged concern .37 Although37 skilled community health and education staff can assist parents in the recognition of a problem, many parents comment that the response of professionals to their expressed concerns was to either offer inappropriate reassurance or give the impression that the parents were being 'over anxious '. Although similar information is unav ailable in New Zealand, the experience of those working in the area of ASD suggests that the situation is likely to be no different. Studies38-40 show that a valid cl inical diagnosis can often be made by the time the child is aged 2 to 3 years. However, diagnosis is more difficult in young children who are more able, and in those with significant general developmental delay (eg, a mental age below one year). The opinio n of the committee which developed the NAPC in the United Kingdom, supported by experience in New Zealand, is that there have been a number of barriers to early diagnosis .11 These include: failure to recognise s ymptoms, denial that there may be a problem, failure to get a referral, lengthy waiting time for an appointment, inadequately trained staff for diagnosis and separate waiting lists for each professional group. Successful identification of ASD in young children and the effectiveness of intervention programmes are dependent on the ability of primary care providers to monitor children 's development and initiate referrals in a timely manner. Well Child nurses, general practitioners (GPs) and other members of th e primary health care team are therefore central to early identification. Consequently, the importance of primary care practitioners cannot be overemphasised. This has Part 1: Diagnosis and initial assessment of ASD 34 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline implications for the education of primary care health providers. Indeed, all professiona ls who come into contact with children, whether in health care services, early childhood education centres or primary schools, should receive training in 'alerting signals ' of possible ASD (Recommendation 6.1, Professional learning and development ). Elicit ing, valuing and addressing parental concerns Parents of children with ASD often note features that were markedly different during the child 's first two years of life. Since parents are experts about their children, eliciting and valuing parental concerns is imperative. Studies have shown that when parents raise developmental concerns, some primary care practitioners respond either by waiting to see if the delays will resolve spontaneously or by discounting parental observations .41 While a small number of children do 'catch up ' without formal intervention, this approach will delay identification and treatment of children with ASD who could substantially benefit from earlier identification and treatment (Recommenda tion 1.1.5 ). Assuring appropriate referral of a child with possible ASD Throughout New Zealand there is no consistent referral and assessment pathway for children with ASD (or indeed children with other developmental problems). Multiple potential referral points exist, such as Child Development Services or Ministry of Education, Special Education, but there is no single service with the designated overall responsibility for coordinating assessments. This leads to confusion amongst parents and primary health care providers about what to do when a child is identified as showing some autistic features (Good Practice Point 1.1.7 ). There are genetic factors in the causation of autism, but as yet there is limited information on how these genetic factors work and e ven more limited information on potential gene -environment interactions. There are a small number of single gene disorders which are associated with autistic symptoms. These include fragile X, Rett syndrome and tuberose sclerosis. Evaluation for genetic di sorders is outside the scope of this guideline. Clinicians should consider the possibility and importance of genetic factors for each individual and carry out appropriate investigations, as indicated by clinical assessment. Clinicians should provide geneti c advice where indicated and ensure onward referral, where necessary. Children aged 1 to 3 years In the first year of life, there are usually no clear discriminating features42 and delays/impairments in developm ent may not necessarily be recognised by either parents or professionals. Any parental concerns around the infant 's development or the way the infant responds need to be acknowledged by professionals and discussed fully with the parents. At this age, initi al discussion is likely to be with a primary care health professional, but may also be with an early childhood education provider. Some children between the ages of 13 -23 months may lose developmental skills. As an example, it may be reported that they sto p using words, lose eye contact and regress in relation to social skills. The following table gives information on key signs which should indicate referral for children aged 1 to 3 years. Part 1: Diagnosis and initial assessment of ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 35 Table 1.1: Key signs for identification of children 1 -3 years with ASD C All children with ANY of the following findings MUST be referred for a general developmental assessment: no babble, pointing to or showing of objects or other gesture by 12 months no meaningful single words by 18 months43 no two -word spontaneous (non -echoed or imitated) phrases by 24 months ANY loss of any language or social skills at ANY age .44 45 Key signs in child ren aged 1 -3 years (which should prompt referral for a developmental assessment (modified from the NAPC Guideline )):11 40 Social impairments: lack of social smile and lack of eye contact lack of imitation of actions (eg, clapping) deficits in joint attention, such as lack of showing to share interest or involving others in joint play with toys or other objects lack of interest in other children or odd approaches to oth er children minimal recognition or responsiveness to another 's happiness or distress not wanting to be picked up and cuddled odd relationships with adults (either too friendly or distant) limited variety of imaginative play lack of pretend play, especially involving social imagination (ie, not joining with others in shared imaginary games) appearing to be 'in his/her own world ' failure to initiate simple play with others or participate in early social games preference for solitary play activities. Communica tion impairments: impairment in language development, especially comprehension unusual use of language poor response to name deficient non -verbal communication (eg, lack of pointing and difficulty following the pointing of others) failure to smile socially to share enjoyment and respond to the smiling of others abnormalities in language development, including muteness, odd or inappropriate intonation patterns, persistent echolalia, reference to self as 'you' or 'she/he ' beyond three years, unusual vocabular y for child 's age/social group limited use of language for communication and/or tendency to talk freely only about specific topics. Part 1: Diagnosis and initial assessment of ASD 36 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Table 1.1: Key signs for identification of children 1 -3 years with ASD C Impairment of interests, activities and other behaviours: over -liking for sameness and/or inability to cope with changes es pecially in unstructured setting repetitive play with toys (eg, lining up objects or turning light switches on and off, regardless of scolding) over -attentiveness to small visual details (eg, fascination with spinning wheels) repetitive motor mannerisms lack of flexible, cooperative imaginative play or creativity (although certain imaginary scenarios, such as those copied from videos or cartoons may be frequently re -enacted alone) difficulty in organising self in relation to unstructured space (eg, hugging the perimeter of playgrounds, halls). Other factors which may support a diagnosis of ASD: Over - or under -sensitivity to: - sound (eg, has trouble keeping on task with background noise, responds negatively to unexpected/loud noises) - touch (eg, discomfort duri ng grooming, avoids getting messy, picky eater, especially regarding certain textures) - movement (eg, becomes anxious or distressed when feet leave the ground, or twirls/spins/rocks self frequently during the day) - visual stimuli (eg, prefers to be in the da rk, feels discomfort or avoids bright lights) - smells (eg, seeks out certain smells). Note: These factors in isolation are not indicative of ASD. They are intended to alert professionals to think about the possibility of ASD - whether and when they make a r eferral will d epend on the overall situation. Part 1: Diagnosis and initial assessment of ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 37 Children aged 4 to 8 years Professional concerns about more able children with ASD may not develop until children are exposed to the greater social demands of the early childhood education service or primary school environment. Indeed, prior to school entry, some may have been thought to be well advanced in their development, because of their special interests and precocious vocabulary. The following features should alert teachers and others to the possibilit y of ASD. The features described for younger children are also applicable to this age group. Presence of these features should trigger discussion with parents and the possible implementation of the local referral pathway. Table 1.2: Key signs in children a ged 4 -8 years with ASD (modified from the NAPC Guideline )11 C 1. Communication impairments: abnormalities in language development, including muteness, odd or inappropriate intonation patterns, persistent echola lia, reference to self as 'you' or 'she/he ' beyond 3 years, unusual vocabulary for child 's age/social group limited use of language for communication and/or tendency to talk freely only about specific topics. 2. Social impairments: inability to join in wit h the play of other children, or inappropriate attempts at joint play (may manifest as aggressive or disruptive behaviour) lack of awareness of classroom 'norms ' (criticising teachers; overt unwillingness to cooperate in classroom activities; inability to appreciate/follow current trends, eg, with regard to other children 's dress, style of speech, interests etc) easily overwhelmed by social and other stimulation failure to relate normally to adults (too intense/no relationship) showing extreme reactions to invasion of personal space and extreme resistance to being 'hurried '. 3. Impairment of interests, activities and behaviours: lack of flexible, cooperative imaginative play/creativity (although certain imaginary scenarios, eg, copied from videos or cartoons , may be frequently re -enacted alone) difficulty in organising self in relation to unstructured space (eg, hugging the perimeter of playgrounds, halls) inability to cope with change or unstructured situations, even ones that other children enjoy (such as s chool trips, teachers being away etc) preoccupation with restricted patterns of interest that are abnormal either in intensity or focus; over -attention to parts of objects. Part 1: Diagnosis and initial assessment of ASD 38 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Table 1.2: Key signs in children a ged 4 -8 years with ASD (modified from the NAPC Guideline )11 C 4. Other factors which may support a diagnosis of ASD: unusual profile of skills/d eficits (eg, social and motor skills very poorly developed, whilst general knowledge, reading or vocabulary skills are well above chronological/mental age) any other evidence of odd behaviours, including over -or-under -sensitivity to sound (eg, has trouble functioning when there is noise around), touch (eg, difficulties standing in line or close to others, avoids getting messy, or excessively touches people and objects), movement (eg, avoids playground equipment or moving toys, or seeks all kind of movement, and this interferes with daily routines), visual stimuli (eg, prefers to be in the dark, discomfort or avoids bright lights) or smells (eg, deliberately smells objects) unusual responses to movement (eg, toe walking and hand flapping) unusual responses to pain any significant history of loss of skills. No criteria were provided in the NAPC Guideline to guide referral for diagnosis in children older than eight years. Guidance for diagnosis of older children can be found in the next section. 1.1.b Young peo ple and adults Four factors that commonly prompt initial referral for diagnosis of children beyond childhood include :41 46 symptom changes and diagnostic dilemmas - where children formerly diagnosed with conditions such as PDD -NOS have matured, their behavioural and emotional characteristics have altered, and, consequently, the original diagnosis is being re -evaluated social deficits - where the differences in social b ehaviour between the person in question and same -age peers has become more obvious difficulty meeting academic expectations - where the child 's response to the increasing demands of the educational system is of concern considerations such as family , whnau , cultural, community, or other demographic factors that mediate the dysfunctional quality of behaviours - where factors formerly suspected to account for the child 's behavioural characteristics hold less weight. Similar factors may well initiate referrals for diagnosis in high functioning adolescents and adults (ie, those who could be diagnosed with high functioning autism (HFA) or Asperger syndrome (AS). (See Definition in Introduction section .) Differences in behaviour and emotional understanding may bec ome more obvious as people move into the demands of the adult world of higher education, employment, independence and intimacy. Part 1: Diagnosis and initial assessment of ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 39 1.2 Assessment This section describes the process that should take place from the identification of a concern that an individual has a problem that may be an autism spectrum disorder through to making a diagnosis. Summary of recommendations Recommendations: Grade 1.2.1 The initial assessment of children may be undertaken by an individual practitioner. If there are ongoing concerns , a multidisciplinary assessment is recommended. B 1.2.2 Preferably, a multidisciplinary team of health care practitioners experienced in ASD should undertake diagnostic assessment of young people and adults suspected of having ASD. In the absence of an a ssessment team, a health care practitioner trained and highly experienced in ASD may undertake diagnostic assessment. B 1.2.3 Formal pathways for diagnostic assessment of young people and adults should be developed. C 1.2.4 Diagnostic assessment of young people and adults should be comprehensive (covering all areas listed below), and involve the person concerned in interview and observation (see Appendix 10. 5). C 1.2.5 Standardised ASD assessment interviews and schedules should be used (see Appendix 10. 5). B 1.2.6 Test users should ensure that they are aware of the validity, reliability and appropriateness of tests when assessing people with ASD and take these limitations into account when forming opinions and reporting results. C 1.2.7 The intellectual , adaptive and cognitive skills associated with ASD should be seriously considered and, where possible and appropriate, formally assessed . B Part 1: Diagnosis and initial assessment of ASD 40 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Good Practice Points: 1.2.8 Children identified with a significant developmental concern in the 0 -7 year age gro up should be seen by a developmental or general paediatrician. 1.2.9 A developmental services coordinator should be appointed in each local area. This person would manage the referral process for all children about whom there are developmental concerns. 1.2.10 All children suspected of having ASD or another developmental problem should have an audiology assessment. 1.2.11 If the general developmental assessment suggests an autism spectrum disorder, the developmental services coordinator should arra nge a multidisciplinary assessment of the child. 1.2.12 Where the local Specialist Assessment Team has found difficulty in making a diagnosis because of atypical or complex presentation, a network of tertiary centres should be provided where children co uld have a tertiary - level assessment. 1.2.13 The psychometric properties of formal ASD assessment tools within the New Zealand population should be further researched. 1.2.14 Assessment should consider the influence of diversity such as sense of self , ethnicity, culture, gender, sexuality, religion, socio -economic status, and geographic factors. 1.2.15 Assessment of an individual should elicit and consider whether that person requires, would value, and would benefit from a diagnosis of ASD. Assessment is the process undertaken by gathering information about the health, education and care needs of a person and family /whnau . This results in an identification of needs (including diagnosis, where appropriate) and a plan for action to meet the iden tified needs. As ASD is a developmental disorder, the presentation will vary with age and, in any one individual, vary over time. The characteristics of ASD may be more prominent at some ages than others. A clear understanding of normal social, behavioural and language development is required among parents, carers and professionals .11 The assessment has three specific aims: to identify health needs of the child (or adult), including consideration of differential diagnosis, establishing aetiology and provision of genetic advice to promote understanding and agreement about the potential developmental implications of the condition so that effective educational, behavioural, physical, emotional, social and communicati on strategies can be put in place to promote development to address the needs of the child (or adult) in the family context such that the family is given confidence to provide for the health, learning and care needs of their child or dependant adult, whils t understanding that their own needs (including cultural and spiritual needs) are being taken into account. From knowledge of current practices and services within New Zealand, there is currently inconsistent and inequitable access to assessment .9 Part 1: Diagnosis and initial assessment of ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 41 1.2.a Early childhood to adolescence The recommended pathway leading to the assessment of a young child, older child or adolescent with suspected ASD is summarised below in four steps: 1. developmental surveillance 2. identification of developmental concerns and appropriate referral 3. appropriate referral and developmental service coordination 4. multidisciplinary assessment. This pathway is outlined in Figure 1 which can be found at the end of this section. 1. Develop mental surveillance All children in New Zealand should receive developmental surveillance. For babies and children in the early childhood years, this is provided through the Well Child/Tamariki Ora framework. Children and teenagers attending compulsory sec tor education have educational attainment and behaviour reviewed regularly at school, with schools being required to formally report to parents at least twice per year. Where schools have a particular concern about a student 's health, they can consult with the Public Health Nurse linked to the school. Parents and a range of health and educational professionals (such as Plunket nurses and other Well Child providers, general practitioners (GPs), early childhood educators, playgroup supervisors and teachers) h ave considerable skill and experience in understanding the pattern of normal child development and should, in the course of developmental surveillance, identify areas of developmental concern. If any concerns become apparent to parents or professionals, th ese concerns should be discussed immediately. This discussion between parent and health or educational professional should seek to define the developmental concerns and gather further information about the child 's developmental milestones, unusual social interactions or behaviour, the child 's general health, eating and sleeping patterns, and potential family /whnau and environmental impacts on development, such as family emotional or financial stress. Such discussions may be formal (eg, a speech - language th erapy screening assessment) or informal (eg, a discussion between a parent and a kindergarten teacher). These are not formal diagnostic assessments. Health and education professionals should be proactive and should view each professional encounter as an op portunity to elicit developmental, health and social concerns about the child, rather than waiting for parents to voice concern. Routine professional encounters include each Well Child assessment, GP visits for intercurrent illness, and sessions at creche, kindergarten, playgroup or school (Recommendation 1.2.1 ). A wait -and-see approach, or a desire not to mention a concern for fear of creating unnecessary anxiety in parents, should be resisted, as this could lead to a delay in providing appropriate assessm ent and other services. 2. Developmental concerns If the outcome of the discussion between the parent and professional is that developmental concerns are unclear, or if that professional is not formally trained in assessing developmental skills, the profes sional should seek further advice, guidance or assessment from another professional with expertise in assessing child development. These professionals could include a speech -language therapist, a child development service therapist, or a paediatrician (Good Practice Point 1.2.8 ). If developmental concerns are confirmed during the discussion between the parent and professional, then onward referral for appropriate assessment must be made, through the developmental services coordinator. Part 1: Diagnosis and initial assessment of ASD 42 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 3. Developmental and A SD service coordination A developmental services coordinator (DSC) appointed by the District Health Board (DHB) should be located in each local area (Good Practice Point 1.2.9 ). The DSC should have a clinical background in child development and work closel y with health and education services. The DSC should have access to advice from child development services, child and adolescent mental health services, paediatricians and education services including Ministry of Education, Special Education and Resource Teachers: Learning and Behaviour (RTLB). It will be essential for the DSC to have access to advice from a paediatrician, as occasionally, developmental concerns can indicate serious underlying medical problems which need timely assessment. The role of the d evelopmental services coordinator is to collect more information, ensure that assessment occurs in a timely manner and to support the family /whnau through the assessment process. The coordinator arranges onward referral to appropriate agencies. If a medical problem has been identified, referral is recommended to a GP initially and then to a paediatrician, if required. If a developmental concer n is recognised, referral to the local child -development service, or to Ministry of Education, Special Education is recommended, depending on the type of concern and local referral patterns. Referral to a paediatrician may also be indicated. If concerns ap pear to involve significant emotional, behavioural or mental health issues, referral to an appropriate service according to locally agreed pathways should be considered. This may be the local Child, Adolescent and Family Mental Health Service or another ap propriate counselling, support or service agency. The role of the developmental services coordinator will include: taking enquiries from families and professionals gathering information coordinating a response, including arranging a general developmental assessment for all children under six years who meet the criteria for significant developmental concern. The general developmental assessment will usually be carried out by a developmental paediatrician or general paediatrician. coordinating a response for all children greater than six years of age who meet the criteria for significant developmental concern and, on occasions, for any child or young person attending any compulsory education sector facility. Referral of the child may include: onward referral t o a paediatrician, and/or onward referral to a specialist service or agency such as: - District Health Board child development service - Ministry of Education, Special Education - other specialised early intervention provider - Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services - non-governmental organisation (NGO) provider (eg, Family Works, Barnardos) - referral to a GP for primary care health assessment/review Part 1: Diagnosis and initial assessment of ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 43 - referral for audiology assessment for all children less than six years old where there is any concern about langua ge development. Hearing evaluation is mandatory in any child with developmental delay in language acquisition (Good Practice Point 1.2.10 ). Children require excellent hearing to develop language. Even mild to moderate hearing loss can lead to problems with language development. Where the general developmental assessment suggests an ASD, there needs to be a coordinated response for onward referral. The developmental services coordinator should arrange a multidisciplinary assessment of the child. In areas wit h large child populations, an Autism Spectrum Disorder coordinator may be appointed to assist the developmental services coordinator in this task (Good Practice Point 1.2.11 ). Contact details for the local developmental services coordinator and ASD coordin ator should be widely disseminated to all potential referrers. The coordinator will also be responsible for collecting data and providing information to the Ministry of Health and District Health Boards for policy and planning purposes. Data to be collecte d include: - parental report of age of first developmental concerns - age at referral to the coordinator or to another professional service - duration of waiting time for multidisciplinary assessment - outcome of assessment - time until specified services and suppor ts are in place for the child. Outcome data could include: - diagnosis of autism or Asperger syndrome by ICD-1020 or DSM -IV21 criteria , or ASD by DSM -519 criteria - autism spectrum disorder diagnosis, or other diagnosis - presence of co -morbid conditions - level of verbal and non -verbal developmental function. Note: It is not intended that an ASD or developmental disorder register b e established, rather that the efficiency of service provision and service gaps be identified by data collection. 4. Multidisciplinary assessment A multidisciplinary specialist assessment team involves a group of professionals working collaboratively to as sess the child. This team usually includes at least two or three members drawn from the following professions: paediatricians, child and adolescent psychiatrists, clinical or educational psychologists, speech -language therapists and occupational therapists . The preferred model of assessment process is a concurrent assessment by a collaborating team. If this is not feasible, the process could involve sequential assessments by individual professionals who then share their findings with one another. Each profe ssional provides insights from his/her area of expertise which are then integrated and synthesised through an interactive group process. This approach will lead to more robust diagnosis, more accurate planning of future services and supports, and will redu ce repetition and redundancy. Where a paediatrician or child and adolescent psychiatrist is not present at the multidisciplinary assessment, a separate medical assessment, including physical examination, is required by one of these professionals. Part 1: Diagnosis and initial assessment of ASD 44 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Specialis t assessment teams are multidisciplinary, and may be multiagency (team members employed by different health and education providers such as Ministry of Education, Special Education, Child Development teams, Child Adolescent and Family Mental Health Service ) or provided within one agency. Multiagency teams are preferred to prevent the child and family having to undergo repeated assessments and to ensure timely access to all the services needed. Occasionally, the local multidisciplinary specialist assessment team will be unable to make a diagnosis. This may occur where the clinical features are atypical or complex. In this situation, local clinicians should be able to access assessment at a tertiary centre. It is envisaged that there should be a network of ter tiary centres, with such assessments being available in main centres (Good Practice Point 1.2.12 ). The NAPC Guideline has defined the following essential components of specialist team assessment. These have been adapted for New Zealand. Essential component s for a complete multiagency assessment Existing information from all settings should be gathered. A specific ASD developmental and family history should be taken. No evidence exists on which to recommend any particular framework, but this history should b e taken by an experienced team member with recognised ASD professional learning and development. In some cases it may be useful to use a semi -structured interview such as the Autism Diagnostic Interview - Revised (ADI -R) or the Diagnostic Interview for Soc ial and Communication Disorders (DISCO). If the person taking the developmental history is not medically trained, then the medical history and examination should be completed separately. Focused observations should be taken across more than one setting as the familiarity of the setting often has significant impact on the skills and behaviours demonstrated by the child. These settings usually include home, early childhood centre or school. In some cases, observations at multiple settings are particularly use ful for further assessment and clarifying the diagnosis. Direct observations need to be systematic and examine communication, social and play skills. This could include tools such as the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule - Generic (ADOS -G). Direct obs ervation of the child 's behaviour in an unstructured setting is essential. This is possible during the history taking as the child will often display behaviours that may be of concern to the parents and can help clarify information provided by the parent, for example how the child is responding to gesture. It also gives opportunity for the team to observe patterns of interactions within the family and with unfamiliar adults. The interview setting should include a selection of toys for children at a range of developmental levels - sensory, functional, symbolic and so on. The focus of the assessment of primary school -aged children should include their functioning in an educational setting and include observations of their behaviours in both classroom and playg round settings. With older verbal children, assessment may also include a formal or informal child interview to provide further information on pragmatic skills and diagnostic features of communicative style. Part 1: Diagnosis and initial assessment of ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 45 If possible, a cognitive assessment should be pe rformed in an appropriate setting by either a clinical or an educational psychologist with ASD -specific skills and experience. Skills and weaknesses found in cognitive assessment may not significantly contribute to clinical diagnosis but may assist in pred ictors of outcome and prognosis. A communication assessment should be made, and speech and language competencies assessed where needed by a speech -language therapist with ASD - specific skills and experience. Formal tests do not provide a comprehensive pictu re of a child 's communication skills, especially for young children, and their results must be viewed qualitatively with other information. Observations of a child 's understanding, pragmatic skills and symbolic understanding need to be made in informal set tings. Where necessary, adaptations to play activities can be made to elicit specific skills. An assessment should be made of mental health and behaviour. Co-morbid mental health and behaviour problems are common. An assessment of the needs and strengths o f all family members should be undertaken. If not already performed, a referral should be made to the appropriate Needs Assessment and Service Coordination (NASC) Agency. A full physical examination should be performed. Appropriate medical tests should be ordered. Choice of tests will depend on each child 's clinical presentation, but chromosome karyotype and fragile X DNA analysis are the only current routine recommendations (Grade B). Clinical evidence of co -morbid medical conditions such as epilepsy shoul d be sought but tests such as EEG should not be undertaken unless clinically appropriate. The evidence base for all investigations should be fully explained to parents. Other assessments may be required to investigate unusual sensory responses, motor plann ing and coordination difficulties, and self -care problems. These assessments should be carried out by a therapist with appropriate experience in ASD. On occasions, the therapist will wish to involve another health professional. Joint assessments are prefer able. The findings should be discussed with the family /whnau and a plan developed including referrals for further assessment/intervention, review of the child and provision of a comprehensive report. After the assessment is completed, the DSC (or ASD coor dinator, where available) should ensure that the child (where appropriate) and family have received information about services and supports and that the relevant referrals have been made. Current Ministry of Health elective guidelines require referrals to be seen within six months. All agencies should work together to ensure that waiting times are minimised, especially for children in the early childhood years, and that assessments are completed as quickly as possible within the available resources. Part 1: Diagnosis and initial assessment of ASD 46 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Figu re 1: Flowchart of identification and assessment process for children (aged < 16 years) who may have ASD Part 1: Diagnosis and initial assessment of ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 47 1.2.b Young people and adults The diagnostic team and sources of diagnostic assessment Interagency or multidisciplinary assessments or both are reco mmended for young people and adults suspected of having an ASD11 41 47-50 (Recommendation 1.2.2 ). Although it is possible for a single clinician with experience evaluating ASD to make a diagnosis in very young children, assessment and diagnosis by a team of health care practitioners experienced in ASD is recommended for older individuals .41 In New Zealand, recommendations and proposals have been made for the development of specialist ASD services which could undertake this role for people with ASD of all ages ,51-53 but they have not been implemented. Currently, within New Zealand, there is no formal referral pathway for ASD assessment and diagnosis of adults. In some areas, referral pathways for youn g people are also unclear (Recommendation 1.2.3 ). Private health care practitioners are often approached to carry out diagnostic assessments. The health care practitioners most likely to be able to diagnose ASD in young people and adults include clinical psychologists, educational psychologists, child and adolescent psychiatrists and adult mental health psychiatrists (Recommendation 1.2.2 ). However, not all health care practitioners have expertise in ASD, and identifying ASD -competent health care practition ers able to diagnose older adolescents and adults is an ongoing issue. When seeking a practitioner or team to undertake a diagnostic assessment, the choice of health care practitioner should be based on their post -qualification education and areas of speci alisation, and recommendations from within the ASD community (Good Practice Point 6.26, Professional learning and development ). A suggested pathway for the ide ntification and assessment process for young people and adults who may have ASD is outlined in Fi gure 2 which can be found at the end of this section. Components of diagnostic assessment Diagnostic assessment for young children has been outlined in section 1.2.a. A similar assessment should be undertaken for young people and adults .41 54. Diagnosing people from these age groups presents a number of challenges, however, which include: recognising the wide range of expression of the symptoms of ASD which are influen ced by the person 's level of maturity, lifetime experiences and cognitive ability46 the likelihood of more complex differential diagnosis because of the increasing possibility of alternative diagnoses and co -mor bid conditions54 competing diagnoses which may overshadow ASD difficulty obtaining accurate and detailed early developmental history as the age of the individual increases .27 46 Research and expert opinion support diagnostic assessment that includes the following components: detailed health, developmental and behavioural history (usually from parents and other informants) detailed assessment of patterns of skills, disabilities and behaviours comprehensive record and file review medical evaluation social and emotional abilities and interactions direct evaluation of the person through interview and observation in a range of environments Part 1: Diagnosis and initial assessment of ASD 48 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline formal assessment of intellectual functioning, in order to better understand the person 's abilities and their prognosis, but not as a diagnostic tool in itself assessment of adaptive functioning (those skills needed for independent living), also in order to better understand the person 's abilities (note that professional tests users should be aware of ASD norms for the Vineland adaptive behaviour scales55 and other ASD relevant research )56-58 assessment of other forms of cognitive functioning ( see below ) neurological assessment mental health assessments communication and audiological assessment sensory, motor and pe rceptual assessments vision assessment occupational and physical therapy evaluation evaluation of social competence and functioning evaluation of interests and activities assessment of family resources and needs27 41 42 49 50 59 60-62 (Recommendation 1.2.4 ). The use of standardised interviews and assessment formats for autism, Asperger syndrome and ASD is supported ,63 and assessment processes are regularly reviewed and refined as understanding of ASD develops further64-67 (Recommendation 1.2.5 ). Currently, commonly recommen ded tools include: Autism Diagnostic Interview - Revised (ADI -R), a standardised, semi - structured clinical review for carers of children and adults suspected of having autism or other pervasive developmental disorders66 68-70 Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule - Generic (ADOS -G), a semi - structured, standardised assessment of social interaction, communication, play and im aginative use of materials, for use with children and adults suspected of having autism or other pervasive developmental disorders66 71 72 Asperger Syndrome Diagnostic Interview, a clinician -administered tool for use with children and adults suspected of having Asperger syndrome or High Functioning Autism73 Autism Spectrum Disorde r Screening Adults Questionnaire (ASDASQ), a screening test for ASD in the adult population74 Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ), a self - administered screening test for people suspected of High Functioning Autism/Asp erger syndrome75 Australian Scale for Asperger 's syndrome (ASAS), a checklist for parents of primary school children suspected of having Asperger syndrome76 Childhood Asperger Syndrome Test (CAST), a parent -completed screening test for children aged 5 -11 years77 Developmental, Diagnostic and Dimensional Interview (3di), a computerised assessment for autism spectrum disorders78 Diagnostic Interview for Social and Communicative Disorders (DISCO), a clinician -administered schedule of assessment for use with people of all ages79 80 Part 1: Diagnosis and initial assessment of ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 49 Gilliam Asperger 's Disorder Scale (GADS), a scale for use by parents and professionals, assessing Asperger syndrome in people aged 3 -22 years81 Krug Asperger 's Disorder Index (KADI), a scale for use by professionals, assessing Asperger syndrome in people aged 6 -22 years .82 Many of the tests above are subject to ongoing review and limitations are described in the literature and Append ix 5. Many of the tools require specialist education which is not currently available in New Zealand ( Recommendation 1.2.6, Recommendation 6.2, Professional learning and development ). Theory and research on the nature of ASD is complex, controversial and o ngoing .83 84 The three main theoretical approaches are: disturbance in theory of mind or 'mindblindness ': impaired ability to reflect on the contents of one 's own and others ' minds85 weak central coherence theory: the difficulty that people with ASD have in cognitively 'seeing the big picture ', and their focus on the smallest possible parts executive dysfunction theory: impa ired ability to perform tasks involving 'executive function ' (eg, planning, working memory, impulse control, inhibition, shifting set, initiating and monitoring action) .86 Assessment related to the above psychol ogical theories of ASD and specific cognitive functions may lead to a fuller understanding of an individual 's strengths and needs and, in turn, inform intervention and support87 (Recommendation 1.2.7 ). Summary o f this work is beyond the scope of the New Zealand ASD Guideline, but interested professionals may find it useful to follow up on some associated references .82 83 87-96 No studies were identified which addressed the validity of applying any of the measures listed above to the New Zealand population. As no New Zealand norms have been published, information is lacking on the applicability of these tools to New Zealanders of any ethnic background and on the sensitivity or specificity of the tools (Recommendation 1.2.13, Recommendation 6.3, Professional learning and development ). Part 1: Diagnosis and initial assessment of ASD 50 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Figure 2: Flowchart of identification and assessment process for young people and adults who may have ASD Part 1: Diagnosis and initial assessment of ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 51 1.3 Differential diagnosis of autism and consideration of other possible conditions Summary of recommendations Recommendations: Grade 1.3.1 Differentia l diagnosis must be covered during diagnostic assessment. C 1.3.2 Differential diagnosis must be thorough and cover all conditions commonly confused with ASD and those known to coexist with ASD. C 1.3.3 Health care professionals must have a good understa nding of the different forms of expression of ASD symptomatology across developmental stages and the symptomatology of common coexisting and alternative conditions. B Good Practice Points: 1.3.4 Health care professionals must consult with specialists in areas of diagnostic overlap when issues are not clear. 1.3.a Early childhood There is no absolute test for ASD. While this is also true for many other situations, it is essential for clinicians providing assessment and diagnostic services for children with possible ASD to fully consider other possible diagnoses (the differential diagnosis)42 88 (Recommendation 1.3.1 ). When a child is being assessed for autism, othe r diagnoses need to be considered, such as: hearing impairment auditory processing disorder environmental deprivation attachment disorder specific language disorder semantic pragmatic language disorder dyspraxia intellectual disability selective mutism men tal health disorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and opposition defiant disorder conduct disorder in the older child abuse, trauma, neglect. Part 1: Diagnosis and initial assessment of ASD 52 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline These disorders may also occur in association with ASD. Other conditions occur more commonly in association with ASD than in the general population. When two different conditions or disorders occur together in the same individual they are called co -morbidities .88 89 They include: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder anxiety disorders (including obsessive - compulsive disorder) Tourette syndrome depression developmental dyspraxia/ developmental coordination disorder epilepsy nutritional deficiencies secondar y to restricted diet specific learning disability or intellectual disability. If a co -morbidity is suspected, then an appropriate evaluation should be carried out and a treatment plan put in place (Recommendation 1.3.2 ). An increasing number of specific me dical conditions have been described as being associated with autistic symptomatology. These include: degenerative neurological or metabolic condition Down syndrome fetal alcohol spectrum disorder fragile X Rett syndrome tuberose sclerosis. Every child wit h a developmental problem for which no cause is obvious should have a paediatric evaluation and an appropriate focused investigation, depending on the findings from that evaluation (Recommendation 1.3.3 ). All children with a language delay or difficulty sh ould have an audiology hearing assessment as part of their evaluation. Any child in whom there is a history of possible developmental regression should have the possibility of neurodegenerative disease or metabolic disorder considered and appropriately inv estigated. This should involve consultation with a paediatric neurologist or metabolic specialist, as appropriate. In children where there is doubt about diagnosis and who have a history of abuse or disrupted early attachment, an opinion from a child psych iatrist or psychologist is necessary to consider possibilities such as: attachment disorders other psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and schizoid personality disorder in older children, adolescents and adults. Management of epilepsy will not b e addressed in this guideline. Children with uncomplicated epilepsy should be managed by a paediatrician. Children with complicated or refractory epilepsy should have an evaluation by a paediatric neurologist. Pharmacotherapy in ASD and for other co - morbid ities in association with ASD is discussed in section 4.4. Part 1: Diagnosis and initial assessment of ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 53 1.3.b Young people and adults Careful differential diagnosis is extremely important for young people and adults (Recommendation 1.3.1 ). ASD can be misdiagnosed, for any number of psychiatric condit ions can co -exist with or be superimposed on ASD .27 41 46 54 Common differen tial diagnoses and/or coexisting conditions include schizophrenia, intellectual disability, catatonia, depression, anxiety disorders, obsessive - compulsive disorders, attention disorders, language disorders, disorders of impulse control, and substance abuse .41 42 59 90 Competent differential diagnosis in young people and adults relies on: the process being thorough the health care professionals involved having considerable experience in and knowledge of ASD, including an understanding of the different forms of expression of ASD symptomatology across developmental stages and the symptomatology of common coexisting and alternative conditions healt h care professionals consulting with specialists in areas of diagnostic overlap when issues are not clear (Good Practice Point 1.3.4 ) undertaking careful examination of the factors that prompted the referral collecting detailed history to discern whether p otential symptoms of ASD present at the time of assessment were present (albeit possibly in different forms) at earlier stages of development careful delineation of symptomatology consistent with ASD, from characteristics of coexisting or alternative diagn oses41 (Recommendation 1.3.2 ). A common diagnostic dilemma is whether to differentiate autism or high functioning autism from Asperger syndrome. Autistic disorder and Asperger disorder are separate diagnoses wit hin the classification system most commonly utilised in New Zealand, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM -IV-TR)90 (see Appendix 4). Yet recent reviews o n the conditions in children, young people and adults have found considerable overlap in symptoms and few qualitative differences ,23 91 92 102-105 and reviews of tests designed to discriminate between the conditions found that most could not differentiate reliably .64 65 Consequently, some eminent researchers suggest that using the terms ASD or High Functioning Autism/Asperger syndrome is more appropriate, and/or use such terms in their own publications .93 94-97 Given the current state of knowledge, a diagnosis of ASD is likely to be sufficient. The focus needs to be not so much on th e specificity of the diagnosis but on an appropriate assessment and management plan. Note: this approach is consistent with the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, the DSM -518, as discussed in the Living Guideline Group 's Supplementary Paper on the implications of the DSM -5 for the guideline ( see Appendix 10.5 for a summary ). Part 1: Diagnosis and initial assessment of ASD 54 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 1.4 Formulation, disclosure of diagnosis and post -diagnosis support Summary of recommendations Recommendations: Grade 1.4.1 Formulation is the necessary next step from assessment. C 1.4.2 Clarity of diagnosis should be the goal of assessment and formulation. C 1.4.3 In situations when diagnostic clarity is not possible, an action plan should be developed to attend to areas of complexity an d confusion. C 1.4.4 All diagnostic assessments should include a detailed written report covering the person 's strengths and weaknesses, developmental course, ASD symptoms, recommendations for intervention and information on support networks. C 1.4.5 Disclosure of diagnosis of older teens and adults and decisions a bout the involvement of family and whnau or support people should take into consideration the wishes of the person concerned, privacy issues and their support needs. C 1.4.6 Information on ASD and support services should be available at all diagnostic di sclosure interviews and through health and disability services. B 1.4.7 Sources of post -diagnosis support should be identified for the person with ASD. C Good Practice Points: 1.4.8 Disclosure of diagnosis of young teens should be family -centred and in volve the family and whnau. 1.4.9 The need for formal support pathways of post -diagnostic support for newly diagnosed people with ASD should be investigated further. Part 1: Diagnosis and initial assessment of ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 55 Formulation is the process of integrating the assessment information systematic ally (Recommendation 1.4.1 ). This enables the diagnostic team to attend to differential diagnosis sufficiently, finalise their opinion and develop recommendations .41 Ideally, through the process of formulation, the team will develop a single, coherent view of the child or person assessed (Recommendation 1.4.2 ). In cases where a definitive diagnosis is not possible, an action plan should be developed to address issues of complexity and confusion41 (Recommendation 1.4.3 ). The formulation should become a written report detailing the person 's strengths and weaknesses, developmental course, ASD symptoms and recommendations for intervention. It should also provide information on support networks41 47 54 (Recommendation 1.4.4 ). Whilst family -centred disclosure of diagnosis is recommended for children with ASD, careful clinical judgement and attention to issues of privacy is required when disclosing diagnosis of young people and adults (Recommendation 1.4.5 ). Younger teens and more dependent adults may prefer/require family and whnau involvement in disclosure (Good Practice Point 1.4.8 ). Older teens and more independent adults may prefer individual sessions, or to be accompanied by a support person of their choice. Research on the satisfaction that parents of children diagnosed with ASD felt with the disclosure process suggested that higher satisfaction was associated with the quality of information given to them (including written reports), acceptance of their early suspicions about their child 's development by professionals and being given a definite, rather than a tentative, d iagnosis98 (Recommendation 1.4.6 ). The study authors went on to advise professionals to be respectful, identify supports and be informed. Published advice to professionals disclosing diagnoses to young people an d adults includes giving the person concerned ample time to ask questions, to understand what is being said and to voice concerns .47 99 Of interest to some may be the model used by a United States -based medical doctor to explain the diagnosis to parents of children with ASD (this may be able to be adapted for use with young people, adults and their families and whnau) .100 He recommended discussing the child 's needs and likely prognosis while outlining four basic premises: that atypical development occurs along a continuum from mild to severe; that phenotypic expression of ASD varies with age; that ASD of any degree of severi ty can occur in combination with any degree of general intelligence; and that long -term prognosis represents the joint impact of ASD and the child 's general level of intelligence. People diagnosed with ASD and their families and whnau may raise issues which indicate a need for post -diagnostic support from an ASD specialist or specially trained psychologist or psychiatrist47 (Recommendati on 1.4.7 ). Common themes include doubt about the diagnosis, depression and despair, anger and fear .99 However, some people find the diagnosis a relief, making sense of what have sometimes been years of difficult y.33 Nevertheless, these people may also have significant issues. Good post -diagnosis support helps the person to: understand ASD and how it affects his/her life access good -quality ASD information discover his or her financial entitlements (if any) identify services for specific ASD support network with other people with ASD source further counselling from appropriately skilled practitioners (Good Practice Point 1.4.9 ). Part 2: Support for individuals, f amilies and carers New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 57 Part 2 Support for individuals, famil ies and carers \"Many adults with autism believe that positive family involvement and support help individuals with autism develop the skills necessary to be as successful as possible as adults. I think it was the work of many people who loved me that got m e where I am now...\" Part 2: Support for individuals, families and carers 58 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Part 2 Support for individuals, families and carers ASD has been described as a 'hidden ' disability that affects every aspect of a person 's day -to-day life, including social inclusion. Some people with ASD will have significant support needs with everyday tasks while others will need low-level ongoing support to sustain education and employment or access to the community .101 Studies have mostly focused on outcomes that are associated with the person with ASD. However, parents and whnau, partners, siblings and carers are key people in the lives of the person with ASD, and they have additional needs for support that must be considered to ensure that they, too, enjoy social inclusion to the degr ee other community members take for granted. People with ASD also need support to improve their wellbeing. This section of the ASD Guideline identifies the key support and service needs for people who live with, love and care for individuals with ASD. It a lso covers the health care needs of people with ASD that need to be addressed to enhance their well being. Part 2: Support for individuals, f amilies and carers New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 59 2.1 Relationships Summary of recommendations Recommendations: Grade 2.1.1 The values, knowledge, preferences and cultural perspectives of the fami ly/ whnau should be respected and evident in services and resources. C 2.1.2 The stress experienced by the families and whnau of children w ith ASD should be acknowledged. C 2.1.3 The value of parent -led support networks should be recognised in helping parents to deal with the issues that they are facing following diagnosis and in supporting access to information. B 2.1.4 Teachers and other professionals should collect and appreciate the unique information about the child, which is held by the parent. T his information should be incorporated into the planning of the child 's education programme. B 2.1.5 The parents ' role in interventions should be respectfully negotiated. B 2.1.6 Planning and evaluation of interventions should always take into account both family /whnau and child variables and outcomes. B 2.1.7 ASD -related counselling and/or advocacy services and education should be available to all family members and carers. C 2.1.8 Further research is needed to identify the needs of children parented by people with ASD and the needs of parents with ASD. C Good Practice Point: 2.1.9 The perspective of grandparents should be researched to investigate the therapeutic and cost -effectiveness of involving grandparents as part of the assessment process and to identify the importance of their role in their ongoing support of family /whnau . Part 2: Support for individuals, families and carers 60 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 2.1.a Parents and full -time carers Emotional and financial stresses There is significant agreement that having a child with ASD places additional stresses on parents (especially mothers), families and whnau. There is speculation that the lack of interpersonal responsiveness might be a major reason for this, over and above the difficulty of having a child with a significant disability .102 Factors associated with parent and family psychological distress include low levels of support from within the family and bringing up a child with challenging behaviour .103 Parental perception can have an impact on how well parents cope. Mothers who feel they are to blam e for their child 's disability or those who find the child 's needs to be a catastrophe for the family tend to have more difficulty adapting. In contrast, perceived social support (such as supportive partners) and psychological hardiness (an understanding a nd acceptance of the diagnosis) tend to protect mothers from the effects of stress .104 Most of the literature describes parents ' experiences of helping a person with ASD to develop skills and enjoy activities as hard work and time consuming, and the additional demands of caring for a family member with ASD often continue into adulthood. Combining this with bringing up other children poses challenges in meeting the needs of the whole family .31 47 These challenges are more complex if families have more than one family member on the spectrum .105 The behaviour of the person with ASD wi ll impact on other members of the family and balancing the needs of other children will require extra consideration. Despite these demands, families and whnau are often extremely resilient and develop excellent coping strategies, including strengths - focus ed problem solving .104 106 Longitudinal research on the experiences of parents and families as they adapt to the changing needs of a family member with ASD is scarce. Research tends to concentrate on mothers and has a focus on the negative aspects of ASD, with limited research on cultural influences. Little is known about the long -term experiences of families who have children with Asperger syndrome .107-109 Research shows the economic and social impact of caring for family members with disabilities .31 110-112 Combined with the cost of therapies and medication, interventions and support services and lost earnings, ASD is acknowledged to be a costly disorder. Flexible community -based and employer suppo rts are crucial to support parents of children with disabilities to enable them to work and care for their children .110 Support and respite to minimise stress Timely and more effective early support for the mana gement of children with ASD may reduce the need for full -time 24 -hour out - of-home placements of some young children with ASD .11 Providing support to families who care for a child with ASD may result in a signifi cant cost -benefit to government, saving expensive crisis management and providing quality of life to people with ASD and their families113 (Recommendations 2.1.1, 2.1.2 ). Evidence suggests that the provision of respite care and a key worker case management model is likely to lead to the most positive outcomes for parents .111 113 115 The value of parent -led support networks has also been identified .114 Parents want help to deal with the issues they are facing following diagnosis. Parent -to-parent support enables new parents to feel less isolated and encourages access to information115 (Recommendation 2.1.3 ). Part 2: Support for individuals, f amilies and carers New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 61 The strongest evidence for reducing stress in mothers identified the success of more structured interventions, such as cognitive behavioura l interventions. There is a lack of evidence for alternative models to cognitive behaviour therapy, including culturally appropriate elements and how and when to involve other family members .114 Parent -professio nal collaboration The evidence is clear that regardless of the intervention, implementing it across home, early childhood education services, school and community settings is important to the outcomes. However, the high level of participation that is assoc iated with effective outcomes does put considerable demands on parents .104 Parents have to take on multiple roles when their child has ASD. Engagement of parents is crucial, but the degree to which they are invo lved will differ, depending on family wishes and circumstances. Some parents just want to be 'Mum ' or 'Dad ' and not the child 's teacher, and this should be respected. When planning interventions, parents and professionals need to agree on the roles and res ponsibilities each wishes to take. These roles may change at times to reflect the specific needs of the child and his or her family .11 116 117 Eco-cultural theories hold that family values are embedded in daily routines and families and whnau maintain these routines in order to adapt to their environment. Research suggests that interventions need to accommodate these routin es or they will not be sustainable .106 It is important that the skills which are targeted in individual plans are functional and able to be practised in both home and educational settings .104 Collaboration is associated with effective outcomes. A collaborative intervention considers that the child 's and family / whnau 's characteristics (values, culture and resources) are important in designing interventions and routine s. A review of parent roles in intervention reported greater improvements for children following a collaborative -consultation model than with a teacher -only model106 (Recommendation 2.1.4 ). Family participation is effectively supported by education providers through ongoing consultation and individualised problem solving, as well as through opportunities to learn techniques for teaching their children. While parents cannot be expected to provide the majority of educational programming for their child, their concerns and perspectives should actively shape educational planning104 (Recommendation 2.1.5 ). Support for New Zealand families during the diagnostic process is out lined in Part 1 of this guideline. Key actions recommended, specifically for families following assessment and diagnosis ,11 include: easy access for families to information and support relating to their needs immediate appointment of a key worker who has ASD expertise for coordination of interventions and supports for the child and family, with an outline of agreed time scales and dates (this person is not the same as the ASD coordinator who coordinates referral) care plan developed with and for the family which includes care management for complex situations and ongoing needs consideration of the needs of siblings as part of the care plan. Part 2: Support for individuals, families and carers 62 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline There is increasing awareness about the practical and emotional needs of f amily members and the central role they can play in the family 's adaptation to ASD. Virtually all parents of children with special education needs require support, partnership and substantial new skills and knowledge learned in the context of the needs o f their particular child. Families' and whnau 's knowledge, beliefs, aspirations, values, culture and preference for services must be recognised and used for planning and provision of supports and services11 118 (Recommendations 2.1.5, 2.1.6 ). Observational research acknowledges the important role that parents have in any intervention process, but specific guidance is lacking on the potential advantages and disadvantages of different parent -mediated approach es to providing early intervention. A Cochrane systematic review, including two small randomised controlled trials (RCTs), was unable to offer guidance for practice from its findings .119 All staff working with a child should liaise closely to develop an individual plan and a family care plan, which include clear goals and strategies and which are updated regularly. Family care plans should be written in a clear format and, where necessary, intensive ASD service coordination should be provided to assist in accessing services provided by a joint funding provision .11 Advocacy It is important to make information available to parents so they are able to take an active role i n advocacy for their children 's education if they wish .104 Specialists and teachers can support parents to master an understanding of the vocabulary and systems of education, the characteristics of ASD, how thos e are related to a child 's educational needs and gain an appreciation of how intervention techniques work. Without this knowledge, it is unfair and unreasonable to expect a parent to be an effective collaborator or good advocate for his or her child .104 Education in advocacy skills should be available for parents and individuals with ASD ( see also section 4.2 Problem minimisation and avoidance ). Conflict resolution skills may be useful for both parents and school staff to ensure that both groups are well informed and to ease tensions that may arise through their interactions. There is always the potential for conflict and both parties need to be supported in learning how to disagree and resolve differences within a constructive atmosphere. Parents who do not feel confident to advocate themselves should be offered access to quality advocacy services104 (Recommendation 2.1.7 ). Part 2: Support for individuals, f amilies and carers New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 63 Rural issues Rural families and whnau exper ience significant challenges and disadvantages in accessing resources and services (eg, transportation, lack of local support, isolation, financial resources, lack of employment opportunities) compared with urban dwellers. Distance education programmes may be one way to make information accessible. Literature about provision of services to families and whnau of children in rural areas is scarce. There have been promising results for distance education programmes for parents of children with challenging beh aviours (one based on written materials with weekly telephone contact and one delivered through television) .106 Cultural issues Cultural differences need to be recognised and appropriately acknowledged. If teach ers and other professionals do not understand what the child 's ASD means to a family /whnau , it will be difficult for them to develop the kind of collaborative relationship which is essential for the education of children with ASD. Cultural sensitivity will mean providing services in a language in which parents are fluent as well as an und erstanding that views of disability may differ for some ethnic or racial groups .11 117 In New Zealand, it has been suggested that people working with Mori learners w ith special education needs should not make assumptions or unilateral decisions about what is culturally appropriate for a learner and what degree of cultural input is required. These decisions must be made in consultation and collaboration with the learne rs, parents and whnau concerned .120 A recent qualitative study which examined Mori perspectives of ASD identified that, although parents ' experiences of diagnosis were variable, many parents were well informed .116 Most had encountered both helpful services and services with barriers. The report identified a number of areas of concern that highlighted the need for education in ASD. Parents had a wide range of views wi th respect to cultura l input into service provision and saw Mori - medium education and services as having advantages and disadvantages (inclusive supportive staff versus a lack of knowledge about ASD). A study that looked at access to 'EarlyBird ', an education programme for pa rents of children before they start school, identified other cultural issues as raising barriers to parent education in New Zealand. As well as language barriers, the study identified late diagnosis, difficulties in attending programmes due to work and fam ily commitments and a need for a more community focused approach .121 Further information on Mori and Pacific peoples ' perspectives of ASD is included in Parts 7 and 8. 2.1.b Siblings There are special demands placed on the siblings who live with family members with ASD. Learning how to manage these demands can help brothe rs and sisters to cope with their experiences, through access both to developmentally appropriate information and to specific strategies to help meet the distinctive challenges of living with a sibling with a disability .122 123 Part 2: Support for individuals, families and carers 64 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Studies on the effects of children with disabilities on the wellbeing of their non - disabled siblings and/or the quality of the sibling relationship provide contradictory results, partially expla ined by methodological problems (such as choice of comparison groups). Research does, however, identify that while siblings of children with ASD experience their own stress and often bear more responsibilities than children with typically developing siblin gs, a disabled sibling does not necessarily lead to a problematic sibling relationship. Positive sibling relationships are enhanced by the siblings having knowledge of the ASD disorder and through support programmes for siblings that are provided by suppor t groups for children with similar disorders. Longitudinal studies have been recommended to determine whether relationships remain positive with age and/or increasing responsibilities on the part of the non disabled sibling .124-127 There is increasing awareness of the needs of other family members and the role they play through practical and emotional support. Thus, the current and future needs of family members should be considered when interventions and supports are identified for their disabled sibling and these needs should become part of a care plan .11 It is important that the personal needs of siblings are not overlooke d. They should have an opportunity to learn about ASD and to have access to sibling support groups124 127 or one -to-one counselling or both, where appropriate. Resear ch suggests that peer instruction from siblings can contribute to behavioural and social changes in their brothers or sisters .102 Siblings who attend the same school as their brother or sister with ASD also need support in situations where they might be asked for help by teaching staff or where they are teased about or embarrassed by their sibling 's behaviour. It is important to remember that the needs of siblings will change over time .11 There is a lack of evidence on the effects of a diagnosis of ASD within the family on non - disabled siblings. Siblings need information and support post -diagnosis and ongoing support throughout their development. Further research is nee ded to identify the variety of formal and informal social supports that best sustain non - disabled siblings and their relationships with their sibling with ASD ,125 and to determine what types of information might be effective for siblings of different ages .128 Information about ASD for siblings can be sourced through support groups and libraries, disability related websites and links specifically designed for siblings. Computer -mediated self -help groups are another possibility, although there is, so far, little research in this area. One study, of the online conversations of young individuals who participated in Sibkids, an online support group, identified three main categories of social support that were provided: emotional support, informational support and social companionship .129 This suggests that there is a potential for children and adolescents to receive multidimensiona l social support from online chat groups. Siblings are at greater risk of showing symptoms of ASD than the general population. Younger siblings, particularly, require close monitoring to ensure that if they have indicators, intervention can begin very earl y.104 Part 2: Support for individuals, f amilies and carers New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 65 2.1.c Grandparents Even when generally supportive, extended family and whnau such as grandparents can struggle to provide practical and emotional support because of difficulties coming to terms with the diagnosis and the challenging behaviours of children with ASD. Communit y awareness and understanding of ASD are important to overcoming these barriers .116 Three key themes were identified from a qualitative study on the experiences of six grandparents of children diagnosed with ASD : the parental bond towards the grandchild and adult child, striving for answers (the search for meaning) and the role of grandparents in holding the family together .130 Their role in helping to inform clinical assessment work is unclear and there is a lack of evidence on the therapeutic value and cost -effectiveness of involving grandparents as part of the assessment process (Good Practice Point 2.1.9 ). New Zealand child -protection law requires that children be p laced within their extended family /whnau , if possible, when in need of care and in many cases it is grandparents who take on the caring role. Many others take care of their grandchildren in response to a family crisis without any formal or statutory intervention .131 Anecdotally, it is known that some grandparents who may have looked forward to retirement after parenting their own ASD child(ren), find themselves caring for their grandchildren who have been diagnosed with an ASD. Whatever the circu mstances, information, support and services are essential to help grandparents to cope. A New Zealand handbook for grandparents and other kin carers exists which is a comprehensive resource - including further references and contacts for agencies - for gra ndparents who find themselves in this situation .131 2.1.d Formal carers Formal carers are those people who are paid to care for people who are placed outside their family home. Education, opportunities to discus s professional practices and having breaks are seen as necessary supports for carers. There is a lack of ASD -specific evidence in this area and further research into their support needs is recommended. 2.1.e Spouses and life partners People with ASD do hav e intimate relationships, inclusive of marriage, life partnerships and homosexual relationships, although it should be noted that not all adults with ASD will want or attain a long -term relationship. Although this is an area that remains under - researched, personal accounts by both partners and individuals with ASD can be found in the literature33 132 including perspectives provided by counsellors .133 Challenges to these relationships include difficulties that are directly related to ASD, particularly in relation to communication, socialising and imaginative thought. How a partner approaches and copes with the many difficultie s that having ASD can present makes a difference to the coping mechanisms of both partners .133 Appropriate support services are needed for adults with ASD and their partners. A review of literature, anecdotal information and websites identifies a number of supports that spouses and partners can access to support them in their relationships, including how to: learn about ASD and how it affects their loved one establish routines that work for both partners - this c an include negotiating formal agreements about things that cause problems Part 2: Support for individuals, families and carers 66 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline access genetic counselling, if planning to have children access relationship assistance if needed - the counsellor must know about ASD handle separation and divorce, which present sp ecial issues. In order to support spouses and life partners, health and education professional development curricula need to: ensure that any professional learning and development for ASD offered to health and education professionals through their institut ions includes knowledge and awareness of the needs of this specific group of people ensure that social service staff members receive adequate education in child - welfare issues relating to parents who have ASD47 (Recommendation 6.4, Professional learning and development ). 2.1.f People raised by paren ts with ASD There is limited information on what it means to be parented by someone who has ASD. A small number of websites and publications provide personal insights from adults .134-136 Very little research information was identified on the experiences of young children parented by people with ASD (Recommendation 2.1.8 ). A number of important child -welfare issues need to be addressed when the parenting threshold for an ASD parent has been exceeded, including the needs of children in custody arrangements or following the death of a parent. A number of issues are raised in calling fo r further research to better support people with ASD in their role as parents ,135 including: research on the needs of parents with ASD research to identify the needs of children parented by people with ASD paren t education and workshops which offer ASD -appropriate supports and resources specific training for counsellors to work with children who are parented by people with ASD (Recommendation 6.5, Professional learning and development ). Part 2: Support for individuals, f amilies and carers New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 67 2.2 Parent information a nd education Summary of recommendations Recommendations: Grade 2.2.1 Family members and whnau need to know how to find and access information and support. Health authorities and support groups must work together to develop appropriate support services for adults and their partners to ensure sources of support and information are available. C 2.2.2 All education services should be family /whnau -centred. B 2.2.3 A key service to support families and whnau is the provision of information about ASD. Information needs to be accessible to all people including translated material, easy -to-read vers ions and developmentally appropriate information. Support groups and government should work in close association to ensure all information is kept up to date. C The critical role parents play in supporting their children 's learning is highlighted by a met a- analysis of health and aging undertaken for the Australian Government to identify the most effective models of practice in early intervention for children with ASD. Emotional support, advice and education are required by parents to enable them to work ef fectively with their children. Parents also need access to up -to-date information about treatment options and support services. The research acknowledged that information, support and education should be provided for the entire family unit. The Australian report also commented on the needs of ethnic minorities, socioeconomically disadvantaged families and people living in rural areas who require special consideration .137 A key service to support families is the p rovision of information about ASD. Increased media attention and the widespread availability of the Internet have increased parents ' knowledge, but these sources can convey perspectives that are not balanced or well -supported scientifically. Parents need a ccess to balanced information about ASD and the range of appropriate services and technologies104 (Recommendation 2.2.1 ). The information needs to be accessible to everyone and include culturally appropriate mat erial in an easy -to-read format that is developmentally appropriate. Support groups and government should work in close association to ensure all information is kept up to date .47 Readiness for education in fami lies with a newly diagnosed child needs to be carefully handled and evaluated. Information that can assist parents might include: scientifically based, specialised knowledge and skills about ASD and its treatment guidance on mastering specific teaching str ategies that enable them to help their child acquire new skills and behaviours information on understanding how ASD influences their child 's learning and behaviour guidance on understanding their rights and responsibilities in the education system in order to effectively advocate for their child help in coping with the emotional s tress that can follow from having a child with a significant developmental disorder .106 Part 2: Support for individuals, families and carers 68 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Sound information from appropriately qualified professionals can also assist parents to make good decisions and maintain a sense of control. Parents require timely information about assessments, education plans and the available resources for their children to be conveyed in a meaningful way that give s them time to prepare to fulfil their roles and responsibilities .104 In a qualitative study of 19 Mori families and whnau in New Zealand, parents reported finding a range of information to be helpful: verbal explanations of ASD at point of diagnosis; a good talk with someone who knew about ASD; how they could assist their child; future implications; and what services, equipment and entitlements existed. Parents wanted to know not only how these could be obtained, but who could assist them in the process. Useful sources of information were identified: taped and written info rmation (ranging from pamphlets and books), videos, conference attendance and web - based information .116 In some situations, Pacific people may feel that asking for help, which can extend to seeking out services, is rude. In their communities, help is usually offered rather than requested .138 Traditionally, family issues and problems are kept very private and often hidden and families can find it extremely difficult to actively seek help and ask for available services and supports, especially where there are gaps in services. Information therefore needs to be offered to people rather than expecting them to initiate contact or ask for help. Socioeconomic circumstances mus t also be considered (eg, access to transport or a telephone) .139 It has been reported for other health conditions that it is more effective to provide consumer information proactively, for example, using a rang e of media to provide consumer information and, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, it should be assumed that the same is likely to be true for ASD (Recommendation 2.2.3 ). Conversely, teachers and other professionals need to recognise the value of the information held by parents and other family members /whnau . In addition to specialist assessments, it is essential that teachers and parents work together to develop an awareness of the child 's specific strengths and difficulties. Understanding and interpreting this information is often the key to successful interventions and professionals need to find sensitive ways to gather this information from parents and highlight its importance104 106 (Recommendation 2.2.2 ). As well as keeping parents and families well informed, parent education has been identified as one of the most widely accepted intervention methods for children with ASD .140 It has been noted that assessment of factors likely to influence the success and course of intervention is in the early stages of development. An understanding of the key factors influencing the effectiveness of parents as teachers shou ld help: aid choice of intervention and timing to optimise success identify parents who would profit from parent education identify barriers to accessing education and possibly increase maintenance of gains. Two survey studies, each of over 250 mothers who se children were receiving early intervention, showed that the highest preference for services was for parent education activities. This preference rated higher than the preference for other family support activities, including personal/family assistance a nd resource assistance .141 142 Part 2: Support for individuals, f amilies and carers New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 69 Parent education is generally associated with improved family outcomes. Parent education increases the number of intervention hours tha t a child receives and has been shown to help children to generalise and maintain what they have learned, which reduces stress for parents .106 In addition, the use of effective teaching methods for children with ASD results in more adaptive skills for the child, giving family and whnau members access to a wider range of leisure options and more time for one another .104 In order for parent education programmes to be ef fective, parents may first need support in other areas, such as respite care, vocational training, development of peer networks and counselling to deal with their own emotional and mental health issues .106 In su mmary, parent education should: be ongoing, for individual needs change according to the child 's age and circumstances take a variety of forms (eg, face -to-face, distance, video and online) take into consideration family needs, such as work commitments and access to respite care include shared professional learning and development with professionals in the field to lead to a common understanding of needs take into consideration the needs of rural families and whnau (ie, distance education) consider cultura l issues such as differing perceptions and management of disability and the impact of ASD on children 's cultural development where possible, be available in the language of the participant family include services for siblings and other family members .11 104 106 116 Part 2: Support for individuals, families and carers 70 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 2.3 Physical wellbeing Summary of recommendations Recommendation s Grade 2.3.1 Individualised support should be available to people with ASD who require assistance to manage their physical wellbeing and health care. C 2.3.2 Medical assessments should be comprehensive. B 2.3.3 A health -assessment profile for people wi th ASD should be developed and medical and health care practitioners trained in its use accordingly. B 2.3.4 The health -assessment profile should include: screening for mental health issues and the careful surveillance for emergence of epilepsy age-relate d prompts for screening for hearing loss, eyesight changes/ glaucoma, hypertension and metabolic syndrome dietary and exercise guidelines to prevent secondary health issues, especially for those on medication screening for motor, sensory and perceptual dif ficulties. B 2.3.5 People with ASD should have regular health checks, especially if they have an intellectual disability or have ASD symptoms that may impair their ability to self -monitor or report potential heath problems. B 2.3.6 Medical and health car e practitioners should take into account the symptomatology of their ASD clients/patients, and adapt their practices and procedures accordingly. C 2.3.7 The dental needs of people with ASD in New Zealand should be investigated. People with ASD should be p rovided with factual information on dental hygiene tailored to their cognitive level. Dentists should alter their processes and procedures to take into account the symptomatology of their ASD patients. B C B 2.3.8 The quality and quantity of sleep of peo ple with ASD should be considered by health care professionals, and be addressed therapeutically. Medication and behavioural treatment of sleep disorders should be considered. The effectiveness of medication and behavioural treatment of sleep disorders sho uld be further investigated. B C C 2.3.9 Research should be undertaken to identify the needs of people with ASD with regard to constipation, allergies, medication reacti ons, menstruation and exercise. C Part 2: Support for individuals, f amilies and carers New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 71 Recommendation s Grade 2.3.10 In the absence of evidence for effective in terventions to address specific health problems, help should be sought from suitably experienced health professionals. C 2.3.11 All children with ASD should be fully immunised including the MMR vaccine (Measles, Mumps and Rubella) in accordance with the N ew Zealand immunisation schedule. There is no scientific evidence to support the contention that this vaccine has a role in the causation of ASD. A 2.3.12 The effectiveness of health -promotion campaigns with people with ASD should be investigated. Health -promotion campaigns should ensure that people with ASD are included as a specific target group. C C 2.3.13 Recommendations on the health care of people with an intellectual disability should be implemented in relation to people with ASD who also have an intellectual disability. B 2.3.14 Sensory issues in people with ASD should be identified and appropriately addressed by occupational therapists with experience in ASD. These assessments should lead to specific recommendations. B 2.3.15 Methodologically r igorous research is needed to examine the effectiveness of current evaluation methods and treatments used to address sensory issues. B 2.3.a Health needs As described in Part 1 of the ASD Guideline, the health care needs of people with ASD can be complex. Not only do people with ASD have higher likelihood of epilepsy and other co -morbid conditions (see section 1.3 : Differential diagnosis ), but also the appropriate management of their health care needs is complicated by the impact of the symptoms of ASD its elf. For example: the level of social skills development that people with ASD have will affect their understanding of the roles of health care practitioners, their behaviour with the health care practitioner, their understanding of boundaries of the relati onship and their ability to trust and thus disclose personal information communication difficulties can limit the information provided to the health care professional, the understanding that people with ASD have of their health care needs, and the explanat ions, instructions and advice given to them people with restricted and/or re petitive interests may not attend to health care needs at all, or attend to them inappropriately some individuals with ASD experience unusual sensory and perceptual sensitivities ( both hypo - and hyper -responsivity) to a range of experiences including light, sound, taste, touch and pain there may be unpredictable reactions to medication, sleep disturbances, issues with diet and, for some people, engagement in behaviours that can be h armful to themselves. Part 2: Support for individuals, families and carers 72 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline In New Zealand, public sector health services focus on the provision of care in primary health settings. Everyone is encouraged to enrol with a general practitioner (GP). The health care of children known to have ASD is often monitor ed by a paediatrician in addition to the service provided by the general practitioner. However, specialist input usually ceases when the person reaches adulthood. As a result, it is possible that many adults with ASD access only GP care and do not access s pecialist services. Accounts by people with ASD suggest that there are barriers to good health care which include lack of attention to health issues, anxiety, poor communication and confusion and avoidance of contact caused by dissatisfaction with previous contact .33 143 Clearly, some people with ASD need support to manage their physical wellbeing appropriately, and medical and health care practitioners require knowled ge of ASD and how it affects their clients to be able to provide optimum health care services (Recommendation 2.3.1 ). Strategies to improve the current situation could include: comprehensive medical assessments of people with ASD11 routine health care screening144 the development of a health -assessment profile covering: - close surveillance for the development of mental health problems and epilepsy - age-related prompts fo r screening for hearing loss, eyesight changes/glaucoma, hypertension and metabolic syndrome - dietary and exercise guidelines to prevent secondary health issues, especially for those on medication - screening for motor, sensory and perceptual difficulties education in ASD should occur both in initial and in post -qualification training of GPs, nurses and other health care practitioners144-146 educating families, wh nau and carers how to, first, support the person with ASD to attend to their own health care, and second, how to recognise health care issues and get assistance accordingly (Recommendations 2.3.2, 2.3.3, 2.3.4, 2.3.5 and 6.8, Professional learning and dev elopment ). Health care providers have also been advised to: work with the person and their family/ whnau to ensure that their needs are understood work within the interests and strengths of the person with ASD alter agency procedures to take the ASD needs into account (ie, have several short appointments rather than one long one, use the same room each time, fit into their daily routines and use language they understand) communicate clearly use photographs or pictures to explain procedures provide visual an d written information remove stimuli that may distress the person give feedback and encouragement33 47 143 146-149 (Recommendation 2.3.6 ). Part 2: Support for individuals, f amilies and carers New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 73 2.3.b Specific health care issues Acute and emergency care Acute and emergency medical care presents special problems for people with ASD and their parents, carers and families. The very nature of acute illness and the need for urgent medical care means that the child or adult cannot be prepared for the experience. Communication difficulties mean that the individual may not understand the need for unp leasant and invasive procedures, such as establishing intravenous lines. It is important that all health care staff have education in the special needs of people with disabilities, including ASD. Occasionally, sedation or even general anaesthesia may be re quired for procedures that could normally be carried out on fully conscious children or adults. Dental hygiene and care Some evidence exists suggesting that the oral hygiene of some people with ASD is compromised and that people with ASD have increased ris k of caries and periodontitis .147 The only preventative measure recommended in the literature sourced was providing information and explanations on good dental hygiene in a manner suited to people with ASD .147 150 Recommendations to manage problems occurring within a dental consultation include: dentists telling their clients what they are about to do, showing them the procedure, then doing it, rather than simply doing it straight off using short and clear instructions using positive reinforcement using sedation or restraint (an appropriate approved approach by a health professional with specialist skills) to enable treatment and avoid more intrusive measures (after explanation and obtaining written consent) organisational changes to the office and appointment scheduling147 148 151 (Recommendation 2.3.7 ). Sleep disturbance Research suggests that whilst sleeping problems are frequent in normally developing children, children and adults with ASD have significantly more sleep problems .152-154 In particular, adults with ASD appear to have more difficulty falling asleep, report less sleep and sleep of poorer quality, feel more drowsy during the day, are more likely to fall aslee p during free time and need longer periods of sleep at night .154 Research has indicated that children with ASD exhibited the same range of sleep problems as their normally developing peers (eg, difficulty settli ng, night waking, early morning waking, and co-sleeping), but were more sluggish and disoriented after waking .152 Treatment by medication or behavioural sleep management programmes or both has been assessed by r esearch studies, but more research is needed152 153 (Recommendation 2.3.8, see section 4.4.a ). Standard sleep hygiene procedures may be appropriate to use before medi cation and other treatments. Other health issues Issues identified in the literature, but about which no reliable research was found, include constipation, allergies, medication reactions, menstruation and need for regular exercise .155-157 There are examples in the literature of practical suggestions for the health care of people with ASD and advice should also be sought from suitably experienced health professionals158 (Recommendations 2.3.9, 2.3.10 ). Part 2: Support for individuals, families and carers 74 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 2.3.c Immunisation for children who have an ASD Immunisation is an important personal and public health issue. All the diseases for which immunisation is offered have the poten tial to cause serious illness, disability and death. A child who is immunised against a disease is much less likely to contract that disease than a child who has not been immunised. Children who have ASD may not cope with illness as well as their non -disab led peers. In particular, children with ASD (and their parents) find hospital admission very distressing. Immunisation helps to prevent illness. Some parents feel that they do not need to get their child immunised, because they think that disease will be l ess prevalent in the community where many other children are immunised. This is true and is sometimes called herd immunity. However, the proportion of children in New Zealand who complete all their immunisations is not high enough to protect vulnerable mem bers of the community who have not received immunisation, for whatever reason. Parents have been particularly anxious about MMR vaccine (Measles, Mumps and Rubella). This vaccine is given at the age of 15 months in New Zealand. In 1997, a group of workers studying gastrointestinal symptoms in children announced (at a press conference before publication of their work )159 that they had found a link between the development of autistic symptomatology and the prior administration of Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) vaccine. A number of large and well -conducted studies of whole populations have demonstrated that this claim has no basis in fact. The lead worker has subsequently been disciplined by the General Medical Cou ncil in the United Kingdom and has been shown to have had a financial conflict of interest. Expert international review panels (such as, in the United States, the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences), have examined all the evidence an d concluded that there is no causal relationship between either thiomersal or MMR vaccine and autism .160-162 A recent study from Japan, where MMR vaccine was withdraw n for reasons unrelated to the autism controversy, demonstrated that the incidence of ASD continued to rise in a cohort of children, none of whom received MMR .163 Infection with measles, mumps and rubella can ca use significant problems in some children. All these viruses can cause encephalitis and permanent disability. This is very rare as a consequence of infection with the mumps virus and rubella virus, but devastating when it occurs. The evidence strongly indi cates that all children should therefore be immunised according to the New Zealand schedule. Parents should be reassured that there is no scientific evidence to support the hypothesis that the vaccine plays any role in causing ASD (Recommendation 2.3.11 ). 2.3.d Nutrition Full discussion of the nutritional issues in children with ASD is outside the scope of the New Zealand ASD Guideline. Some children who have ASD restrict their intake of food by refusing foods on the basis of smell, taste, texture and colou r. Such children may be very sensitive to small changes in the food offered, such as changing a brand of, for example, bread. Children may also restrict their intake on the basis of how the food is offered, for example refusing to eat if the food is not pr esented on a particular plate, or if certain foods are touching on the plate rather than separated. Often these self -restrictions result in the child taking a very limited range of foods, resulting in concerns that the child 's intake of essential nutrients (especially vitamins and trace elements) is inadequate. Part 2: Support for individuals, f amilies and carers New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 75 In this situation, the child 's nutritional state should be assessed by their general practitioner, paediatrician or a dietitian. Dietary supplements may be recommended. It is acknowledged that access to dietitians who have paediatric experience is limited. Some parents choose to place their child on diets that eliminate certain proteins (especially gluten or casein or both). Parents should ensure that children on these diets also receive adequate inta ke of vitamins and trace elements, especially where the child also self -restricts that range of foods taken. Resources for parents can provide some guidance on this issue .164-166 2.3.e Health promotion The health and physical wellbeing of society in general is frequently targeted by national campaigns on smoking, obesity, driving, alcohol and drug abuse, sexual health and safety, occupational safety and so on. While no research was found which assessed the effectiveness of these campaigns for people with ASD, given their communication, cognitive and social characteristics, it is likely that effectiveness is less than optimum. Adapting national health campaigns in order to more effectively engage people with ASD and their families (eg, through use of visuals and web -based initiatives) and developing ASD -specific campaigns on health issues has been recommended internationally47 144 (Recommendation 2.3.12 ). 2.3.f Issues especially relevant to people who also have an intellectual disability The physical health of the population of people with ASD who are also intellectually disabled is a significant issue. Research into the physical health of people with an intellectual disability found that many have ongoing and complex health needs (often unrecognised) combined with difficulty accessing health care without support and they were often de pendent on others to recognise their need for health services .167 168 Communication issues were linked with impaired assessment, diagnosis, ongoing care and the abili ty to fully inform patients .167 169 Medical care of treatable, relievable or curable conditions was substandard or simply did not occur for some people with an intell ectual disability. They were often over -medicated, treated with outdated medication and unable to access specialist review. The use of psychotropic medication in the absence of psychiatric diagnosis was high and associated with attempts to manage behaviour , without attending to the cause of the behavioural difficulties .144 167 Clearly, recommendations made on the health of people with an intellectual disability are of high relevance to people with ASD, many of who also have an intellectual disability. Recommendations from the National Advisory Committee on Health and Disability state that: The systemic neglect of the health of adults with an intellectual disability [sho uld] be urgently addressed ... directing the Ministry of Health to ensure that primary health care providers are aware of the health needs of adults with an intellectual disability and have: clearly developed policies for access to services comprehensive hea lth assessment tools for people with an intellectual disability appropriate staff education programmes, including peer review processes health -promotion material is produced that is directed towards and accessible by this population Part 2: Support for individuals, families and carers 76 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline prescribing practices f or this population are consistent with current New Zealand best practice guidelines directing the Ministry of Health to ensure that service provider contracts include recognition, and adequate funding and that the disability support role includes assistanc e for people with an intellectual disability to regularly access health care directing District Health Boards to examine access to their secondary and tertiary services for people with an intellectual disability, identify barriers and take active steps to minimise or remove them, and utilise their Disability Services Advisory Committees to provide ongoing monitoring of this '167 (Recommendation 2.3.13 ). 2.3.g Sensory processing Evidence confirms the existence of s ensory and motor difficulties for many children with ASD104 170 (see also section 3.2.c Sensori -motor development ). Most of the research evidence on sensory processin g difficulties is derived from studies on children and young people with ASD but may be relevant to older people with ASD as well. Autopsy studies and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies support the notion that people diagnosed with ASD have differenc es in the parts of the mid-brain associated with movement, the regulation of movement and attention, the symptoms of which may have an impact on a person 's ability to communicate and relate to others .171 People with ASD, their families and carers have observed disordered levels of sensitivity to visual, auditory, olfactory and tactile stimuli. Sensory disorders include a wide range of perceptual experiences, and can cause disordered temperature perception, pressu re and pain thresholds, food intolerance and dietary restrictions and aversive reactions to environmental materials and clothing. Sometimes faulty sensory processing can have negative consequences to health and wellbeing . Assistance to put strategies into place can help people to succeed172 (Recommendation 2.1.14 ). Behaviours that indicate a need for evaluation include: clumsiness; frequently tripping or falling toe walking difficulty throwing or catching a ball unusual grasping patterns when writing poor fine or gross motor movement skills balance problems poor posture over - or under -sensitivity to sound, lights, smell or touch being unusually active or inactive difficulty calming frequently impulsive difficulty with social situations frequent headaches or stomach aches specific or general learning disabilities tendency to obsess often anxious poor eating habits passive or aggressive behaviours developmental regression. Autistic -like symptoms common in blind child ren (but which also occur in non - autistic blind children) include room hugging, spinning themselves and spinning objects, self -stimulation, echolalia and the reversal of pronouns .173 Some blind children fit the diagnostic criteria for ASD ,174 and can be identified using standardised ASD assessment tools, such as the Childhood Autism Rating Scale .175 The literature suggests t hat teachers, family, whnau and carers of visually impaired people with ASD adapt their techniques to take into consideration the Part 2: Support for individuals, f amilies and carers New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 77 dual diagnosis that the person experiences, adapt resources from both fields of work, and ensure that they recognise symptoms of each disorder clearly, rather than simplistically attributing behavioural or emotional problems to other causes (eg, poor parenting skills, impaired mother - child attachment) .173 176 177 Behavioural similarities also exist between deafness and ASD, to the extent that hearing impairment is often suspected in children eventually diagnosed as having ASD. However, some people with ASD are hearing -impaired or deaf as well ,178-181 and ear infections occurred commonly in a sample of 190 children and adolescents with autistic disorder .181 The DSM -IV21 criteria and the Autism Screening Instrument have been used to diagnose ASD in deaf children .179 181 Issues for the support of hearing impaired and deaf people with ASD are the same as those above for blind people. Assessments Abnormal responses to sensory stimuli are so common that they are seen by many as cardinal symp toms of autism despite not being recognised in the DSM IV .140 Sensory processing problems may explain some autistic behaviours and differences in cognitive processes may explain others .182 Poor sensory processing functions can affect learning, play, work, socialisation, health and wellbeing . Low motivation to participate can be the result of medium - term memory, cognitive functioning difficulties and sensory processing disorders, which affect a person 's willingness to embark on tasks because of previous negative experiences. It is important that these issues are identified and properly addressed because they affect how the child responds to the environment, whether in ea rly intervention, home and school settings or in the community .183 184 Assessments and treatment should be carried out by therapists with appropriate experience in AS D.183 Essential elements for a complete multidisciplinary assessment may include assessments to investigate unusual sensory responses, motor planning, coordination difficulties and self -care problems for the per son presenting for diagnosis. Joint assessments are considered preferable. All professionals involved in a multiagency assessment for ASD should be experienced and knowledgeable about ASD and assessment should lead to specific recommendations11 (Recommendation 2.3.14 ). Interventions There is no consistent evidence that sensory -based treatments have special effects (see also section 3.2.c Sensori - motor development ).96 Additional studies are needed to document the unusual sensory processing features and motor functions and their relationship to broader behavioural and educational outcomes. Methodologically rigorous research is needed to examine the effectiveness of current evaluation methods and treatments/interven tions being used by occupational therapists (Recommendation 2.3.15 ). Special forms of occupational therapy are used to help people with ASD to overcome their isolation, progress developmentally, find ways of coping and gain a sense of self and relatedness to the world .185 Some experimental therapies, such as sensory integration therapy, are sometimes tried but there is insufficient evidence to recommend them as it has not been established scientifically that they are effective (see section 4.5 : Other interventions ). Part 2: Support for individuals, families and carers 78 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 2.4 Coordination of services Summary of recommendations Recommendations: Grade 2.4.1 A coordinated service should be provided to families and whnau and they should be supported to access services across sectors. C 2.4.2 Family and whnau support services should be flexible and timely. C 2.4.3 Families , whnau and service users should have direct involvement in planning and implementation of s ervice provision. C Good Practice Point: 2.4.4 A coordinated approach to planning and implementing services should be developed to meet the identified needs of an individual with ASD, including linkage or integration and coordination of multiple service s. This requires further discussion and analysis to support implementation of services. Support and service needs The complex range of emotional and practical difficulties that parents and carers of children with ASD experience tend to change over time .106 116 These often unmet needs include: difficulties accessing diagnostic services anxiety and helplessness before diagnosis; sadness, anger and disappointment at di agnosis and, for some parents, a sense of relief in finding out what is wrong with their child difficulties finding and accessing services (particularly culturally appropriate services) lack of knowledge among medical, educational, social and community ser vice agencies dependency issues and concern about the child 's welfare in the years ahead intolerance, misunderstanding and lack of community acceptance of their child disruptions in family routines and lifestyle limitations, including reduced access to opportunities for social interaction, recreation and leisure activities heavy caregiving responsibilities and 'burn -out' from working intensively on behalf of their children unmet needs such as difficulty accessing respite care and advice about education and behaviour .186-189 Part 2: Support for individuals, f amilies and carers New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 79 To meet these needs it is helpful for families /whnau and carers to: have information on ASD and how it affects the person receive practical assist ance, including preventative services and supports to minimise the need for crisis management have information on support services, ASD groups, rights and entitlements be familiar with services that are available and know how to access them (Recommendation 2.4.1 ) have their needs considered when a needs assessment is undertaken by the Needs Assessment and Service Coordination agency (NASC) know how to act as effective advocates for the child and family have one key person to case manage and liaise with the family and multiagencies know how to access emotional support and counselling, if required know how to access genetic counselling. Family support services need to target families /whnau to increase their capacity to provide for a family member and develop informal and community supports around the family. Services should include flexible and intensive support, planned respite (if required), a range of planned short -term breaks, parent education and empowerment, home -based support, financial support, behavio ural intervention, substitute care and transition services to adulthood190 (Recommendation 2.4.2 ). Families of younger children especially need access to services and supports during school holidays .11 Many families and whnau report that mutual support networks are an important element in their support systems. Individuals who have had experiences similar to their own can provide practical and emotional support. Profe ssionals can play a role in providing information and facilitating parent entry into a support network .191 Many of the issues faced by carers are not inherent to the impairment of the person with ASD but are soc ially constructed .192 Researchers advocate: joint funding, requiring agencies to work collaboratively in providing services more direct involvement of users and families and carers in planning and implementation of service provision (Recommendation 2.4.3 ) more extensive use of the social model of disability in applying welfare policies education and public information so that the public is more accepting of children with disabilities in the community .192 Service coordination The need for service coordination and case management for individuals with ASD is emphasised throughout the ASD Guideline (Good Practice Point 2.4.4 ). The heterogeneity of the condition of ASD (wide range of degree of impairment, age at diagnosis, intellectual ability, personal needs and health status) necessitates a wide range of supports and services. Needs Assessment and Service Coordination (NASC) is the first step for a person to get Government -funded disability support services . www.supportoptions.co.nz Part 2: Support for individuals, families and carers 80 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline The Health Funding Authority (previous funding body whose functions are now fulfilled by the Ministry of Health and District Health Boards) develo ped guidelines for needs assessment and services coordination agencies working with people with ASD and their families/whnau .193 The Health Funding Authority Guidelines recognise that the nature of the needs of people with ASD increases the likelihood that they will need intensive service coordination, with follow - on benefits accruing from an ongoing relationship with their service coordinator. An individualised approach to planning and delivery is seen as parti cularly important for people with ASD. Specific recommendations on the coordination of multiple services are outside the scope of the New Zealand ASD Guideline, but remain critical to the success of its implementation. A number of general principles have b een identified by the workstream leaders to guide the process of service coordination and planning: the ASD coordinator role should carry authority, to ensure effective service outcomes services should be coordinated within and across sectors self-determin ation and person - centred/individualised plans should provide the basis for all coordinated planning services referral pathways should be clarified through Memorandums of Understanding between agencies and services support infrastructure should be developed nationally. Part 3: Education for learners with ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 81 Part 3 Education for learners with ASD \"I am proud of who I am and autism is part of who I am. In fact, you can't separate the autism from what I do, think or am.\" Part 3: Education for learners with ASD 82 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Part 3 Education for learners with ASD This part of the New Zealand ASD Gui deline deals with the range of assessments and interventions for children and young people with ASD in educational settings. It also covers strategies for supporting young people in secondary school and education sector organisations. The principles behind effective education are outlined in terms of their relevance for the various domains of learning. Further information and guidance is provided in Appendix 7, Core elements of effective teaching. Educational programmes that incorporate some of the outlined principles are listed in Appendix 8, Educational interventions. Part 3: Education for learners with ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 83 3.1 Approaches to teaching and learning in the early years This section relates primarily to children below age five, the early childhood population in New Zealand. However, some of the lit erature surveyed included children up to seven years of age. Summary of recommendations Recommendations: Grade 3.1.1 Services should not wait for the diagnostic process to be completed but should be available as soon as a significant developmental need is identified. C 3.1.2 There is no evidence that any single model is effective for teaching every goal to all children with ASD. Models should be chosen to fit the characteristics of the ch ild and the learning situation. B 3.1.3 Decisions about the type of intervention and the degree of intensity should be informed by a skilled team and reflect the child 's developmental stage, characteristics, teaching goals and family preferences. C 3.1.4 Generalisation and maintenance needs to be carefully planned. The l earning of new skills should take place in the child or young person 's usual environment ie, with their usual carers and teachers and with access to peers who do not have ASD. B 3.1.5 Interventions should be monitored and evaluated on an ongoing basis. Where there is lack of progress over a three -month period, changes should be made to the curriculum or intervention goals, the time set aside for instruction, the intensity of the instruction (such as lower teacher -child ratios) or increasing consultation and support for staff. A 3.1.6 Spontaneous communication, socialisation and play goals should be a priority. A 3.1.7 Approaches should emphasise pivotal skills such as spontaneity, initiation, motivation and self -management. C 3.1.8 Services should be ava ilable to ensure a young child is appropriately engaged across a variety of home, educational and community settings in goal -directed activities for at least 15 to 25 hours per week. B 3.1.9 Planning for intervention and evaluation should always take into account not just the child, but also family and whnau variables and outcomes. C 3.1.10 Families and whnau should be part of the team involved in the development of priority goals and intervention plans. C 3.1.11 A child 's educational programme should reflect the child 's interests and the development ally appropriate learning models for his or her age. C Part 3: Education for learners with ASD 84 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Good Practice Points: 3.1.12 Specialist early intervention staff should provide education and support to families , whnau and early childhood teachers in how to provide structure and supports for ch ildren in their natural settings ie, home, early childhood facilities and community. 3.1.13 The literature on educational programmes for young children should be reviewed. 3.1.a The importance of early intervention There is a growing body of evidence that good quality early intervention results in positive outcomes for children with ASD104 194-198 (Recommendation 3.1.1 ). There is some evidence that children who participate in intensive intervention before the age of three have a significantly better outcome than those beginning after five years of age .104 197 Research into interventions for young children with ASD requires the overcoming of many challenges .63 104 195 These include matching sample groups in such a heterogeneous population and controlling for a wide variety of other variables (eg, parents using other therapies or treatments outside the study programme and finding adequate instruments to measure progres s).199 Many factors make it difficult to compare and/or replicate results. For example, studies use different outcome measures to demonstrate progress (eg, IQ, school placement, adaptive behaviour or functional spontaneous language and generalisation) .104 Many of the published studies of early intervention programmes are from university model programmes of early intensive intervention. They tend to involve high staff r atios, occur in artificial or clinical settings and often use research funding. In the United States, many of the clinical programmes operate for the full year .104 These characteristics provide a challenge in co nsidering research findings for New Zealand practice where resources are scarcer and intervention tends to be largely confined to term times (Good Practice Point 3.1.13 ). 3.1.b Theoretical approaches to teaching and learning There are an ever -expanding num ber of approaches for intervening with young children with ASD that have been reported in the literature. Apart from education programmes, there are other treatments which focus on aspects such as diet. In this section, the focus will be only on education -based approaches ( see Part 4 for a discussion of other approaches ). It has been suggested that most educationally based intervention programmes can be categorised as fitting within a continuum of approaches, with discrete trial training at one end and deve lopmental (social pragmatic) approaches at the other .200 There appears to be a trend towards comprehensive programmes which use elements of all the models. The models can be characterised as: discrete trial trai ning (DTT)/traditional behavioural approaches, for example, Lovaas Young Autism Project201 202 approaches which draw on recent behavioural and developmental research, for example, Pivotal Response Training203 and SCERTS204 developmental (social pragmatic) approaches, for example, 'Floortime '.205 206 Part 3: Education for learners with ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 85 The approaches represent a continuum of different philosophies and outcomes. They differ on a number of characteristics such as: the degree of prescription of the teaching versus flexibility; whe ther the approach is adult - or child -centred; whether the emphasis is on 'response ' or 'initiation '; the naturalness of the learning context; achieving generalisation; artificial versus natural reinforcers; and the role of typically developing peers .200 Programmes also differ in the outcomes they aim to achieve. At one end of the continuum are traditional behavioural approaches such as DTT, which is designed to remediate ASD with the desired outcome being 'recove ry'. At the other end are the developmental approaches, which place greater emphasis on acceptance and adapting to the child, and which consider a good outcome to be for individuals to realise their full potential regardless of the extent of their ASD. Discrete trial training Applied behaviour analysis (ABA) is a branch of behavioural psychology which, in its broadest sense, is defined as the study of observable interactions between humans and their environment. ABA includes a wide range of techniques. The focus in education has been to improve instruction so that it results in learning that makes socially important changes in students ' lives .207 One of the original techniques of ABA was DTT and this has resulted in some confusion over the use of the term ABA to only represent this single technique .196 DTT is an instructional technique in which a task or trial is isolated and taught to an individual by being repeatedly p resented to them. Responses are recorded for each trial or command, and the trial is continued until the individual has demonstrated mastery. The controversy that accompanies debates about ABA usually revolves around a few specific programmes which use tra ditional DTT methods, such as the Lovaas ' intensive behavioural therapy201 and other programmes that use similar principles. The controversy focuses on a number of issues: (1) skills of the therapists, (2) inten sity of the programme and (3) lack of flexibility. 1. DTT programmes often rely on a non - educationally qualified 'therapist ' following a pre -set programme. Although the therapist is trained in delivering the programme, researchers have questioned the appro priateness of one -to-one instruction with an individual who may not have the skills and knowledge to plan, implement and evaluate a programme using best practices for children with ASD .208 2. Traditional DTT met hods specify a level of intensity for all children; this can become controversial for several reasons. First, each child is an individual and it is unlikely that the same levels of intensity will apply for each. Second, traditional DTT programmes have tend ed to take a more -is-better, follow -the-manual format which is not individualised. Third, a highly intensive programme is a costly programme, which tends to put funders and parents in conflict .208 3. Proponents of DTT -type behavioural programmes often advocate education for up to 40 hours a week in a one -to- one context to achieve 'recovery '. This is in conflict with the evidence that there is neither a cure for ASD nor a single educational technique that can or should be used exclusively to meet the needs of individuals with ASD. The most appropriate and efficacious programmes for children with ASD employ a variety of practices, including a systematic and ongoing Part 3: Education for learners with ASD 86 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline evaluation of interventions and treatments .11 104 199 200 209 More recent developments in ABA Many other ABA techniques have been developed, in some cases to address weaknesses in the early discrete trial techniques, such as generalisation. In contemporary ABA (which may involve incidental teaching, pivotal response training, naturalistic teaching and milieu teaching), there is a pre ference for carrying out interventions in naturalistic settings and involving the most appropriate or natural person for that setting. Usually, if goals are taught in a one -on-one situation in isolated settings, this is only for a very brief time with 'real-life' generalisation and maintenance being an important outcome .104 200 207 209 210 These ABA programmes, unlike traditional ABA approaches, sometimes start with adult -directed goals, but control is shared or shifted to the child as soon as possible. Initiation and spontaneity are important elements and teachers are encouraged to follow the child 's lead and interests. Observations, functional assessments, naturally occurring events and developmental factors determine the next goals for the child .200 It has been advocated that, with appropriate training a nd support, the broader ABA principles c an be adopted by parents, family , teachers and teaching assistants and used in both inclusive educational and community settings .209 Developmental pragmatic approaches Developmental pragmatic approaches advocate using the child 's natural interests and motivations to re -establish the developmental sequence of communicating with and relating to others .211 These approaches are the m ost recent of the three broad categories of approaches and have not yet been fully evaluated. They have as their foundation the literature on cognitive, social and communication development. The context for learning is considered very important and activit ies and events are chosen for their interest and motivation for the child. Teaching may not be confined to a set time and an emphasis is placed on using a variety of social situations and routines .200 Researcher s have identified a number of characteristics of the social pragmatic developmental approaches: focus on teaching spontaneous social communication emphasis on building multi -modal communication repertoires, for example, speech, gestures, augmentative commu nication control is shared and turn -taking encouraged learning is done within meaningful activities and events children are involved in a variety of social groupings child development sequences influence the development of goals visual and gestural support s are used to aid the child 's understanding focus on helping the child to develop socially appropriate means to gaining some social control, for example, ways to protest emotional expression and affect are central to the development of relationships and le arning .200 (For a further description of the programmes mentioned in this section see Appendix 8, Educational interventions. ) Part 3: Education for learners with ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 87 3.1.c Implications for practice Which is the best intervention? No one model has been shown to meet the needs of all children with ASD104 196 199 200 212 213. All the models have something to offer in certain situations. The skill of the professional is knowing when to use which model to meet the needs of particular children, situations and skills .197-200 The most appropriate and efficacious programmes for children with ASD employ a variety of practices, including a systematic and ongoing evaluation of interventions11 104 199 200 211 (Recommendation 3.1.2 ). Young children with ASD can be expected to make significant progress when diagnosed early and exposed to structured, consistent approaches that are based on effective models and educational methods .199 210 211 What is known about the characteristics of quality intervention programmes? A number of characteristics of successful programme s have been identified .104 194 210 1. Making the earliest possible start to intervention Early intervention services shou ld be available as soon as a significant developmental difficulty is recognised, even if the full diagnostic process has not been completed .104 194 210 Services should be provided in home and community settings as well as in early childhood education services according to the developmental needs of the child and family circumstances104 194 197 210 (Recommendation 3.1.1 ). 2. Individualising services for children and families and whnau Individual plans should be dev eloped for children who are identified as having specific ASD needs .194 The development of plans requires access to a team of skilled, knowledgeable professionals who can work with the family and, where appropri ate, early childhood teachers to assess the child in his/her usual setting and provide information and support to decide on goals to meet the child 's needs210 (Good Practice Point 3.1.12 ). Research suggests that it is important that such individualisation incorporate the child 's interests and motivations as well as developmental needs .104 Developing and maintaining an individual profile for the child can help with this .11 200 Services and interventions should also match the needs, priorities, concerns and interests of families .194 197 210 Professionals ' knowledge of the family 's current goals should be updated on a regular basis210 (Recommendation 3.1.3 ). 3. Providing sys tematic 'planful ' teaching Systematic goal -directed teaching needs to be carefully planned and have a strong conceptual base .194 210 Optimal strategies may be differe nt depending on whether a new skill is being taught or an existing behaviour generalised .63 Those working with children need to be familiar with a range of interventions and in what circumstances they can be use d appropriately .195 199 213 214 While adequate individual instruction is crucial to early learning, the greatest effect for children with ASD lies in the generalisation of that learning, which is achieved through working with early childhood education personnel and parents. Generalisation and maintenance need to be carefully plann ed and are more likely to be attained when skills are taught Part 3: Education for learners with ASD 88 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline in natural contexts and routines104 200 207 (Recommendation 3.1.4 ). There is little long -term value in individual therapies unless the techniques are taught to and used regularly by the child and people who work with him or her in natural contexts .63 199 200 210 An important aspect of systematic teaching is ongoing evaluation and assessment .104 196 210 Measures need to go beyond traditional cognitive and language skills and look at characteristics such as emotional development, motivation, social competence and functioning in natural environments .200 There are many assessment tools and techniques. Learning Stories ,215 which is a narrative -based form of assessment and currently widely used in New Zealand early childhoo d education services, may be one useful technique to document these developments. However, for this to be useful for children with ASD, the observer needs to have a good working knowledge of ASD and how it affects the particular child being observed .215 Whenever possible, observations and assessment are most effectively conducted in the child 's natural environment .200 216 If a lack of progress towards goals is seen over a three -month period, consideration needs to be given to one or more changes such as in the degree of intensity through lowering child -teacher ratios, increasing time for instruction and practice, adapting the curriculum or intervention goals or providing extra consultation and support to staff104 210 (Recommendation 3.1.5 ). It is crucial that all staff have appropriate education and qualifications in ASD and have professional learning and development, opportunities and time to develop the skills and knowledge that early intervention teams need to be effective11 63 104 210 (Recommendation 6.18, Professional learning and development ). 4. Providing a curriculum to meet the needs of the young child wi th ASD Priority should be given to goals that emphasise functional spontaneous communication and social development, including play104 194 196 197 200 210 213 (Recommendation 3.1.6 ). Other importan t areas relate to the enhancement of a child 's ability to participate in and have some control over his/her environment .104 194 200 Provision of proactive interventions for behaviour challenges, which usually involve teaching the child alternative skills and making environmental and learning adaptations, is another high priority .104 210 There is evidence that addressing 'pivotal ' areas will have the greatest probability of positive effects in many areas of functioning .63 196 197 Pivotal skills training203 addresses teaching core areas of functioning such as improving motivation, responding to multiple cues, self - management and self -initiation of social interactions. This is in conflict with the notion of targeting many individual or narrowly defined behaviours196 (Recommendation 3.1.7 ). Some possible important pivotal skills that children need to function in the classroom or early childhood setting may include the abilities to: attend imitate others with understanding, not irrelevantly comprehend and use language/have a good communication system in place play appropriat ely with toys develop and apply cognitive skills appropriately interact socially appropriately with others .217 Part 3: Education for learners with ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 89 5. Intensity of engagement of the child Intervention for the young child with ASD (ie, those below e ight years) requires intensity, but the optimal amount of intensity for different children is still not determined .197 Hours of intensive intervention do not necessarily equate to effective practice or improved outcomes. The quality of the intervention/education is at least as important as its intensity .196 The intensity of an intervention is not synonymous with the number of teacher aide hours or the hours of attendan ce at an early childhood education centre. It may include time engaged with parents and other carers who are incorporating the goals for the child into family routines and play. For typically developing children, providing an opportunity to participate in a developmentally appropriate activity is sufficient to have an educational benefit. For children with ASD, opportunities to participate are not always utilised by the child and it is suggested that educational opportunity is more appropriately measured, not by hours of attendance, but by hours of engagement63 194 - although there is considerable debate about how engagement is defined .11 104 194 195 199 200 For the purposes of this guid eline, a child is 'engaged ' when he or she is focused on systematically planned, developmentally appropriate activities (either in the home or in an educational setting) leading towards identified objectives .104 A more naturalistic model might define engaged time as any time in which the child is interacting and responding (rather than just being present) during activities such as: play sessions reading or sharing one-to-one parent -child time time in an early chi ldhood education setting where the child is engaged in goals related to his/her individual plan activities such as shopping and bath time, where there is a deliberate intention to practice skills or engage in interactions. Many different approaches may be used to achieve this intensity. The choice will depend on the goal, the developmental level of the child and the setting. For children with ASD to make progress, they need to be engaged in developmentally appropriate activities or interactions for at least 15 to 25 hours a week11 104 194 199 217 (Recommendation 3.1.8 ). However, individual decisions about intensity need to be made with consideration for the child 's stage of development and family preferences and needs .63 104 This engagement can occur in the home and community as well as in early childhood education settings. Early childhood teachers need education to understand that, for this group of children, the opportunity to participate does not of itself constitute engagement .104 There are resource implications in providing support for such intensity across a range of settings and with a variety of adults as teachers. 6. Sustainable family involvement Planning for intervention and ev aluation should consider not just child but also family /whnau variables and outcomes63 200 213 (Recommendation 3.1.9 ). Family -centred services are already a well recognised and important part of New Zealand early childhood education and this approach is to be supported and encouraged. Particular consideration needs to be given to how early intervention services can incorporate the cultural values of the family /whnau in developi ng individual plans .194 210 213 214 Part 3: Education for learners with ASD 90 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Families and whnau need to be part of t he team involved in the development of priority goals and intervention plans (Recommendation 3.1.10 ). The family 's perception that the goals chosen are socially valid is of the utmost importance .214 If they wish , they should receive support and training so that they can incorporate the generalisation of skills into daily routines .104 194 197 210 213 7. Structured environments A structured environment for young children with ASD is strongly recommended .104 194 200 This structure can relate to both the physical and social environment as well as the instructional environment. Early childhood education environments have an emphasis on social interaction and negot iation, which is the core difficulty for children with ASD. Teachers need education in how to provide structure within these environments (eg, the use of visual supports) (the importance of structure is explored more fully in section 3.2). Families may als o need support and education in this area .104 210 8. Developmentally appropriate practices Although children with ASD require certain areas of the curriculum to be emphasised with mo re intense teaching and learning opportunities, it is important that the activities and methods chosen are developmentally appropriate .104 194 195 213 For the very young child, this often means learning through play and following their interests (Recommendation 3.1.11 ). Developmentally appropriate practice is an important tenet both in research and in New Zealan d early childhood education services. Te Whriki emphasises this point .218 9. Intervention in natural environments and with access to typically developing children Best practice for children with ASD is not achi eved by teaching in isolated settings away from other children and the quality of an intervention is at least as important as its duration .104 194 199 200 Inclusion of children with ASD in regular settings is a common early childhood education practice in New Zealand, but the lack of structure and high noise levels in these settings may make it d ifficult for some young children with ASD to participate without careful planning. Both home and early childhood education settings are natural environments for young children, and services should be available in both, according to family preference and ch ild need .194 200 216 Links with Te Wh riki - the New Zealand early childhood curriculum New Zealand is fortunate and unique in having an early childhood education curriculum. Te Whriki (the New Zealand early childhood education curriculum) draws on an ecological perspective to highlight how the child 's learning environments extend to incorporate family, whnau , community and professional relationships and settings. The strands of Te Whriki are: wellbeing - mana atua belonging mana reo exploration - mana aot roa. These strands provide a very comprehensive framework within which goals for the young child with ASD can be developed in collaboration with families and whnau. Part 3: Education for learners with ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 91 3.1.d Transitions and young children The young child particularly requires structure at times of transition. Transitions occur when changing environments as part of the daily routine (eg, home to early childhood education centre), changing activities (eg, meal time to bath time) and when changing to a new education setti ng (eg, beginning school). These transitions require careful planning for both the child and the new environment .217 A key transition is to move from home to an early childhood education setting and from there t o school. A survey has identified a number of successful programmes for young children with ASD. The following useful strategies have been suggested: preparing children to function as independently as possible from the beginning. This may begin by teaching imitation and attention to adults and then particular skills taught in small steps actively teaching 'survival skills ', for example, turn -taking, sitting quietly during activities, listening to directions from both near and afar, communicating basic needs members of the team around the child visiting the new setting and considering the demands of the environment and teaching the child the skills needed, for example, putting belongings into a tray or locker, indicating they need to go to the toilet, putting toys away members of the team from the current setting providing information, support and education to the staff in the new setting planning the transition to the new setting with visits which take place on a gradual basis using social stories and other v isual strategies to introduce the new setting and the people in it217 219 220 (see section 3.4 for a further discussion o f transitions ). Part 3: Education for learners with ASD 92 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 3.2 Teaching specific curriculum areas in early childhood and school years This section looks in detail at a number of different areas of curriculum for children and young people with ASD in educational settings and how they influence l earning. It covers communication and literacy skills, social development, sensori -motor development, cognitive skills and self -management skills. 3.2.a Communication and literacy skills Summary of recommendations Recommendations: Grade 3.2.1.1 Communicati on should be seen as a high -priority learning area, and communication goals should be included in individual plans for all children and young people with ASD. A 3.2.1.2 The assessment and development of communication and social goals should complement eac h other. Teaching of the two areas should be carried out in parallel. C 3.2.1.3 Encouraging initiations and spontaneous communication should be a key focus of intervention.

B Good Practice Point: 3.2.1.10 All children with ASD sho uld have an assessment and intervention suggestions by a speech -language therapist with expertise in ASD at a minimum of once a year, more often in early childhood. Part 3: Education for learners with ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 93 Background Communication is one of the most well - researched areas in ASD .104 However, most of the research and evidence relate to populations of younger children (mostly 3 to 5 years old). There is very little research relating to school -aged children and those below age three. It is recognised th at one of the greatest sources of stress for parents may be the communication difficulties of their child with ASD .197 Communication is a core difficulty for all children with ASD, but there is a wide diversity of skills among individuals. Impairments can range from a failure to develop any functional communication at all to the development of apparently good language, but with unusual elements .104 197 Whi le research studies report that between one-third and one -half of children with classic autism do not develop functional language, this may not reflect the effectiveness of current interventions .104 The use of s pontaneous communicative speech in children with ASD before the age of five indicates good prognosis for IQ, language, adaptive skills, and academic achievement in adolescence .104 197 Development of communication skills is also closely correlated with the development of social behaviour .197 Communication is a complex process and has several different aspects. 1. Receptive comm unication This is the process by which messages from others are comprehended. Children with ASD have two core difficulties in this area: difficulties with auditory processing - receiving and making sense of auditory information problems with comprehension, including: - difficulties attac hing meaning to words - lack of prior experience, context or knowledge - impaired understanding of facial expressions, body language and other non -verbal communication features - inability to attend, or lack of interest - a tendency to attend to environmental cues rather than attaining real understanding of verbal language - a tendency to interpret statements literally. 2. Expressive communication This describes the process by which information or messages are sent to other people. It includes: getting attention know ing what you want having a label or symbol for what you want using language, signing, pictures or other non -verbal communication strategies being able to use alternative or 'repair ' strategies when not understood understanding the social and pragmatic rules that guide communication processes. Joint attention, symbol use, imitation, developing conventional means of communication and understanding the social and pragmatic rules of communication are particular difficulties for children with ASD .63 104 3. Joint attention Joint attention is the ability to coordinate attention between people and objects and is indicated by behaviours such as looking at people, drawing others ' attention to objects and events to share experiences, following Part 3: Education for learners with ASD 94 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline the gaze or attention of another person and sharing emotions. Joint attention is regarded as a pivotal skill for communication and is considered to be a significant predictor of language outc omes compared with all other non-verbal indicators .104 197 4. Symbol use This involves learning to use conventional gestures and understanding and using the conventional meaning for words. It also includes learning to use objects functionally and in symbolic play. Children with ASD often find these skills difficult, but an understanding of symbol use is regarded as an important basis for communication .104 197 Many children with ASD find visual quasi -symbols, such as photos and pictograms which are more static, easier to comprehend than verbal language .104 221 5. Social pragmatic skills Communication interventions have traditionally focused on unusual aspects of speech, such as echolalia (imitating the speech of others), pronoun reversal and unusual intonation. More recent research has emphas ised the functional aspects and social or pragmatic aspects of communication, such as sharing attention (joint attention) or using and noticing non - verbal cues such as gestures and facial expressions .104 Childre n and young people who develop fluent speech may still have difficulty with social rules governing conversation .104 Difficulties with prosody, which includes rate, rhythm, inflection and volume, also provide cha llenges which need to be addressed .222 6. Echolalia Children with ASD who learn to talk often use echolalia as they start to communicate .104 Echolalia can be immediat e (ie, an echo of something just spoken) or delayed (ie, refer to an event in the past). This speech initially serves as a label for a particular situation but may at later stages serve a variety of communicative functions .223 Many children eventually learn to break these scripts down into smaller, more meaningful chunks .197 Even after children have developed more fluent speech, echolalia may reappear when the child is confused or fat igued .223 7. Unconventional behaviours Children who do not develop fluent communication skills may use inappropriate or unconventional behaviours such as tantrums, aggression or self -injury as means of communica tion. Improvements in communication have been found to be a key factor in improving and preventing problem behaviours .104 197 There is strong support for functional communication tra ining - where the communicative function of a behaviour is identified and an appropriate communication form (including signs, visual symbols or language) is taught as an alternative to the challenging behaviour. This intervention has the advantage of teach ing the individual to communicate, as well as reducing undesirable behaviours104 197 200 221 (this is discussed in more deta il in section 3.2.e: Self - management skills and addressing challenging behaviour ). Approaches to interventions In the 1970s and 1980s, the developmental pragmatic literature which looked at the development of communication for social purposes began to infl uence interventions for children with ASD .200 Speech is only one form of communicating, but in the past it has been seen as the main focus for intervention for children with ASD .63 However, without a good understanding of the social purpose of communication, the child may never make Part 3: Education for learners with ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 95 use of the words they learn to communicate with others .200 Most children understand a lot about communicating before they lea rn to speak and it is equally important for children with ASD to develop this pre -verbal knowledge. Very young typically developing children begin to communicate using informal means such as gestures - for example, raising their arms to be picked up, or po inting. Young children with ASD may have a limited range or unconventional gestures for their communication. They are likely to use communication to regulate another person 's behaviour, such as requesting something by taking someone 's hand and leading them to the object, and they are less likely to use the more socially oriented functions such as pointing to draw another person 's attention to something .223 Implications for professional practice The research stron gly indicates that improving communication is a very high priority for children with ASD .11 The assessment and development of communication and social goals should complement each other. Teaching of the two area s should be carried out in parallel104 200 (Recommendations 3.2.1.1, 3.2.1.2 ). One study reports success in teaching young children joint attention skills and symbolic play which gen eralised to playing with caregivers .224 There is increasing evidence for the importance of encouraging initiation and spontaneous communication197 (Recommendation 3.2.1.3 ). A child 's attempts to initiate will tend to result in others finding strategies to understand and communicate with them, which is likely to result in further positive initiations .104 197 The research increasingly emphasises the importance of interventions which take place in natural settings, within natural routines and which use natural consequences (Recommendation 3.2.1.4 ). These activities are often built on the child 's interests .63 104 197 Children will benefit from communication goals that are carefully planned and implemented by teachers and carers throughout the curricul um and throughout the day, rather than in one -to-one therapy sessions in a clinical setting on a more intermittent basis. Speech -language therapists will need skills in scaffolding teachers ' and carers ' learning to support such interventions197 (Recommendation 6.6, Professional learning and development ). Interventions which emphasise the capacity to understand the purpose of communication rather than simply focusing on the form of the message (eg, learning to say words) are most important .63 104 Children who learn speech and language out of the social context may become prompt -dependent in their use of language and fail to generalise their learning to other settings and partners .197 200 Assessment and goal setting The most functional and relevant communication abilities that children acquire emerge from self -generated and self-motivate d goals. Assessment of the function or purpose of their communicative acts is as essential as an assessment of the means (words, informal gestures, pictures etc) they use to communicate their message. Consequently, effective assessments include observation s in natural settings and in activities that involve peers and significant adults .223 Formal measures should always be supplemented by informal assessments which include observations across a variety of settings and activities, and interviews Part 3: Education for learners with ASD 96 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline with significant adults11 (Recommendation 3.2.1.5 ). Aspects which need to be assessed include eye gaze, facial expression, the child 's range of communicative functions and use of gestures .104 When assessing immigrants and others where English is not their first language it is important that interpreters and translators are available. The most effective communication assessments are those performed by members of a multidisciplinary team in conjunction with assessments of other aspects of development .11 Consideration should be given to how these assessments relate to and influence each other, and goals based on these assessments need to be planned with the child 's teacher and embedded in the child 's day. An assessment of the communicative demands of the environments the child is in, as well as an assessment of the child, is required to do this eff ectively11 104 (Recommendation 3.2.1.6 ). For older children and \"higher functioning \" young people, assessments should include pragmatic aspects of communication such as their understanding of figurative language, ability to read the emotions and reactions of others and ability to communicate and understand abstract ideas225 (Recommendation 3.2.1.7 ). It is also important to consider their ability to engage in conversation and repair breakdowns in communication .104 Outcome measures When evaluating the success of interventions, consideration should be given to i ncreases in: the initiation of spontaneous communication The emphasis should move from simply measuring 'verbal behaviour ' (eg, the ability to say words) to considering 'spontaneous communication ' (ie, the ability to send a message to another person). Many children with ASD have a tendency to become cue dependent if every effort is not made to encourage spontaneity. greater participation in functional activities An important goal for developing communication is an emphasis on skills which allow the child or young person to interact with many people and participate in a wide array of activities in a wide range of places. generalisation of communication skills across environments and partners Children and young people with ASD may not generalise new communicat ive skills with others unless this is specifically addressed. This generalisation should be encouraged across a variety of partners, places and events. conventional communicative means which are understood by a wider range of partners The emphasis on 'comm unication ' acknowledges that there are many ways of conveying a message to another person. In the beginning, many idiosyncratic means may be used which only those who know the child well may interpret. A valued outcome is the use of increasingly convention al means. The ultimate aim of all intervention is increasing competence in the natural settings associated with the child 's life.63 104 197 223 Teaching strategies 1. Use of augmentative communication There is a considerable body of evidence to support the use of augmentative communication strategies with children and young people with ASD .11 104 219 221 226 These strategies are used to support existing speech or as part of a multimodal system of communication which may include gestures .221 Part 3: Education for learners with ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 97 Augmentative communication interventions tend to suit the distinctive strengths and needs of children with ASD. These can effectively support both expressive and receptive communication. The most commonly used are those with visual symbols, for example, photos, pictures, objects or written words. They include: visual timetables schedules to outline the steps of a task rules or instructions in visual form commun ication boards or books .221 The rationale for their use includes the: strong visual processing of many children with ASD predictable and static nature of visual information close and obvious relationship of the picture to the c oncept it represents role such interventions may play in assisting children to rely on visual or symbol recognition to understand rather than relying simply on memory recall .104 Research suggests that aided symb ol use (such as photographs, line drawings, symbols or written words) may enhance the development of speech in individuals with ASD. There appears to be no evidence that the use of augmentative communication strategies, in conjunction with language instruc tion, delays the acquisition of speech. This research includes those who are older than five years .104 Two studies reported on the use of PECS (Picture Exchange Communication System) with children in the early c hildhood years and school -aged children. All students demonstrated an increase in speech and there was some evidence of generalisation to non -intervention settings .227 228 Using manual signs as augmentative communication are less often successful. They are often difficult for children to use because of motor planning and motor imitation difficulties. However, manual signs used by others may be useful for some children to supplement their understanding .104 221 It is important to make a careful selection from the many resources available for the most appropriate intervention or device. Like all inte rventions with this population, careful assessment and planning is required. Consideration needs to be given to: receptive and expressive communication skills communication needs and desires cognitive skills sensory characteristics abilities of the communi cation partner(s) environments and their demands environmental barriers .221 Evaluation of the effectiveness of any resource needs to be done in a natural setting to ensure that its use has been generalised .226 Use of visual supports and technology can effectively assist with this goal by supporting development of both expressive and receptive communication. Significantly, low -technology augmentative communication tools, such as picture systems, can b e relatively simple and inexpensive to implement104 (Recommendation 3.2.1.8 ). 2. Computers While there is little research on specific computer programmes for individuals with ASD, there is some evidence that com puter technology may enhance motivation, increase attention, and reduce challenging behaviour in individuals across the ability range .221 Computer -based schemes are seen as particularly valuable for literacy development .219 229 Part 3: Education for learners with ASD 98 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 3. Literacy skills In the past, despite demonstrating skills directly related to literacy, some children with ASD have been labelled as too cognitively impaired or not ready for literacy instructio n.230 There is some evidence of situations where individuals without verbal language skills have learnt to read and write .230 Often children and young people 's interests have been dismissed as 'stim ming ' (self -stimulatory behaviours) when they could have been used to channel the students into activities enabling them to read, write, draw and communicate about their special interest or obsession (eg, trucks), at least until the interest wanes and drif ts into another .230 Some children with ASD have hyperlexia, which is being able to read words beyond what would be predicted on the basis of cognitive and language scores. This often presents as early (at age 2 to 5 years) comp ulsive or indiscriminate reading of words, which develops in the absence of direct instruction. The decoding skills of these children appear to outstrip their understanding of the text. Research shows that hyperlexia in ASD tends to be associated with gene ral receptive language difficulties rather than with reading comprehension per se. This is often combined with a lack of background knowledge about the topic due to their restricted experience of the world. Children with ASD are capable of learning to unde rstand what they read, but it should not be assumed that they can comprehend all the words they are able to decode. Hyperlexia occurs in children with a wide range of disabilities, but disproportionately in children with ASD (up to 10%) .221 230 Most children and young people will benefit from literacy instruction that incorporates multiple instructional strategies to teach skills such as decoding, analogy, prediction and sight words230 (Recommendation 3.2.1.9 ). Research into teaching literacy to children with ASD is inconclusive, but emerging themes include: some children with ASD can sight -read words without teacher -directed rote drill interventions that use recommended practices for children without disabilities are also useful for children with ASD literacy -rich early childhood education service environments can promote literacy learning. The recommended intervention is a balanced one that incorporates all the processes that are known to be involved in successful literacy learning .221 Part 3: Education for learners with ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 99 3.2.b Social development Summary of recommendations Recommendations: Grade 3.2.2.1 Social assessment should be carried out in a variety of natural settings with both adults and peers as social partners. C 3.2.2.2 Goals should be functional a nd consider family and whnau preferences. C 3.2.2.3 Social interventions should take place in natural settings and within natural activities as much as possible.1 A 3.2.2.4 Interventions using carefully trained and supported typically developing peers should be encouraged. A 3.2.2.5 All social intervention plans should include generalisation and maintenance strategies. A 3.2.2.6 Support and training should be provided to families (including siblings) and whnau to develop social skills interventions in the home. C Good Pra ctice Point: 3.2.2.7 Socialisation goals should be included in all individual education plans. Background Social difficulties are one of the core impairments for children with autism .102 104 216 231 232 Social challenges may appear in the first few months of life .216 One of the earliest signs is a lack of normal response to physical contact .231 Studies show, however, that children with ASD tend to have standard attachment patterns with their par ents or carers .104 The social interactions of children with ASD are characterised by low rates of both initiations and responses. This includes non -verbal communication such as gestures and facial expressions as well as verbal interactions .104 This difficulty is most marked in interactions for the purpose of sharing experiences and establishing a joint focus of attention, rather than in initiations to have needs met an d continue pleasurable experiences .104 233 1 Research on social skills groups for young people and adults was comprehensively updated as part of the living guideline process. It is summarised in Appendix 10.6, and is available as full text from the Ministry of Health website .17 (Also see new recommendation 4.2.1a, and new good practice points 4.2.1b and 4.2.1c in Chapter 4. ) Part 3: Education for learners with ASD 100 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Children with ASD have significant difficulties in relating to peers, using non - verbal communicative behaviours, imitating (actions, mov ements and vocalisations), and using and understanding symbolic or dramatic play .216 231 They pay less attention to other people 's emotions and tend to demonstrate fewer acts of empathy or shared emotion than do children who do not have ASD .104 As the nature of the communication impairments has been more accurately researched, it has become easy to see that social competence is closely related to impairments in verbal and non -verbal communication .231 Research has identified subgroupings of children on the basis of their social responsiveness: passive (few initiations but positive r esponses), aloof (indifferent in all situations, particularly with other children), 'active but odd ' (seeks out interactions but uses odd language, focuses on obsessional topics and lacks understanding of others) and 'over formal and stilted ' (excessive fo rmality and difficulties with the subtleties of social situations) .104 These groupings can be useful to help focus interventions and set priorities. Lack of speech does not prevent the development of increased s ocial skills, but social interactions do require communication to initiate and respond, which underlines the importance of matching interventions to the child or young person 's communication skills .104 Explicit teaching of social behaviour needs to be part of the individual plan for any child or young person with ASD throughout his or her life .210 216 232 Verbal and \"higher functioning \" children and young people Despite their command of language and sometimes their desire to interact, \"higher functioning \" children and young people with ASD are often unable to use their verbal skill s to successfully enter the social fray.232 These children tend towards repetitive enactments of solitary routines around their obsessive interests and either avoid social play or approach peers in ways that are unlikely to be reciprocated .233 Older children and young people have difficulty with peer relationships and demonstrating social and emotional reciprocity .234 235 Social difficulties are thought to be a reason for the high rates of depression, which are often seen in \"higher functioning \" adolescents .232 236 In adolescence, young people begin to engage in social interaction primarily by conversation and this provides many challenges for the young person with ASD .232 Approaches to interventions Interventions t o enhance social development need to be carefully planned and systematic .237 Particular care should be given to planning for generalisation and maintenance .104 216 238 Practitioners need to be fluent in a range of approaches so that they can choose what is most appropriate for the teaching of specific skills and for particular settings. It is also important to match the approach to the developmental level and needs of the particular child .104 Researchers advocate that it is important for teachers and other professionals to draw on their own theory of mind to try and ap preciate their student 's view of the world when planning interventions .233 Part 3: Education for learners with ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 101 Implications for professional practice Assessment Different aspects of socialisation require different forms of assessment. Areas to be assessed Because communication is the process by which people carry out social relationships, social and communication assessments and the goals and objectives that follow need to be considered hand in hand .104 238 Play is an important social activity for children; therefore, play skills also need to be assessed .104 Researchers recommend an assessment of the sensory preferences of very youn g children .237 These data will allow teachers and practitioners to more efficiently predict the features of toys which will be the most reinforcing. The interests and preferences of all children and young people will need to be understood if activities and materials are to be motivating .210 232 238 Assessment techniques and tools Developmental scales may also be useful for assessing general social development. However, children with ASD often do not demonstrate typical patterns of development .104 Many researchers report that the ability to carry out targeted observations is a key skill for practitioners .231 233 239 Observation allows information to be gath ered on unusual forms of expression of needs and emotional states which may be missed by other forms of assessment .233 Observations need to include the child 's actual behaviours, including: initiations responses length of rounds interest in others proximity to others .104 However, data on the behaviours of the child alone are not sufficient. Observation should also include the reciprocal nature of social interactions, t hat is, who does what and with whom and the effect of this on social interactions. The degree of responsiveness and the skill of peers are also important aspects of the assessment and planning of the intervention .239 Observations using the type of narrative assessment with which early childhood teachers in New Zealand are familiar (such as Learning Stories) might be a useful tool for analysing social learning repertoires and interactions with peers. A range of se ttings should be used for assessment. Social assessment should be carried out in a variety of natural settings (such as classrooms, community settings and homes) and should include both children and adults as interactive partners104 216 (Recommendation 3.2.2.1 ). Goal setting and outcome measures Social goals need to be very carefully designed and implemented and should form part of each child 's overall education plan (Good Practice Po int 3.2.2.7 ). Early goals for interacting with adults need to include joint attention, turn taking, imitation, responding to gaze, initiating social interactions and engagement with toys.104 237 Encouragement to play in or nearby similar activities as peers and share materials, as well as to watch and imitate the gross motor actions of other children, are also important goals .237 Goals for school -aged children may include communication, participating in classroom routines, responding to adult directions and expressing needs. Goals for peer interactions might include what are sometimes called 'play organisers ' - suggesting play ideas, sharing affection, assisting others and responding to initiations from peers. These are based on Part 3: Education for learners with ASD 102 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline the characteristics of socially successful children .104 239 Social understanding of routines and other social events needs explicit teaching and should be given equal importance to the teaching of the skills themselves .240 Goals need to consider family and whnau preferences and be functional in the present setting or in the next environment which the child or young person will enter104 226 (Recommendation 3.2.2.2 ). Functionality is defined as accessing control of the child 's or y oung person 's environment, increasing independence and quality of life and increasing performance .226 Teaching strategies Interventions to develop social skills in young children tend to come from two broad appr oaches to teaching: developmental and behavioural .104 Developmental approaches fit easily into early childhood education settings. These approaches tend to be child -centred in which the adult follows the child 's lead and then attempts to stimulate and continue interactions. An example of such an approach is Greenspan 's DIR/ 'Floortime '.241 Many of these interventions are carried out in natural settings and use natural routines and activities. In traditional behavioural approaches, the emphasis is on building skills by using one - to-one instruction. These approaches are more difficult to fit into child -centred early childhood education settings. Teaching tends to be adult -directed instruction of specific components, such as responses to gestures, toy play skills and social speech .104 These techniques, with their emphasis on compliance, often do not acknowledge the child 's initia tions and often do not generalise to other settings .233 Some of the newer behavioural approaches, such as pivotal response training and incidental teaching, have elements of both approaches: encouraging child in itiations and teaching in natural settings and routines while maintaining systematic teaching procedures (Recommendation 3.2.2.3 ). These approaches are more easily accommodated in early childhood education settings and have proven to be effective .104 210 226 237 Instructors Interventions can also be classified by the person who instructs the child or young person and encourages and prompts interactions and new skills. 1. Adult -child interventions Individual interventions These can be adult -directed behavioural approaches which focus on specific skills, or more child -centred developmental approaches .104 The focus of these is usually one-on-one. If a one -to-one intervention has been used to work on specific skills, it is important the child then has access to a group and is supported to generalise the skills learnt .216 Social skills groups Social skills groups are a common intervention technique. They are often used with \"high functioning \" children and young people who have language skills. They rely on teaching and practising topics such as body language, emotion recognition and understanding and conversational skills in a group of target children. Teaching strategies include lessons, group games, conversations and field trips .210 Studies have shown good participant and parent satisfaction, but only modest improvement in target social skills. However, there is some evidence to suggest that they may, in fact, improve the participant 's mood and self -image .210 Part 3: Education for learners with ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 103 Research on social skills groups for young people and adults was comprehensively updated as part of the living guideline process . It is summarised in Appendix 10.6, and is available as full text from the Ministry of Health website .17 (Also see new recommendation 4.2.1a, and new good practice points 4.2.1b and 4.2.1c in Chapter 4.) 2. Peer -mediated techniques Peer -mediated techniques are the best developed and most studied of all the interventions .210 216 These techniques involve trained peers, usually without disabilities, prompting and sustaining social engagement .104 216 These techniques have the advantage of not requiring the child with ASD to generalise from an adult instructor to peers .210 Typically developing peers are taught to initiate such skills as 'play organisers ' - sharing, helping and using praise and affection .104 Peer mediators need to be friendly, outgoing and skilled, and their preparation and support is important. Instruction, feed back and role play are important elements to use when preparing peers .231 Interventions work best when several mediators are used, so that each target child has repeated opportunities to interact with a number o f skilled peers .232 Support and training for the education professionals who will be involved in developing peer -mediated programmes is also required (Good Practice Point 6.25, Professional learning and developm ent). Many of these peer -mediated interventions tend to be rejected by teachers because they are seen as being unduly complex and time consuming .232 However, simpler peer - based approaches, such as 'Stay, Play, Talk', show promise with younger children and are easier to set up .232 The effectiveness of peer -mediated strategies has been demonstrated in many studies where interventions were well planned104 210 216 239 (Recommendation 3.2.2.4 ). However, even when using well - trained peers, initiations and responses were not always maintained when the peer trainer was not present .210 216 231 Circle of friends This programme involves a group of students undertaking t o provide support to the child with a disability. This programme has been shown to be inadequate on its own without ASD -specific education and support for peers .232 3. Combination of strategies Some successful i nterventions combine both individual child -focused interventions and peer -mediated interventions to prompt and reinforce the strategies already taught .216 These combined strategies have shown positive results as well as promising outcomes .104 Setting for interventions Interventions are most effective if they take place in natural settings and within regular routines and activities and involve opportunities for interact ions with typically developing peers .104 216 232 238 239 The so cial competence of peers has been shown to be a major factor associated with improved outcomes .210 However, simply placing children and young people in settings with socially more competent peers will not be sufficient to foster social interaction without other intervention .216 232 The context for instruction needs to be developmentally appropriate .232 Young children An accepting and secure play environment, set up to encourage interaction with enticing toys and equipment, needs to be provided for young children .233 Toys and activities n eed to be chosen with consideration for the child 's interests and preferences .237 The arrangement of the environment can be used to prompt and Part 3: Education for learners with ASD 104 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline support social interaction. For example, desirable equipment can be visible but not accessible without interacting with another person .216 Older students School -aged children and young people require appropriate games and buddy systems .232 One study reported that the most effective activities for encouraging peer interactions are rule -governed games and construction materials, with dramatic and functional play the least effective .210 However , another study reported positive outcomes from teaching symbolic pretend play. The intervention involved video feedback and observation and gradually reducing the amount of structure provided by the teacher .242 Teenagers respond best to discussion groups on a variety of topics and social network interventions. Both interventions should include peers who are supported by adults and, where necessary, trained .232 Other c onsiderations Interventions to enhance social interactions need to be carried out in conjunction with communication interventions .104 Social interactions with both adults and peers need to be targeted .104 There is a greater likelihood of social interactions occurring in preferred activities which have a structure and are predictable .216 The hidden curriculum Children and you ng people with ASD will need to be taught the unwritten rules of school life, such as what to do where, when and with whom. These rules have a tendency to change depending on the circumstances and children and young people with ASD will not usually be able to generalise what they have learned to different situations. Even \"high functioning \" students with ASD will probably not understand things that others may know intuitively. Children and young people may need a great deal of support and direct teaching to master any of these skills: the meanings of facial expressions rules about personal space and touching the meaning of gestures and postures metaphorical language rhythm and time personal hygiene different ways of addressing people formal and informal lang uage the meaning of common similes and metaphors to reduce over -literalness. Strategies for teaching these skills might include the use of photographs and video, role-playing, acting skills, drama, cartoons or social stories .104 240 Generalisation and maintenance The teaching of skills by themselves will seldom be effective if generalisation to other settings and people is not actively addressed236 (Recommendation 3.2.2.5 ). Interventions need to be available throughout the day and in a variety of activities .216 Where generalisation occurs, it is often attributable to high levels of peer responsiveness; therefore, peers need to be primed and supported to recognise and respond to interaction attempts .239 Other interventions which have anecdotal support Social stories 'Social stories ', devel oped by Gray and Garand, is a relatively new intervention243 (see also Appendix 8, Educational interventions ). Social stories are narratives written by adults about difficult social situations to help the child 's understanding. These stories help promote self-awareness, self -calming and self - management .240 Only a few small studies Part 3: Education for learners with ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 105 have been undertaken; one showed a decrease in the frequencies of inappropriate behaviour s and anxiety levels and another showed an increase in social skill levels .232 244 Other studies have demonstrated the utility of this intervention for increasing sha ring, play and appropriate independent social initiations and responses, as well as for reducing aggression. Social stories probably need to be used in combination with other strategies .226 There is a need for further research to consider which children and young people will benefit from such approaches .245 Other interventions Other techniques that have been shown to be useful for improving social skills include: visua l cueing - printed cues in work schedules to stimulate social initiations to other peers with ASD social games - teaching socio -dramatic scripts or games revolving around a child 's special interest (both interventions increased peer interactions in multipl e ways) video modelling - some studies have shown better skill acquisition of maintenance and generalisation than for in -vivo teaching techniques acting lessons - learning to express emotions verbally and non -verbally and interpret the feelings of others self-esteem building - from placing the child in the role of tutor or helper (eg, the teacher compliments the child and teaches him/her to compliment him/herself) social autopsies - conversations with adults which review and interpret social situations whic h have happened cartooning - the use of cartoon drawings to understand social situations .210 232 240 Other issues Interventions for home settings Without family /whnau involvement, interventions are unlikely to generalise to home and community settings .237 Several studies have shown measurable improvements from simple interventions such as teaching parents and siblings to imitate a child in play with toys and other play skills on a daily basis, or daily early childhood education service programmes with positive child -adult interactions and play .104 226 231 Support and education should be provided for families and whnau to facilitate the use of home -intervention strategies (Recommendation 3.2.2.6 ). Strategies can include: rehearsing scripts videotaping conversations, reviewing and coaching structured 'play dates ' (social opportunities with peers usually conducted w ithin the home) structured conversations involvement in groups around a special interest .210 Siblings can also be involved in home interventions using many of the peer - mediated techniques .210 Part 3: Education for learners with ASD 106 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 3.2.c Sensori -motor development Summary of recommendations Recommendations: Grade 3.2.3.1 Teams should consult appropriate expert professionals such as occupational therapists for guidance about strategies to support children and young people whose sensory processing difficulties interfere with their educational performance. B 3.2.3.2 Sensory programmes and strategies should be monitored carefully and discontinued if some progress is not apparent in 6 to 12 weeks. B 3.2.3.3 Environments and tasks should be adapted to minimise negative sensory reactions, perceptual distortions or motor difficulties. C Background Most children with ASD experience sensory and motor difficulties at some point in their development .104 183 246 At present these are not included as part of the diagnostic criteria in either the DSM -1V or ICD -10. These difficulties include under - or over -reactions to b asic sensations and perceptions (including touch, taste, sight, hearing and smell), movement and information from muscles and joints (proprioception). These difficulties are manifested early in the child 's development (by 9 -12 months in some reports ).104 183 There is evidence that sensory responses change with maturation. As with other aspects of development for this population, there is an uneven and fluctuating variation of difficul ties for each child183 (see also 2.3.7 Sensory processing ). Unusual sensory responses have been reported in various studies in 42 to 88% of older children with ASD. These include: hypo - or hyper -responses problems modulating ar ousal preoccupations with the sensory features of objects perceptual distortions paradoxical responses to stimuli .183 There is some evidence that auditory processing difficulties are a particular problem; in one study, these we re demonstrated by all the subjects .183 Visual -spatial skills appear to be more advanced than other skills, although individual differences are apparent .183 Behaviours may be associated with the nee d to seek or avoid sensory input or with difficulties in modulating sensory input to maintain attention and arousal appropriate to the demands of the task and environment .104 246 Although motor skills are generally more advanced than language or social skills in children with ASD, motor problems can be significant. Gross and fine motor skills such as gait, ball skills, balance, dexterity, motor imitation, handwriting, cutting with sci ssors, and sense of rhythm may be delayed. Children may demonstrate low muscle tone, oral motor problems, repetitive motor movements or motor planning difficulties (dyspraxia). Part 3: Education for learners with ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 107 Research suggests that such children with dyspraxia may have more difficulties with the planning or preparation of movement than with the actual execution of the movement .183 Approaches to interventions A systematic review of the efficacy of sensory and motor interventions for children with ASD identifie d different types of interventions :183 remedial interventions, ie, ones that target specific sensory motor components, for example, sensory integration and later developments such as sensory diets, visual therapies and Irlen le nses task and environmental modifications. Some of the interventions reviewed have questionable rationales for using with children with ASD and no evidence is provided to evaluate their efficacy with this population. Many of the studies fail to directly li nk changes in the dysfunctional mechanism as a result of the remediation programme to functional changes in behaviour, for example, auditory sensitivity, visual distortions and vestibular dysfunctions. Generally results were inconsistent and changes were m odest. It was concluded that this does not necessarily imply that the interventions are ineffective in all cases, but that there is insufficient sound research to demonstrate their efficacy. In some cases, it was difficult to tell whether benefits were fro m an intervention or from learning skills associated with the intervention (such as play -coaching, structured teaching and attention skills) .104 183 Given the variability in developm ental profiles of children with ASD, it has been suggested that the indiscriminate use of any sensory or motor -based programme is unwise, so a conservative approach to suggesting specific sensory or motor programmes is recommended. Good practice suggests t hat decisions are best made on an individualised basis by expert professionals .183 An expert professional would be someone such as an occupational therapist or physiotherapist who has ASD - specific education and experience in sensory and motor difficulties (Recommendation 3.2.3.1 ). Interventions should be provided in short - term increments, progress should be systematically documented and the intervention should be discontinued if some progress is not apparent within 6 to 12 weeks (Recommendation 3.2.3.2 ). As with other interventions, best practice suggests that interventions are most effectively integrated into daily routines within naturalistic contexts to increase retention and generalisation of the skills .104 183 It has also been suggested that task and environmental modifications to address sensory issues and teaching compensatory strategies are useful in combination with other educational programmes183 (Recommendation 3.2.3.3 ). (Other sensory motor interventions such as sensory integration are discussed in section 4.5. Music therapy and art therapy are discussed in Appendix 8.) Implications for professional practice Assessment Sensory challenges and preferences can be assessed by observing children and young people in their natural environments (home, school and community) and by using interviews and sensory checklists. Some children will need a more specialised assessment by a n occupational therapist, such as a sensory profile which is based on parent report. This should still be used in conjunction with observation data and other measures .184 246 Some of the following may be observed in children and young people with sensory issues. Part 3: Education for learners with ASD 108 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Table 3.1: Sensory s timuli and their possible effects on children and young people with ASD247 Sensory system Description Some behaviours that might be observed Vestibular Movement of body in space Motion sickness Fear of heights Avoidance of balancing activities or participation in sports Seeking fast -moving activities Engaging in frequent spinning, bouncing or running Seeming oblivious to the risks of heights or moving equipment Tactile Provides information about factors such as touch, pressure, texture, hard/soft, sharp, dull, heat/cold, pain Avoidance of touch contact Disliking and avoiding messy play Disliking having hair brushed or washed Appearing irritated by certain clothing and food textures Appearing irritated by others ' proximity Appearing fidgety or active Using hands to explore Proprioceptive Provides information about where a certain body part is and how it is moving Enjoying rough -and-tumble play Relaxing when given firm touch or massage Exerting too much or not enough pressure while handling objects Visual Provides information from the eye about objects and people Discomfort in strong sunlight Sensi tivity to television/computer screens or changes in lighting Enjoying flickering objects (eg, computer, flicking pages, flickering hands) Focusing on shadows, reflections or spinning objects, lines, patterns Auditory Provides information about sounds in t he environment Becoming upset at loud or unexpected noises Humming or singing to screen out unwanted noise Unusual responses to voices Dislike of large indoor spaces Fleeing the area and refusing to go back Behaviour such as flapping or rocking Part 3: Education for learners with ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 109 Sensory system Description Some behaviours that might be observed Olfactory (smell) or gustatory (taste) Provides information about different types of tastes or smells Dislike of strong smells or tastes Craving strong smells or tastes Eating non -edible items (sometimes referred to as 'pica ') Eating a restricted range of foods The way in which sensory challenges impact on daily performance is complex, and individual and sensory deficits may not always result in performance deficits if there have been environmental adaptations or the child has been taught coping strategies. It is mo st useful if functional assessments of behaviour always include consideration of sensory issues as well as the other core impairments. Occupational therapists and other staff skilled in ASD and sensory issues should provide support and guidance to parents, early childhood education and school staff in assessing and intervening in sensory issues. Teaching strategies Conventional educational environments are associated with a complicated and unpredictable array of sensory experiences. A New Zealand survey of staff associated with early childhood education centres reported that children with auditory processing problems such as ASD were the most severely affected by noise. Under noisy conditions, there was distraction from learning tasks and impaired communicat ion.248 Children and young people who are challenged by these will need to have adaptations made to their environment and planning to optimise their successful participation .104 183 Environmental analysis and adaptations and teaching the child or young person coping strategies (such as sensory stories)249 are therefore the priority interventions in an educational context. Teachers may need to address some of the following sensory considerations. It is important to note that reactions from children and young people might be either to seek or to avoid the sensations. Often fairly small environmental changes and accommodations for children and young people with ASD can alter significant behaviour challenges by reducing negative sensory reactions. Children usually have some sensory sensitivity which can be helped by adaptations as follows :250 Acoustics: Sensitivity to noise in children and young people with ASD can be exacerbated by a lack of sound -dampening measures in areas such as school halls, corridors, technology rooms and science laboratories. Teachers need to consider providing students with a mix of quiet and noisy environments through the school day to provide some relief from the busy environments. In some situations, the child may need to avoid the noisy place or spend very short periods of time th ere. Other children may be helped by allowing them to wear headphones or ear plugs. Lighting: for some children and young people with ASD, poor artificial lights or harsh bright sunshine can cause stress and distraction. The position of the child in the cl assroom and a shady play area might need to be considered. Classroom organisation: reducing clutter and clearly defining space within the classroom can greatly help students with ASD to access learning. In a regular school setting, the needs of a child or young person with ASD for a structured, low -arousal environment might be accommodated through: Part 3: Education for learners with ASD 110 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline - providing an individual workstation, positioned away from the centre of the classroom - planning to allow a child or young person to take movement breaks throughou t the day - allowing time for calming sensory activities between activities that are more challenging - using cues to support the child or young person to shift attention between activities. Playground : adaptations could include visually marking areas that are safe to access and using stop signs to cue children to stop and wait at exit points to the school. 3.2.d Cognitive development and thinking skills Summary of recommendations Recommendation: Grade 3.2.4.1 IQ tests should be used with caution: IQ tests, w hen used, should be accompanied by an assessment of language and an assessment of adaptive functioning in natural settings. Cognitive assessments should be administered by a psychologist with experience and training in ASD. A 3.2.4.2 The cognitive strengt hs of the child or young person should be used to compensate for areas of difficulty. C 3.2.4.3 The child or young person 's particular interests should be incorporated whenever possible. C 3.2.4.4 Children and young people should receive carefully planne d, systematic instruction tailored to their individual needs and abilities. B 3.2.4.5 Children and young people should be provided with supports to enhance learning structure. C Background Cognitive characteristics The characteristics of ASD are usually described in behavioural terms and there has been considerable effort to understand the cognitive and biological basis for the difficulties children and young people experience in the social, communication and imagination domains .251 Various differences in cognition have been noted and a typical developmental sequence of learning new skills cannot be assumed. Difficulties with symbolic representation, imagination, joint attention and preferential orientation to s ocial stimuli are some challenges which appear at an early age .63 104 Later, difficulties with combining and integrating different kinds of information become more ob vious. In formal cognitive testing, abilities which require less verbal mediation (eg, block design) tend to show less impairment .104 Across time, children may learn to compensate for these difficulties, through teaching or development of their own strategies .104 However, as in other areas of development, children and young people with ASD Part 3: Education for learners with ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 111 vary greatly in their abilities and approaches to learning and require indivi dualised supports.226 About 10% of children with ASD show unusual islets of ability, or 'splinter' skills (exceptional skills in a very narrow area). These can either be unusual in relation to the child's gener al abilities or (sometimes) in contrast to the skills of typically developing children. They are often related to the child's particular preoccupations or obsessions, and can sometimes reflect information -processing skills other than just rote -memory skill s.104 Types of research Research focused on understanding the cognitive characteristics of individuals who have ASD is developing rapidly and new papers are published constantly .63 This work, however, is far from complete, and there is only a partial understanding of the basis of the behaviour of people with ASD. The research comes from two main areas of endeavour: neuro -biological research , using new techniques of bra in imaging, is providing new insights into the development and working of the brain .63 These brain studies suggest that there is involvement of broader and more developmentally interrelated systems than would be consistent with a 'single core deficit ' for ASD. However, clearly some systems are spared, as is demonstrated by normal or even superior functioning in some areas by some individuals63 psychology has provided s ome theories to explain the cognitive characteristics and behaviours of children with ASD and seeks to explore and refine these hypotheses with experimental data .63 Neither of these bodies of research currently provides all the answers to the educational questions which arise from the practical issues of teaching and scaffolding the learning of children and young people with ASD. However, the growing body of evidence does provide some directions for educational p ractice. Psychological models To date, the neuro -biological research and psychological models of ASD have shown only a limited amount of overlap. The dominant psychological theories to explain the core cognitive difficulties in ASD come from three models w hich suggest: core deficits involving theory of mind skills local rather than central processing, or weak central coherence difficulties of self -organisation or executive dysfunction63 104 251 (see also section 1.2.b Young people and adults in Part 1 Diagnosis and initial assessment of ASD ). 1. Theory of mind The theory of mind hypothesis suggests that individuals with ASD have difficulty identifying and understanding mental states - either their own or others ' - and are thus unable to understand a social world guided by intentions, desires and beliefs .63 104 It is proposed that these difficulties lead to stilted language interactions, a poor understanding of social situations and little insight into the knowledge and beliefs of other people .252 A practical li mitation with this theory is research that shows teaching theory of mind skills to people with ASD does not necessarily improve real -life social competence, suggesting that the links between theory of mind and sociability are not simple .63 104 Part 3: Education for learners with ASD 112 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 2. Weak central coherence The theory of weak central coherence suggests that there is a tendency to process all information in a fragmented way with a focus on the details, rathe r than integrating information into meaningful wholes .63 104 251 252 This leads to difficult ies generalising from one task or situation to the next and difficulties with seeing patterns across experiences. This results in problems in planning ahead and self - organisation. Children with ASD tend not to learn by observing the experiences of other ch ildren but often require direct teaching .252 They also have a tendency to interpret language literally without regard for the context in which it has been expressed .251 3. Executive dysfunction The executive dysfunction framework looks at the self -organisational elements required to learn, such as attention, inhibition of irrelevant responses, maintenance of a train of thought and use of abstract rules. This theory overlaps the other theories. Executive dysfunction suggests that individuals with ASD have difficulties characterised by poor self -regulation and perseveration, which result in difficulties with change, reduced forward planning and ineffective problem -solving skills (a lack of coordinated reasoning and difficulties adjusting to feedback). There is a general lack of flexibility in thinking .63 104 Limitations and emerging areas of study As mentioned previously, neuro -biological research suggests that there is involvement with broader interrelated systems which is not consistent with the notion of a 'core deficit ' as suggested by each of the psychological theories outlined above .63 A theory that is currently re -emerging suggests that a derailment of social motivation is a core deficit. This means that the young child is not motivated to observe and imitate other people in their environment. This ha s huge implications for the child 's early learning and explains difficulties with joint attention and imitation. This lack of social motivation is seen as the basis for the difficulties described in the above theories .63 An emerging area of study, made possible by new techniques, focuses on the cognitive processes used by individuals with ASD rather than just the results obtained. There is early evidence that individuals with ASD may achieve higher than expected results on a given task, but use cognitive processes that contrast markedly from their typical peers. This work has useful future implications for understanding how individuals with ASD think and learn, and consequent lessons about appropriate educational interventions and strategies .63 Implications for professional practice The way in which cognitive abilities and deficits are interwoven with social and communication difficulties for each child means that no edu cational intervention can assume a typical sequence of learning. A careful assessment is required of each child and young person 's abilities and approaches to learning. Assessment The cognitive ability of children with ASD has been assessed traditionally u sing IQ tests. The information about IQ in populations of individuals with ASD has changed. Up to 70% were considered to be intellectually disabled, whereas current estimates suggest that fewer than half of children with ASD have non -verbal IQs less than 7 0.63 104 This change may be due to more extensive identification of children who are not intellectually disabled and a broader definition of ASD, as well as greater e ducational opportunities for children .104 IQ scores have been found to Part 3: Education for learners with ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 113 be relatively stable with older children, but problematic with very young children and those who are more severely impaired .104 There is debate about the role of IQ testing for this population .253 There are difficulties in assessing children with ASD which include: the amount of verbal understanding and t he verbal responses required slower responses, particularly related to auditory processing, which can affect scores on timed tasks difficulties related to the child 's motivation and subsequent compliance difficulties in establishing a ceiling and baseline because the usual test norms may not be appropriate difficulties in following standard procedure scoring protocols which may be inappropriate .11 There are also challenges in interpreting the results. The scatter of abilities which often appears in the profile of children with ASD means that composite scores are misleading .104 Children 's responses during testing may provide valuable information on their ability to tackl e an unfamiliar task. Data on the following may be collected: reactions to challenging stimuli behaviour and cooperation in structured settings memory and attention skills motivation determination perseverative or repetitive behaviour resistance to change. It is important to note that most of these aspects can also be recorded through focused observations of children tackling tasks in a variety of natural settings and not just in test situations .11 Suggestions fo r assessment tools IQ tests, if used, should be one of a number of measures and a language assessment should always be included to establish whether some difficulties might be due to difficulties in following instructions253 (Recommendation 3.2.4.1 ). Test results may also be affected by mood, compliance and motivation. Adaptive behaviour may be a more robust predictor of some areas of development in young children .104 A parental interview may be an effective way to establish a profile of the young child 's strengths and weaknesses. A parental report, however, may overestimate abilities but these can be confirmed with direct observation. Observations should be made in bot h structured and unstructured settings .11 Tests and other cognitive assessments should be administered by a psychologist with experience and training in ASD (Recommendation 3.2.4.1 ). The setting needs to be chos en with particular care11 and extreme care is required when interpreting test scores, particularly with younger children .220 253 IQ tests should not be considered the primary measure of outcome for interventions because there are very complex implications for test selection in this population across ages and developmental levels .104 When IQ scores are used as outcome measures for interventions, there can be considerable difficulty if the pre -test instrument is no longer appropriate at post -test because of age or other reasons. Different tests produce different results and apparent changes in IQ may be due to test selection rather than real changes .33 135 258 Also, some apparent changes may reflect an increase in compliance rather than a true change in cognitive ability .11 Part 3: Education for learners with ASD 114 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Evaluation of academic skills is very important for planning goals for children who are participating in academic activities .104 Teaching strategies Children with ASD have diverse and distinctive patterns of development, both as a group and as individuals. An emphasis on thinking skills, concepts, strategies, problem solving and other broad skill s will have an effect across all academic areas. The content and sequence need to be decided on the basis of the child or young person 's interest and progress. The following suggestions have been identified to support their learning. 1. Make use of relativ e strengths Many children may have relative strengths that can be used in teaching and learning to compensate for the areas in which they have particular difficulty, for example: strong visual -spatial skills, which can lead to literacy as a means of commun ication non-verbal problem solving skills, which can be used to structure tasks in a way that motivates a child auditory memory which can be a strength that may lead to a child developing socially appropriate phrases for specific situations strong visual m emory of some students that can be used to teach skills such as spelling104 (Recommendation 3.2.4.2 ). 2. Make use of children and young people 's interests Children with ASD can often show relatively complex skil ls and knowledge in an area of their interest, sometimes called 'splinter skills ', but show no similar ability in areas that are being taught. Difficulties in social motivation impact enormously on the ability of children with ASD to learn in areas where t hey have no interest and, as a consequence, no prior knowledge. In this context, Steven Shore notes that: It is important for teachers to know about their students ' interests and build on these existing strengths. Using these topics as the centrepiece of students ' academic work helps to keep them focused, engaged and motivated and can also serve as bridges to new topics and skills254 (p. 298). There is evidence that students who are offered preferred activities a nd objects engage in more self -initiation of questions, use more communication, engage in more social interactions and have enhanced engagement with the task226 (Recommendation 3.2.4.3 ). 3. Systematic instructio n and adequate supports It is difficult to make recommendations or generalisations about specific practices, and students with significant cognitive and communication difficulties will require greater adaptations, more intensity and greater support. Howeve r, student performance, appropriate use of materials, direction following and on -task behaviour can all be improved by maximising material that is within the student 's interest, and by: incorporating choices reinforcing attempts pre-task sequencing (giving the child or young person a series of short, easy requests to reinforce expectation and motivation, followed by a more difficult task) using the least intrusive prompts first using minimal physical prompting adequate modelling providing natural consequenc es Part 3: Education for learners with ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 115 use of peer -tutoring (which can increase instructional time and provide pacing, feedback, error correction, high mastery levels and content coverage) using well -planned cooperative learning220 255 (Recommendation 3.2.4.4 ). 4. Provide structure in the classroom programme Children and young people with ASD often require much more structure in their environments than others in order to learn .11 226 254 'Structure ' is not consistently defined, but a programme might be considered structured when the curriculum (activities, schedule and environment) is clear and comprehen sible or predictable to both the children or young people and any observers. One suggested test is to observe the student for 10 minutes. If the observer cannot identify the task which the student has been set without further explanation, then further 'structure ' is required in the form of visual or other supports (Recommendation 3.2.4.5 ). Examples of structure include: consistent programming facilitating transitions, flexibility and change schedules of activities providing visual supports writing instructi ons on whiteboards minimising verbal prompts planning and providing choice -making opportunities defining specific areas of the classroom and school setting allowing some access to repetitive behaviour providing behavioural support environmental adaptation to plan for sensory needs breaking tasks into clear, manageable pieces using work baskets to show visually how much work is required and when work is completed minimising ambiguity planning so that students can finish tasks before moving on having adults f ollow through with expected rewards, consequences and routines and warnings about transitions and changes .220 226 229 5. Supports for older children and young people Preparing the student for what is going to happen offers a number of benefits. When students know what is going to happen, they are better able to think and problem solve, are less anxious and can better attend and comprehend. Strategies for preparing the student include: long -term planning including information that will be of interest to the student writing step -by-step lists of instructions, for example, within activity schedules and timetables providing alter native modes for completing assignments (audio, video, computer, dictation and mind -maps) adapting tasks and instructions to the student 's level pre-teaching important concepts encouraging background reading or watching a video on the topic providing outli nes or copies to follow during whole -class instruction specifying expectations for completion (showing students completed models, if necessary) using self -management strategies cueing systems to get the student back on task (such as secret signals) Part 3: Education for learners with ASD 116 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline providi ng mnemonic devices priming students about elements that might be of particular interest to them highlighting important concepts by: - mind -mapping or creating family trees of concepts or ideas - making timelines - providing graphics and visual organisers - provid ing outlines with topic headings and subheadings226 229 (Recommendation 3.2.4.5 ). 3.2.e Self-management skills and addressing challenging behaviour in education settings Summary of recommendations Recommendations: Grade 3.2.5.1 Interventions should start early, as soon as challenging behaviours are of concern, and be proactive. The child or young person 's programme should be individualised and designed to engage the child or young person and provide a highly supportive environment. B 3.2.5.2 Educational interventions should incorporate principles of positive behaviour support, particularly a focus on understanding the function of the child 's behaviour (see Appendix 10.1). A 3.2.5.3 Physically aversive procedures should not be used. A 3.2.5.4 All school staff should understand the goals of a child or young person 's behaviour -support plan. C Good Practice Point: 3.2.5.5 Teams in educational settings need access to a quick response in cases of severe behaviour. This may include both specialist medical and behavioural support. Background 'Problem ' behaviours Behaviour problems have been identified as the most challenging and stressful issue facing parents and educ ators of children and young people with ASD .104 210 The definition of 'problem behaviour ' depends on whether one looks at behaviour from the perspective of a child with ASD or from t he perspective of a parent or teacher. Part 3: Education for learners with ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 117 From a child 's perspective, parents and teachers demonstrate problem behaviours by putting the child in situations which they find difficult, by: making demands they are unable to comprehend communicating and expect ing communication in ways that are difficult to understand expecting them to engage in social interaction and tasks in which they have little or no interest or skill limiting engagement in their interests. From the parent 's or teacher 's perspective, the ch ild demonstrates problem behaviours by not complying, disrupting classroom activities, having tantrums, destroying property and being aggressive towards themselves or others. Behaviours such as these put children and adolescents at risk of being excluded f rom social, family , whnau , peer and educational and community activities and therefore need to be understood and addressed .104 In addition, there is evidence that for children with ASD, unlike for typically developing children, these behaviours, once established, will persist and worsen rather than decrease with age .104 256 The focus of interventions The nature of behavioural interventions has changed over recent years, from a focus on eliminating behaviours to that of understanding the function of the behaviour for the child or young person and providing an acceptable alternative to serve the same purpose. This may involve modifying enviro nmental triggers and changing consequences of the behaviour as well as change to systems within the organisation. There is no longer an emphasis on deterrence or punishment .210 An extensive meta -analysis found t hat interventions which focused on teaching positive skills to replace challenging behaviours combined with system change had better outcomes than consequence - focused interventions .257 Many school -wide disciplin e plans may include the use of consequences such as detentions. Such approaches are unlikely to be effective in teaching more appropriate behaviours to children and young people with ASD. Principals and staff will need to resolve this issue so that all adu lts support the child 's behaviour plan. There has been a shift from viewing behaviour support as a process by which individuals are changed to fit environments to one in which the environment is recognised as having a role in contributing to the problem be haviour .104 There is agreement that interventions are most effective if they begin early, before behaviours become entrenched. The child should not be left to 'grow out of the behaviour '11 210 256 (Recommendation 3.2.5.1 ). The use of punishment Punishment is the use of an aversive procedure in an attempt to eliminate or reduce an unwanted behaviour. Intervention s that use punishment -based procedures often have unwanted side effects, such as the child avoiding the punisher and negative feelings for both the child and the adult and seldom result in the replacement of the unwanted behaviour with more desirable behav iours. Many of the more physically intrusive punishment procedures, such as hitting, slapping or spraying with water, are now considered unethical. Physically aversive measures should not be used104 210 (Recommendation 3.2.5.3 ). Part 3: Education for learners with ASD 118 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Other forms of punishment such as holding, physical redirection and time -out should only be used when more positive approaches have temporarily broken down. In this circumstance, they should be used as a very temporary measure until a new plan can be developed to support and teach more appropriate behaviours. 'Time -out' needs to be used with caution in this population. Many children with ASD enjoy being alone and are not worried about social exclusion. As a res ult, this intervention may become reinforcing of the negative behaviour if the child sees it as a means of escape from a demanding situation. Early childhood education centres and schools should have a clear policy statement about the use of restraint, physical redirection and time -out. An individual plan should be developed within this policy for each child at risk. This should outline details of procedures and when they will be used, and be agreed to by the parents/guardians. Implications for professional practice Positive behaviour supports Positive behavioural supports or approaches begin by asking what the child can do instead of what he or she is currently doing (inappropriate behaviour) to receive the same benefit. This shifts the emphasis from simply eliminating the behaviour. This approach allows the child to learn appropriate ways of communicating as well as recognising the rights of the child to have his or her own personal goals. Eliminating behaviours is not only more difficult; it can be detrime ntal for a child who already has a very limited behavioural repertoire and can mean that the child develops a different problem behaviour to serve the same purpose .210 Positive behaviour supports impact on many areas of practice. (a) Preventing or minimising behaviour problems Research evidence and clinical judgement also agree that providing the child with the skills needed to effectively deal with the physical, academic, communicative, social and sensory aspect s of their family, whnau , school, early childhood or community environment is an effective strategy to minimise behaviour difficulties .102 104 217 256 Children with ASD who have educational programmes that effectively target appropriate pro -social and positive skills (communication, social interaction, cognitive, adaptive behaviour and sensori - motor skills) are less likely to develop problem behaviours .11 104 Given that these skills are difficult for this population, many children are at risk of developing alternative ways of coping (often with challenging behaviours) as a response to challenging situations if they do not receive proactive supports and teaching .256 Increasing engagement in activities, providing choices and using preferred materia ls and topics are also effective prevention strategies for young children .217 Augmentative communication strategies to help with receptive and expressive communication (eg, using visual supports, a word processor with picture communication symbols, work systems and task organisers to help children and young people to understand routines and requirements, as well as instruction in spontaneous expressive communication) are important in helping prevent problems .11 104 217 It is equally important that these supports are kept up to date and are not removed without careful consideration. Part 3: Education for learners with ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 119 Physical activity and relaxatio n strategies have been shown to have health benefits and can help prevent behaviour problems, particularly those related to self - stimulatory behaviour104 183 and disruptive behaviour .258 Preparing for and supporting children and young people through transitions, both between activities and different settings, are important to minimise stress and anxiety .226 The provision of a quiet space is important for most children and young people with ASD. Regular, timetabled 'down time ' can be an important positive strategy to decrease stress and give the child an opportunity to have a break from social expe ctations and busy environments. Using 'down time ' as a reward that is dependent on performance can increase anxiety and should be avoided. In summary, the key to avoiding and reducing problem behaviours is to provide an appropriate individualised education programme to engage the child or young person104 217 256 (for further detail on appropriate programmes see sections 3.2.a; 3.2.b; 3.2.c and 3.2.d ). (b) Functional assessment of problem behaviours Functional assessment is based on the assumption that behaviours are learned and maintained because they serve an adaptive function, resulting in some kind of gain for the participants .104 256 259 Functional assessments are usually expected to lead to the identification of the function or purpose of the behaviour for the child or young person. They may also ident ify environmental elements, ie, the antecedents and consequences which may be supporting the behaviour .210 217 226 252 An appropriate behaviour plan can then be developed. It is important to acknowledge the role the core deficits in ASD (communication, socialisation and a lack of flexibility in thought and routines) may play in causing or maintaining behavioural problems. Many challenging behaviours may have communicative and social functions for the child or be an attempt to control their environment. Once the function of the behaviour has been established, the child may be taught a more appropriate behaviour which has the same 'pay-off', or the environment may be modified to eliminate the 'triggers ' for the behaviour. Some common functions of behaviours are: the communication of needs and wants social attention social avoidance escape from difficult or boring tasks or other ave rsive situations access to tangible items and preferred activities generation of sensory reinforcement or stimulation .104 The steps in a functional assessment are: describe the problem behaviour in detail identi fy the times and circumstances (contexts and triggers) that are regularly associated with the occurrence (or non -occurrence) of the behaviour identify the consequences that maintain the behaviour develop hypotheses regarding the function or purpose of the behaviour and collect observational data to support each hypothesis design an intervention, supported by the assessment, to provide an alternative behaviour .104 256 259 Part 3: Education for learners with ASD 120 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Effective assessments involve interviews with people in the child 's classes or family, as well as direct observation of the behaviour in its usual context .259 This will provide important information about past patterns of behaviour and skill development. It is also important to consider the possible effects of any co-morbid conditions such as epilepsy .11 An ecological inventory of the environment may also help identify sensory or human triggers of behaviours. Behaviours maintained by sensory input are more difficult to change .104 Cognitive and sensory overload, and difficulties switching attention and processing information 'under pressure ', are common triggers for individuals to 'shut down ', which is often seen as non -compliance .33 This assessment and analysis may lead teams to develop hypotheses about causal relationships between environmental changes, skill acquisition and reductions in problem behaviour. This analysis will require input from people who know the child well - particularly parents and teachers - and may help focus attention on what to do before or between bouts of problem behaviour as well as the skills needed by the child .259 260 For example, if the functional assessment reveals that the inappropriate behaviour serves the purpo se of escaping a task, a positive solution could include a reduction in task demand to something manageable by the child as well as teaching functional communication so that the child can signal the need for a break. Reviews of the research on the outcome of functional behavioural assessments show that they more often result in the choice of positive procedures than punishment procedures, and they are more likely to result in significant reductions in behaviour .104 256 However, the research warns that in some cases where assessments were conducted, interventions were designed that were not consistent with the actual assessment information. This highlights the need for education to effectively link assessment and intervention .256 261 Research has shown that positive behavioural interventions and support: are effective in significantly reducing problem behaviours have doubled effec tiveness when preceded by a functional behavioural assessment were able to be effectively carried out in community settings by the children 's parents or usual carers if they are well supported256 (Recommendation 3.2.5.2, 6.9, P rofessional learning and development ). One study that trained parents to analyse problem behaviours in their young children and teach their children functional communication systems (on the basis of their existing communication skills) increased appropriat e social behaviour by 69% and decreased aberrant behaviour by 87%. The intervention took 10 minutes a day and had a high rating for parent acceptability .104 (c) Teaching positive skills Comprehensive behaviour p lans are intervention strategies which have been developed by the team around the child. Comprehensive behaviour plans should: consider all problem behaviour performed by a child be driven by functional assessment outcomes be applied across all (or most) o f the child 's day incorporate a number of intervention procedures fit the context where they are to be implemented emphasise the teaching of positive alternative skills. Part 3: Education for learners with ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 121 Systems change The literature on this behavioural support theme is less developed and falls into three categories: generalisation, organisational systems and adult behaviour change .256 (a) Generalisation It is no longer considered appropriate to reduce problem behaviour in narrow contexts across narrow periods. Good interventions result in adding elements to the child 's life that improve the richness or effectiveness of living and learning. It is therefore very important that all those who will interact with the child (eg, other teachers and relieving or duty tea chers) have an understanding of the young person 's behaviour -support plan and goals260 (Recommendation 3.2.5.4 ). (b) Organisational systems Effective interventions require funding for staff development (Recommen dation 6.10, Professional learning and development ). Staff time and evaluation should be available to support these practices .104 252 256 There can often be a conflict between school behaviour management policies that have a focus on punishment or negative consequences (eg, detentions) and positive behavioural interventions. These need to be discussed and resolved with the child 's team and the whole school staff. (c) Adult behaviour change Adults may need to change their own behaviour and adapt the learning, physical and social environment to produce durable change in the behaviour of the children. Teachers, families and whnau, and staff may need to be tra ined to consider elements such as: modifying the curriculum modifying daily routines, timing of activities and the spaces or places used ensuring adequate opportunities for social engagement changing communication styles following through with planned interventions monitoring the effect of interventions104 210 252 256 (Recommendation 6.11, Professional learning and development ). Environmental change Behavioural interventions also emphasise environmental adaptations. These include changing the physical characteristics of a setting, altering schedules, modifying curricula and redesigning social groupings as soon as it is suspected these might be problematic for the child .104 256 Other issues Outcome measures The expected outcomes from positive behavioural interventions and supports are an increase in positive behaviour, decreases in problem behaviour and improvements in quality of life. Possible outcome measures for evaluation include: a reduction in the problem behaviour child or young person 's use of new alternative skills that he or she can now use in place of the problem behaviour evidence of new strategies to prevent the future problems in similar risk situations report of improvements by families and whnau and others increased engagement in positive social interactions with peers and others and greater p articipation in their school or community setting improvements in the child or young person 's quality of life (more choice, happiness or satisfaction) .262 Part 3: Education for learners with ASD 122 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline More serious behaviours A small number of children and young people with ASD may develop very serious or dangerous behaviours .102 When this occurs, rapid access to specialist assistance and support and a timely response are essential. This may include both specialis t medical and behavioural assistance (Good Practice Poi nt 3.2.5.5, and see section 4.6: Supporting people with challenging behaviour ). 3.3 Particular issues for secondary students Summary of recommendations Recommendations: Grade 3.3.1 The student should be supported through the multiple transitions of secondary school using schedules and other supports. C 3.3.2 A careful assessment of the skills which the young person requires for the transition to adult life in the community, leisure activities and the workplace should be undertaken. The outcome should inform the curriculum for the last few years of school. C Good Practice Point: 3.3.3 A quiet place should be provided for the young person to take a break from the busy environment of secondary school. The bulk of the research around education for children with ASD focuses on the needs of younger children. Strategies for supporting young people at secondary school are often derived from the research around younger children. Further research work nee ds to be done on the particular issues associated with secondary schools and particularly in meeting the needs of more severely affected young people. There are particular challenges in providing a suitable programme and meeting the support needs of young people with ASD in the busy environment of a secondary school. Secondary schools require students to respond to many different adults and to be members of many different class groups, each of which may have differing expectations and social dynamics. This means there is much potential for misunderstanding and inappropriate responses. Young people may have difficulties because of: over -selectivity - a tendency to process only one cue or component storing irrelevant details failing to recognise either the poi nt of the information or which pieces of information are crucial secondary teachers ' tendency to rely more heavily on verbal explanations, which creates problems even for young people with good verbal skills students ' difficulties in understanding and comm unicating their own perceptions and needs Part 3: Education for learners with ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 123 students' difficulties in understanding the needs of others and ways of meeting them lack of motivation difficulties because of the emphasis on assessments. Where young people suffer from stress, or have difficulti es understanding questions or instructions, they may not demonstrate abilities consistent with the assessment263 (Recommendation 6.13, Professional learning and development ). Students can be helped by being spec ifically taught problem solving and thinking skills, including: explicit teaching in recognising and discarding irrelevant information memorising and retrieving information collecting ideas examining pros and cons highlighting key concepts checklists perso nalised plans of the school devising personal routines use of written and visual, rather than verbal information increasing structure around exam time.263 Transitions Secondary schools frequently require student s to make many transitions during their day. These include transitions between different teaching areas, teachers, groups of peers and subjects as well as changes of activities within classes. Students will benefit from within -activity schedules as well as daily and weekly timetables to prepare them for these changes. In some cases, tasks may not be finished within a lesson and this may make the transition from a particular class even more stressful. Some young people may need tasks to be broken into chunks to allow for a sense of completion in each class229 (Recommendation 3.3.1 ). It may be particularly important to provide the student with a quiet place to take a break from the busy environment of the secondary school (Good Practice Point 3.3.3 ) (for further discussio n about transitions see section 3.4: Education sector organisation and management ). Curriculum for transitioning to adult life and work The curriculum for students as they near the end of compulsory schooling requires careful planning and thought with input from both family/ whnau and school staff. The emphasis should be on critical skills for adult functioning. Assessment of the young person's current skills in the community, work and leisure may hel p identify priority skills. Observation and information from teachers and family should inform the assessment. The student's preferences for work, leisure and domestic activities should also inform the planning (Recommendation 3.3.2 ). All students will nee d goals around communication. For some students, these will emphasise functional communication skills to cope in a wider range of adult community settings. Other students will require attention to pragmatic skills relating to communicating in the work plac e. It is important that functional academic skills and problem solving are also included. At this stage, however, it is important that there is an emphasis on the young person's particular interests and strengths in developing his/her curriculum220 (for further discussion see section 5.1: After secondary school ). Part 3: Education for learners with ASD 124 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 3.4 Education sector organisation and management Summary of recommendations Recommendations: Grade 3.4.1 All school staff should be offered informatio n about ASD and given opportunities for discussion with an aim towards understanding the needs and experiences of the child or young person. C 3.4.2 Peers should be provided with information about ASD and given support and encouragement to foster relation ships. C 3.4.3 When making a choice about educational placement, teams should consider whether the following factors are provided or can be created: structure opportunities for contact with typically developing peers trained and stable staff staff with a positive attitude willingness of all staff and management to work with family /whnau as a team flexibility to meet changing needs. C 3.4.4 Education for students with ASD in New Zealand schools should have the following elements: individualised supports a nd services systematic instruction comprehensible and structured learning environments specialised curriculum content a functional approach to problem behaviours family /whnau involvement. B 3.4.5 All transitions for students with ASD should be carefully planned and the child or young person and the new environment carefully prepared. B Part 3: Education for learners with ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 125 The support of the whole school community is a key factor in the successful education of a child or young person with ASD. The following key elements were identified as being important general principles. Support from management Teachers and specialist educators who work with children and young people with ASD are involved in difficult work, requiring specialised skills and good judgement. Support for staff from school management has been identified as a critical element of success .211 Teachers require support from school management for professional learning and development and release for consultation with specialist ASD supp ort staff .211 School -wide policies need to be reviewed with consideration of the implications for students with special education needs .104 There are few specific dat a on the progress of students with ASD in New Zealand schools. Data need to be recorded about outcomes and difficulties encountered to inform future policy and funding. Whole school awareness The child or young person with ASD benefits both from a consiste ncy of intervention and interactions with staff that have insight into his or her perspective and needs. Opportunities for the development of whole school awareness and education will result in individual teachers working with school - wide support and encou ragement, rather than tackling problems in isolation .11 104 All members of staff require information, experiences and opportunities for discussion to help them foster more accepting attitudes towards individuals with ASD211 (Recommendation 3.4.1 ). Support for peers If interactions and relationships with peers are to be successful, the other students require support and infor mation104 211 263 (Recommendation 3.4.2 ). Units of work and simulations designed to facilitate a better understanding have proved effecti ve.255 Education of others is important to protect the child from teasing and provide peers with some insight into the child 's needs. Other students need to understand the reactions of the child with ASD when he or she is anxious or upset and to be aware of his or her particular interests .263 Decisions about what others are told about the individual child need to be made with consideration of the views of the family /whnau .104 209 Staff should be particularly alert for signs of bullying of students with ASD. Support for students There are many students with ASD who do not receive additional suppor t from the Ministry of Education through current special education initiatives. Given the complex nature of this disorder, it is likely that all students will require access to some ASD -specific specialist service at some points in time. Support for teache rs The research repeatedly emphasises that there is no one programme, strategy or level of intensity to meet all the needs for all children and that individualised programmes of support are the most appropriate .104 226 To understand the needs of students, provide ASD -specific assessments, interventions and strategies and provide effective teaching, teachers require positive attitudes and access to trained and skilled specialist suppor t and coordination ( for further discussion of this point see Part 6, Professional learning and development ). Part 3: Education for learners with ASD 126 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 3.4.a Choice of educational placement Times of transition are stressful for parents and children with ASD. Parents require balanced information abo ut, and support in accessing, the different options and approaches for the next step in the education of their son or daughter. Decisions need to take account of the needs of the child as well as the preferences of the family /whnau and what options are lo cally available .11 255 Options for students with ASD include state funded and integrated primary, intermediate and secondary schools, kura kaupapa Mori, special schools and schools with attached units, private schools and schools of special character. The Correspondence School also provides services for students with special education needs and some families opt for home schooling. However, not all these choices will be available to families in every locality. Schooling in New Zealand: A guide states: Special education services are available for children with disabilities, learning or behaviour difficulties who need additional resources to those usually provided in regular education s ettings. Students with special education needs can receive help in a range of settings, including special schools, special education classes in regular schools and mainstream classrooms. Most students with special education needs attend a regular school. Parents and caregivers of children with special education needs have the same rights as other parents and caregivers to enrol their children at the school of their choice. It is against the law for any educational institution to treat a student differently because of a disability (for example, by denying or restricting services ). Where it is the parents ' choice, children with disabilities are enrolled with other children in ordinary classes wherever possible. If necessary, buildings are modified, special equipment is provided and extra staff may be appointed to help teachers. As well, advisers may help teachers develop suitable programmes for the individual child .264 The evidence for children with ASD suggests that , in general, the principle of the 'least restrictive environment ' should be used and the paramount consideration should be the wellbeing of the child and freedom from persecution, stress and distress .11 104 Each child should be accommodated in the least restrictive setting required to still meet that student 's needs (ie, as close to a regular school setting as possible). A more restrictive environment may be required for students with severe behavioural needs where they represent a danger to themselves or others. On the whole, the setting is less important than the attitude, level of expertise and understanding about ASD of all those concerned with the child. Where the re is expertise and understanding, children make good progress in a variety of settings. Where there is less sensitivity to ASD, children can be adversely affected and may not make good progress academically or socially .11 Some research shows that many children and young people make better connections in the natural setting of regular school education, where natural rewards are plentiful and there are good role models .263 The development of peer -mediated interventions is particularly helpful .104 211 For regular education placements to be successful, educators require knowle dge of and access to empirically validated strategies and professional supports .255 Settings need to provide sufficient structure to support the child or young person .11 104 Part 3: Education for learners with ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 127 It is important that placement decisions be flexible and not irrevocable, as the child 's needs change over time. In conclusion, the most suitable setting will be one: that provides adequate structure and gives the child or young person opportunities for contact with typically developing peers where staff are well trained and have a positive attitude, expertise, understanding and a willingness to work in a team with the family /whnau that has the ability to be flexible in meeting the child 's needs over time (Recommendation 3.4.3 ). 3.4.b Implications for the New Zealand school sector The literature for early childhood includes variable age ranges, with some studies covering up to the age of seven years .11 104 The literature suggests that it is appropriate that programmes for young children are adapted and continue throu gh their first years of transition to compulsory education. Researchers identified six core elements of effective educational practices for school -aged children and young people: Individualised supports and services This element includes incorporating a focus on the child/young person 's strengths and weaknesses, as well as family /whnau preferences, child and young person preferences and interests to determine the most appropriate intensity and level of instruction to meet the child or young person 's indivi dual goals. Systematic instruction This involves carefully planning for instruction by identifying valid educational goals, carefully outlining instructional procedures for teaching, implementing the procedures, evaluating their effectiveness and adjusting the instruction on the basis of the evaluations. Comprehensible and structured learning environments This includes strategies such as organising the instructional setting, providing a schedule of activities that is kept up to date, carefully planning and providing choice -making opportunities, providing preventive behavioural support and providing supports to assist with transitions, flexibility and change. Specific curriculum content This component describes prioritising the core difficulties for individua ls with ASD in the areas of communication and social interaction, and the skills that are required to participate. Functional approach to problem behaviour This describes the process by which the child/young person 's problem behaviour is not merely decreas ed or eliminated, but is replaced with an appropriate alternative or replacement behaviour that results in the same or similar consequences (this is described in detail in section 3.2.e ). Family involvement Families /whnau should be provided with the infor mation they require to be involved in making decisions for their child/young person and to participate as part of the team designing the child or young person 's programme226 (Recommendation 3.4.4 ). These points, on the core elements of effective teaching of children and young people with ASD, are further expanded in Appendix 7. Part 3: Education for learners with ASD 128 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Collaborative teams in education Developing and maintaining effective collaborative relationships are important components in special edu cation support .104 Most teams will consist of core members who will generally include the student 's classroom teacher, special education needs coordinator (SENCO) and the student 's family and whnau. Wider teams will include other staff such as psychologists, speech -language or occupational therapists and other teachers, paraprofessionals and school staff. Teams need a dual focus in delivering supports to students by directing attention to the student and also to the team itself. Student -centred efforts include: developing the student 's schedule or programme collaboratively designing accommodations and adaptations together finding ways to ensure consistency and quality among school staff shared problem solving abo ut specific issues co-teaching and co -working planning for successful transitions within, between and beyond early childhood education settings and schools. Team -centred efforts include: understanding other team members ' roles and skills clarifying the tea m's values learning to communicate effectively among team members identifying and resolving concerns reaching consensus on decisions developing trust and respect .265 The biggest barriers to collaborative teaming are negative staff attitudes and a lack of time. However, there is good evidence that collaborative teams enhance teacher satisfaction with their jobs, improve communication and collaboration skills for all participants and result in better decisions and results for students .265 The roles of specific professionals The education section of the ASD Guideline has deliberately not closely defined specific roles for particular professional groups such as occupational therapists and speech - language therapists when working in early intervention and educational settings. The intention was to identify the knowledge and skills which are required to support children and young people with ASD in a variety of settings. Member s of a well -functioning collaborative team will share information and enskill one another. It is expected that each professional will take the lead in areas where they have particular expertise, for example, speech -language therapists in planning communica tion strategies. The skills of different professionals will overlap in some areas. Some teams may have gaps in the skills and knowledge available to them from actual members of a child/young person 's team. In such circumstances, professionals may need to act as consultants to the team from a distance. Readers who seek more details about the work of various professional groups should source information from the relevant professional bodies. These include: New Zealand Association of Occupational Therapists (N ZAOT) New Zealand Speech and Language Therapists Association (NZSTA) New Zealand Psychological Society. Part 3: Education for learners with ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 129 3.4.c Supporting and planning for transitions Times of transition (from one teacher to another, as well as from one setting to another) are stressful fo r all children and young people and their parents. Times of transition provide additional challenges for students with ASD. These can include transitions from home to school, between activities, from place to place, between classrooms and from one school t o another. Strategies to help students to understand the purpose and expectations of transitions are essential and include: visual supports maps priming schedules of events planning for changes and sharing plans with the child social stories careful analys is of difficult ies (not always what is assumed) .209 219 Developing and regularly updating a personal profile for students is one way to ensure recognition of their sk ills and behaviours, as well as their preferences, interests, effective strategies and prior learning (Recommendation 3.4.5. For further discussion of transitions see sections 3.1 and 3.3 ). Part 4: Treatment and managemen t of ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 131 Part 4 Treatment and management of ASD \"I do want to stre ss that people with autism should be helped to the point where they can help themselves. We need the best treatment and education we can get.\" Part 4: Treatment and management of ASD 132 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Part 4 Treatment and management of ASD This section covers the management of behavioural, emotional and mental health difficulties that can be experienced by children, young people and adults with ASD. Many of these difficulties can be prevented, minimised or alleviated by interventions with a totally educational component (see Part 3: Education for learners with ASD ). This section applies to interventions with a different focus for these problems. Part 4: Treatment and managemen t of ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 133 4.1 Introduction Summary of recommendations Recommendations: Grade 4.1.1 Treatment should encourage functional development, teach skills for independent living, and mini mise stress for the person with ASD , and their family and whnau. B 4.1.2 Treatments of ASD and co -morbid conditions should be matched to the specific characteristics and needs of the person concerned. B 4.1.3 Treatments of ASD and co -morbid conditions s hould be based on comprehensive diagnostic and ongoing assessments. B 4.1.4 Pre-treatment assessments should gather detailed information on behavioural, emotional and mental health difficulties, address differential diagnosis, screen for medical condition s and address environmental issues. B 4.1.4a Gastrointestinal problems, specifically constipation, chronic diarrhoea, altered bowel habits, and encopresis (faecal soiling), are more common in children and young people with ASD compared with typically deve loping peers. ( see Appendix 10.4 ). B 4.1.4 b Children and young people with ASD should have a full evaluation that includes a thorough assessment of gastrointestinal function. Some children, particularly those with social communication difficulties, may have atypical presentations such as increased anxiety, irritability, disordered sleep patterns, and unusual vocalisations and movements . (see Appendix 10.4 ). C 4.1.5 Treatment plans should be comprehensive, and include behavioural needs, educational interve ntions, psychosocial treatments, communication, environmental and systems issues and the suit ability (or not) of medication. B Autism spectrum disorders are behaviourally defined. Working through the symptoms of ASD, it is clear that behavioural and emoti onal problems typify the disorder, and that long -term problems may arise if the communicative, social and ritualistic/obsessive aspects of ASD are not attended to.256 266 267 Common behavioural problems include hyperactivity, attention difficulties, repetitive and ritualistic behaviours, self -injury, tics, and unusually strong interests .42 268 Problems with mood are common ,42 as are social difficulties .269 Not surprisingly, parents of children and y oung people with ASD frequently seek behavioural advice, as do families and carers of those adults with ASD who also have an intellectual disability. Good treatment of ASD encourages normal development and skills for independent living, while minimising th e stress of the person with ASD and their family /whnau , and treatments are likely to be more successful if they are targeted on specific skills development (Recommendation 4.1.1 ). Part 4: Treatment and management of ASD 134 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline There is a growing literature on the mental health concerns of people with ASD. Emotional problems, such as poor anger and a nxiety control and depression, appear to be common experiences of young people and adults with ASD ,269 270 especially at times of transition and at adolescence. Major psychiatric dis orders (eg, bipolar affective disorder, psychoses, schizophrenia and catatonia) have also been described in research and academic case studies . 26 54 270-275 A study of the diagnostic accuracy of the Autism Spectrum Disorder Screening Adults Questionnaire found that 1.4% of the psychiatric population screened (n=1323) had ASD, most previously undiagnosed .74 The increased prevalence of psychiatric problems in the population of people with intellectual disabilities has been well established in the literature .167 Preliminary re search on the prevalence of psychiatric symptomatology in people with intellectual disabilities with and without ASD suggests that those with ASD have a much higher chance of developing psychiatric problems .268 There is debate about whether the behavioural, emotional and mental health issues of people with ASD should be considered co -morbid disorders (ie, completely separate disorders that occur at the same time as ASD) or underlying symptoms of ASD itself .270 271 Nevertheless, international guidelines for children with ASD suggest that treatments of ASD itself should be distinguished from treatments of co -morbid disorders11 and treat ment should be individualised (Recommendation 4.1.2 ). While no treatment or medication actually cures ASD, such interventions can sometimes effectively manage associated emotional and mental health problems .273 The first step in the treatment of the behavioural, emotional and mental health problems of people with ASD is comprehensive assessment42 and assessment should be ongoing (Recommendation 4.1.3 ). Initial diagnost ic assessment has been covered elsewhere in this guideline ( see Part 1 Diagnosis and initial assessment of ASD ). Pre -treatment assessments gather information on behavioural, emotional and mental health difficulties in much more detail, address differential diagnosis, and screen for medical conditions before developing psychological programmes256 266 (Recommendation 4.1.4 ). Note that research on gastrointestinal issues in children and young people with ASD (Recommendation 4.1.4a, 4.1.4b ) was comprehensively updated as part of the living guideline process, and is summarised in Appendix 10.4, and available as full text from the Ministry of Health website .15 Treatments of ASD and co -morbid conditions are most appropriate when derived from comprehensive diagnostic and ongoing assessments, given that no one option works for all people with ASD .42 256 270 Components of comprehensive treatment plans include those that address behavioural needs, educational interventions, psychosocial treatments, communication and the s uitability (or not) of medication42 (Recommendation 4.1.5 ). In many cases, education on ASD and post -diagnosis counselling may help ameliorate various issues. However, often the behavioural, emotional and mental health needs of people with ASD will need to be specifically addressed. Part 4: Treatment and managemen t of ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 135 4.2 Problem minimisation and avoidance Summary of recommendations Recommendations: Grade 4.2.1 The development of social skills and community support groups for young people and a dults should be undertaken to minimise and avoid problems. C 4.2.1a Facilitated and structured social skills groups should be considered for high functioning children and young people with ASD (see Appendix 10.6 ). B 4.2.2 Parents, families and whnau sho uld be provided with information on interventions and supports that are available locally, nationally and internationally. C Good Practice Points: 4.2.1b Social skills groups approaches in New Zealand need to be responsive to the cultural and linguistic diversity of the group participants (see Appendix 10.6 ). 4.2.1c Decisions about participating in social skills groups should be guided by whether a person with ASD values it, and whether they are expected to benefit from it (see Appendix 10.6 ). 4.2.3 Routine monitoring (or monitoring schemes) of young people and adults should be considered to minimise and avoid problems. 4.2.4 Attention to the core deficits of ASD as experienced by young people and adults should be considered to minimise and avoid problems. Because of their social and communication problems, people with ASD are at risk of developing behavioural and emotional difficulties from childhood. Once problem behaviours have become established, they are not likely to decrease without inte rvention, and are more likely to worsen than improve. Not intervening and hoping the child will outgrow behavioural problems is a mistake .256 270 Many of the emotional, behavioural a nd even legal problems experienced by young people and adults with ASD arise from communication difficulties, social misunderstanding, obsessions, compulsions, and ritualistic or repetitive behaviours ,266 which are frequently evident in childhood. Therefore problem minimisation and avoidance early in life is essential (see section 3.2.e : Selfmanagement skills and addressing challenging behaviour in education settings ). Given individual and family differences, no one method or style of intervention is likely to be effective for all children with ASD and intervention will need to be adapted to individual needs .266 Accordingly, parents, families and whnau of young children with ASD should be supported to: Part 4: Treatment and management of ASD 136 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline learn about ASD as it affects their child, and adapt the home environment and routines accordingl y develop routines within the home that work for both the child and the family and whnau ensure that behaviours that are 'cute ' in young children do not develop into problem behaviours for people of an older age develop methods of communication that can b e used inside and outside the home give their child opportunities to mix with other children, learn social skills, and develop friendships seek referrals for specialist services (eg, speech and communication therapy, behaviour support, occupational therapy , clinical psychology) if they need assistance to help their child develop skills or to prevent or manage problem behaviour .256 270 276-278 Problem minimisation and avoidance is equally as important for services and paid staff . Agencies providing services for people with ASD of any age (including adulthood) can implement strategies designed both to avoid the development of pro blem behaviour, and to intervene early, such as ensuring that members of staff have good education in ASD, that education is current and that agency procedures incorporate best practice in ASD (Recommendation 6.17, Professional learning and development ). Adequate service provision for young people and adults with ASD and routine monitoring may reduce the number and severity of stressors experienced by people with ASD and, in doing so, minimise and avoid problems (Good Practice Point 4.2.3 ). Attention to edu cational, work and vocational options (see section 5.1 After secondary school ) could address some of the problems associated with financial hardship, social isolation, boredom, and lack of a valued role in society. Addressing the communication needs and so cial skills of a person with ASD, which are core deficits of this condition, is frequently effective in preventing and/or managing behavioural and emotional problems (Good Practice Point 4.2.4 ). Promising outcomes have been described for adults with ASD fo llowing participation in relatively inexpensive and time - efficient social skills groups279 and community support schemes9 283 284 (Recommendation 4.2.1 ). Research on social skills groups for young people and adults ) was comprehensively updated as part of the living guideline process, and is summarised in Appendix 10.6, and availab le as full text from the Ministry of Health website17 (Recommendation 4.2.1a, Good Practice Points 4.2.1b and 4.2.1c ). For all people wit h ASD and their parents, family and whnau, information on interventions and supports that are available locally is of utmost importance. As well as formal services provided by the Ministries of Health and Education, people may value contact with people in a similar situation to themselves. Contact by telephone, the Internet, informal support groups and joining ASD and/or disability associations should be encouraged (Recommendation 4.2.2. See Part 2: Support for individuals, families and carers ). However, b ecause of the current state of scientific knowledge, caution should be exercised when selecting interventions (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 ). Part 4: Treatment and managemen t of ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 137 4.3 Psychological approaches to the management of ASD Summary of recommendations Recommendations: Grade 4.3.1 Professionals should, objectively and honestly, interpret research evidence for parents or people with ASD. C 4.3.2 Structured educational/daily living programmes and interventions with an emphasis on visually based cues should be implemented. They should focus on skill enhancement and establishment of communication strategies. Family -centred treatment approaches should be provided. C 4.3.3 Professionals, people with ASD, family, whnau and carers should evaluate treatment approaches before and during implementation. C 4.3.4 Behaviour management techniques should be used to intervene with problem behaviours following functional behavio ur assessment (see Appendix 10.1 ). A 4.3.5 All behavioural interventions should be of good quality and incorporate the following principles: person -centred planning, functional assessment, positive intervention strategies, multifaceted interventions, focu s on environment, meaningful outcomes, focus on ecological validity and systems -level intervention. C 4.3.5a Interventions and strategies based on applied behaviour analysis (ABA) principles should be considered for all children with ASD (see Appendix 10.1). A 4.3.5b Early intensive behavioural intervention (EIBI) should be considered as a treatment of value for young children with ASD to improve outcomes such as cognitive ability, language skills, and adaptive behaviour (see Appendix 10.1). B 4.3.6 Cons umers of applied behaviour analysis interventions should refer to recently published guidelines for identifying, selecting and evaluating behaviour analyst services for people with ASD (see Appendix 10.1 ). C 4.3.7 The feasibility of establishing publicly funded, ASD -specific behavioural services should be investigated. C 4.3.8 Insight -oriented therapy and psychodynamic therapy are not recommended as suitable treatments for people with ASD. C 4.3.9 Cognitive behaviour therapy should be considered as a sui table treatment for many behavioural, emotional and mental health difficulties. C 4.3.9a Broadly defined cognitive behaviour therapy, adapted for ASD, may assist adults with mental health conditions (see Appendix 10. 7). C 4.3.10 Cognitive behaviour thera pists should adapt their techniques to take into account the characteristics of people with ASD. C Part 4: Treatment and management of ASD 138 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Good Practice Points: 4.3.9b Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) has been designed and evaluated predominantly for people without ASD. More research is reco mmended to further develop and evaluate effective cognitive behaviour therapies and their necessary adaptations for people on the spectrum as well as appropriate and valid outcome measures for research in this field . As it seems likely that some individual s receiving CBT benefit and some do not, future research should also investigate what personal characteristics and aspects of therapy best predict treatment effectiveness (see Appendix 10.7). 4.3.10a The following adaptations to cognitive behaviour ther apy are recommended: Use a structured approach and minimise anxiety about the therapeutic process by being explicit about roles, times, goals and techniques. Extend the number of sessions and time provided to conduct tasks to accommodate slower information -processing and the mental demands of the therapeutic process. Be flexible about the length of each session and offer breaks to allow for cognitive and motivational deficits. Provide psycho -education about autism, emotions, and mental health cha llenges rel evant to the client. Concentrate on well defined and specific difficulties as the starting point for intervention, with less emphasis o n changing client's cognitions. Be more active and directive in therapy, where appropriate, including giving suggestions, information, and immediate and specific feedback on performance. Examine the rationale and evidence for inaccurate, automatic thoughts and collaboratively develop alternative interpretations, concrete strategies and courses of action. Teach explicit rules and their appropriate context, including the use of verbal, nonverbal and paralinguis tic cues to a social situation. Incorporate specific behavioural techniques where appropriate, such as relaxation strategies, meditation, mindfulness, thought stopping or systematic desensitisation. Communicate visually (eg, using worksheets, images, diagrams, 'tool boxes', comic strip conversations, video -taped vignettes, peer - modelling, and working together on a computer). Avoid ambiguity through minimising the use of co lloquialisms, abstract concepts and metaphor. Use specific and concrete analogies relatable to the client's concerns. Part 4: Treatment and managemen t of ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 139 Good Practice Points: Incorporate participants ' interests in terms of content and modes of content delivery to enhance engagement. Involve a support person , such as a family member, partner, carer or key worker (if the person with autism agrees) as a co -therapist to improve generalisation of skills learned within sessions (see Appendix 10.7 ). 4.3.11 Applied behaviour analysis (ABA ) interventions and strateg ies should be relevant to the child 's context and culture (see Appendix 10.1 ). 4.3.12 Interventions based on the principles of ABA can be introduced before the diagnosis of ASD is confirmed in a child displaying some of the symptoms of ASD (see Appendix 10.1). There are many approaches to treating and managing ASD. Interventions and approaches that make compelling claims to cure ASD are easily sourced through the Internet, although many make claims that have not been substantiated .212 266 280 286-291 Although claims are often str ongly worded, a great deal of the information that is readily accessible is biased, and claims that certain interventions 'cure ' ASD or lead to 'recovery ' have been described as misleading and irresponsible .281 While every parent or person with ASD has the right to seek treatment from any source they believe may work for them, professionals have a responsibility to interpret research evidence for them and be as objective and honest as possible (Recommendation 4.3 .1). The absence of appropriately supportive data for most of the treatment approaches underlies the reluctance that many authorities worldwide share for publicly funding specific treatment methods .212 282 283 Furthermore non-established treatments can be costly in time and money and some have adverse effects .284 As ASD represents a heterogeneous spectrum of dis orders, treatments may have differential effects in individuals, making the identification of effective treatments difficult. There is a great deal of variability in response to treatment and some individuals may show apparently spontaneous improvement in symptoms in a particular area for unidentified reasons. In such a situation, if an intervention has been recently implemented, the improvement can be erroneously attributed to the treatment, even when the treatment is actually ineffective. The following in tervention guidance has been suggested (which is also contained in Part 3: Education for learners with ASD - the same principles apply in both settings) :285 treatment programmes should be individually designed, taking into account the individual 's cognitive level, severity of autistic symptomatology, overall developmental level, chronological age and temperament/personality (Recommendation 4.1.2 ) structured educational/daily living programmes should be considered ; programmes with an emphasis on visually based cues can provide a predictable and readily understandable environment, minimising confusion and distress to the person with ASD (Recommendation 4.3.2 ) Part 4: Treatment and management of ASD 140 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline interventions should take account of the core deficits of autism (eg, communication, social skills and stereotyped and ritualistic behaviour) (Good Practice Point 4.2.5 ) many undesirable or challenging behaviours reflect limited behavioural repertoires or poor communication skills, so focus on skill enhancement and establishment of more effective communication strategies are often the most successful means of reducing difficult or disruptive behaviours (Recommendation 4.3.2 ) family -centred treatment approaches result in greater generalisation and maintenance of s kills. Development of management strategies that can be implemented consistently but do not demand extensive sacrifice in terms of time, money or other aspects of family life seem most likely to offer benefits for all involved (Recommendation 4.3.2 ). Guide lines for evaluating treatment options for people with ASD advise parents, family, whnau and professionals to: ask specific questions about the treatment regarding its goals, components, style, target group, outcomes, efficacy, effectiveness (and the best method for evaluating this), negative effects, risks and safeguards find out about therapist experience, qualifications and professional association be hopeful, but conservative, about any new treatment where the efficacy of the treatment has not been pro ven remember that the primary goal of any treatment should be to help the person with ASD live as full a life as possible within society beware of any programme that claims to be effective for all people with ASD be cautious of programmes that do not allow individualisation recognise that there are likely to be several suitable treatment options for each person with ASD recognise that treatment choices should be based on the results of the person 's individual assessment avoid treatment approaches that do no t provide information on how to assess whether the person with ASD is suitable for that treatment use appropriate methods to determine whether the treatment was effective (eg, appropriate behavioural data; trialling the treatment for a sufficient length of time, completion of appropriate questionnaires about the targeted behaviours/skills before and after treatment, telling no one when a treatment has started, and monitoring of the behaviour of the person with ASD by making written notes)286-289 (Recommendation 4.3.3 ). 4.3.a Behavioural interventions Behavioural interventions, following careful and thorough functional behaviour assessment , are often the most appropriate means of addressing behavioural problems for people with ASD42 256 266 270 277 278and those with an intellectual disability257 290 (Recommendation 4.3. 4). However, assessment must be comprehensive and consider all potential causes of behavioural problems (eg, pain, undiagnosed medical issues, sensory problems, abuse, etc). Although differences of opinion exist regarding how behavioural interventions are described (eg, applied behaviour analysis, positive behaviour support, behaviour modification, behavioural programming, etc) ,256 291 and various methods of behavioura l assessment and interventions development have been published, all behavioural interventions are based on the science of applied behaviour analysis. It is beyond the scope of the New Zealand ASD Guideline to provide details Part 4: Treatment and managemen t of ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 141 on how a practitioner should co nduct a behavioural assessment, and how behavioural interventions are developed and implemented. A large literature on this exists, and includes many lengthy texts. Features common to behavioural interventions of good quality are: person -centred planning: through which the person with ASD remains the focus of the assessment and treatment, and the individual characteristics are taken into account functional assessment: a comprehensive assessment, through which all the factors that reliably precede, predict a nd maintain the problem behaviour (including setting, specific triggers, reinforcers) are identified, through means of thorough interview, observation, recording and/or formal testing positive intervention strategies: a preference for interventions which u se positive reinforcement, as opposed to punishment multifaceted interventions: packages of treatment which include more than one intervention, such as specific intervention procedures combined with staff and carer education focus on environment: designing or altering the environment of the person with ASD to effect behaviour change meaningful outcomes: measures of successful intervention which are significant to the person with ASD and/or the people with whom they associate focus on ecological validity: interventions which are settings - specific and are implemented in the places that people live, study, work, socialise or otherwise spend their time, so that they can be transferred or generalised to other settings systems -level intervention: interventions that take into account the systems -level issues and overall context (eg, agency policy, staff professional learning and development, financial constraints, team values etc) and, when required, seek to alter matters at the systems level291 (Recommendation 4.3.5 ). Note that research on applied behaviour analysis (ABA) and early intensive behavioural intervention (EIBI) in children with ASD was comprehensively updated as part of the living guideline process, and is sum marised in Appendix 10.1, and available as full text from the Ministry of Health website12 (Recommendations 4.3.5a and 4.3.5b, and Good Practice Points 4.3.11 and 4.3.12 ). Within New Zealand, a range of professi onals develop and implement behavioural interventions. However, there are significant variations in educational level, professional affiliation or accreditation, expertise and supervision arrangements, all of which can impact on intervention quality. Consu mers are advised to scrutinise the expertise of professionals providing behavioural interventions, including checking that the person has the appropriate professional affiliation (eg, for those claiming to be psychologists, teachers, applied behaviour anal ysts, etc) (Recommendation 6.14, Professional learning and development ). For example, it is against the law (Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act) for a person to call him/herself a psychologist if he/she is not registered with the Psychologists B oard. There is growing international pressure for practitioners of applied behaviour analysis to be formally accredited, as a means of ensuring service quality and good professional practice292 (Recommendation 4.3.6), but so far there are few accredited applied behaviour analysts in New Zealand. For further information, interested parties are referred to recently published guidelines Part 4: Treatment and management of ASD 142 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline for identifying, selecting, and evaluating behaviour analysts for people with AS D.292 Currently there are no publicly funded, ASD -specific, behavioural services in New Zealand292 (Recommendation 4.3.7 ). 4.3.b Cognitive behaviour therapy Often the first source of formal assistance when people experience emotional or behavioural difficulties is a counsellor. Although some counsellors may have good skills in working with people with ASD, many do not. Lack of understanding of ASD and approaches that w ork effectively with ASD are problems shared by many counsellors, therapists and other mental health professionals working with adults .47 293 294 Knowledge and understanding of ASD are crucial for the success of any therapeutic encounter. Given the importance and financial cost of counselling, a counsellor or therapist must be carefully selected. Of equal importance is the t heoretical orientation of the counsellor or psychologist. Because of the social and communicative aspects of ASD, expert opinion suggests that psychodynamic styles based on insight, introspection and the development of a therapeutic alliance are unlikely t o be successful270 295 (Recommendation 4.3.8 ). Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), a therapeutic approach well supported across problem types and many different popula tions (including the intellectually disabled), may be more promising46 270 289 296 305 (Recommendation 4.3.9 ). The more structured format of CBT and practical emphasis on the here -and-now may account for this .295 297 298 CBT is derived from applied behaviour analysis and behaviour therapy, and addresses the role of beliefs about events in the development and maintenance of emotional distress. CBT typically consists of five components: psycho -education about the emotional and/or mental health difficulty, and education about CBT itself teaching the person how to control the physical symptoms of the problem (eg, relaxation training, spe cific breathing techniques) teaching the person how to identify faulty/irrational cognitions (thoughts), and how to change the cognitions into a more appropriate/helpful form (cognitive restructuring) assisting the person to practice his/her new coping ski lls in situations where the problematic emotions/behaviours occur; this may be a graduated process developing long -term plans (relapse prevention plans) aimed at helping the person to identify and respond appropriately to early warning signs and triggers .296 Because of the symptoms of ASD, even experienced cognitive behaviour therapists working with people with ASD need to understand ASD and how the characteristics of the disorder are likely to present in therapy . Advice to cognitive behaviour therapists on adapting their techniques to more appropriately suit people with ASD includes: concentrate on well defined and specific difficulties attend to and intervene with the core deficits of ASD (communication, social skills, stereotypical and repetitive behaviour) and alter techniques accordingly minimise anxiety about the therapeutic process by being explicit about roles, times, goals and using techniques like repertory grid be flexible about the length of sessions and leaving the treatment room Part 4: Treatment and managemen t of ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 143 avoid direct challenges to personal beliefs, as these may be misinterpreted as a personal attack; instead, examine the rationale and evidence and collaboratively develop alternative interpretations and beliefs use visual imager y encourage clients to write down positive things, rather than relying on changing thoughts in their heads incorporate specific behavioural techniques where appropriate, such as relaxation strategies, thought stopping or systematic desensitisation267 295 297 299 (Recommendation 4.3.10 ). Research on cognitive behaviour therapy for adults was comprehensively updated as part of the living guideline process. It is summarised in Appendix 10.7, and is available as full text from the Ministry of Health website.18 (Also see new recommendation 4 .3.9a, and new good practice points 4.3.9b and 4.3.10a .) 4.4 Pharmacological Grade 4.4.1 SSRIs (eg, fluoxetine) may be effective for some children with ASD and high anxiety and/or obsessive symp toms. However, in the absence of good evidence, these drugs should be used with caution and careful monitoring. B 4.4.1a Citalopram cannot currently be recommended for the treatment of repetitive behaviours in children and young people with ASD (see Appen dix 10.2 ). B 4.4.1b Citalopram 's use for established comorbid indications for children and young people (eg, anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder) should be considered with significant caution on a case -by-case basis, after full disclosure of side effec ts to the individual and their family and careful ongoing monitoring (see Appendix 10.2 ). C 4.4.2 There is insufficient evidence to make any recommendation in relation to the use of other types of antidepressants in children with ASD. I 4.4.3 Risperidone is effective in reducing aggressive behaviour, irritability and self-injurious behaviour in children with ASD. It may be useful in improving restricted interests and patterns of behaviour. It should be used with caution because of the high risk of adverse effects and the uncertainly about long -term effects. Monitoring for side effects should be carried out on a regular basis. Risperidone is currently on the IMMP (Intensive Medicines Monitoring Programme) in New Zealand and all new clinical events should be reported. B Part 4: Treatment and management of ASD 144 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Recommendations: Grade 4.4.4 In most circumstances risperidone should be the first medication used when indicated for significant irritability in children and young people with ASD. Aripiprazole could be used as a second -line treatment where individuals have demons trated poor efficacy to risperidone or where there is concern regarding significant metabolic or adverse effects. Clinicians prescribing these drugs need to keep up to date with current literature (see Appendix 10.2 ). B 4.4.5 Typical antipsychotics are ef fective in reducing motor stereotypies, temper tantrums and improving social relatedness. These drugs have a high rate of adverse effects and are therefore not recommended for first -line use. Haloperidol, in particular has been shown to cause little weight gain. Thioridazine should only be used in exceptional circumstances, as recent reports have implicated thioridazine in cases of sudden death. B 4.4.6 Methylphenidate is effective for some children with ASD and co -morbid ADHD. It should be used with cauti on because of the high risk of adverse effects. C 4.4.7 Melatonin can be recommended for use in children and young people with ASD who are experiencing significant sleep problems (see Appendix 10.2 ). B 4.4.7a Benefits and adverse effects of longer term t reatment of melatonin require further investigation (see Appendix 10.2 ). C 4.4.7b Behavioural strategies (eg, sleep hygiene) should always be used in conjunction wit h melatonin (see Appendix 10.2 ). C 4.4.8 Co-morbid bipolar disorder should be managed in consultation with an appropriately experienced psychiatrist. C 4.4.9 Children with ASD who also have epilepsy should be managed in consultation with an appropriately experienced clinician. C 4.4.10 There is insufficient evidence to make any recommendatio n with respect to the use of the following drugs for ASD -specific symptoms in children with ASD. However, these medications are in current use, and may be used by experienced clinicians, who maintain up to date knowledge of the literature: clonidine sedati ves (benzodiazepines, antihistamines). I 4.4.11 There is insufficient evidence to make any recommendation with respect to the use of the following drugs for ASD -specific symptoms in children with ASD. The opinion of the Guideline Development Team is that these medications are unlikely to be useful: amantadine intravenous immunoglobulins naltrexone. I Part 4: Treatment and managemen t of ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 145 Recommendations: Grade 4.4.12 The use of the following drugs and agents is NOT recommended: fenfluramine secretin chelation therapy. A A C 4.4.13 Clinicians prescribing more than one medication or prescribing any additional medication must consider the possibility of drug interactions. C Children and young people The mainstays of treatment for behavioural, emotional and mental health problems are supportive, educational and beh avioural approaches. No medication has been identified as a cure for ASD. However, a number of medications may be helpful in significantly improving various target symptoms and associated conditions. Many of these same medications can continue to be used i n adults with ASD but there is little evidence to provide specific comparative advice on effectiveness and safety. The use of alternative strategies for behavioural difficulties, including behavioural and psychological approaches, environmental modificatio n to ensure safety of the child and others, and adequate provision of respite care, should always be considered before using pharmacotherapy. However, it is also acknowledged that many behavioural procedures are also of unknown efficacy and safety. These approaches can be time consuming, expensive and stressful for the child and/or the child 's family and whnau. There are very few well -controlled studies of medications in ASD, particularly in children and adolescents. However, some evidence is accumulating for treatment of both aspects of core autistic symptomatology (largely compulsive and repetitive patterns - the 'cluster c ' symptomatology of DSM IV) and frequent co-morbid symptoms, including anxiety and aggression. Of necessity, therefore, many recommend ations are based on short -term studies or expert opinion. Many medications utilised for children and adolescents with ASD have been developed for and tested in adults. Because of important potential differences in pharmacokinetics (metabolism etc) and phar macodynamics (effects on the body and mind), findings from the adult literature should be applied to children and adolescents with significant caution. Studies involving children and adolescents are slow to take place and numbers included in studies small. Prescription of many agents will, by necessity, therefore be 'off-label ' when applied to children with autism (that is, outside manufacturers ' recommendations) .300 Parents, carers and professionals need to be a ware of the implications of this practice. In addition, the response to medications used to treat co -morbidities may be different for children with ASD so that special care is needed when prescribing in this group. For example, many children with ASD have coexisting significant ADHD symptomatology. While this may often improve significantly with stimulants, stimulants may increase anxiety and stereotyped behaviour. Stimulants may therefore be less useful in some children with autism. There is evidence that suggests that some children with ASD become over -focused when on stimulant medication, and repetitive and obsessional behaviour may be exacerbated .301 Part 4: Treatment and management of ASD 146 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Clearly, for reasons of brevity, this review cannot address the vast literature on the use of psychoactive medications in disorders other than ASD. This means that any prescriber working with children with ASD must have a good working knowledge of psychiatric disorders, their diagnosis and treatment, and indeed of all psychoactive drugs, including their safety and efficacy. If the prescriber does not have this knowledge, then access to a child and adolescent psychiatrist or other appropriately knowledgeable prescriber is necessary. Where there is clear and properly diagnosed evidence of another mental health disorder (eg, ADHD), the child or person with ASD has should be treated according to evidence - based treatment guidelines for that disorder. However, prescribers must make it clear that the treatment may not impro ve ASD symptoms, and must ensure that there is monitoring for side effects (including worsening of ASD core symptoms like obsessional anxiety). Some medications currently in use in children with ASD in New Zealand are relatively new medications. It is esse ntial that both clinicians and parents appreciate that there is therefore very limited information on long -term safety. As children with challenging behaviour may remain on these medications for many years, both prescribers and parents need to understand t hat there is an element of risk in the use of such drugs. The therapeutic use of a large number of different medications and other approaches such as biological agents and dietary approaches (see section 4.5 : Other interventions ) has been studied in ASD an d related disorders, but not many are supported by rigorous evidence. Some of the studies have only assessed classes of medications, rather than individual agents. The most commonly studied agents are risperidone, fenfluramine, secretin and naltrexone. Som e of the evidence for medications may be biased because the studies have been funded by the manufacturers. Medications for which little or no evidence base exists are not necessarily less effective, but it is recommended that clinicians avoid using medicat ions for which evidence of efficacy is not available. A useful summary of issues in paediatric psychopharmacological prescribing may be found in a number of reviews by experts, although only the first of these is autism specific .302-304 Adults The evidence for psychotropic medications specifically for adults with ASD is extremely limited and consultation with specialists is recommended. Although there are specialists a vailable for adults with intellectual disability and dual diagnosis (intellectual disability and mental health problems), there is a lack of specialists with specific knowledge of ASD. Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services see young people until scho ol leaving age. For Ongoing and Reviewable Resourcing Schemes (ORRS) funded students with significant disability, this may be the end of the year in which they have their 21st birthday. Once the young person has left school, services are provided by Adult Mental Health, according to the entry criteria of the particular service concerned. Where an individual, his or her caregiver or service provider thinks that the individual may benefit from the use of psychotropic medication, a consultation should be arran ged with that person 's general practitioner. If the general practitioner requires specialist advice she or he should contact the local adult mental health service and request advice or psychiatric assessment. Regional Dual Disability Services (ie , Speciali st Mental Health Services for adults who have a mental health disorder in addition to an intellectual disability) should be consulted where local primary and secondary services are unable to meet the individual 's need. Part 4: Treatment and managemen t of ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 147 IMPORTANT NOTE FOR PRESCRIBERS: As p rescribing information may change during the currency of this guideline, the guideline group has deliberately not provided full information about the status of medications in relation to registration, funding and manufacturer 's recommendations. All prescri bers must ensure that they are informed of current information in relation to the medications that they use and they should be aware when they are using medications that are 'off-label '. All medications should be used with caution and patients should be ca refully monitored while taking medication. Clinicians are expected to prescribe safely and should be knowledgeable about potential interactions. In particular, prescribers need to keep up to date with current literature, especially in relation to newly rep orted adverse effects and 'black box ' warnings. 4.4.a Managing specific symptoms and co -morbidities The choice of drug should be guided by the clinician 's assessment of the symptom to be targeted by the intervention. Table 4.1 indicates which group of med ications may be considered for a range of target symptoms. Table 4.1: Psychotropic medications used in the management of specific symptoms Symptom/core feature Medications to consider Anxiety SSRI* Mood stabilisers Epilepsy * SSRI = Selective Serotonin Re -uptake Inhibitor The evidence for each group of medications is discussed below. Part 4: Treatment and management of ASD 148 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Antidepressants Selective Serot onin Re -uptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) One small randomised controlled trial (RCT) demonstrated a positive effect of fluoxetine on repetitive behaviour in children and adolescents with ASD .305 A number of open -label studies have reported positive responses to fluoxetine (Prozac) and other selective serotonin re - uptake inhibitors (SSRIs). These responses include improvement in social interaction and emotional reactivity, reduction in stereotypies and obsessiveness, wid ening of range of interests and improvement in fluidity of movement. There are reports that the SSRIs may be helpful for children with ASD who exhibit high anxiety (Recommendation 4.4.1 ). A Cochrane systematic review on the use of SSRIs in ASD is in progre ss by Wheeler and colleagues at Children 's Hospital at Westmead .306 This review is currently at the stage of gathering information from authors and critical appraisal of papers and will not be available for incl usion in this version of the New Zealand ASD Guideline. The SSRIs as a class have a number of usually minor and/or short -lived side effects, as listed in the various manufacturers ' data sheets. These include: insomnia or sleep disturbance behavioural excit ation and agitation dyskinesias or movement disorders withdrawal symptoms (these can occur if these drugs are stopped abruptly or doses are missed). They are more likely with those SSRIs that have a shorter duration of action, such as paroxetine. gastroint estinal upset loss of libido (in adolescents) weight loss. Infrequent but serious side effects may include: serotonin syndrome (particularly if SSRIs are given with other serotinergic drugs or drugs which interfere with liver cytochrome metabolism) an incr ease in suicidal thinking in children and adolescents with mood disorders (notably paroxetine). It should be noted that there has been no evidence of an increase in completed suicide and there is ongoing research into the relationship between use of SSRIs in adolescents and suicidal thinking. Note that research on the use of the SSRI citalopram for children and young people with ASD was comprehensively updated as part of the living guideline process, and is summarised in Appendix 10.2, and available as full text from the Ministry of Health website13 (Recommendations 4.4.1a and 4.4.1b ). Heterocyclic antidepressants Two double inhibition) and placebo .307 308 Clomipramine was significantly more effective in reducing obsessive compulsive behaviours than either desipramine or placebo. Desipramine is more likely to be cardiotoxic than clomipramine. A later study compared clomipramine with haloperidol, and found haloperidol to be superior in terms of symptom control and also to be better tolerated .309 In relation to the use of heterocyclic antidepressants in children with ASD, there is insufficient evidence to make any recommendation (Recommendation 4.4.2 ). Part 4: Treatment and managemen t of ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 149 Antipsychotics Atypical antipsychotics Of the atypical antipsychotics, risperidone is the widely studied. A number of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) suggest that risperidone may be useful for children and adolescents with ASD who have serious behavioural problems (Recommendation 4.4.3 ). The Research Units on Paediatric Psychopharmacology Autism Network demonstrated that risperidone was effective and well tolerated for the treatment of tantrums, aggression and self -injurious beh aviour in children and adolescents with autistic disorder .310 Double -blind placebo -substitution withdrawal of risperidone indicated that risperidone discontinuation was associated with a rapid return of disrupti ve and aggressive behaviour in most subjects .311 The same group also reported that risperidone resulted in significant improvements in the restricted, repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behaviour, interests and activities of autistic children but that it did not significantly improve deficits in social interaction and communication .312 Similarly, another study found that risperidone significantly reduced irritabili ty and other behavioural symptoms in children with ASD .313 While there is good evidence that risperidone is effective in reducing serious behavioural problems in children with ASD, randomised trials and a number of single case reports document a number of significant potential adverse effects .314-317 A number of other atypical antipsychotic medications exist, although no RCT s relating to their use in ASD have been found by the Guideline Development Team (Recommendation 4.4.4 ). Note that Recommendation 4.4.4 was revised following a comprehensive update of research on the use of the atypical antipsyc hotic aripiprazole for chil dren and young people with ASD as part of the living guideline process. This is summarised in Appendix 10.2, and is available as full text from the Ministry of Health website .13 It is now acknowledged that whil e risperidone should be the first medication used when indicated for significant irritability in children and young people with ASD, aripiprazole could be used as a second -line treatment where individuals have demonstrated poor efficacy to risperidone or wh ere there is concern regarding significant metabolic or adverse effects. Clinicians prescribing these drugs need to keep up to date with current literature (Recommendation 4.4. 4). Clinicians must be alert to the potential adverse effects of this group of medications. These include: significant weight gain sedation extra -pyramidal motor symptoms (eg, dyskinesias) which are dose -related hyperprolactinaemia. This can result in osteoporosis. It may also result in breast enlargement and occasionally secretion of milk in both males and females which can cause both alarm and embarrassment to the patient and carers. Monitoring prolactin levels has been suggested. Clinicians should also be aware of the interaction with SSRIs if prescribing these medications concurren tly. Haloperidol and other typical antipsychotics Haloperidol has previously been frequently prescribed for individuals with ASD. The efficacy of haloperidol in reducing motor stereotypies, temper tantrums and improving social relatedness is not in doubt .318 319 However, haloperidol and the other older antipsychotic agents have a high rate of side effects, especially dyskinesias (abnormal motor movements). Part 4: Treatment and management of ASD 150 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline In one large study more than 50% of individuals developed dyskinesias (32% acute; 5% after chronic treatment and 15% on discontinuation). The withdrawal type dyskinesias (a variant of tardive dyskinesia) were noted to gradually abate after some months .320 321 The use of new agents such as risperidone with better safety profiles should be considered first before using older agents. These older agents should be reserved for cases wh ere the beneficial effect of atypical antipsychotics is conspicuous but side effects such as weight gain are unacceptable. Haloperidol, in particular, has been shown to cause little weight gain. Thioridazine should only be used only in exceptional circumst ances, as recent reports have implicated thioridazine in cases of sudden death322 323 (Recommendation 4.4.5 ). Stimulants Two stimulant drugs are available for use in New Zealand: namely methylphenidate and dextroamphetamine. These are class A controlled drugs (see table 9.1, Appendix 9 ) and are used off -label unless treating ADHD diagnosed according to DSM IV criteria, and other named conditions as specified in The Pha rmaceutical Schedule. Three randomised controlled studies (including a total of 95 children) and two cohort studies (one publication, including a total of 226 children) examining the use of methylphenidate in children with ASD were identified .301 324-326 The trials reported a significant improvement in ADHD -like symptoms, but no improvement in core ASD symptoms. Significant adverse effects occurred in some children, especially social withdrawal and irritability (Recommendation 4.4.6 ). Melatonin Melatonin is a hormone produced in the human brain which regulates the sleep - wake cycle. Children with autism commonly have abnormal sleep patterns .327 One non -randomised study of 15 children with Asperger syndrome and severe sleep problems demonstrated improvements in the sleep patterns in all cases .328 A small controlled trial which was completed by only seven children showed improvement in sleep .329 A large study (the MENDS study) has recently commenced in the United Kingdom. Results are expected by 2010.330 Melatonin is currently not registered for use in New Zealand. A number of different preparations can be purchased at retail pharmacies on presentation of a prescription. Caution is needed as formulations may vary and the appropriate dose is not clear (Recommendation 4.4.7 ). Note that research on the use of the hormone melatonin for children and young people with ASD was comprehensively updated as part of the living guideline process, and is summarised in Appendix 10.2, and available as full text from the Ministry of Health website .13. This review concluded that melatonin can be recommended for use in children and young people with ASD who are experiencing signif icant sleep problems , although longer term treatment requires further investigation . Behavioural strategies including sleep hygiene should be used in conjunction with melatonin (Recommendations 4.4.7, 4.4.7a and study reported improvement in in male children with ASD331 (Recommendation 4.4.10 ). Part 4: Treatment and managemen t of ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 151 Sedatives Benzodiazepines are sometimes used in emergency situations to effe ct sedation and manage very disturbed behaviour. There are insufficient data to recommend this practice routinely. Benzodiazepines have the potential to cause excessive sedation and disinhibition .332 Some childr en and young people become agitated and aggression may increase after administration of benzodiazepines. Practitioners using these drugs should have appropriate training and experience (Recommendation 4.4.10 ). Antihistamines are commonly used as sedatives in children. Trimeprazine (Vallergan) and promethazine (Phenergan) are both in use in New Zealand. These medications belong to the phenothiazine group of drugs and are used as antipsychotics. There is no autism -specific evidence for their use. These drugs, especially trimeprazine, can cause agitation. These drugs are not recommended for routine use (Recommendation 4.4.10 ). Mood stabilisers Bipolar disorder occasionally occurs as a co-morbidity in children and adolescents with ASD. However, there are no cont rolled trials in the ASD population. No specific recommendation is made for pharmacotherapy of co -morbid bipolar disorder. This situation should be managed in consultation with an appropriately experienced psychiatrist (Recommendation 4.2.8 ). Antiepileptic medication Epilepsy is relatively common in children with ASD, especially those with classical Kanner type ASD. Discussion of epilepsy management is outside the scope of this guideline. Children with ASD who also have epilepsy should be managed in consult ation with an appropriately experienced clinician. Where children with co -morbid epilepsy also require pharmacological management of challenging behaviour, prescribers must consider both potential interactions between medications AND the potential for some psychotropic medications to lower seizure threshold (eg, A number of other pharmacological agents have been discussed in the international literature as potentially useful for modifying various symptoms in ASD. Some of these agents have been used widely in the past (notably, fenfluramine, naltrexone and secretin). For some of these, there is insufficient evidence for effectiveness, but so far there is also insufficient evidence to prove that they are ineffective. For others, there is evidence that they are ineffective, and in some instances potentially or actually harmful. They are discussed here, to provide assistance to clinicians and parents who may read about these agents and wish to have further information about them. A number of these agents are not currently available in New Zealand. Use of any of these agents to treat children with ASD in New Zealand would be off -label and would be rega rded as out of line with current standard practice in this country. None of these agents is recommended. Amantadine Amantadine (Symmetrel) is a non - competitive N -methyl -d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist licensed in New Zealand for use as an antiviral agent and as an antiparkinsonian agent. One randomised controlled study was Part 4: Treatment and management of ASD 152 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline identified .333 This study found statistically significant improvement on some subscales (notably hyperactivity) on investigator ratings , but no differences on parent ratings (Recommendation 4.2.11 ). Immunoglobulins One small double -blind placebo controlled study on the use of intravenous immunoglobulins was reported in a letter to a journal but is difficult to evaluate .334 The authors reported improvement on parent and teacher ratings but no difference on clinician ratings. They urged caution and recommended further research (Recommendation 4.2.11 ). Naltrexone Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist. It is used in New Zealand in the management of opioid and alcohol dependence. It has largely been used in rel ation to repetitive self-injury in children and adolescents with ASD. As with other agents, there are several case reports and open -label studies. Two double -blind placebo -controlled crossover studies, with very small numbers of children, were identified .335 336 Results were inconsistent with improvement in teacher ratings (but not in parent ratings) achieving statistical significance in one study and the opposite find ing in the other study ( Recommendation 4.2.11 ). Fenfluramine Fenfluramine (Ponderax) was previously available in New Zealand for use as an anorectic in obesity. It has been withdrawn because of concerns about safety. In the early 1980s there was substantia l interest in the use of fenfluramine in ASD. Fenfluramine significantly lowers blood serotonin levels, which are elevated in a proportion of individuals with ASD (and other developmental disorders). A non-systematic review concluded that, while there were many studies of this agent, there were some concerns about methodology, even in some trials described as double -blind and placebo -controlled .337 A double -blind placebo -controlled trial was also identified .338 While there are some data to suggest that fenfluramine enhances social relatedness and reduces stereotypies and overactivity, the results are not consistent. There have been significant concerns about potential n eurotoxicity on the basis of animal studies as well as reports of significant adverse effects in humans and depletion of brain serotonin with long -term use (Recommendation 4.2.12 ). Secretin There is no evidence to support the use of secretin (either human, synthetic or porcine) in children with ASD. There was an initial surge of enthusiasm over this medication in the 1990s, following a report that three children, who received secretin while undergoing gastroenterological investigations, had demonstrated improvement in their autistic symptomatology following infusion. Subsequent anecdotal reports and open - label studies appeared to confirm that secretin might be effective. There have now been several double -blind randomised controlled trials, all of which have demonstrated that secretin is ineffective339 340 (Recommendation 4.2.12 ). Chelation therapy There is no evidence that heavy metals are implicated in the causation of ASD. There are no randomised controlled trials of chelation therapy in children with ASD. Chelation therapy is potentially dangerous and, given the absence of evidence for benefit, should not be used341 (Recomm endation 4.2.12 ). Part 4: Treatment and managemen t of ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 153 4.5 Other interventions Summary of recommendations Recommendations: Grade 4.5.1 There is insufficient evidence to make any recommendation with respect to the use of the following biological agents, nutritional or other approaches for AS D-specific symptoms in children with ASD. The opinion of the Guideline Development Team is that these agents are unlikely to be useful: combined vitamin B6 -Mg dimethylglycine polyunsaturated fatty acids auditory integration training holding therapy options therapy sensory integration therapies Irlen lenses. I 4.5.2 The use of Facilitated Communication for ASD -specific symptoms in children with ASD is not recommended. B Over the past decades, a number of other approaches have been used as treatments and many have been claimed as 'cures ' for ASD. Some of these are currently popular in New Zealand and are being promulgated by a very small number of medical practitioners. Most of the research in this area is based on anecdotal reports rather than controlled studies. The lack of quality research evaluating these treatments means that firm conclusions cannot be drawn about their effectiveness. For a small number of treatments, there is evidence that they are in effective and, in some instances, potentially or actually harmful. Addressing all possible alternative treatments is beyond the scope of this guideline. The most common interventions are briefly discussed. The interventions include biomedical approaches an d other alternative non - medical treatments. Biomedical approaches Biomedical approaches seek to alter physiology or change the underlying processes that result in symptoms of autism. They include combined vitamin B6 -magnesium (Mg), dimethylglycine, gluten -casein free diet vitamin B6 -magnesium (B6 -Mg) A Cochrane systematic review (updated 2005) concluded that no recommendation could be made regarding the use of B6 -Mg as a treatment for ASD .342 Three small studies were included in the review (total n=33) but data were unsuitable for pooling (Recommendation 4.5.1 ). Part 4: Treatment and management of ASD 154 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Dimethylglycine (DMG) Dimethylglycine is closely related to the inhibitory neurotransmitter, glycine. It is readily available from health -food shops in New Zealand. Rimland (of the Autism Research Institute in San Diego) has advocated its use and there are a large number of anecdotal reports that DMG is useful. Only one small randomised controlle d trial was found .343 This did not demonstrate significant differences between the groups (Recommendation 4.5.1 ). Gluten -casein free diet In a Cochrane systematic review (updated 2004) of gluten and casein free diets in ASD, only one small trial (n=20) met the criteria for inclusion .344 Three of the four outcomes studied were not significant between groups but a benefit was found for one outcome, reduction in autistic traits, on parental report for participants randomised to the gluten -casein free diet compared to placebo. The reviewers concluded that these results added weight to the existing anecdotal evidence but that there was insufficient evidence for clinicians to advise the use of gluten -casein free diets for individuals with ASD and more adequately powered research was needed (Recommendation 4.5.1 ). Omega -3/long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids There is current interest in the role of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), especially omega -3 and omega -6 long - chain PUFA (LC -PUFA), in brain development and function. A Medline search in July 2005 did not yield any studies meeting our criteria for review. The use of these agents cannot currently be recommended (Recommen dation 4.5.1 ). Other biomedical treatments have been tried but there is either insufficient or no evidence to recommend them. These include electroconvulsive therapy and cranial osteopathy. None of these approaches can currently be recommended. Other alter native approaches Facilitated communication Facilitated Communication was developed by Rosemary Crossley in Melbourne. The technique involves supporting the hand, wrist or arm of the communicator, pulling back the hand and, where necessary, helping to isol ate the index finger while the person accesses a word, picture board or keyboard to communicate. Emotional support in the form of encouragement is also supplied by the facilitator. It is intended that the supports be faded over time. Some qualitative repor ts show people have become independent typists after training with Facilitated Communication. There has been considerable controversy about whether the facilitated output is from the person with ASD or is under the influence of the facilitator. A large num ber of quantitative studies show facilitator influence .104 There is no scientific validation of Facilitated Communication and it is not recommended (Recommendation 4.5.2 ). Auditory integration training (AIT) This is a procedure to retrain the auditory system in an attempt to address hearing abnormalities and to effect positive behaviour changes for people with ASD. Anecdotal reports of negative side effects, such as hearing loss, have raised a number of ethical q uestions regarding its use and it has been suggested that the nonstandardised and unregulated use of AIT may place individuals using this treatment at risk .345 A Cochrane systematic review of AIT studies with a number of Part 4: Treatment and managemen t of ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 155 methodological flaws concluded that there is no clear evidence for auditory integration therapy nor does the procedure provide beneficial changes to behaviours of people with ASD .346 The review conclud ed that further research is required to determine the effectiveness of sound therapies and that, in the absence of evidence, the treatment must be considered experimental and parents should be made aware of the cost of treatment. The American Academy of Pe diatrics also suggests that the use of AIT should be limited to research protocols .347 No recommendations can be made for this treatment (Recommendation 4.5.1 ). Holding therapy This intervention is based on the work of Tinbergen and Tinbergen348 who claim that autism is caused by an emotional imbalance which results from a lack of attachment between the mother and the child with ASD, causing the child to withdraw inwar ds. Holding therapy requires the mother to provide intense physical contact with her child, even to the point of eliciting distress until the child submits and accepts comfort. No adequate research on this intervention has been undertaken (Recommendation 4 .5.1). Sensory integration (SI) Sensory integration therapy is based on the sensory integration theory developed by Jean Ayres in 1970. SI helps to reorganise the vestibular, tactile and proprioceptive systems and is intended to remediate perceived sensory difficulties to allow the child to interact with the world in a more adaptive fashion. Sensory integration theory lacks empirical support. There are no experimentally sound studies supporting the use of sensory integration in the treatment of children wit h ASD349 (Recommendation 4.5.1 ). Irlen lenses This therapy is based on the notion that children with ASD may have overstimulated cells in their retinas or abnormalities in the optical neural pathways which resul t in incorrect signals being sent to the brain. The treatment involves the placing of coloured overlays or lenses over printed pages to allow the correct interpretation of visual stimuli. Some subjective reports have found benefits for students with ASD ,350 but there is no conclusive evidence of effectiveness (Recommendation 4.5.1 ). A number of other treatments have been tried. They have either not been assessed in controlled studies or studies have not found evi dence that they are effective. More research is required before conclusions can be reached about these treatments. These include: pet therapies (such as service dogs, horse riding) dolphin -assisted therapy the Dolman -Delacato method horticulture aromathera py.42 266 Part 4: Treatment and management of ASD 156 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 4.6 Supporting people with challenging behaviour Summary of recommendations Recommendations: Grade 4.6.1 When challenging behaviours are evident, people w ith ASD need to be assessed for co -morbid conditions such as seizures, A DHD, anxiety disorders, depression and gastrointestinal problems (see Appendix 10.4 ). C 4.6.2 In severe or life -threatening situations, medication may be the optimum therapy. C Good Practice Points: 4.6.3 There should be access to interagency, multidisciplinary teams for ongoing serious behaviour needs. 4.6.4 The following systems need to be in place for emergency situations and there must be a prompt response: specialist staff w ith skills and experience in ASD from all relevant professions available for consultancy a multiagency team which can work in education settings and coordinate with home and community based interventions facilities to withdraw a child from class when they are, or are likely to be overloaded 24-hour care placement for a small number of children and young people who cannot be accommodated within school and home. This should be regarded as a last resort and be for as short a period as possible. 4.6.5 Referr al to the High and Complex Needs Intersectoral Unit (children and young people), Adult Mental Health, and/or local Needs Assessment and Service Coordination agencies may be required when behaviour is challenging. Part 4: Treatment and managemen t of ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 157 Even with well constructed and imple mented behavioural interventions (as outlined above), a small number of children, young people and adults with ASD may develop very serious or dangerous behaviours .102 Extreme behaviours that put the person with ASD, others or property at serious risk will require assessment by specialist behaviour professionals and will usually require a multidisciplinary team from different agencies (Good Practice Point 4.6.3 ). Such a team will require good service coordination if it is to be effective .11 When challenging behaviours are evident, people with ASD may need to be assessed for co-morbid conditions such as seizures, ADHD, anxiety disorders, depression11 104 and gastrointestinal disorders (Recommendation 4.6.1 ). Although medications are not regarded as the treatment of choice for behaviour problems, this may need to be considered for severe or life -thre atening situations11 104 (Recommendation 4.6.2 ). Behavioural interventions may enhance the use of medication104 and expert opinion suggests that medicati on may enhance receptiveness to behavioural interventions. Schools, families and whnau, and services supporting people with extreme behaviour problems need rapid access to specialist assistance and support for staff, families and whnau (Good Practice Poi nt 3.2.5.5, section 3.2.e ). A timely response may prevent loss of current residential, educational and vocational placements .11 Systems which need to be in place to support a crisis response include: specialist staff with skills and experience in ASD from all relevant professions available for consultancy information for people with ASD, parents, family and whnau, and professionals about how to access consultancy and support from specialist staff a multiagency team which can work in all settings short break respite (with specific ASD knowledge) and other r espite in -home supports for families facilities to withdraw a person from a situation when they are, or are likely to be, overloaded 24-hour care placement for a small number of people11 (Good Practice Point 4.6 .4). For some children and young people who have exceptional needs across two or more sectors, a referral to the High and Complex Needs Intersectoral Unit may be appropriate (Good Practice Point 4.6.5 ). A successful referral would result in a suitable pers on being appointed to coordinate the team 's support plan. Extra funding is provided to resource the plan. Similarly, adults with ASD who exhibit challenging behaviour should be referred to Adult Community Health, and, if intellectually disabled, to local N eeds Assessment and Service Coordination agencies (Good Practice Point 4.6.5 ). Part 4: Treatment and management of ASD 158 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 4.7 Crisis management Summary of recommendations Good Practice Points: 4.7.1 Appropriate support should be promptly delivered at times of crisis. 4.7.2 Proactive crisis support planning should be routinely undertaken and reviewed on a regular basis. 4.7.3 The development of crisis services should be investigated. Crises come in many forms. Previously settled children, young people, and adults with ASD may move int o a situation of crisis for any number of reasons. Change is a known trigger for crisis, but the impact of changes that can be predicted (eg, transitions, staff redeployment, terminal illness of an important person), may be able to be well managed, with ad equate planning, support and service provision .351 Crises caused by sudden (such as a change in circumstances, for example, family illness, injury or death) and unpredicted (sometimes unknown) factors can have a devastating effect on the emotional, mental and behavioural wellbeing of a person with ASD ,26 and serious implications on their educational or work placements, living situations, independence, health and safety . Very little research or information was identified pertaining to crisis management for people with ASD, and this area of support requires further attention. However, prompt provision of appropriate support during times of crisis appears vital (Good Pract ice Point 4.7.1 ). Given the distinctive needs of people with ASD, no one system is likely to meet the needs of all people. Therefore, proactive crisis support planning should be routinely undertaken and reviewed on a regular basis (eg, annually) (Good Prac tice Point 4.7.2 ). Planning should consider any/all predicable changes or other stressors, and the potential impact of a sudden and unpredicted stressor. Attention to the following factors is recommended: how their experience of stress can be minimised the potential need for accurate information about the person to be conveyed to others (eg, relevant background, up -to-date medical records, communication systems, response to previous interventions, personal preferences, key professional personnel) in a timel y manner where the person is best supported (in which environment) who should support them how much support may be required how parents, families and whnau, schools and agencies will work together to minimise the impact of the crisis lead agencies and pro fessionals the role of medication funding arrangements (Good Practice Point 4.7.2 ). Because of concern about the experiences of people with ASD as mental health inpatients, alternatives to inpatient care have been recommended .47 Crisis services have been recommended that involve staff trained in ASD and that contain timely and Part 4: Treatment and managemen t of ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 159 flexible systems that are able to adapt to the needs of the person in crisis and minimise the need for in -patient care47 (Good Practice Point 4.7.3 ). Other additional characteristics of ideal crisis services include: systems that reduce external pressure, perhaps by reducing choices, providing structure and avoiding confrontation or arguing commun ity-based homes, if out -of- home placement is needed rather than in-patient facilities staff teams that visit people with ASD in their own homes, and are also accessible to families consistent approaches and clear communication within services, and between the service and other relevant agencies (ie, mental health specialists, police, probation, youth offending, lawyers) a training role with other relevant agencies to ensure that they are appropriately responsive to people with ASD47 (Good Practice Point 4.7.3 ). 4.8 Mental health, forensic and disability services Summary of recommendations Recommendations: Grade 4.8.1 Adults with ASD who are patients of adult mental health or forensic services should be supporte d to overcome fears and given information on their rights and advocacy services. C Good Practice Points: 4.8.2 People with ASD experiencing serious mental health disorders should be supported by mental health services appropriate to their age or situati on. 4.8.3 The development of ASD -specialist teams within mental health services should be investigated. 4.8.4 When hospitalisation in mental health services is needed on a recurring basis, whenever possible the same hospital unit and key personnel sh ould be used. 4.8.5 People with ASD (with or without an additional disability) should be referred to their local Needs Assessment and Service Coordination (NASC) agency. 4.8.6 Adults with ASD, intellectual disability and mental health problems should be referred to specialist Dual Diagnosis Services (intellectual disability and mental health) through their GP or local Adult Mental Health Service. 4.8.7 Adults with ASD and intellectual disability, and who are charged with or convicted of a crime, sh ould be referred to Forensic Intellectual Disability Services, either through Adult Mental Health Services or NASC agencies. Part 4: Treatment and management of ASD 160 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Mental health services All children and young people with ASD who are experiencing mental health problems should access clini cal services though local Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) (Good Practice Point 4.8.2 ). Although professionals working in these services certainly have professional learning and development needs (see Part 6, Professional learning and de velopment ), some of them will be experienced in working with children and young people with ASD. The development of ASD -specialist teams within CAMHS may be appropriate (Good Practice Point 4.8.3 ). Adults with ASD who are experiencing mental health problem s should access clinical services through General Practice or, where mental health problems are severe, through local Adult Mental Health Services (Good Practice Point 4.8.2 ). In circumstances when adults with ASD have been charged with or convicted of com mitting a crime whilst believed to be mentally unwell, they may receive services from Forensic Mental Health Services (Good Practice Point 4.8.2 ). However, ASD was traditionally seen as a childhood disorder, and interest in the spectrum by specialists in a dult and forensic mental health is a recent development. Consequently, some writers have identified significantly more training and professional learning and development needs for adult and forensic mental health professionals, including psychiatrists ,47 293 294 and across a variety of sectors (eg, in -patient units, community services and secure services). However, no research was identified that addressed this issue. The development of ASD specialist teams within Adult and Forensic Mental Health Services and CAMHS may be appropriate (Good Practice Point 4.8.3 ). Negative experiences of adults with ASD within adult mental health and forensic systems are described in clinical settings, reviews ,270 and reports by the people themselves .33 Reluctance to have contact with or be an in -patient of adult or forensic mental health services is common, as are fears o f being misunderstood, misdiagnosed, and inappropriately medicated or hospitalised .270 Once these fears are addressed and the professional learning and development needs met, adult mental health and forensic ser vices may well be appropriate sources of support for adults with ASD who experience mental health problems48 270 294 (Recommendation 4.8.1). Consistency of environment and staffing may minimise stress for people with ASD when hospitalisation in mental health services is needed on a recurring basis (Good Practice Point 4.8.4 ). Disability services People with ASD who have an additional disabi lity may be entitled to Disability Services, through the Ministry of Health. Access to such services is managed by local Needs Assessment and Service Coordination (NASC) agencies, contacts for which are available from the Ministry of Health. People with AS D who also have an intellectual disability may be able to access the full range of services for children, young people and adults with an intellectual disability. Access to intellectual disability services is also managed by NASC agencies (Good Practice Po int 4.8.5 ). People with ASD, intellectual disability, and mental health problems may access specialist Dual Diagnosis Services (intellectual disability and mental health) through their GP or local Adult Mental Health Service (Good Practice Point 4.8.6 ). People with ASD and intellectual disability, and who are charged with or convicted of a crime, may access Forensic Intellectual Disability Services, either through Adult Part 4: Treatment and managemen t of ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 161 Mental Health Services or NASC agencies (Good Practice Point 4.8.7 ) (also see section 5. 3.b: People with ASD suspected, accused, charged or convicted of crimes ). Whil e staff working within intellectual disability services also have ASD -related professional learning and development needs (see Part 6 : Professional learning and development ), a significant number of professional staff have relevant experience of ASD within the population of people with an intellectual disability. Part 4: Treatment and managemen t of ASD New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 163 Part 5 Living in the community \"I have not recovered from autism. I believe that no human being should be asham ed of who he or she is.\" Part 5: Living in the community 164 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Part 5 Living in the community This section of the ASD Guideline addresses the support needs of people with ASD in the community that fall beyond the scope of initial diagnosis and early childhood/school education services. These include transition into adulthood, further education and work (paid or unpaid), recreation and leisure, and contact with the police, courts and criminal justice systems. Part 5: Living in the community New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 165 5.1 After secondary school Summary of recommendations Recommendations: Grade 5.1.1 Research should be undertaken to identify appropriate methods of supporting people with ASD when they leave school. C 5.1.2 Careful and timely attention should be paid to planning for people with ASD leaving school and moving into further and post -compuls ory education, work (paid or unpaid) or vocational services. C 5.1.3 Further and post -compulsory education should be considered as an option for all people with ASD, regardless of their intellectual ability. C 5.1.4 Planning for transition into further a nd post -compulsory education should consider symptoms of ASD that may have an impact in these settings, and aspects of educational environments that may complicate transition and known support strategies. C 5.1.5 People with ASD should access appropriate student services. C 5.1.6 Providers of further and post -compulsory education should ensure that their members of staff are aware of the specific educational needs of people with ASD. C 5.1.7 Providers of further and post -compulsory education should recog nise that people with ASD may have special requirements when being formally assessed and take these into account in their policies and procedures. C 5.1.8 Work (paid and unpaid) should be considered as an option for all people with ASD, regardless of thei r intellectual ability. B 5.1.9 Any k nown support needs of people with ASD, including those relating to cognitive ability, should be taken into account when transitioning into any work environment (see Appendix 10.3 ). B 5.1.10 Supported employment servic es for people with ASD should be developed (see Appendix 10.3 ). C 5.1.11 Supported employment services should incorporate known features of best practice employment for people with an intellectual disability and ASD -specific strategies (see Appendix 10.3 ). B 5.1.12 Any characteristics of ASD that may have impact in the work setting (both as strengths and as needs) should be taken into account when planning transition into work, when making choices about work and career and in accessing ongoing in -work sup port (see Appendix 10.3 ). B 5.1.13 Supported employment services should work with employers, managers and colleagues to maximise success in work placements (see Appendix 10.3 ). B Part 5: Living in the community 166 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Recommendations: Grade 5.1.13a Supported employment services are recommended and should be availab le for all people with ASD (see Appendix 10.3 ). B 5.1.13b Supported employment services should make available, where required: Individualised job matching based on the person 's career goals, strengths, and interests Pre-placement assessment of work tasks and work environment Promoting understanding of any support needs within the work environment, including training employers and colleagues in the goals, processes and benefits of supported employment services. On-the-job provisions, including training of w ork tasks, acclimatisation to the work environment, social integration, developing communication and interpersonal skills, and management of stress and any contextually inappropriate behaviour Job coaches with level of support is determined by need Work pl ace modifications Long -term support in developing natural supports (eg, upskilling managers) and, where needed, external supports (eg, follow -up, assisting with issues which impact on work) (see Appendix 10.3 ). B 5.1.14 Vocational services of a high stand ard should be available for people with ASD who are not ready or able to access education or work. B Good Practice Points: 5.1.13c Methodologically rigorous research is greatly needed to examine and improve the effectiveness of New Zealand -based suppor ted employment services for people with ASD (see Appendix 10.3 ). 5.1.13d New Zealand based research should consider the effectiveness of supported employment services for people of different ethnicities with ASD (see Appendix 10.3 ). 5.1.15 Self-emplo yment may be an appropriate o ption for some people with ASD. 5.1.16 More research is required on self -employment options for people with ASD. Part 5: Living in the community New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 167 5.1.a Leaving school Given that restricted, stereotyped and repetitive repertoires of interests and activit ies are key features of people with ASD, it is unsurprising that many experience significant stress when their routines are changed and their normal support systems are disrupted .352 Leaving school alters the en vironments in which people spend their time, what they do and when they do it. It also changes the people with whom they share their day or interact. Accordingly, leaving school can be a highly anxious time, not just for the person with ASD, but also for h is/her parents and family. The situation is further complicated by the cessation of relationships/contact with people who have provided formal support within the high school system (often for long periods of time), and the prospect of unemployment, under - employment and lack of meaningful daytime activity. Whilst little research covering this transition was identified (Recommendation 5.1.1 ), expert opinion suggested that successful transition requires considerable care and time352-355 (Recommendation 5.1.2 ). Careful transition planning has been recommended to minimise the anxiety that people with ASD and their families experience when time comes to leave school353 354 356 (Recommendation 5.1.2 ). Attention to the attachments that the individual with ASD has with their school (environments and people) is important so that the timing, sequencing and synch ronisation of leaving school (and of other transitions) can be carefully planned .352 Suggestions to increase the chance of successful transition into further education or work (paid and unpaid) include: taking a person -centred planning approach to transition facilitating self -determination, to ensure that the wishes of the person with ASD are fully taken into account careful selection of course of study or type of work careful selection of place of study (type of further education provider, geographical location, level of support offered to students) or employer coordination between the education sector and funders of adult services precise timing of funding, because the person may need to transition gradually, and possibly attend both the high school and the further education organisation, or work, on a part -time basis flexibility of commencement of further education or work, so that the person can become familiar with the environment and new demands, whilst not b eing overloaded anticipation of problems and creative problem solving (eg, of how to manage timetables, spare time, the social demands of further education or the workplace) .47 352-354 357 358 5.1.b Further (post -compulsory) education Further education should be an option for all people, regardless of ability or disability (Recommend ation 5.1.3 ). In fact, improved post -compulsory education options for all disabled people is a significant action listed in the New Zealand Disability Strategy .359 Nevertheless, people who are different sometime s experience barriers when trying to access further, post -compulsory education ,358 and, in the past, the educational options and outcomes for people with ASD were poor .270 356 360 Over recent years, as ASD has become more readily diagnosed and better managed and supported within schools, educational outcomes have improved .360 Improvement Part 5: Living in the community 168 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline may also be related to legislative changes in many parts of the world that recognise and support the rights of people with a disability to self -empowerment and participation in all aspects of society .270 356 359 People with ASD do have the potential to have successful and satisfying experiences in further education, regard less of their intellectual level .356 The chances of this are enhanced with careful planning and attention to ASD -specific issues (Recommendation 5.1.2 ). Symptoms of ASD that may have significant impact in furthe r and post -compulsory educational settings and should be considered in the planning process include: problems making friends and maintaining friendships, causing possible social isolation and difficulty working in a group lack of initiative, and lack of or failure to use self -help and independence skills low self -esteem and poor self - confidence peculiar use of language (eg, unduly dull speech, monotonous voice, over - precise grammar and vocabulary, using complex words without fully understanding their meanin g) literal understanding of language intense interest in select topics, and resistance to changing an area of study unawareness of the needs and emotions of other students or education staff or both insistence on routine and sameness, and intense overreact ion to change poor non -verbal communication (eg, limited facial expression, inappropriate eye contact, lack of understanding of sarcasm or irony) clumsiness, poor coordination and gross motor skills, ungainly movement, difficulty mastering practical skills unrecognised onset of co -morbid mental health problems47 361 (Recommendation 5.1.4 ). Aspects of post -compulsory and tertiary education environments can complicate transition into these settings, especially for people with ASD .48 356 362 Further education settings can be large, crowded and noisy. Withi n them, people often move from one room to another. Verbal communication is a predominant means of teaching, and sessions can vary in form, from traditional lectures by teaching staff, to student -led seminars, laboratory and fieldwork and informal experien tial or tutorial groups (Recommendation 5.1.4 ). Changes within the services provided by some of the post - compulsory and/or tertiary educational organisations across New Zealand reflect their shared responsibility to people with ASD to maximise the chances of successful educational experiences. New Zealand universities and polytechnics have student service departments through which students can access a wide range of support, ranging from study skills and counselling to note -taking and examination assistance (Recommendation 5.1.5 ). Information is available through the organisations ' websites and some include specific ASD policies363 and ASD support groups .364 There are a number of strategies that could be considered when any person with ASD is transitioning into further and post - compulsory education and, periodically, for ongoing support. Some of them can be accessed through student service departments, but when these ser vices are deficient, appropriate support may need to be organised from another source. Support strategies include: Part 5: Living in the community New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 169 vocational counselling and course selection buddies/guides for first -year students to help them settle in study skills support and developmen t (eg, planning and sticking to a study and assignment schedule) practical resources (eg, rest and study rooms, computer access) mentoring counselling (eg, dealing with the social demands of tertiary life, learning skills of self -organisation and problem solving, managing anxiety, controlling obsessive interests) one-to-one tutors or assistants reformatting course materials audiotaping lectures or arranging for a note -taker alteration of personal routines to suit study and attendance requirements informing staff of ASD diagnosis, and obtaining appropriate assistance examination support47 361-369 (Recommendation 5.1.4 ). One Un ited Kingdom guideline for people with Asperger syndrome47 provides specific advice to tutors and lecturers and recommends: establishing clear learning outcomes at the beginning of the course establishing class rules and making behavioural expectations explicit at the beginning of the course reminding students of class rules and behavioural expectations when necessary using a clear and standardised framework for each teaching session beginning sessions by introdu cing the specific learning outcomes for that session using an authoritative (not authoritarian) style and consistency patience, respect, fair play, support and encouragement assisting a student to stay on task by reminding them that the task at hand is an important step in developing their knowledge organising short breaks in long sessions, and on occasions when the student has difficulty discussing challenges with the student counsellor and/or line manager progressing review of learning outcomes towards th e end of the course, so that transition can be planned (Recommendation 5.1.6 ). Expert opinion suggests that people with ASD can experience great stress at examination time, which interferes with their ability to demonstrate clearly the knowledge and skills they have acquired .368 It is possible to alter examination arrangements to minimise stress and maximise opportunities for performance, yet maintain the integrity of the examination. Useful examination considera tions and adaptations for written examinations include: informing the student of the date, time and duration of the exam well in advance if possible, telling them the location and which staff will be adjudicating giving an estimation of how many other peop le will be sitting the exam drawing a plan of how the chairs and desks will be arranged (and seating plan, if possible) if this is a source of anxiety for the student Part 5: Living in the community 170 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline being specific about the topics and modules being tested giving the student the opportuni ty to arrive at the exam early, so they can become comfortable with the environment recognising that the student may need the adjudicator to instruct him/her personally considering allowing the student to take the examination in a separate room (with super vision), away from the distraction that test taking with others provides and to ensure that others are not distracted by the student with ASD permitting the student to have an object of comfort in the examination room granting extra time in advance of the examination day, as many people with ASD find it extremely hard to work within a time limit, or experience such stress at having a time limit that they cannot perform at their optimum level ensuring the student knows they are free to leave the room when th ey have finished their examination paper presenting examination papers in a manner that is not distracting (eg, certain colours can be very distracting for some people, who may work better when examination papers are plain or uncoloured) ensuring that inst ructions and questions are clear and unambiguous, and avoid abstract ideas, except when understanding such ideas is part of the assessment prompting obsessional students when it is time to move on to the next question, to avoid unnecessary and obsessional rewriting of answers allowing use of a word processor if handwriting is extremely slow arranging for scrutinisation of answer papers by an educational professional with expertise in ASD if there are concerns that the student 's performance may not reflect t heir ability (the scrutineer could comment on the general appearance of the paper, including diagrams and labelling, language used, obsessional content of the answers and possible use of inappropriate language)47 368 (Recommendation 5.1.7 ). Oral examinations can be particularly difficult for the person with ASD, and for examiners if they are unaware that the student has ASD .368 The National Autistic Society47 368 suggests that oral assessment over a period of days rather than hours should be considered, and that examiners should be brief ed that the candidate may display some of the following behaviours: poor understanding of body language standing/sitting too close - invasion of 'personal space ' inappropriate or poor eye contact (ie, avoiding or over -intense) unusual physical movements or walking around making inappropriate remarks, that are either over -familiar or too formal repeating questions, including copying the voice and accent hesitant or disjointed speech, unless the topic is of obsessional interest to the student failure to under stand abstract ideas literal understanding of jokes, exaggerations and metaphors poor understanding of questions about relationships and social situations (Recommendation 5.1.7 ). Part 5: Living in the community New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 171 5.1.c Work (paid and unpaid) Work is one of the primary activities of adults in our society, and with work comes status, success and other related benefits. Adults with ASD often experience difficulty securing and maintaining work. Long periods of unemployment are common, as is 'under -employment ', or working below one's skills leve l.33 34 270 355 370 371 A systematic review of outcomes in adult life of more able people with ASD concluded that few specialist support systems existed for adults with ASD, and that most individuals relied heavily on the support of their fam ilies in finding jobs .360 Anecdotal evidence suggests that this conclusion is applicable to New Zealand. Furthermore, research into, and systematic reviews of, the employment options and experiences of people wi th an intellectual disability (many of whom may also have ASD) found similarly disappointing results and unsatisfactory experiences .358 To become a worker is a normal life goal. For a person with ASD, whatever t heir ability level, becoming a worker is more likely to be achieved with careful attention to preparation and planning270 354 355 357 360 370-375 (Recommendations 5.1.2 and 5.1.8 ). The support need s of people with disabilities, including ASD, fall into six broad areas: assistance in finding a job (recruitment), learning how to do the job, obtaining assistance with completing the job, addressing work -related issues, addressing non-work -related issues and transportation376 (Recommendation 5.1.9 ). People with an intellectual disability who receive relevant work experience as part of their school -based transition planning are more likely to maintain competitiv e jobs .358 However research suggests that the responsibility for 'making it work ' in an employment setting tends to rest on the person with ASD, rather than the employer .377 While advice especially designed for use by people with ASD exists ,355 strategies are typically targeted towards supported employment services for people with ASD .357 370-372 376 378 Positive work outcomes (eg, increased chances of finding work, maintaining work and having good working relationships) for people with ASD (including those with co-morbid intellectual disability) are more likely when supported employment services are involved357 358 373-376 379 (Recommendation 5.1.10 ). Involvement of supported employment services has also been associa ted with improved attitudes of employers towards people with ASD, in that they are more likely to rate the employee 's effectiveness at their job, rather than their ability to work in an established way and to adapt to the organisation, and more likely to be willing to be supportive and adapt circumstances to suit the person concerned .377 Features of best practice identified in a review of intellectual disability and ASD supported employment literature357 include: individuals controlling their own vocational destinies through self -determination, facilitated by person -centred planning, and a career -based approach employment coaches acting as facilitators, not experts taking account of employers ' as well as individuals ' needs using 'natural supports ' and supplementing jobs in ways that are 'typical ' for each setting using intentional strategies to enhance social integration supporting self -employment post or follow -up suppo rt ensuring that people with severe disabilities can access supported employment quality outcomes result when services adopt a principles - and values -led approach to supported employment357 (Recommendation 5.1.1 1). Part 5: Living in the community 172 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Additional strategies recommended for use by supported employment services are: careful vocational assessment and job matching use of case management and job coaching clear explanation of duties, responsibilities, expectations and rules ahead of time undertaking task analysis (breaking complex tasks down into small logical components) to develop written and/or pictorial prompts and instructions arranging for or providing intensive one-to-one instruction and repetition of new job tasks supporting the per son with ASD when deciding whether to disclose their diagnosis in the workplace helping employers consider the advantages of having an employee with ASD (eg, punctual, pays attention to detail, gains satisfaction from repetitive work; loyalty, stability) educating employers and co -workers about ASD supporting the person with ASD at times of employment stress (eg, organisational change, performance reviews) support in managing behavioural or emotional problems that could hamper work performance or relationsh ips with management or co -workers recognising the risk to the person with ASD of discrimination, workplace intimidation and bullying, and taking appropriate steps to prevent and minimise this ensuring that the person with ASD knows their employment rights, is a competent self -advocate and/or has access to advocacy services47 270 370-372 (Recommendation 5.1.11, Recommendation 5.1.13a ). Even people with severe autism or co-morbid intellectual disability can become engaged in meaningful work .354 372 373 380 Specialist schemes for assisting less able people with ASD to get into work have recorded success .373 375 376 For many people with an intellectual disability, real work in real employment settings is preferable by far to vocational and day services358 (Recommendation 5.1.8 ). Features of ASD may both help and hinder finding work and obtaining employment success. For example, attention to detail may be valued highly, but may seriously hinder speed of output. ASD characteristics relev ant to employment include: punctuality conscientiousness loyalty attention to detail perfectionism independence enjoyment of routine or repetitive tasks careful attention to the order and appearance of the personal work area strong preference for structure d time, and discomfort with lack of structure unique work routines preference for no distractions or interruptions stress reactions to multitasking, change of priorities, conflict of priorities and deadlines difficulties with teamwork and components of wor k involving social skills anxiety about performance reluctance to ask for help or support, or accept positions of authority and supervision low awareness of danger to self or others difficulty with starting projects, time management issues Part 5: Living in the community New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 173 strong reactions to changes in persons, environment or work conditions motivational issues regarding tasks of no personal interest difficulty with writing and making reports270 355 (Recommendation 5.1.12 ). A strong finding in a survey of workplace supervisors of people with ASD successful in employment was that the supervisors believed that assistance from supported employment services had been crucial .381 The key supervision strategies identified by those supervisors were: job modification - maintain a consistent schedule and job duties - keep the social demands of the job manageable and practicable - provide organisers to help structure and keep track of work - add activities to reduce or eliminate unstructured time supervision - be direct and specific when giving directions - verify that communications are correctly understood - assist the employee in learning social rules and interpreting social cues e ncountered on the job - explain and help the employees deal with changes on the job co-worker relationships and social interactions - encourage co -workers to initiate interactions - ensure that one or two co -workers play a role in helping to give job - related sug gestions and 'keep an eye out' for the employee support services - provide a sense of familiarity and reassurance until the employee and company staff get to know one another - transfer relationships and supports to company employees - check in and remain on -call in case problems arise - maintain a liaison role for non -work issues that affect the job (Recommendation 5.1.13 ). Research on supported employment was updated as part of the living guideline process, and is summarised in Appendix 10.3, and available as ful l text from the Ministry of Health website .14 No literature was accessed on self - employment options for people with ASD. Self-employment may be an appropriate option for some people with ASD (Good Practice Point 5.1.15 ) and more research on this is required (Good Practice Point 5.1.16 ). Vocational services All people with ASD should have the opportunity to participate in further or post -compulsory education and work (paid or unpaid). However formal education or work may not be the goal of every person with ASD, especially people with significant co-morbid conditions. For those people, access to meaningful daytime activities may be very important (Recommendation 5.1.14 ). In addition to recreation and leisure option s (see next section ), some people may want vocational services, or they may be obliged to use such services, because of a lack of educational and work options in their areas. Opinions on vocational services are varied, but many people with an intellectual disability report such services to be unfulfilling.358 Vocational services for people with ASD must be of high standard. For further information on this area, the reader is referred to relevant sections of curre nt New Zealand policy on people with disabilities.167 358 359 379 Part 5: Living in the community 174 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 5.2 Recreation and leisure Summary of rec ommendations Recommendations: Grade 5.2.1 All children and adults with ASD should have access to leisure facilities and meaningful activity tailored to their needs and interests and designed to promote social inclusion. B 5.2.2 Family members and whnau should be supported to maintain social relationships. C 5.2.3 Leisure and recreation planning should be included in a student 's/young person 's transition programme and this information shared with post - school providers. Person -centred planning should: focus on individual choice and preference, including strengths, capacities, interests and experiences include recognition that people with ASD have a right to privacy and a right to be autistic. C B C 5.2.4 Individual leisure plans need to be regularly e valuated in all services by staff clearly identified to have the responsibility and who should have received specialist education for the role. C 5.2.5 All children with ASD should have access to good -quality play opportunities, including one -to-one suppo rt and adapted toys and equipment. C 5.2.6 Where a child or young person is provided with a respite service or is outside the normal home environment, the environment needs to be structured and predictable, and it needs to support the function of the child in communication, personal independence and safe leisure skills. B 5.2.7 Ongoing one -to-one support should be provided to those who need it to enhance their ability to pursue leisure pursuits. C 5.2.8 Services should provide ongoing support where requi red to help someone with ASD build up and maintain social contacts, using strategies to promote social inclusion (section 3.2.b). C Part 5: Living in the community New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 175 Recreation is a powerful tool for promoting independent functioning, community inclusion, education, employment, profic iency of life skills and improved overall quality of life. Meaningful routines, use of resources, recreation initiation and planning for structure and organisation are important processes for supporting a person with ASD to participate and enjoy a balance of leisure, work, self -care and other commitments382 (Recommendation 5.2.1 ). The Department of Recreation and Leisure, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and the Department of Psychiatry from Division TE ACCH (two nationally recognised programmes in the United States) collaborated on Project Autism, to conduct a three -year project which identified the support required to address recreation and leisure needs of people with ASD .382 The project found that participating in recreation can help people with ASD to: expand their interests develop/improve their communication skills explore or expand their knowledge improve their cognitive functioning be with, interact wit h, and build friendships with others make leisure choices help others, and be able to contribute to home and community, including volunteering and opportunities to provide for others enhance self -control follow rules, directions and procedures gain others ' respect enjoy completing and mastering things improve their physical functioning keep in shape physically relax physically and emotionally learn and improve coping skills heighten self -awareness and self - esteem promote community integration increase their life and leisure satisfaction. Project Autism also identified a number of sources of information as useful for completing an assessment to identify the support that people with ASD will need to make leisure and recreation choices. These sources included: verbal self -reporting information gathered from a variety of sources, including everyone who interacts with the person observation. Project Autism produced a manual, which included a section describing the steps and processes to help an individual with ASD become involved in a recreation activity of choice. These steps included: personal strengths goals and wishes approaches to learning - where a child or young person has communication difficulties, using concrete items such as pictures or photos, choice bo ards, social stories and observation of the individual can identify leisure interests and provide a means of evaluating satisfaction leisure interests and satisfaction to support future planning - use of vocabulary with which the individual is familiar; ev aluation of the level of satisfaction of the individual meaningful routines including a balance of leisure, work, self -care and other commitments use of resources found in the home and wider community identifying who is responsible for recreation initiatio n and planning. Part 5: Living in the community 176 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 5.2.a Barriers to participation in leisure and recreation pursuits People with disabilities who do not take part in sport and leisure activities may become isolated, lonely and miss out on activities which are fun and which provide opportun ities to make friends and learn new skills .383 Findings from three separate studies have identified a number of common barriers preventing participation in family and community activities, and these studies have informed both the New Zealand and United Kingdom governments ' strategies for promoting social inclusion for people with an intellectual disability .383-385 The studies reported that key barriers preventing participation include: negative attitudes and a disabling environment poverty, reliance on benefits or low income versus the cost of some leisure pursuits the need for support to prepare for activities and to participate in activiti es outside the home lack of energy, exacerbated by the emotional and cognitive energy expended on preparation, transport and disability -specific issues the extra time used for ordinary living due to the effects of the disability difficulties of communicati ng and expressing choices community groups involving people with disabilities may be more likely to include people with physical or sensory disabilities than those who have intellectual disability community attitudes that can make people 's experiences in t he community frightening and unpleasant. Tony Attwood, an internationally recognised expert in ASD, described at the Autism New Zealand Conference 2004 how having an ASD can affect an individual 's ability to participate in their community .386 In his presentation, he explained how the special interests of people with ASD can dominate a person 's time to a point where the interest can: become obsessive -compulsive become obtrusive for the family cost money, with cons equences for financial planning disproportionate to income and sometimes lead to criminal behaviour in order to access a special interest. However, special interests also provided positive functions for the person with ASD and can: provide enjoyment reduce anxiety motivate and support learning become a source of income and employment be a means of making friends. 5.2.b Strategies to promote community participation A study that investigated peer relationships and participation in social and recreational activities of 235 adolescents and adults with ASD who lived at home found that, consistent with previous research, prevalence of friendships, peer relationships and participation in social and recreational activities were low .387 Greater participation was predicted by: greater functional independence less impaired social interaction skills higher internalising behaviours Part 5: Living in the community New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 177 environmental support from maternal participation in social and recreational activities greater n umber of services received inclusion in integrated settings and community based services. A study of a social contact group set up for four men with learning difficulties388 reported that, for people with severe learning disabilities, the most important factor in developing friendships was the physical opportunity they had to meet others in a supportive environment. It was not how socially adept they were, nor was it the severity of their learning disability. Access to leisure facilities and meaningful activity tailored to needs and interests should be designed to promote social inclusion and, where app ropriate, should involve family, whnau and friends. Supporting the family to maintain social relationships may be beneficial for the individual with ASD387 Recommendation 5.2.2 ). The family 's goals and interests related to leisure time will also need to be considered, including shared activities, independent activities and timing of activities. Personal and community safety issues need to be addressed to ensure community participation is enjoyable. Skills can be taught or enhanced through recre ation opportunities (eg, appropriate touching, crossing the street, using money and waiting in line). Control and choice are at the core of self -determination and should be the principles on which any recreation or leisure involvement is based. A person 's strengths should therefore be taken into account to ensure that he or she has a sense of control and choice .389 Two independent reviews of literature and health and disability services for people with intellectu al disability in New Zealand have identified a number of strategies to promote community participation .167 384 These include: person -centred planning with a focus on individual abilities, including strengths, capacities, interests and experiences, and respecting the choices and preferences of the person concerned (Recommendation 5.2.3 ) working with local neighbourhoods and communities to promote participation in and pl anning for integrated activities working to change communities to ensure they become less prejudiced and more inclusive of people with ASD identifying and using natural (unpaid) supports providing formal support using visual supports (eg, social calendars to promote choice and preferences) developing individual leisure plans that are regularly evaluated (Recommendation 5.2.4 ) identifying services and staff with responsibility for leisure plans, and ensuring they have appropriate education and resources (Recommendation 5.2.4 ) ensuring that policy and service design address barriers to leisure. In New Zealand, the Halberg Trust links people with disability to sport and active leisure, as do disability not -for-profit community groups. Information about recreati onal programmes in the community can be accessed through the Needs Assessment and Service Coordination (NASC) agency, the Citizens Advice Bureau, Autism New Zealand and Disability Information Advisory Services. Part 5: Living in the community 178 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 5.2.c Children with ASD Difficulty in underst anding and following social situations and cues can cause problems during interactions for people with ASD. Problems with self -initiation, motor planning and sequencing, plus a restricted repertoire of interests and play activities, mean that many children with ASD have difficulty developing play skills that enable them to occupy themselves productively. Play can be one of the most difficult times for children with ASD: it is less structured and harder to understand because of the many social aspects to fol low and involves initiation and follow - through .382 Many children with ASD need to be taught play skills that can provide the basis for more complex social play later on. All children with ASD should have access to good -quality play opportunities, including one-to-one support and adapted toys and equipment (Recommendation 5.2.5 ). Consideration of the environment and the context in which new skills are to be taught is important, because some children with ASD exper ience difficulty transferring skills to different settings. For example, planning and communication between families and carers is important, where children and young people are provided with a respite service. Any environment needs to be structured, predi ctable and support the function of the child in communication, personal independence and safe leisure skills382 (Recommendation 5.2.6 ). A child with ASD is likely to need help to explore recreation options. Chil dren with ASD often display initial resistance to try a new experience, which could be driven by dislike of new or novel situations, or resistance to change. All children develop new interests and have preferences, and children with ASD can have strong and unusual interests. Determining whether these interests are appropriate needs careful consideration. The challenge is to explore all opportunities while maintaining structure, keeping the child safe and in good health, and maintaining the right balance of activities .31 Jen Birch, a New Zealander who provides personal insight into her life as an adult diagnosed with ASD, suggests careful monitoring of the amount of recreational activity in which an individual part icipates and providing an adequate balance in learning, recreation and special interests .172 5.2.d Young people with ASD Young people with ASD often have particular difficulties with social interaction and recip rocity. The severity of social impairment and practical language problems varies greatly within the ASD population, with observable behaviours including high levels of anxiety, obsessional disorders, depression, suicidal ideation, rage and defiance .297 390 391 Adolescence marks the transition from childhood to adulthood, with the accompanying pressure to conform. Typical characteristics noted in adolescents with ASD are: poor communication skills excellent vocabulary intense interests and pursuits (usually isolative) that can seem obsessive a tendency to prefer predictable events, resulting in problems of social flexibility problems in self -organisation and productivity, especially around school work a preference and overt wish to engage in self -interest activities. There is general consensus from experts in ASD internationally about the support strategies and services that ca n assist young people with ASD .47 297 390 392 Part 5: Living in the community New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 179 Young people with ASD can be s upported through: social therapy and social skills groups one-to-one support for acquiring social skills, time to achieve these skills and a safe place for practice being taught friendship skills adults acting as guides and coaches, facilitating relationsh ips and providing opportunities to interact with peers life-skills training opportunities for supervised high - interest activities often enjoyed by people with ASD (chess clubs, computer clubs, animal husbandry, writing classes, music appreciation, etc) alternatives to unstructured social situations availability of safe adults who can be accessed in times of crisis specialised staff if required by an individual, ongoing support to help build and maintain social contacts. Individual support is sometimes neede d to link the person into existing community activities, interests, clubs and leisure facilities and also to help them identify social networks (Recommendation 5.2.7 ). Some New Zealand schools have included leisure and recreation planning in a student 's transition programme. It is important that information in a student 's transition plan is shared with post -school providers47 (Recommendation 5.2 3 ). 5.2.e Adults with ASD Leisure activities can be an important source of empowerment, self -expression and community participation for adults. For full community participation, social relationships and networks are of critical importance384 (Recommendation 5.2 .8). People with A SD can have strong and sometimes unusual interests and incorporating these into a leisure plan is an important issue to address. Interests can be expanded to include those that are more socially acceptable and this can offer additional opportunities for sk ill development and social interaction. A survey has identified the following functions of special interests in the lives of people with Asperger syndrome :386 genuine enjoyment security comfort and relaxation facilitation or avoidance of social interaction and a means of reducing anxiety. New experiences and new activities can feel very threatening for people with ASD, and adequate and sensitive support is required when beginning new, unfamiliar activities .172 Support is needed to help a person with ASD choose one or more sporting and recreational activities and learn the skills necessary to participate .382 An increasing emph asis is being placed on sport as a recreation choice .190 While there are people with ASD who enjoy team sports, personal accounts and observations from individuals with ASD and from parents note that these activ ities require many social skills, and that team activities need to be chosen carefully .172 393 For adults, including people with disabilities, work is viewed as the p ath to social and economic integration. As participation in paid employment becomes more common for all New Zealanders, increasing concern about how to achieve a work -life balance has been raised, including the role of the New Zealand Government and genera l public and communities in helping people overcome the barriers that prevent a balanced lifestyle .394 Part 5: Living in the community 180 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline The New Zealand Department of Labour completed a project in 2004 to develop policies and practices to promo te better balance between paid work and life outside work. Research of articles and projects, and consultation which included 700 responses from individuals and organisations, identified mobility issues as obstacles for some people with disabilities and a range of problems for parents of children with disabilities .394 Barriers to a balanced lifestyle for adults with ASD are exacerbated by higher rates of unemployment than among other citizens and barriers present ed by a person 's ASD and special interests, which are often solitary .384 395 An ASD viewpoint should be considered when discussing lifestyle balance. Individuals and parents of children with ASD emphasised in personal correspondence and in literature that, while following personal interests does not necessarily have to isolate a person, people with ASD do have a right to privacy and a right to be autistic172 396 (Recommendation 5.2.3 ). 5.3 Contact with the justice system Summary of recommendations Recommendations: Grade 5.3.1 The victimisation of people with ASD should be further researched. C 5.3.2 People having regular contact with children and young people with ASD should be screened for safety, and paid staff should be appropriately trained, supported and supervised. C 5.3.3 People with ASD should be taught social skills, an d be educated in community safety, strategies to keep safe when out at night, and what to do if they are abused. C 5.3.4 If people with ASD are abused, they should receive services from Child, Youth and Family (CYF) , Victim Support, A ccident Compensation Commission (ACC Sensitive Claims Unit) and other similar agencies. C 5.3.5 Research is needed on the effect of abuse on people with ASD and how to reduce these effects. C 5.3.6 Application for the appointment of a welfare guardian or property manager sho uld be made to the Family Court in cases where there are serious concerns about the ability of a person with ASD to manage his or her financial/personal affairs and guard himself/herself against harm. C 5.3.7 Further research is needed into the support ne eds of people with ASD who are complainants and witnesses in criminal cases, their reliability as witnesses, and the suitability of current provisions for vulnerable witnesses. C 5.3.8 The prevalence of people with ASD in prison and secure settings needs further investigation. C Part 5: Living in the community New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 181 Recommendations: Grade 5.3.9 Research is needed into how to minimise the stress experienced by people with ASD when they come into contact with the police and criminal justice system. C 5.3.10 Families and whnau, and carers of people with ASD should d evelop good relationships with their neighbours and (where appropriate) provide them with information on ASD, to ensure that neighbours understand them and deal with concerns informally wherever possible. C 5.3.11 Families and whnau, carers and professio nals should ensure that measures are undertaken during the childhood of the person with ASD to prevent the characteristics of ASD developing into behaviour that leads to victimisation or criminal offending. C 5.3.12 Young people and adults with ASD shoul d be taught their legal rights, and be prepared in advance with information should they ever have contact with the police and legal authorities . Appropriate resources and training should be developed to assist with this. C 5.3.13 Families and whnau, and carers should be trained on how to support people with ASD who come into contact with the police. C 5.3.14 When it is known or suspected that an adult with ASD who is charged with a criminal offence may have an intellectual disability, the suitability of the Intellectual Disability (Compulsory Care and Rehabilitation) Act 2003 is determined. C 5.3.15 People with ASD involved in disputes within the Family Court are advised to seek assistance from solicitors and advocacy services with knowledge and experie nce in ASD. C Good Practice Point: 5.3.16 People with ASD who are victims of crimes should access support from Child, Youth and Family (CYF) , Victim Support, A cident Compensation Commission (ACC Sensitive Claims) and other similar agencies . Part 5: Living in the community 182 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 5.3.a People with ASD as victims of crimes Although it is generally accepted that people with ASD and other disabilities have a higher likelihood of contact with the police, courts and criminal justice system than other people ,397 398 little research on this could be found. Certainly people with disabilities have an increased risk of being victims of crimes .398 It is believed tha t people with ASD probably share certain vulnerabilities with other people with disabilities, which increase the likelihood that they will be victims of crimes (Recommendation 5.3.1 ). For people with intellectual disabilities, some of these vulnerability factors are: misinterpretation of social cues difficulties recognising danger poor self -protection skills no or poor 'keeping safe ' education acquiescing to behaviour they do not like in order to have a social contact dependency on others limited access to resources .398 Vulnerability to being a victim of crime may also be related to offender characteristics (eg, personality, occupation), characteristics of the interactions between offender and victim (eg, legitim ate authority and power), social control, the environment in which the offence occurs and the culture of society (eg, attitudes towards people who are different) .398 The first step in prevention is good -quality care, especially when people with ASD are young or also have an intellectual disability. Parents, families, whnau, teaching authorities and service managers/coordinators should try to ensure that anyone in regular contact with the person with ASD is consi dered to be safe (ie, no relevant criminal convictions, not violent), is preferably trained in ASD, and is appropriately supported and supervised if they spend much time together with the person with ASD (Recommendation 5.3.2 ). As children with ASD grow ol der, social skills development is important; for example, education in sexual safety strategies, community safety, strategies to keep safe when out at night and what to do if they are abused399-401 (Recommendations 5.3.3, 5.3.4 ). Little research has been undertaken on the effects of abuse on people with disabilities or ASD, or how to reduce the effects of such stress .402 Although a study402 used a structured parental interview to delineate the effects of abuse from other behaviour in non-verbal children with autism who had been exposed to abuse, much more research is needed (Recomm endation 5.3.5 ). People with ASD need to be able to access the age -appropriate service for supporting people who are at risk or who have been victimised (eg, Child, Youth and Family (CYF), Victim Support, A ccident Compensation Commission (ACC Sensitive Claims Unit) and other similar agencies ) (Good Practice Point 5.3 16 ). In cases where people with ASD are unable to manage their property and personal welfare decisions and guard themselves against harm (eg, if they have a severe intellectual disability as we ll), the Family Court, on application, may appoint someone else to manage their affairs (Recommendation 5.3.6). Part 5: Living in the community New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 183 Special legal provisions and practices in New Zealand have been developed to manage situations in which people with intellectual disability are complainants and/or witnesses in criminal cases .403 These practices are research based, and there is a growing international literature in this area .404 405 While some of this will be of relevance to people with ASD who also have an intellectual disability, more ASD - specific research is needed as the issues may be different (Recommendation 5.3 .7). For example, in contrast to non-autistic people, people with ASD may well be less likely to make 'false memory ' errors when interviewed .406 Furthermore, research is needed on how best to support people with ASD to give evidence. For examp le, while facilitated communication (FC) was used to assist non -verbal people with ASD to give evidence in some court settings internationally in the 1980s and 1990s, research suggests that the results of FC are not valid and that FC should not be used in court .407 5.3.b People with ASD suspected, accused, charged, convicted of crimes Despite some high -profile criminal cases where people with ASD have been convicted of serious crimes, no strong evidence exists as sociating ASD with criminal behaviour .270 360 408 409 For example, in a stud y published in 1999, ASD was diagnosed in only 2.4% of the total population of patients in special hospitals in England .410 However, the prevalence of ASD in the prisons and secure settings is unknown ;270 411 research is underway in Wales to explore this area further412 (Recommendation 5.3.8 ). It has been hypothesised that people with ASD may be at risk of committing offences because of ASD -related behavioural traits and characteristics, such as lack of empathy, lack of social understanding, pursuit of obsessional interests, failure to recognise the implications of their behaviour, rigid adherence to rules and misuse by others .270 360 413 However an alternative view is that engaging in criminal acts is due to the affect of co -morbid conditions, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression or poor anger management .414 Rarely does there appear to be a deliberate intention on the part of people with ASD to hurt others .270 413 Contact with police, courts and the criminal justice system is anxiety provoking for most people, and people with ASD have particular support needs. Given the nature of ASD, young people and adults with ASD are likely to experience difficulties when in contact with the police, courts and criminal justice systems .270 397 415 Furthermore, common practices in these systems may inadvertently victimise people with ASD (eg, confrontational interviewing, incarceration with violent offenders), exacerbate their anxiety, expose them to risk (ie, of physical harm, challenges to their interviewing style, charges of bias) and undermine legal and criminal justice processes (Recommendation 5.3.9 ). Expert opinion on preventative measures regarding contact with police and criminal justice includes the fo llowing recommendations: consider giving neighbours information on the person with ASD (eg, name, physical appearance, likes and dislikes, basic routines, contact details, names and details of the person) so that they know who the person is and can develop a better understanding of his or her behaviour (Recommendation 5.3.10 ) Part 5: Living in the community 184 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline develop good relationships with neighbours, so that concerns are dealt with informally wherever possible (Recommendation 5.3.10 ) intervene early on in the life of the person with ASD t o ensure that the obsessional interests, social deficits and communication problems of childhood do not become entrenched behaviours that expose the person to risk of victimisation or criminally offending (Recommendation 5.3.11 ) establish firm and consiste nt rules in childhood, so that people with ASD will accept limits on their behaviour in adulthood270 397 399 400 416 417 (Recommendation 5.3.11 ). Advice for the person with ASD when having contact with the police is: do not run away or make s udden movements try to stay calm consider letting the police officer know that you have ASD or some of the symptoms (it may help to have an information card on ASD kept in your wallet or purse) ask for someone who you trust and can rely on to be contacted (carry the telephone numbers of trusted people with you at all times) if you are suspected of a crime, ask for a lawyer, and do not answer any questions until the lawyer is present remember that refusing to talk does not suggest guilt you do not need a law yer with you if you are a victim or reporting a crime, but it may help to have an information card on ASD and a support person present399 415 (Recommendation 5.3.12 ). Advice for the family and whnau and support people of young people and adults with ASD, when having contact with the police and courts, includes: have summary information on the person with ASD readily available, so that it can be given to the police, an d any lawyers, at the start of the contact ensure that the legal rights of the person with ASD are upheld seek legal services if the person is suspected of or charged with a crime contact specialist advocacy services prepare the person with ASD well for pre-court and court appearances, especially regarding the conduct of the court47 399 418 (Recommendation 5.3.13 ). Police, courts and criminal justice perso nnel (eg, lawyers, probation officers, court staff, judges and prison officers) need to know: how to recognise when the person they are in contact with has ASD the implication of ASD on the behaviour of the person with ASD, and his/her likely responses to the behaviour of the police, court and criminal justice personnel397 416 strategies to ensure that the legal rights of all people concerned are upheld, and that the a ppropriate legal processes can be followed (eg, using an expert witness in court; recognising that people with ASD and other developmental disabilities are vulnerable in formal interviewing conditions, whether as potential suspects or witnesses; the vulner ability of people with ASD when held in custody)270 403 405 the potential impact of minimising the seriousness of the ina ppropriate behaviour of a child or young person with ASD, including the potentially reinforcing effects of police being 'too Part 5: Living in the community New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 185 nice ', giving cups of tea and taking people for rides in the police car .270 The recomm endations that ASD professionals and services develop good working relationships with police, courts and criminal justice facilities, provide appropriate education and keep lists of solicitors and advocacy agencies with expertise in ASD may well be appropr iate for New Zealand47 (Recommendation 6.15 ). The Intellectual Disability (Compulsory Care and Rehabilitation) Act 2003 provides New Zealand courts with alternative options for managing situations where people w ith an intellectual disability are charged with committing an imprisonable offence. These include specialist risk assessments, alternative sentencing options and directing services to provide appropriate interventions. The cases of young people and adults with ASD who are charged with an imprisonable offence, and who are also suspected or known to have an intellectual disability, may be more appropriately managed under this legislation ( Recommendation 5.3.14 ). 5.3.c The Family Court People with ASD may well find themselves in contact with the Family Court if their marriage or life partnership breaks down and if the custody and access of their children is under dispute. No information on this was available at the time of developing this guideline. However, because of the characteristics of ASD, there is a risk of significant issues in this arena, and people with ASD are advised to seek legal advice from solicitors and advocacy services experienced and knowledgeable in ASD (Recommendation 5.3.15 ). Part 6: Professional learning and development New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 187 Part 6 Professional learning and development \"People who know the details of my autism are usually more comfortable dealing with me. Also the more information my teachers have, the more ideas they have to help me learn .\" Part 6: Professi onal learning and development 188 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Part 6 Professional learning and developmen t Summary of recommendations The following recommendations have been drawn from throughout the guideline.

C 4.2 Problem minimisation and avoidance Part 6: Professi onal learning and development 190 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Recommendations: Grade Cross -reference 6.18 Education and interventions should be planned and implemented by professionals* with appropriate ASD education and qualifications. * In New Zealand, these are professio nals who meet the Ministry of Education 's criteria to provide services in early intervention and services in other educational settings. C 3.1 Approaches to teaching and learning in the early years 6.19 Professionals (including teachers) who are responsib le for students with ASD need release for professional learning and development, consultation, family meetings, observation, mentoring, planning and supervision. C 6 Professional learning and development 6.20 Different professional groups and multidiscipl inary teams should be given the opportunity to train together. C 6 Professional learning and development 6.21 In addition to workshops and seminars, all professionals and paraprofessionals who are learning new skills should be offered opportunities for pr actice, coaching and feedback. C 6 Professional learning and development 6.22 Distance learning opportunities should be developed for those working away from the main centres. C 6 Professional learning and development 6.23 Priority for professional learn ing and development should be given to those who provide a specialist or consultancy service and support and education to others. B 6 Professional learning and development Other recommendations 6.24 The development of a coordinated national plan for prof essional learning and development should be undertaken. This should include standards for professional learning and development and competencies for professional roles. B 6 Professional learning and development Part 6: Professional learning and development New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 191 Good Practice Points: 6.25 Support and tra ining should be provided to education professionals to develop peer -mediated strategies for social development. 3.2.b Social development 6.26 Consumers should investigate the post -qualification training and areas of specialisation of the health care professionals that they are approaching for diagnostic assessment and consider seeking recommendations from within the ASD community. 1.2 Assessment 6.27 Identification, education and support of ASD consultant practitioners should be a priority in each region. Consultant practitioners should be skilled in evaluating programmes and translating research into practice. 6 Professional learning and development 6.28 A full review of the professional learning and development literature relating to all sectors s hould be undertaken. 6 Professional learning and development Part 6: Professi onal learning and development 192 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 6.1 Personnel The following groups from the different service sectors were identified as those who should have access to professional learning and development. The educational needs will v ary with some requiring a very high level of knowledge and skill, for example, developmental paediatricians, speech - language therapists and psychologists. Some may require good skills and knowledge, for example, general paediatricians, teachers and paid ca re providers. Others may have their needs met through education in awareness and positive attitudes, and knowledge of sources for further advice when needed, for example, general practitioners, radiographers, court staff and school board of trustee members . Health, human services and education professionals who require access to knowledge and skills in working with people with ASD Health Medical: - General practitioners - Paediatricians - Psychiatrists: child and adolescent; adult - Internal medicine specialists (o r physicians) - All specialties Dental: - Generic - Specialist (eg, oral health disability service at Green Lane) - Dental therapists Psychologists: - Clinical psychologist - Other psychologists (educational or organisational) Behaviour support specialists Applied beh aviour analysts Counsellors Mental health staff Physiotherapists Occupational therapists Speech -language therapists Social workers Orthotists Nurses - general Plunket nurses and others doing Well Child assessments Radiographers Radiation therapists Human s ervices Mental health court liaison (social workers/nurses) Other staff in the health services who work with people with ASD Needs assessors Service coordinators Care managers Compulsory care coordinators Court staff (including solicitors) Forensic service s staff Police Holiday programme workers Voluntary workforce - non-regulated Recreation service staff Care and residential service providers, for example, residential services, contracted respite services (including Ministry of Health -contracted providers and those subcontracted by service providers) Disability support workers Part 6: Professional learning and development New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 193 Other support workers ASD Disability Information Advisory Service (DIAS) providers Regional Intellectual Disability Care Agency (RIDCA) staff, including paraprofessional support worke rs in Regional Intellectual Disability Supported Accommodation Services (RIDSAS) Taxi drivers, mobility drivers Government departments especially: - Work and Income - Child, Youth and Family - ACC - Justice Education services Teachers (early childhood, primary, intermediate, secondary) Teacher aides and support workers such as for education, communication and behaviour Principals Boards of trustees Librarians School counsellors Psychologists working in education Occupational therapists working in education Speech -language therapists working in education Physiotherapists Specialist teachers (early intervention teachers, special education advisors, Ongoing and Reviewable Resourcing Schemes (ORRS) funded specialist teachers, Supplementary Learning Support teachers) Special education facilitators Tertiary organisations - disability support staff Lecturers who have students with ASD enrolled in their courses Others who interact with students in the course of their work, for example, taxi drivers, bus drivers, school clean ers and maintenance people etc Education for health personnel Education for health personnel in understanding and working with people with ASD should occur at the following stages: Pre-service training/undergraduate training Postgraduate/specialty training Continuing Professional Development/ Continuing Professional Education/ Continuing Medical Education - Generic - all - Specialist The competencies at each of these levels should be defined (see section 2.3 : Physical wellbeing ). Part 6: Professi onal learning and development 194 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 6.2 Some principles of effect ive professional learning and development The resources and scope of the current guideline did not allow for a comprehensive search on all aspects of professional learning and development. However there are many recommendations throughout the ASD Guideline which relate to the need for professional education. A strong theme has emerged from the evidence surveyed by all workstreams. Parents, specialists, education, health and other human service professionals and paraprofessionals who work or live with people with ASD can improve the outcomes for those individuals if they have the necessary skills developed through appropriate education .11 104 197 211 419 Some general principles for professional learning and development have been developed. It is the opinion of the workstreams that these ar e applicable to all professionals, paraprofessionals and other people who provide support to people with ASD. While only a small amount of research was identified about the most effective personnel preparation, there is agreement that it is important to tr anslate research about effective practice into information that practitioners can use .104 There is a need for all groups to receive professional education which is up to date and ongoing. 1. To be effective, par ticipants need opportunities for meaningful instruction and opportunities to observe and practise new skills while receiving coaching, mentoring and feedback .104 209 419 There are many models for professional in - service development. Much of the professional learning and development currently offered takes place in 1 - to 2-day sessions that are topic -specific and are facilita ted by an expert in an area such as communication. While expert speakers may address important information and the expertise may be motivational, these opportunities do not necessarily provide participants with the comprehensive skills needed, or relate to mastery of new skills. This learning needs to be supplemented by practice, coaching, mentoring and feedback for confident application of new skills. 2. No one professional learning and development course or method will meet the needs of any group and prof essional learning and development opportunities need to be ongoing and offered in a variety of ways .11 419 Professional learning and development methods commonly used include: in-service programmes tertiary courses seminars with follow -up visits for on-site coaching and mentoring teachers with the provision of support via email distance learning programmes (university distance teaching, video - and telephone -conferencin g, online) general information short workshops itinerant trainers and consultants for small group or individual instruction, coaching and mentoring Part 6: Professional learning and development New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 195 access to resource and technical assistance centres, which can provide professional learning and development , training manuals, training videos and CD-ROMs individual professional upskilling and reflection, including self -monitoring and peer review. All these modes have different strengths and are appropriate to meet the wide range of needs. In particular, dista nce learning needs to be supported and developed for professionals working away from the main centres .11 3. Professional learning and development needs to be in 'quality time ', not in 'twilight time '. Profession als should be released to participate in learning opportunities. They should also be provided with time for planning, to practise new skills, receive feedback and coaching and to problem solve and communicate with other team members .11 211 4. Professional learning and development with a focus on ASD should take place both during initial training and continue to be available throughout the working life of the profession al ASD awareness and basic general skills will ideally be incorporated into the pre -service education of all relevant groups. For staff who will have regular contact with the person with ASD, there should be intensive professional learning and development in the first 4 to 6 weeks of a child or adult 's placement or appearance on a case list. Ongoing mentoring should be available for the first year .104 Education should be provided proactively and not wait until a problem develops .419 Parents also require access to information, support and education as soon as a concern about their child is identified11 419 (see section 2.2 : Parent information and education ). 5. Professional education and learning at any level, including initial training, needs to include information and learning that affects the attitudes of participants. Positive te acher attitudes are determinants of success for students with disabilities in general education classrooms .211 One study has reported that, with support and education, 86% of teachers were willing to accept a st udent with a disability, but less than 33% were prepared to do so without support and education. Access to appropriate support is a key factor in creating positive attitudes .211 It is important to remember that the voice of the person with ASD and his or her family is an essential part of any professional learning and development .11 It is likely that these factors are also true for other groups who work with people wit h ASD. 6. Professional learning and development should be offered at different levels to meet the needs of the following roles. This education will range from awareness - raising for the community at large to postgraduate level university courses. Parents Parents require education in many of the same skills as teachers and other service providers if there is to be consistency across settings. They need to be educated in the best practices in teaching and in reducing problem behaviours. They require opportunit ies for receiving modelling, coaching and feedback. Siblings can also benefit from some knowledge in these areas. Parent education will need to include individualised problem solving, including Part 6: Professi onal learning and development 196 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline in-home education or observation419 (further information and recommendations are found in section 2.2 Parent information and education ). Frontline professionals Professional learning and development and support should be available to any frontline worker such as educators, health professionals and paid carers who are responsible for a person with ASD .11 104 209 419 Teachers require instructional strategies beyond the knowledge of general teacher education. It has been shown that the extent of teacher professional learning and development has a significant impact on teaching success, and that even teachers with special education or early intervention qualifications benefit from attending ASD -specific programmes of study .104 197 The content of professional learning and development programmes for all frontline service providers should include: knowledge of the disorder and the signs of ASD at various ages ( see Part 1 : Diagnosis and initial assessment of ASD ) skills in interacting and communicating with people with ASD and t heir families and whnau the voice of the consumer (first -hand experience of ASD) parent involvement (family /whnau views and values) theoretical underpinning of instructional approaches the development of skill in a variety of techniques and natural teach ing strategies the development of language and communication the development of social competencies the development of adaptive skills and supporting transitions providing structure trial teaching decreasing problem behaviours skills in supervision and man agement of paraprofessionals, organisation and collaboration with other team members .11 104 419 Paraprofessionals Teacher aides, education support workers (ESW) and other paraprofessionals require professional learning and development for working with specific children and adults. They need to understand: the individual 's characteristics the individual 's communication skills and style behaviour management techniques for this particular person instructional methods for the development of new skills optimum arrangement of the environment. Every adult working with a person with ASD needs to develop the skills to deal positively with behaviour challenges. The paraprofessional should be able to use, with ease, all learning systems employed with the person (eg, Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) or Incidental Teaching) .211 420 Paraprofessionals and in -home carers need to be trained in strategies such as naturalistic teaching, visual supports, communication and social skill methods, as required .419 A New Zea land study showed the importance of teacher aides understanding the usefulness of taking a facilitative role to assist interactions with peers rather than a role which tried to compensate for the child 's difficulties and Part 6: Professional learning and development New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 197 do tasks for them. They reported th at the teacher aides appeared confused about whether their role was a teaching or caretaking one .421 Guidelines for the roles and responsibilities of paraprofessionals need to be developed so that everyone has a shared understanding of the paraprofessional 's responsibilities and role and who will provide supervision .104 It is not appropriate for paraprofessionals to have sole responsibility for implementing or decision -making about interventions or programmes .211 Teams Because students with ASD benefit from a high degree of structure and consistency, it is important that the team working around the child or person is coordina ted and well informed and shares common information about specialised instructional and behaviour management strategies .104 211 It is helpful if the team approach is reflected in the style of the professional learning and development and that different professions are given the opportunity to share learning opportunities .104 It may also be helpful for parents to join with ot her workers in professional learning and development so that there is an opportunity for each to understand the others ' issues and knowledge. Specialists It is recognised as important for all staff and parents directly involved in teaching and caring for p eople with ASD to have access to adequate support from specialists .11 104 211 Staff who operate in a specialist role or w ho train others will need additional education .117 197 211 The skills of those who provide education and support to others should be considered as the fi rst priority in a national professional learning and development plan .11 104 As well as education in their professional area, specialists such as therapists, psycholo gists, specialist teachers and relevant medical consultants need advanced ASD -specific professional learning and development. They also require access to information networks and ASD -specific consultancy services. Professional learning and development in cultural awareness is particularly important. Frontline staff require an opportunity to participate in hands -on education and ongoing mentoring, peer review and supervision from specialist staff .104 117 Such specialist professionals need to understand a variety of approaches and techniques and be able to communicate with and educate other staff .104 419 Ongoing professional learning and development should also take place through case reviews, reflection, reading and discussion of literature and supervision. Many specialist professionals have been trained to work with children, or to provide a direct service. To provide parent education and professional learning and development for other professionals, specialists need to understand the core constructs of adult learning and techniques for teaching parents and other adults. Many specialists will also b enefit from professional learning and development in supporting and developing teams who are working around the person with ASD .117 197 Consultants Identification and development of consultants from each profession who will be available to support specialists and provide second opinions should be a priority .11 104 419 Nominated people should be available to provide consultancy and professional learning and development to specialist staff .11 This may not involve face - to-face work with children and adults but these consultants may require extra Part 6: Professi onal learning and development 198 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline professional development in scaffolding adult learning, facilitating peer review, supervision and mentoring, and facilitation of professional networks. They also need skills in evaluating programmes and translating research into practice .104 419 Awareness in other professional groups There are many other professionals who are not involved in direct services to people with ASD. On occasion, these prof essionals may be required to interact directly with people with ASD in the course of their work. This may include professionals such as medical specialists, lawyers, those involved in the leisure industry and those providing community services such as librarians. These people need a level of awareness about the challenges which people with ASD face and knowledge of where to go to find further information and support, as they require it. Community education and awareness campaigns and information services sh ould be developed and fostered. 6.3 Organisational structures to support professional learning and development The National Research Council lists the infrastructure supports required to develop an effective service for children with ASD. It is the opinio n of the Guideline Development Team that the following aspects of the structure are relevant for all sectors which serve people with ASD in New Zealand: a national plan for personnel preparation around ASD across all sectors assistance for professionals in the form of support and ongoing professional learning and development development of tools for ASD programme evaluation development of a communication network for professionals working in the area of ASD development of demonstration programmes where profe ssionals can observe and learn new skills development of a data system which would provide the information needed for the development of a plan for services and associated professional learning and development development of a national plan for services fo r ASD. There is a need for professional learning and development to be coordinated nationally and for standards for professional learning and development to be developed .11 104 Part 7: Mori perspectives New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 199 Part 7 Mori perspectives \"You can experience anger and grief when your child is diagnosed with autism. You need time for it to sink in - it can mean a loss, but at least you then know what the problem is and hopefully the whnau will swing in behind you. Underst anding what's going on for them, or as much as you can is the main thing. I guess it's about education in a way.\" Part 7: Mori perspectives 200 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Part 7 Mori perspectives Summary of recommendations Good Practice Points: 7.1 Information packages in relevant and appropriate language abou t ASD in health, education and disability services should be developed. In plain and simple language, the packages could include the following: current knowledge of ASD across the continuum set of symptoms inventory across age groups dual diagnosis and dif ferential diagnosis information availability of specific health, education, and disability services by region funding avenues across health, education, and disability services recommendations on harm and safety issues helplines by region respite care infor mation reliable ASD (international and national) internet sites information pictorial information multimedia resources (eg, video). 7.2 ASD information in English and te reo Mori should be provided and distributed through Mori and mainstream providers of health, education and disability services. Other points of distribution could include: iwi organisations, r nanga, marae urban M ori authorities professional organisations across M ori health, education and disabilities fields mainstream television scr eening M ori programmes (eg, Marae) Mori television radio libraries all ASD support groups and networks police and law enforcement agencies Mental Health Foundation website road shows and workshops. 7.3 The appointment of a kaiarahi (guide) should be c onsidered. The kaiarahi would work in conjunction with, and be supported across, the health, education and disabilities sectors involved with ASD. Part 7: Mori perspectives New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 201 Good Practice Points: 7.4 An ASD antidiscrimination and destigmatisation campaign should be developed. 7.5 A programme of emp irical research that would provide baseline information about Mori and ASD should be developed. This part of the ASD Guideline comprises two sections. The first section provides a description of the methodology used to identify evidence -based information relevant to Mori and ASD and details the results of a literature review. As will be seen, this review is extended, in part, to comment on the association between culture and ASD. The second section outlines the background of a number of hui held throughout New Zealand on the topic of ASD and then provides a descriptive summation of the information elicited from attendees to the hui. These hui provided the opportunity for Mori to contribute their own views and perspectives of ASD. The Good Practice Points li sted at the beginning of this part of the ASD Guideline were developed from the findings of the literature review which largely corresponded with many of the issues raised during the hui. In recognition of the dearth of information available that reports on Mori and ASD, the Ministries of Education and Health identified the need to canvass the wider literature and include a more focused and specific Mori input into this guideline. To further this objective, a Mori Advisory Group was formed in 2004. This group was composed of representatives from Mori health, education and disabilities. All representatives of the group possessed knowledge of ASD. Part 7: Mori perspectives 202 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 7.1 Literature review Methodology A full and comprehensive literature search was undertaken. The specific o bjective of the literature search was to identify evidence -based information relevant, or directly pertaining, to Mori and ASD. The scope of the literature search was constrained to peer -reviewed publications by accredited scholars and researchers. Both q uantitative and qualitative research was sought. Search categories were identified and cross -referenced with main terms appearing in annotated bibliographies reporting on Mori health and disabilities information. Salient differences between an internation al and New Zealand context were also taken note of in preparation of the search. For example, evident within, in particular, some of the American and British literature is the continued use of the descriptor 'race' or labels of colour (ie, black, white) to describe different ethnic groups. A search was conducted using the descriptor 'race', although it is acknowledged that the notion of 'race' itself has been scientifically discredited. No search was undertaken using the labels of colour. Search tips on Mori and evidence, recommended by the New Zealand Health Technology Assessment were also used. Various combinations of the following terms were used to conduct the search: Mori ethnicity race minority indigenous New Zealand New Zealander aboriginal tangata whenua whnau culture autistic spectrum disorder autistic disorder autism Asperger(s) ASD infantile autism mental retardation. International and national databases searche d included the fields of health sciences, education, life sciences (social and behavioural), disabilities, multidisciplinary fields, and Mori health. Databases included, but were not limited to: Te Puna, Social Science Citations Index, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, OVID, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, VOYAGER and Index New Zealand (INNZ) Online. E -journals specifically relevant to ASD were also searched for articles published from the year 2000 onwards using the key terms noted above. The Google search engi ne was also employed to identify websites addressing Mori health, mental health, and ASD (international and national sites) specifically, and these were also searched for evidence -based information. Literature selected to be included in the review comment ed directly on cultural concerns relating to assessment, diagnostic and management issues involving ASD specifically. The broadening of the search objective to cultural concerns was necessary because currently there is no evidence -based information availab le that reports directly or indirectly on Mori and ASD. For the purposes of this part of the New Zealand ASD Guideline, evidence - based information has been defined as that which satisfies standard conventions of systematic search methodology and criteria Part 7: Mori perspectives New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 203 of evaluation. The review included limited international and national literature. The rationale for integrating the material was due to the dearth of literature available. With these caveats in mind, the review undertaken is best regarded as an initial exploratory examination. Results Only one publication was sourced that directly pertains to Mori and ASD.116 This report, commissioned by the Ministry of Education, involved a discourse analysis of interviews conducted with 19 families who had direct experience of caring for children and young people with ASD. The purpose of Bevan -Brown's study was to enable the family to tell their own stories regarding their experience of caring for Mori children with ASD. A synopsis of the findings raised i n this seminal report included the issue of delayed diagnosis, a limited understanding of ASD on the part of families and lack of support including financial resources being made available to such families. The need for helpful people to be identified earl y once a diagnosis of ASD had been received and, concomitantly, the need for better information to be made available to Mori families were also prominent in Bevan - Brown's publication. Participants in this study also recommended the provision of more cultu rally affirming professional processes being made available. It was suggested that these could be provided from the point of first diagnosis through to the subsequent management of children and young people with ASD. To supplement Bevan -Brown's work an extended search of the international literature was also undertaken using alternative search terms. Only two papers were identified that were of interest to this chapter. Other papers sourced, but not included made reference to the discredited notion of 'race ' or were specific to select population groups of other nations. In addition, many papers were based on unsubstantiated assertion or referred to contextual factors inordinately different from those of New Zealand. For these reasons they were discounted as being able to inform this review on Mori and ASD in a credible way. The first paper by Shek and colleagues involved the validation of a Chinese version of the PEP -R scale.422 Their findings supported the cross -cultural validation of this tool, which is used to identify psychometric properties of ASD. They recommended that their study be replicated in the Western context applying the back iterative translation method to the Chinese version of the scale. The secon d and more substantive paper prepared by Mandell and Novak provides a theoretical review of the limited material available concerning the role of culture to influence families' treatment decisions for children with ASD.423 The main foci of the paper include developing a more informed understanding of how families interpret ASD symptoms and, as a consequence, how these interpretations shape beliefs about causes of ASD and influence treatment -seeking strategies of families. According to Mandell and Novak, however, there is only one small study known that has empirically investigated the role of culture to influence treatment decisions involving children with ASD. Importantly, within this paper a number of significan t issues are raised. These issues, however, largely refer to what is not known about the association between ASD and culture rather than what is known with some empirical certainty. Part 7: Mori perspectives 204 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline The authors point out the problem of measuring the culture concept reliabl y. They also identify the absence of any empirical information commenting either on ethnic differences in specific symptoms of ASD or known divergence across cultures regarding the relationship between aetiological beliefs held about ASD by families and su bsequent treatment decisions. Whether delays in treatment seeking or preference for alternative treatments correspond with specific cultures' lay beliefs about causation is not known relative to ASD. Of notable interest is that Mandell and Novak draw atten tion to the variance in the quality of interactions with the health care system experienced by ethnic minorities when compared with others. They posit that clinical biases may influence representation of ethnic minorities with ASD. This may arise because o f differential attitudes being directed to members of these groups by professionals from first presentation of ASD symptoms through to choices of treatment and management of ASD. Access issues are also commented on by Mandell and Novak. In this regard, the y suggest that geographical location of families bears more influence on children with ASD symptoms coming to the attention of health authorities than other socio -demographic factors, including economic status. The caveat to the recommendations proffered b y these authors is that it ought to be understood that the goal with respect to ASD is seldom to treat the disorder proper, but rather to address other problems associated with ASD. They recommend research be undertaken to unravel the hypothesised relation ship between culture and ASD. In their view, such research would include: identifying whether any cultural differences exist in symptom presentation of ASD; how families interpret symptoms of ASD and respond relative to help -seeking and treatment preferenc es; and, the need to elicit more information on the quality of interactions being experienced between ethnic minorities and health and educational systems. The correspondence between recommendations made by Bevan -Brown (2004) and Mandell and Novak (2005) should not be overlooked. The following section reports on a number of hui held nationwide that were undertaken on the subject of ASD and Mori. As is described, these hui were organised to extend the opportunity for Mori to contribute their views and perspectives about ASD. Part 7: Mori perspectives New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 205 7.2 National hui This section reports on information gathered from five hui that were conducted throughout New Zealand during 2005. As a participatory method of gathering information, hui allow members of the community to voice their views and opinions on topics of mutual interest. Gathering information from hui is therefore seen as a complementary method to more conventional research methods as it actively encourages information sharing and exchange in a public forum. Considering the main objective underpinning t his guideline, and in lieu of empirical evidence that reports directly on Mori and ASD, an important caveat needs to be made about the information reported in this section. The information that follows represents subjective opinions and views regarding AS D expressed by attendees at the respective hui. These views are not generalisable beyond the contexts in which they were recorded. Therefore, the content of this section should not be regarded as a consensual characterisation of views held by Mori about A SD, and it should not be assumed that the content is representative of the Mori community more generally. With this caveat in mind, the information that follows presents a valuable insight into issues raised by Mori participants at the hui about ASD. It is anticipated that the content of this section will provide a significant foundation from which future research examining Mori and ASD will draw from and build on. The hui were held in Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch, Whangarei and Hastings. Represent atives from the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Education and the Disability Directorate facilitated the meetings. Background information Following advice from the Mori Advisory Group, work was undertaken to identify points within the guideline -in-progress where specific information or commentary from Mori was required. Under the key themes of assessment and diagnosis, education and support, and transition, a number of questions were developed. Along with these questions, background information about ASD was developed as supporting material. To encourage further Mori input about both the questions and supporting material, a hui was held in April 2005 with whnau who had experience in providing support to people with ASD. The purpose of this hui was to seek responses to the information that had been developed and to improve and extend the existing materials where it was deemed necessary. The outcomes from this hui were summarised and the resulting information was then reviewed by the Mori Advisory Grou p. Using these materials, an inventory of structured questions was developed to serve as a guide to prompt discussion at five hui held during November 2005. An open -ended question was also included to allow for more candid discussion on issues otherwise no t included under each of the key themes. Questions included in the guide covered the following themes: factors influencing representation assessment and diagnosis post -diagnosis support the need for a kaiarahi education services and ongoing support informa tion guideline development other ASD related issues - open discussion. Part 7: Mori perspectives 206 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Invitations were extended to all interested individuals using a number of networks. The five hui were held in three cities and two large urban townships, namely: Auckland, Wellington, C hristchurch, Whangarei and Hastings. About 150 individuals attended the hui. Participants included a wide range of professionals and laypersons. In attendance were representatives from health services, Ministry of Education, Special Education, Child, Youth , and Family, kaupapa Mori services, ASD support networks, and members from other interested groups including the lay public. It is important to note that given the procedures undertaken to develop the key themes, the context in which the information was generated, and the Mori frame of reference to which this chapter refers, the methodological approach that is most closely aligned with this process is exploratory research. To maintain the integrity of participants' subjective views about ASD and limit th e potential for interpretative biases, a descriptive analysis identifying the main issues raised was undertaken. The feedback from the hui was collated under the key themes and then organised into main categories matching those themes. A descriptive summat ion of the information is presented. The following information is organised under eight major themes. Specific questions are posed under each of the key themes. Each of these themes and accompanying questions is briefly described and a summary of the respo nses provided. Factors influencing the representation of M ori with ASD 1. There appear to be low numbers of Mori receiving ASD -related advice, information, and treatment. What factors contribute to this under - representation? The responses to this questio n can be grouped under seven main categories. These include the following: geographic isolation (access difficulties and isolation) insufficient knowledge and awareness of ASD lack of culturally appropriate professionals, services, and contexts funding and resource constraints lack of information available for whnau reluctance to seek treatment, or a delay in treatment seeking uniqueness of ASD. Attendees to the hui identified geographic, economic, cultural, information and individual factors as to why it has been speculated th at Mori children and young people appear to be under -represented with ASD. Part 7: Mori perspectives New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 207 Assessment and diagnosis 2. What would be helpful and supportive during assessment and diagnosis? Participants provided an extensive range of responses to this question. These are grouped under five main categories including: access to specialist services awareness and early intervention cultural education of professionals information whnau involvement and cultural processes. Responses to this question were largely focused on cultu ral factors such as professionals being educated in a Mori world view, Mori frameworks of health such as Te Whare Tapa Wh, and the inclusion of Mori processes during assessment and diagnosis procedures. Whnau involvement and empowerment were also emph asised. Participants voiced the view that assessment should be undertaken in a friendly and appropriate environment and should proceed at a pace suitable to the whnau. It was suggested that the availability of a coordinator to support the whnau through t he assessment process may improve current performance. Reliable information being made available about expectations, treatment options, and availability of appropriate services was also mentioned. The need for explanations to be provided by professionals u sing plain language was noted, as was a need for the relationship between professionals and whnau to be based on trust and confidentiality. Fewer responses were recorded regarding improved access to professional services. Of those that were noted, access to child and adolescent mental health services, Specialist Education Services (now Ministry of Education, Special Education (GSE)), and psychologists received mention. 3. What are some of the barriers for Mori accessing assessment and diagnosis services? Responses to this question were very similar to those obtained for question 1. They are grouped under the following eight categories: differential diagnosis/misdiagnosis geographic isolation (access difficulties and isolation) funding and resource constrai nts lack of culturally appropriate professionals, services and contexts lack of information available for whnau lack of whnau support, the resource constraints of single parenting, or the needs of other children reluctance to seek treatment or a delay in treatment seeking time to access respite care from initial inquiry to f irst response. The major focus of the participants was on cultural issues. Responses recorded included the need to recognise different cultural definitions of disability and spirituality, for professionals to be familiar with Mori world views, models of h ealth and protocols, and the value of involving holistic treatments and tohunga in the provision of care. The concept of whakam was also mentioned as a possible impediment that may influence delays in treatment seeking by parents or carers. Part 7: Mori perspectives 208 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline An observation was recorded involving the length of time it takes to receive accurate professional advice from first observation of a problem to the need to access respite care. Lack of whnau support, and single parenting, were noted as additional barriers. Problems wi th receiving accurate and timely information and referrals including professional advice on availability of services were also noted. 4. Are these problems made harder because the person with ASD is M ori? There was a clear demarcation in responses to this question from hui participants. For those who agreed that assessment and diagnosis issues are more difficult because the person with ASD is Mori, responses fell into four categories. These were: geographic isolation (access difficulties and isolation) reluctance to seek treatment or a delay in treatment seeking lower socioeconomic status not trusting the system. In contrast, those that disagreed with this statement believed that ethnicity was not a significant factor because services should be the same fo r Mori and non -Mori. It was also suggested that the main difficulty about assessment and diagnosis was when an individual received a diagnosis of ASD and the need for family members to come to terms with this. 5. Identify any other M ori-specific issues or needs during assessment and diagnosis. Participants' responses to this question focused predominantly, yet broadly, on cultural factors. A further delineation of responses was therefore required to distinguish between the main issues raised. Responses w ere grouped under the following three categories: cultural protocol cultural frameworks organisational culture. Participants of the hui almost unanimously responded to this question about Mori specific needs by identifying the implementation of Mori cultural protocols into the assessment and diagnosis process. Mirroring the process of pwhiri, the responses included working in a kanohi ki te kanohi (face -to- face) format with whnau, and the provision of karanga, karakia and mihi to establish whanaungatanga, and waiata. The involvement of kaumtua and kuia was also noted, as was te reo Mori and tikanga Mori being made available to whnau during the assessm ent and diagnosis process. Relative to cultural frameworks, emphasis was placed on professionals working with Mori with ASD and their whnau to do so within a holistic frame of reference. The main issue raised was for professionals to consider also the sp iritual and emotional aspects of an individual being diagnosed with ASD along with the impact on their families. The organisational cultural issues noted included providing support to kaupapa Mori organisations and other Mori agencies to undertake assess ment with Mori. In addition, it was also suggested that the cultural competency of non -Mori clinicians to work effectively with Mori and their whnau ought to be examined. Part 7: Mori perspectives New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 209 Other responses to this question included the need for more funding to be directe d to the field of ASD, a transparency of approach and the elimination of labelling relative to ASD. 6. What would be the most important features of an effective assessment and diagnosis service for M ori children or adults with ASD? The direct responses to this question are as follows: aroha, tika, pono, manaaki empowering and supporting the whnau when a parent receives a diagnosis of ASD, the funding should be there through a M ori parent network so that another M ori parent can offer support, information and advice. The major theme reiterated by participants was the need for assessment and diagnosis services to be provided in a supportive environment where individuals and whnau could access cultural protocols and practices. Allowing whnau to take ownership of the process was noted as a potential feature of empowerment. Post -diagnosis support 7. For parents and wh nau, coming to terms with the implications of a diagnosis of ASD can be a very difficult process. What kind of post -diagno sis support would be most helpful? The responses to this question were structured into four main categories. These include: cultural factors organisational factors information emotional support. Relative to cultural factors, attendees considered that post -diagnosis support would be best achieved by including a holistic approach involving kaumtua and kuia and supporting a by -Mori -for-Mori service. Having total whnau involvement along with a coordinator, preferably well versed in Mori protocol, to support whnau in the post -diagnosis p rocess was also considered helpful. Organisational factors suggested included there being a need for good intersectoral relationships across the services to assist Mori. Interagency sharing of information from which Mori could benefit by having improveme nts to their care across a number of sectors was mentioned. Regarding emotional factors, explicit references were made to affective responses experienced by whnau at post - diagnosis including: relief, anxiety, guilt, inferior feelings, whakam, stress, stigmatising attitudes, frustration, embarrassment and self -blame. Counselling and education services were noted as being two areas where more attention could be directed towards improving emotional support for Mori with ASD and their whnau. In addition, the issue of raising awareness about nutrition and general healthy lifestyles for Mori was also recorded. 8. What are some of the barriers or difficulties at this time? The main response noted relative to this question was that currently there is a lack of trained Mori in specialist areas such as health, education and iwi organisations who could provide culturally appropriate support at post -diagnosis. It was suggested that the provision of scholarships could enhance Mori representation in these areas. Oth er responses reiterated the call for improvements in the wider dissemination of clear information. Suggestions for improving information included: Part 7: Mori perspectives 210 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline the use of relevant and appropriate language to describe ASD and its likely lifespan developmental course availability of services across sectors and in specific regions funding and resources how wh nau can best provide for the needs of an individual with ASD. 9. Identify any M ori-specific issues or needs during post -diagnosis support. The responses to this question included there being a lack of continuity in service provision from a diagnosis of A SD and therapy, and a need to consider a grieving period for Mori on receipt of their child or whnau member receiving a diagnosis of ASD. Providing to the cultural needs of whnau post -diagnosis was also emphasised, along with the need for professionals to have dual clinical and cultural competence when attending to the needs of Mori with ASD and their whnau. Kaiarahi 10. The need for a kaiarahi (guide) was identified in the development of the background information for the ASD hui. The role of the kaia rahi is to guide whnau through their encounters with the system. What are your views on the role of a kaiarahi and do you support the need for this role in ASD -related services? Responses to these questions are grouped in to four distinct categories. Thes e are: cultural factors policy factors Strengthening Families model whnau model. Many participants responded yes - that the appointment of a kaiarahi would be of value. The ability to work confidently and competently with whnau so that they could be empo wered was seen as paramount. This involved being able to develop a working protocol in conjunction with the whnau and also being able to provide quality information, advocacy and whnau support. Having an understanding of cultural factors was seen as impo rtant. Many cited partnership, protection and participation as guiding principles that could be used to develop a bicultural service. Other attendees cited a preference for the Strengthening Families model to be implemented rather than appointing a kaiarah i. The reasons given for the favouring of this model over the appointment of a kaiarahi included there being too many people involved already from early ASD diagnosis and that the Strengthening Families approach allowed for an inclusive approach where whn au remained at the centre of the process. Education 11. How can parents and wh nau be assisted to participate fully in educational decision -making for their son or daughter with ASD? Participants' responses to this question fell into four different, but re lated, categories. These are: availability of professional support and services communication and information factors early identification and involvement time and transition. Attendees at the hui clearly favoured the opportunity to more fully participate in educational decision -making. Involvement of the whnau was emphasised as was being given a range of options about educational services available to their child. It was noted that this information Part 7: Mori perspectives New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 211 should be provided to the parent, carer and whnau as soo n as possible from the point of first diagnosis. A more streamlined approach was called for across the various educational programmes and services to facilitate continuity and consistency of education for children with ASD. This was deemed particularly imp ortant, as transitions across different educational environments and their success (or otherwise) can lead to stressful times for the child involved, their families, and professionals. It was suggested that an education package could be developed for whna u describing the various educational services available to them along with explicit information about programme requirements including funding. Providing parents and carers with the choice of where they would prefer the Individual Education Programme (IEP) to be undertaken was also noted, as was the requirement that the cultural choices of whnau for their members with ASD be respected. 12. What are some of the barriers or difficulties associated with participating in education decision - making? Responses to this question fell into five categories. These are: assessment issues environmental factors information factors resource constraints negative emotion and experience. In terms of assessment issues, some participants felt that application forms needing to b e completed to receive education services were barriers for Mori. Others thought that the high number of assessments needing to be undertaken would prevent fuller participation by Mori. It was noted that there seems to be additional support provided to m ore severe cases of ASD and not the same level of support given to less severe cases such as Asperger syndrome. Regarding environmental factors, it was suggested that some schools are special - education -needs phobic, they continue to be monocultural in both tone and practice and that there is a lack of integration between the school and home environments. The use of jargon by professionals and the number of personnel involved in assessment were also presented as barriers. The need to clarify professionals' r espective roles in the educational assessment process was suggested. A lack of resources, such as not having suitable transport available, was also cited as a barrier. Negative emotions, including grief and anger about the diagnosis, were noted as influenc ing participation; as was the parents' own prior negative experience in the educational system. With regard to the latter, it was suggested that the negative educational experience of parents could directly influence whether they wanted to be involved in t heir child's education. 13. Identify any M ori-specific issues or needs during the process. Responses to this question closely resemble those received for question 2. Two categories were used to organise the responses. These are: communication and information factors cultural factors. Specific iss ues or needs of Mori included information being delivered in a clear, precise and meaningful way. Particular attention to communication and information factors should be paid by multidisciplinary teams when working with whnau. It was suggested that hando uts might be useful in this regard, especially if they included illustrations and were written in language that was Part 7: Mori perspectives 212 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline relevant, appropriate and accessible to the public. Moreover, it was also pointed out that provision of information to Mori should not be r ushed, and when imparting information it should not be assumed that silence indicates agreement. Encouraging whnau to take support persons with them when they attend meetings was also noted. The use of cultural protocols such as karakia was cited as being relevant to the process as were an understanding of whakawhanaungatanga and the upholding of the mana of the whnau during the process. Consultation with elders or the inclusion of a kaiarahi to guide and assist professionals working with whnau may impro ve the process. 14. Parents and wh nau may need training and support to work on educational interventions with their son or daughter with ASD, for example, learning new skills to support generalising communication goals to the home or marae setting. Descri be culturally appropriate ways of providing support and involving parents and wh nau in educational interventions. The responses to this question were organised into three categories, namely: home -based support information support marae -based support. Some participants thought that the best way to involve parents and whnau in educational interventions was to improve home -support initiatives. These included a kaiarahi making home visits to whnau, identifying the current skill -base of whnau in collaboratio n with service providers, and providing the opportunity for parents to access education and resources to become skilled in intervention. With respect to the latter point, a process was suggested whereby the kaiarahi, service provider, whnau and individual with ASD could together engage in cultural activities such as raranga, taiaha, haka, waiata, waka -ama and poi. This would potentially engender and facilitate a more collaborative approach. It was also mentioned that the provision of childcare for other si blings when the parent is upskilling would be helpful, as would be making transport available along with kai. It was noted that providing educational resources that parents could use or make themselves would be useful. In addition, participants suggested t hat information support for parents and whnau could be improved. It was suggested that the setting up of an ASD 0800 support or text line where information from a Mori perspective was provided, including information about treatments such as natural remed ies, might improve participation. To facilitate a more collaborative approach it was also proposed that a marae -based environment might encourage greater family /whnau participation. K hanga were also suggested as another culturally appropriate setting. Within these settings, whnau may feel more comfortable and material could also be provided in te reo Mori. 15. Lack of eye gaze from a young Mori child could be an example of where someone's cultural background could be misinterpreted as a communication p roblem. Are you aware of any other examples of possible cultural or communication understandings? The responses received to this question were grouped into three main categories. These are: communication factors contextual factors cultural factors. Part 7: Mori perspectives New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 213 Hui par ticipants mentioned that it was important that professionals listen to families, and limit their use of technical language and terminology when working with whnau. While not culturally specific, participants offered the view that the Mori child with ASD may lack a range of communication skills including the ability to effectively comprehend verbal and non - verbal behaviours. They may also have hearing loss and not be able to communicate using sign language. Some individuals are tactile defensive. Also noted was that there are both positive and negative impacts from stigma surrounding the thoughts and myths attached to ASD. A range of contextual factors was also cited as being worthy of note. Included among these was the need for professionals to examine the background of the child presenting. It was suggested that the reason for the child's social withdrawal might be because t hey were raised in a dysfunctional environment. Reiterating this opinion was the call for experts to pay careful attention to how the child presents to professional services. Regarding cultural factors, participants offered the view that there might be a mismatch of models between whnau and professionals relative to child development. There may also be a mismatch between services and expectations of outputs. This was described as a differential in 'cultural pace' between the expectations of professionals and those of the whnau. How whnau view the spirituality of the child with ASD in relation to their world view was also posited as a cultural consideration. Services and ongoing support 16. People with ASD use a wide range of services within the disability sector. What are some of the barriers for Mori accessing disability support services? Attendees to the hui gave similar responses to this question as those obtained for question 1. These included the following categories: geographic isolation (access dif ficulties and isolation) funding and resource constraints lack of culturally appropriate professionals, services, and contexts lack of information available for whnau lack of whnau support, the resource constraints of single parenting, or the needs of ot her children reluctance to seek treatment, or a delay in treatment seeking. Isolation from appropriate services was cited as a possible barrier, as was not having access to much -needed resources such as a telephone and transport. Relative to culturally app ropriate services, the provision of 'Mori services for Mori people' was discussed along with making available kaupapa Mori services for children and young people up to the age of 15 years. Culturally appropriate day services and respite and residential placements were also called for. A request to extend the choices and improve the provision of community -based professional support was noted. Part 7: Mori perspectives 214 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Once again it was also suggested that there might be a discrepancy in funding between children with severe ASD and those who are 'higher functioning ' individuals. A lack of clear information about available services, how they can be accessed and the rights of parents were cited as possible barriers, as were difficulties in identifying where the responsibilities and bo undaries existed across government agencies providing ASD services. It was also noted that late diagnosis of ASD might prove to be a barrier for Mori accessing disability support services. About this, it was suggested that there might be reluctance on the part of whnau to accept the initial diagnosis especially if they lack trust in the health system and of health professionals. If they do not accept the diagnosis it is unlikely that they will access the appropriate services. 17. What are some of the most significant service gaps for M ori and how could these gaps be addressed? This two -part question received a range of responses that were similar to those obtained for question 1. Answers to the first part of the question regarding current gaps in disabili ty support services were grouped into the following three categories: emotional response lack of culturally appropriate professionals, services, and contexts lack of information and support available for wh nau. It was suggested that whnau need the time t o grieve after their child has received a diagnosis of ASD. This emotional response represents an important transitional event for whnau and should be respected. Consistent with the responses from the other key areas, it was also noted that there should b e more choices made readily available to Mori such as kaupapa Mori services. It was also suggested that Mori continue to fall through the gaps because regular services are inaccessible to Mori. Limited information being made available to Mori about AS D was also mentioned. Two examples that illustrate this gap in services are adults leaving home before receiving a diagnosis and children not receiving teacher aide support in regular schools. More information about support was required that described who whnau could contact, where to contact them and what kind of support and programmes were available. The second part of this question involved identifying how some of the gaps could be addressed. Suggestions made by participants were grouped into two broad categories. These included: cultural factors national initiatives. It was suggested that gaps in current Mori disability services could be improved by providing cultural training to all clinicians, paediatricians and nurses. Participants also felt that th ere was a need to train more Mori to become paediatricians and nurses so that they could become specialists in the ASD field. In addition it was also mentioned that whnau partnerships could be developed that encouraged community collaboration and service integration. The provision of disability support to Mori could also be undertaken under the umbrella of the marae. By providing services on the marae, whnau might be encouraged to more effectively participate, especially if p whiri and other cultural protocols were employed to make them feel more comfortable. Another focus from the hui was on improving Mori provider and workforce development including encouraging more Mori to enter training programmes in specialist ASD services as Part 7: Mori perspectives New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 215 noted above. The need to identify community support mechanisms already available through existing Mori health providers was also suggested. The relevance of working with Mori in a consultative and collaborative way including sharing information and networking was also posite d as a possible avenue to improve current gaps. There were also a variety of national -level initiatives suggested by participants. This included an intersectoral review to research government systemic processes that might either enable or encourage health sector fragmentation. It was also suggested that a national register of professionals with expertise in ASD could be developed, which might strengthen awareness and understanding of ASD across government agencies. Moreover, this might lead to government fu nding being extended from diagnosis to the provision of ongoing funding and support. Participants also advocated the need for a public -awareness campaign about ASD. It was proposed that such a campaign could draw usefully from the 'Like minds, like mine' d estigmatisation of mental health programme. Positive messages about ASD could be specifically directed towards raising awareness of ASD in a public forum and reach a wider national audience including parents and representatives of government agencies. 18. What kind of ongoing support would be most helpful during the transitions and changes facing M ori children, young people and adults with ASD? Attendees at the hui provided an extensive range of suggestions to this question. These were arranged into the fo llowing four categories: contextual or environmental factors cultural factors funding and resource constraints support factors. In terms of contextual and environmental factors, participants identified important transitions for Mori children with ASD as occurring with changes from early childhood education services to school, from school to work and from home to independent living. Issues for the transition from early childhood education services to school involved a lack of environmental skills being prov ided to children with ASD to cope successfully with the transition, a lack of staff awareness of the necessity for these skills to be developed and the problem of schools not being able to effectively manage the transition. Acknowledgement was also made th at individuals with ASD in the school environment may be considered a burden by teachers who may not be sufficiently skilled to manage these children in the educational environment. Regarding the transition from school to work, participants suggested that there is a gap in teaching appropriate life skills to adolescents with ASD in the 17 to 20 years age bracket. For the transition from home to independent living, responses focused on the need for services to be available to provide ongoing support for inde pendent living as well as support to find the right job for the individual. Cultural factors raised during the hui involved empowering the whnau through acknowledging and respecting cultural protocols and the need for services that involved alternative tr eatments. Advocacy services provided by iwi organisations and Mori providers also needed more attention such as developing services appropriate for individuals with ASD and their whnau. Relative to funding, participants suggested that regular reviews of resource allocation for ASD should be undertaken. Such reviews would involve identifying whether adequate resources were being provided to the ASD field and whether there was sufficient funding being made available to parents to attend courses. Part 7: Mori perspectives 216 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Regarding s upport factors, attendees proposed that there is a need for intensive support to be made available to whnau during the change and transition phases. It was suggested that a nominated support person could be made available, or alternatively, whnau members who had been through the respective transitions themselves could provide support. Another important factor noted was that during these stages, whnau could be supported through the setting -up of workshops to provide education about ASD, cultural training and funding information. Other workshops might involve education for professionals and employers who work with individuals with ASD and their whnau. A feature of such workshops would be to destigmatise ASD and challenge negative stereotypes about the cond ition. 19. Respite is a theme in the background information for the ASD hui. What are some of the most important features of an effective respite service for M ori children or adults with ASD? Responses to this question were grouped into three main categor ies. These included: availability issues cultural factors funding and resource constraints. Hui participants considered that there were issues involving the availability of respite care for Mori. These involved difficulties in finding Mori carers and people who have an understanding of ASD. It was suggested that there needs to be a network of people to provide respite care, that there should be professional respite care areas made available, along with suitable allocation of time to undertake professional respite care. It was also noted that these issues were further compounded by the need to pay whnau to provide respite care, even though accepting payment was not generally seen as the correct way of doing things. Moreover, whnau may be reluctant to acce ss respite care services through feelings of whakam. Other attendees at the hui thought that respite care services could be strengthened by providing broader options such as a kaupapa Mori respite service and a whnau -centred respite service. This undert aking would involve all the needs of whnau being taken into account and ensure that the services were both person and whnau centred. In relation to this suggestion, it was suggested that regional service providers and Mori providers could be used as val uable models by which Mori respite services could be developed. In addition, it was also suggested that respite care could be offered in family /whnau settings and that marae - based training could be provided for family carers. A call was also made for there being made available crisis respite care for Mori. Relative to funding and resource constraints, attendees at the hui mentioned that if government funding was specifically targeted towards ASD, then this could potentially lead to the strengthening of a community's capacity to provide support and respite care to whnau. It was also noted that there may be constraints in accessing appropriate respite care services if an individual had a dual diagnosis. Part 7: Mori perspectives New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 217 Information 20. People often stress the importance of timely, accurate and sensitive information. Are there any cultural considerations about the way ASD information is provided? The following suggestions were made relative to this question: make available wnanga in the respective regions and communities invite community based ownership of sourcing and distributing information provide ASD information in te reo Mori develop a mainstream information package. This would contain different strategies for managing ASD behaviour so that services could provide adeq uate support to people with ASD develop a Mori information package. This would describe what ASD is and what it means deliver information kanohi ki te kanohi (face -to-face). It was also suggested that caution should be exhibited about when the appropriate time was to provide information to Mori about ASD. It was noted that for some Mori, a pause is needed after a diagnosis of ASD has been received, so that they have sufficient time to grieve. Providing a lot of information immediately after a diagnosis o f ASD has been given may simply overwhelm them. The need to provide accurate information about what parents and carers could expect during the course of development over the lifespan for their family member with ASD was also mentioned. 21. How could ASD -related information be made more accessible and more useful to M ori? A number of different responses were provided to this question. These included: development of a video featuring kaumtua who could describe the issues involving ASD. The video should be made available in English and te reo Mori and show different c ontexts to deliver the messages, including marae access to Plunket and similar services to identify early indicators preparation of an information pack that may include a range of written and visual resources and dissemination of this material through orga nisations and communities presentation of ASD information through the media (eg, television, radio) with well -known personalities and presenters delivering the information provision of workshops presenting a range of information about ASD assessment and di agnosis, post - diagnosis support, education and disabilities support. Part 7: Mori perspectives 218 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline ASD Guideline development 22. The key themes from all five hui will be analysed and incorporated with other M ori research and information into a M ori section in the draft ASD Guideline. A M ori writer/researcher will be funded to undertake this work following the completion of the hui. Do you support the development of a Mori section in the ASD Guideline? All responses to this question positively endorsed the inclusion of a chapter on Mori for this guideline. Various reasons were given for this view, including: raising awareness of cultural differences and needs, a lack of access to information for Mori in th e past, the need to understand Mori to provide good support to Mori with ASD, and that the Ministries involved in this project had an obligation under the Treaty of Waitangi to include such information. Open -ended discussion 23. Are there any other ASD -related issues that are important to you that we have not already discussed? The primary set of issues raised by the participants is as follows: questions and research should focus on the systemic and structural issues pertaining to the health system's inab ility to under stand Mori needs, rather than using a blaming Mori approach the need for ASD hui that are more inclusive of parents and whnau Mori communities need to ask themselves what support they offer to Mori with ASD. How do r nanga, for example, provide suppor t to Mori with disabilities? a concern that the Ministry took a top - down approach rather that a bottom - up approach, which would involve including perspectives of parents and Mori service providers monocultural service frameworks are not sufficient for th e development of a Mori service. It needs to come from Mori for Mori that autism or similar types of conditions are often seen as normal and life reflects that. Kawa and tikanga can accommodate whnau with ASD questions about the funding for the ASD Gui deline and what is going to happen once the guideline is completed. Will there be extra resources made available? current funding is both a barrier and a gap - the flat level of non -negotiable funding does not take into account the individual needs and the four dimensions of a person with ASD including: - their age - whether they are M ori or non - Mori - their ASD - them as an individual Mori children with ASD are seen as a gift and embraced in whnau information from the hui should go to the policy makers. Part 8: Pacific peoples' perspectives New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 219 Part 8 Pacific peoples' perspective \"Being a parent to a son with autism, is about the importance of having our son being part of and being accepted for who he is in a number of communities, not just our own nuclear family, school, church communities and wider community in general. It really does take a village to raise a child.\" Part 8: Pacific peoples' perspectives 220 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Part 8 Pacific peoples ' perspectives Summary of recommendations Good Practice Points: 8.1 The role of the family, extended family and community should be acknowledged and empowered by identifying attitudes and beliefs that the individual and family have su rrounding ASD. 8.2 Appropriate educational material in language appropriate to each specific Pacific Island group should be provided to enhance understanding of ASD and support services they may be eligible for. 8.3 Pacific support workers, carers, t eacher aides, cultural workers and/or clinicians should be involved from the point of assessment and diagnosis through to coordination and treatment. 8.4 The establishment of Pacific community support networks specific to ASD in appropriate geographical locations should be facilitated. 8.5 Services must be proactive in offering treatment. 8.6 Decision -making regarding assessment, treatment and coordination should be based on contextual information from a variety of sources and include specific Paci fic input. 8.7 A programme of research that would provide baseline information regarding ASD and Pacific people should be developed. 8.8 A targeted recruitment and development strategy to support increasing the capacity and capability of the Pacific ASD -related workforce should be developed. 8.9 A strategy should be developed aimed at improving the cultural competency of the mainstream workforce to acquire knowledge and understanding of Pacific cultural values and world views and appropriately appl y this to their work. Part 8: Pacific peoples' perspectives New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 221 There is no robust formal research to date that addresses issues of ASD in a Pacific population yet anecdotal evidence, expert opinion and qualitative reports identify that ASD also affects Pacific people. However, there is clea r empirical evidence that Pacific people have poorer health status, are exposed to more risk factors for poor health and experience barriers to accessing services .424 The Pacific Health and Disability Action Plan425 sets out the strategic direction and actions for improving health outcomes for Pacific peoples and reducing inequalities between Pacific and non -Pacific peoples. Promoting participation of Pacific peoples is a key priority, with a focus on increasing access and quality of support services for Pacific people as well as encouraging community -based plans for disability issues. The inclusion of the Pacific section in this guideline is aligned with this priority. Due to migration, 6.9% of New Zealand 's total population is of Pacific ethnicity (or 265,974 people) .426 The 2006 New Zealand Census reports that 131,103 of the Pacific population (almost half) are Samoan, followed by Cook Island The majority of this population was born in New Zealand with about two -thirds of the population located in the Auckland region .426 The Pacific population is a very youthful population with the 0 to 14 year old age group accounting for 37.7% of the entire Pacific population. Young Pacific people are also more likely to belong to more than one ethnic group. This part of the New Zealand ASD Guideline provides a broad overview of issues, using a pan -Pacific approach. It is important, however, to recognise and acknowledge the cultural diversity between and within Pacific cultures - each nation has its own specific set of cultural beliefs, customs, values and traditions. The status, authority, tradition, obligations and power structures are different for each group .427 Moreover, the level of acculturation of a Pacific person will determine the extent to which this chapter applies. World views of New Zealand -born Pacific youth may be intrinsically different as identity may include affiliation to both western and traditional Pacific practices and values. Ther e also may be intergenerational tensions that exist between traditional and youth cultures. There is no formal research to date that addresses issues of ASD in a Pacific population and, in line with mainstream epidemiological research, the incidence and prevalence of ASD in the Pacific population within New Zealand is unknown. Research on general disability and Pacific people living in New Zealand estimates that one in seven (or 28,100) Pacific people has a disability, of which 21% are children. The researc h report also estimates that 72% of Pacific people with disability live in the most socioeconomically deprived areas of New Zealand .428 The recommendations contained in this section are derived from public repor ts, guidelines and published statistics and consultation through a fono. Part 8: Pacific peoples' perspectives 222 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 8.1 Pacific concepts of health Common values across Pacific nations are ideals such as respect, reciprocity, communalism, collective responsibility, humility, love, service and spir ituality .429 Pan-Pacific concepts of family emphasise collectivity and encompass the immediate and extended family as well as the wider community - it is not uncommon for children to be raised or parented by aunties, uncles or grandparents. Traditional Pacific concepts of health are holistic, where wellbeing is defined by the equilibrium of mind, body, spirituality, family and environment. Traditionally, Pacific people view disturbed behaviour or mental illness a s a manifestation of an external spiritual force that is usually caused by a breach of a sacred covenant between people or between people and the gods - hence treatment was sought from a traditional healer .430 Accordingly, traditional explanations of disability have been based on cosmological and spiritual connections such as punishment from God or a curse due to a family wrong. Pacific people have historically had low access and utilisation rates of disability support services in general .431 One contributing factor is thought to be the high degree of stigma attached to disability in Pacific cultures, so that the presence of disability is seen as shaming for the family .139 The shame is often associated with beliefs around breach of tapu and punishment for wrongs. Entrenched traditional beliefs and stigma issues inherent in most Pacific cultures, with regards to relating to peo ple with disabilities, act as a major barrier to full acceptance and participation in society and to accessing disability services in particular. Duty of care for loved ones is sacrosanct in most Pacific cultures where ultimate responsibility for the sick or disabled traditionally falls on the immediate and extended family. This may be a tremendous support and strength of Pacific families; however, it could act as a barrier to accessing services139 and, as regard s ASD, may prevent severe difficulties from being identified early .138 Furthermore, the guilt and shame associated with an inability (or perceived unwillingness) to bear the full burden of care increases the cha nces that services may not be accessed. Qualitative information suggests that ASD may not be acknowledged as 'ASD ' in Pacific communities where a child that is 'different ' may just be accepted as 'an odd one' and medical help and other supports may not be seen as needed or a priority. Moreover, there may be perceptions that a Pacific child with ASD may 'grow out of it ', or may be seen as just 'a naughty child '.138 Compounding the situation further is the fact tha t Pacific people are disproportionately over -represented in most negative socioeconomic indicators when compared to the general population. Poverty itself is a barrier to accessing services and there may simply be 'more pressing needs ' related to surviving , rather than dealing with a 'problem child '.138 Part 8: Pacific peoples' perspectives New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 223 8.2 Considerations when dealing with Pacific people with ASD Acknowledge and empower the role of the family, extended family and community. Clinicians and other workers may need to identify attitudes and beliefs that the individual and family have with regards to ASD before carrying out assessment and incorporate this into the treatment plan. Provide appropriate education for Pacific families who may be vulnerabl e to misunderstanding ASD and ASD services. Material written in English is not culturally appropriate for Pacific people with their oral tradition and understanding the messages requires too high a proficiency in written English .139 All written material should be produced in Pacific languages as well as in oral form (eg, videos), where possible. Language interpreters should be offered, regardless of perceived proficiency in English. Involve Pacific support worker s, carers, teacher aides, cultural workers and/or clinicians from the point of assessment and diagnosis through to coordination and treatment. While a 'Pacific for Pacific ' approach is ideal, this may not be realistic (given the under - representation of Pac ific workers in the field), and mainstream services should coordinate and establish partnerships with Pacific providers. Both mainstream and Pacific workers may require cultural competency training as well as training in ASD -specific knowledge. Facilitate the establishment of Pacific community support networks specific to ASD in appropriate geographical locations. Provide proactive treatment planning where services are offered to families, rather than expecting them to initiate contact and ask for it. Socio economic circumstances should be considered. Use standardised tests with Pacific people with caution - particularly tools used for the assessment of ASD. Pacific people have not been included in the populations that the instruments are normed on, giving ri se to inaccurate and invalid conclusions. Cultural protocol and behavioural norms also need to be acknowledged and not misunderstood in relation to ASD symptomatology. Any decision -making regarding assessment, treatment and coordination should be based on contextual information from a variety of sources, should consider natural settings and environment and should include Pacific input. Part 8: Pacific peoples' perspectives 224 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 8.3 Research and workforce development Given the paucity of research in the area of ASD and Pacific people, the contents of this chapter merely symbolise a starting point for the Pacific ASD community and sector. Robust research investigating ASD in the Pacific population is urgently needed, particularly epidemiological information identifying the prevalence and extent of ASD occurring in the Pacific population. Qualitative information is also required to gain a deeper understanding and knowledge of the presentation and nature of ASD among Pacific people, including intra -ethnic differences and similarities between Pacific Isl ands nations, and also between younger and older, more traditional Pacific people. From the start, this research should be framed to translate into policy, inform best -practice guidelines and provide information to funders for resource allocation. Although this section of the New Zealand ASD Guideline recommends involving Pacific people in the assessment and treatment process, it acknowledges that there is a paucity of Pacific people working in the health and disability workforce. There is an urgent need to increase the capacity and capability of the Pacific ASD - related workforce, in particular the professional workforce (rather than the non-regulated workforce in which Pacific people feature more frequently). This would require a recruitment and development strategy specifically targeted at Pacific people. In parallel with this, there is a need to improve the cultural competency of the mainstream workforce so that clinicians, teachers, support workers and carers are working in a more appropriate and effectiv e way. Increasing Pacific workforce numbers and enhancing cultural competency is likely to increase access rates for Pacific families and will contribute to providing culturally appropriate services, more effective treatment and ultimately better outcomes for Pacific people with ASD and their families.

The term is most commonly used with respect to eating and the disorder, anorexia nervosa. Anorexia nervosa an eating disorder characterised by intense fear of becoming obese, dramatic weight loss, obsessive concern with one 's weight, disturbances of body image such that the patient 'feels fat' when of normal weight or even emaciated, and, in females, amenorrhea Glossary New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 251 Applied behaviour analysis (ABA) the Living Guideline Group provided this definition following their update on applied behaviour analysis .12 The experimental analysis of behaviour is a scientific approach to the discovery of environmental variables that reliably influence behaviour; applied behaviour analysis is the systematic application of these principles in socially significant contexts. In practice, applied behaviour analysis is not a single method or type of therapy; it refers to a collection of methods and techniques designed to increase positive behaviours and decrease negative ones. Common techniques include (a) reinforcement (conting ency management, including extinction) ; (b) shaping and chaining (teaching components of more complex skills); (c) establishing stimulus control (discrimination training); (d) fading of prompts, cues, and physical assistance. Behavioural interventions desi gned to decrease negative (excess) behaviours require careful assessment of the function of the behaviour of interest (how it is being controlled by antecedents and consequences, or in other words, what function is it serving for the individual). Intervent ions designed to increase positive behaviours (eg, teaching new skills) require assessment of the components of the skill (task analysis), the social validity or importance for the individual 's development, its acceptability to the individual and his or he r social network (eg, family, culture), and the likelihood that the new behaviour will result in positive natural consequences. Good assessment ensures that the behaviour change resulting from the intervention programme will ideally be maintained once the programme is no longer in effect, and that the behaviour will generalise to new settings other than the training context. For interventions to meet the definition of ABA, the behaviour change (outcomes for the individual) should be systematically monitored . Professionals trained in delivering ABA do not follow a rigid formula or protocol, but will individually design and modify procedures according to well-established behavioural principles. Further discussion of how interventions are judged to meet these c haracteristics were provided in the two literature reviews, which also cited additional references that help to define these terms. It has become quite common for highly structured, intensive early invention programmes to be called 'ABA ' however this is not correct, since ABA refers to a wide variety of techniques and principles. Arrhythmia an abnorma lity of the normal heart rhythm Art therapy art as nonverbal, symbolic means for a person with ASD to express him/herself Glossary 252 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Asperger syndrome (AS) a disorder in the autism spectrum defined by impairments in communication and social development and by repetitive interests and behaviour. Unlike typical autism, individuals with Asperger syndrome do not have significant delay in structural aspects of lang uage and c ognitive development. Assistive technology (AT) defined as any device used to support the functional capabilities of individuals with disabilities. AT includes computer -assisted instruction, mobility devices, high and low technology adaptations and augmen tative communication. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) a disorder of attention to task, characterised by difficulty completing tasks in all settings, and often associated with hyperactive behaviour Audiologist a health care professional wh o is trained to evaluate hearing loss and related disorders, and to rehabilitate individuals with hearing loss and related disorders. An audiologist uses a variety of tests and procedures to assess hearing and balance function and to fit and dispense heari ng aids and other assistive devices for hearing. Audiology the assessment of hearing loss and disorders. Also the study of hearing disorders. Auditory integration training (AIT) an auditory technique which works on the concept that hypersensitivities and processing abilities can be remediated by modulated/filtered music provided through earphones Auditory processing processing information which is received aurally Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) frequently simply referred to as augmenta tive communication (AC). Compensating for impairments in individuals with expressive communication disorders. It might include supporting or developing communication with sign language, visual symbols, or voice output devices. Autism spectrum disorder (AS D) Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a condition that affects communication, social interaction and adaptive behaviour functioning. As specified in the current version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, the DSM -5,18 all people who are diagnosed with ASD share characteristics in two domains: impairment in social communication or social reciprocity, and impairment in restricted, repetitive patterns of behaviour. Although these features a re characteristic of all people with ASD, it is a very heterogeneous condition affecting a very diverse group of individuals with a wide range of severity, disability and intellectual function, from the severely impaired person to a 'high functioning ' individual. Glossary New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 253 Autism characterised by more profound impairments in communication, social and restricted interests, activities and behaviours. May include intellectual impairment. Aversive measures/procedures behavioural methods employing punishment or the with drawal of privileges, rather than positive reinforcement Backward chaining steps to performing a task are identified - the last step is taught first and this process is continued until all the steps are learned Behaviour an individual 's reaction in any g iven situation, or to any given response, or, a generic term covering acts, activities, responses, reactions, movements, processes and any other measurable response. The behaviour of people is studied by a number of disciplines including the academic disci plines of psychology (including applied behaviour analysis), sociology, economics, and anthropology. Behaviour analysis the scientific study of behaviour. BF Skinner, generally considered the founder of behaviour analysis, coined the term 'behaviour analy sis'. The term was meant to distinguish the field as one that focuses on behaviour as a subject in its own right, rather than as an index or manifestation of something happening at some other level (in the mind, brain, psyche, etc). Behaviour management the systematic manipulation of environmental stimuli or events to increase the likelihood that an individual, or group of individuals, will exhibit appropriate behaviours and to reduce the likelihood that an individual, or group of individuals, will exhibit inappropriate behaviours Biomedical an umbrella term for those interventions which have a medical, biochemical or dietary basis, but are not pharmacological Bipolar disorder a major affective disorder in which both manic and depressive episodes occur Body language communication that occurs as a result of using gestures, posture etc Capacity building to improve organisational ability/capacity to respond to a particular need, or meet a demand Cardiotoxicity having a direct toxic or adverse effect on the heart Caries tooth decay, cavities Cartooning use of cartoons to enhance social understanding, for example, by drawing thought bubbles to show what someone is thinking Glossary 254 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Challenging behaviour behaviour of such frequency, intensity or duration that the physical safety of the person or others is placed in serious jeopardy, or behaviour which is likely to seriously limit or deny access to the use of ordinary community facilities Chelation administration of a chemical compound to bind a metal so that the met al can be eliminated from the body Child, Adolescent and Family Services (CAFS) mental health services for children and adolescents.

Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) psychotherapy based on modifying everyday thoughts and behaviours, with the aim of positively influencing emotions. CBT developed out of behaviour modification and Cognitive Therapy, and is widely used to treat mental disorders. Therapeutic techniques vary according to the particular kind of client or issue, but commonly include keeping a diary of significant events and associated feelings, thoughts and behaviours; questioning and testing assumptions or habits of thought that might be unhelpful and unrealistic; gradually facing activities which may have been avoided; and trying out new ways of behaving and reacting. Relaxation and distraction techniques are also commonly included. Cognitive behaviour modification see cognitive behaviour therapy Cognitive learning strategies technique used in cognitive behaviour therapy Glossary New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 255 Cognitive scripts technique used in cognitive behaviour therapy Collaborative consultation a problem solving process that reflects hig h levels of communication and coordination Communication partner the receiver of the message in a communicative exchange Communication the act of exchanging or expressing thoughts, feelings and ideas Co-existing condition one that exists at the same tim e as another condition in the same individual Co-morbid condition one that exists at the same time as another condition in the same individual. The two conditions are usually independent of each other. For example a child who has autism might also develop leukaemia. That the child has autism complicates treating the leukaemia, but the two conditions are independent of each other. Consultative model an integrated process of service provision where the professional works with others (eg, classroom teacher a nd teacher aide) to achieve outcomes for the child, school or family Contemporary applied behaviour analysis the contemporary application of behavioural principles, which holds that conclusions about human development and behaviour should be based on cont rolled observation of overt behaviour, yet are cognisant of developmental issues Cooperative teaching/learning a set of educational practices whereby children of different backgrounds or ability levels work in teams that are structured in such a way that all members have to work together to achieve a common objective or goal Core deficit the core deficits in autism spectrum disorders are defined in diagnostic criteria Cue dependent responding a situation when specific responses or behaviours in a person 's repertoire have come to be dependent on specific stimuli or prompts so that they only occur following these stimuli Curriculum modification modifications or alterations to the content, strategies, mode of delivery, and/or expectations to accommodate the needs of the individual Daily life therapy see Higashi Schools therapy Denver Health Sciences Programme developmentally based programme employing behavioural techniques Desirable Objectives and Practices (DOPs) Ministry of Education policy documents fo r early childhood education services Glossary 256 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Developmental coordination disorder difficulty in the planning and execution of purposeful movements that result in difficulty performing fine and gross motor skills (eg, drawing, buttoning, dressing, learning new moto r skills and speech etc).

EarlyBird a parent -education programme for parents of young children with autism originally developed in the United Kingdom and now avail able in New Zealand through Autism New Zealand (jointly funded by the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Education) Early Intensive Behavioural Intervention The Living Guideline Group provided this definition following their update on applied behaviour an alysis .12 When early, intensive interventions are based on behavioural principles they can be correctly identified as EIBI. There have been many developments in early behavioural intervention since Lovaas first described his protocol in 1987. The common elements of EIBI programmes, paraphrased from Eldevik et al,432 are as follows: (a) intervention is individualised and comprehensive, addressing a range of skills (b) a variety of ABA techniques are used to build new repertoires and reduce interfering behaviour. These are commonly delivered as discrete trial instruction, but may also involve incidental teaching and activity - embedded trials Glossary 258 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Early Intensive Behavioural Intervention (continued) (c) one or more individuals with advanced training in applied behaviour analysis and experience with young children with developmental disabilities (especially ASD) directs (supervises) the programme (d) the selection of intervention goals and short -term objectives is usually guided by understanding of typical developmental sequences (e) parents are encouraged to serve as active co -therapists for their children, and may be trained to do so (f) intervention is delivered in one -to-one f ashion initially, with gradual transitions to small -group and large -group formats when warranted (g) intervention typically begins in the home and is carried over into other environments (eg, community settings), with gradual, systematic transitions to preschool, kindergarten, and elementary school classrooms when children develop the skills they are required to learn in those settings (h) programming is intensive, is year round, and includes 20 or more hours of structured sessions per week plus additional informal instruction and practice (i) in those programmes that have been formally evaluated, the duration of intervention is usually 2 or more years (j) the intervention programme is usually commenced in the preschool years, when the children are 3 to 4 ye ars of age. Echolalia the repetition of speech produced by others. The echoed words or phrases can include the same words and exact inflections as originally heard, or they may be slightly modified. Immediate echolalia refers to echoed words spoken immedi ately or a very brief time after they were heard. Delayed echolalia refers to echoed 'tapes ' that are repeated at a much later time - days or even years later. Eclectic approach a teaching approach which draws on elements from many theoretical models Eco-cultural the ecology of the social and cultural influences surrounding the child and family /whnau Ecological approach/model an ecological approach or model is a view, practice or orientation that considers the role the environment plays in development, learning and behaviour. For example, ecological assessments would include the study of the child in his/her physical, social and learning environments. Glossary New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 259 Electroencephalogram (EEG) a recording of the changes in electric potential associated with activity of the cerebral cortex. EEG is used in the evaluation of epilepsy. Empathy identification with and understanding of another 's situation, feelings, and motives Empirically validated strategies strategies for which there is research evidence Engagement refers to the amount of time that a child is attending to and actively participating in the social and non -social environment Enuresis incontinence, the involuntary passing of urine. 'Nocturnal enuresis ' refers to bedwetting. Environmental barriers aspects o f the environment which limit access to full inclusion and participation. Aspects of the environment are identified as natural environment, built environment, support and relationships, attitudes, services/systems/policies, equipment/products and technolog y. Environmental modification/adaption making changes to the environment to facilitate safety, to make care easier, to support behaviour change or to make the person more comfortable. For example, provision of a safe fenced area by installing climb -proof fencing; installation of Perspex windows to prevent injury from broken glass; moving breakable ornaments out of reach of a child; removing seasonal clothing to support appropriate dress for conditions; addressing noise or other sensory factors. Epidemiolo gy the study of how a disease affects a population, ie, incidence, control, distribution etc Epistaxis nosebleed Executive function the self -organisational elements required to learn or behave. In neuropsychology and cognitive psychology, 'executive func tioning ' is the mental capacity to control and purposefully apply one 's own mental skills. Different executive functions may include: the ability to sustain or flexibly redirect attention, the inhibition of inappropriate behavioural or emotional responses, the planning of strategies for future behaviour, the initiation and execution of these strategies and the ability to flexibly switch among problem -solving strategies. Current research evidence suggests that executive functioning in the human brain is medi ated by the prefrontal lobes of the cerebral cortex. Glossary 260 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Expressive communication the process by which a person sends information in messages to other people. Includes the process of understanding the purpose of communicating as well as functions such as usin g verbal or non -verbal communication. Expressive language sending information or messages to other people using verbal or non -verbal language Extrapyramidal symptoms neurological symptoms including tremors, muscle rigidity, a shuffling gait, restlessness , and difficulty initiating movement Eye contact the event when two people 's gaze meets.

Evidence -based recommendations recommendations that are supported by evidence from a systematic review of the literature . Facilitated communication (FC) technique used for people with communication difficulties whereby they are supported to point to or touch objects, letters, symbols or pictures False memory memory of an event that did not happen or is a distortion of an event that did occur as determined by externally corroborated facts Family -centred services services, goals and plans for a ch ild that are based on family needs and preferences Family Care Plan (FCP) a support plan to meet the individual needs of children and their families, usually around early intervention services Floor Time therapy provided by the Floortime Foundation, whic h describes it as meeting a child at his current developmental level and building on his/her particular set of strengths Formulation the process of integrating assessment information systematically Fragile X a single gene disorder causing intellectual di sability, and autistic and hyperactive behaviour in males. Females usually have more subtle learning difficulties and often have problems with social anxiety. Functional alternative a behaviour that serves the same function as a current challenging behavi our. Teaching functional alternative behaviours helps to eliminate the undesirable behaviour by reducing the need for it. Glossary New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 261 Functional analysis determining the possible cause of inappropriate behaviour, through a process of observation, data collection and the systematic manipulation of variables. Used to identify intervention strategies. Functional analysis is based on the notion that all behaviour serves a function for the individual concerned. If the function of a specific undesirable behaviour is known, then an appropriate functional alternative can be taught, and undesirable behaviour eliminated by ensuring that it functions as well as the appropriate alternative. Functional assessment the observation phase of functional analysis. Sometimes referred to as 'functional behaviour assessment '. Functional communication how the child communicates in their everyday environments which may include a range of communication forms, eg, signs, gestures, visual symbols or language Functional communication training is often part of an intervention where a problem behaviour serves a communicative function. Acceptable functional alternatives to the problem behaviour are taught so that the child is able to communicate appropriately. Functionality likely to be useful - giving access to control of the child or young person 's environment, increasing independence and quality of life, increasing competence of performance Further education tertiary education (university or polytechnic), adult education, and vocational trainin g schemes Gastrointestinal problems refer to dysfunction that is evident in clinical symptoms, usually chronic, persistent, recurrent, frequent or excessive in nature, which do not have clear anatomic, metabolic, or pathologic process. These problems (GER) abdominal pain, discomfort, irritability , bloating; flatulence. Generalisation transfer of learning.

For example, teaching about shopping in a supermarket rather than a classroom. Naturalistic teaching using natural contexts to teach skills Needs Assessment and Service Coordination (NASC) Needs Assessment and Service Coordination Negative Reinforcement occurs when a behaviour (response) is followed by the removal of an aversive (unpleasant) stimulus. The word 'reinforcement ' is defined by the effect it has on behaviour, which is to increase the likelihood of the behaviour to occur in the fut ure. The word 'negative ' signals that this is achieved by withdrawing something. Because the situation becomes more pleasant for the individual as a result of negative reinforcement the effect is to strengthen the behaviour or response it follows.

Today it is the major provider of Well Child/Tamariki Ora services in New Zealand. Positive behavioural approaches behavioural approaches that promote adaptive, socially meaningful behaviours, help overcome maladaptive behaviours and avoid the use of punishment. The primary goal of positive behavioural supports is to teach functional skills as a replacement for problem behaviour. Positive behavioural support typically involves changing existing environments in a manner that makes problem behaviours irrelevant, ineffective and inefficient. Glossary New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 269 Positive reinforcement occurs when a behaviour (response) is followed by a desirable or pleasant stimulu s that increases the frequency of that behaviour. The word 'reinforcement ' is defined by the effect it has on behaviour, which is to increase the likelihood of the behaviour to occur in the future. The word 'positive ' signals that this is achieved by addin g something. Because the situation becomes more pleasant for the individual as a result of positive reinforcement the effect is to strengthen the behaviour or response it follows.

This fr amework was later set aside in 2004 in favour of a more flexible, collaborative, 'whole of life ' way of working across all workstreams. Workstream input The workstreams were established to cover the main components of the ASD Guideline. 1. The Paediatric S ociety led the Assessment and Diagnosis workstream, formerly known as the Early Intervention workstream, which was established in November 2002. This workstream covered: definitions and prevalence rates diagnosing ASD in children assessment and assessment pathways the role of diagnostic and screening tools pharmacotherapy for children. 2. The Ministry of Education, Special Education (GSE) led the Education workstream, which commenced work in March 2003. This workstream covered: support for families ' involve ment in education the implications for teaching and learning arising from the child and adolescent 's communication, cognitive, social and sensory characteristics early intervention approaches and the framework of the Te Whriki curriculum teaching and mana gement strategies and the key curriculum areas for students with ASD professional learning and development for professionals working in education. 3. The Disability Services Directorate in the Ministry of Health led the Support and Transition workstream, w hich commenced in April 2004. This workstream covered: assessment and diagnosis of young people and adults Needs Assessment and Service Coordination supported and independent living options physical wellbeing employment and adult education recreation and l eisure behavioural, emotional and mental health difficulties contact with the police, courts and criminal justice system the needs of others. In March 2004 a Technical Advisory Group was developed. This group consisted of up to two representatives from eac h of the three workstreams and the project manager. At specific times during the development of the guideline, expert advisors were also co -opted on to the group, including a NZGG representative and technical editors. Appendices New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 281 Mori input Although Mori perspectives had been incorporated into some of the guideline development processes, the workstream leaders and Ministries of Education and Health identified the need for a more focused and specific Mori input. A Mori Advisory Group was formed in 2004 and consisted of Mori health, education and disability representatives who also had knowledge of ASD. Following advice from the Mori Advisory Group, work was undertaken to identify points within the existing guideline material where Mori -specific information or commentary would be required. These signposts or themes were used during the five ASD hui held in November 2005 to gain further Mori input. More than 150 predominately Mori professionals, service providers, parents and w hnau attended the hui and provided feedback for the development of the New Zealand ASD Guideline. The feedback from the hui was analysed and incorporated with other Mori research and information into the section of the guideline on Mori perspectives. Pacific peoples ' input In 2004, a fono was held to discuss how Pacific ASD -related needs could be addressed in the guideline. A range of different perspectives was gathered and a report was produced to summarise the findings of the fono. This information was then developed into a section of the guideline on Pacific peoples ' perspectives. Consultation The detailed development of the guideline was undertaken by small working groups within each workstream. The workstreams also established advisory development groups to assist in the development and provide wider consultation. Methodology Each workstream used a separate methodology for the development of the guideline. Workstream 1 The section on diagnosis and assessment of young children in Part 1 of the guidelin e is based on the National Autism Plan for Children 2003 (NAPC), which was developed by the United Kingdom National Autistic Society for the National Initiative for Autism: Screening and Assessment in conjunction with the Royal College of Psychiatrists, th e Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health and the All Party Parliamentary Group on Autism11 The document is available from: www .nas.org.uk/nas/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=3 68&a=2178 . This is the full version on which this part of guideline is based and to which the reader should refer for the evidence base and rationale for recommendations. Further reference was made to the Autistic Spectrum Disorders Best Practice Guidelines for Screening , Diagnosis and Assessment developed by the California Department of Developmental Services 2002 ,33 www .ddhealthinfo.org/asd.asp . Individual members of the Paediatric Society develo ped appendices 5 and 6 and the evidence -based process that they followed is described there. Appendices 282 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline The New Zealand Guideline Development Group in Workstream 1 applied the AGREE tool424 to assess the NAPC Guideline. It was assessed as being an appropriate document to be adapted for the New Zealand environment. Some areas identified by the AGREE assessment required adaptation to reflect the New Zealand context. Adaptation of the NAPC Guideline was undertaken during face -to-face meetings, audi o conferencing and email consultation of drafts. A literature search by NZHTA up until June 2004 was performed to identify evidence on the benefits and harms of pharmacological and biomedical interventions suitable for children with ASD to inform Part 4 of the guideline. The search was aimed at finding literature relevant to children aged 0 to 12 years. A list of abstracts was generated from about 900 papers. A list of relevant papers was generated from these abstracts and evidence tables were compiled. Sel ection criteria were: autism -specific studies - study subjects included individuals diagnosed with ASD double -blind randomised controlled trials systematic reviews case reports of adverse effects (with particular reference to drugs in current use in New Zealand) papers of general interest on the topic. Review of the list of abstracts generated by the NZHTA literature search noted that 70 different medications or biologically active agents have been described as being used therapeutically in ASD and related disorders. In addition, two dietary approaches have been described. Eight classes of medications were reviewed by different authors in Workstream 1 for their applicability to children. Many medications were described in only one or two papers, often single case reports. A number of the papers reviewed included an age range in the study subjects outside the 0 to 12 years criteria and thus recommendations may have a relevance to older children. Early in the guideline development process, the Ministry of Healt h commissioned a New Zealand Health Technology Assessment review, undertaken by Marita Broadstock and Carolyn Doughty, on the evidence relating to the use of psychotropic medication in adults with ASD. However, no adult psychiatrist was identified to evalu ate this review and produce recommendations for pharmacotherapy in adults. It is intended that this work be undertaken at a later date. Workstream 2 Major sections of Parts 2 and all of Part 3 of the guideline were developed by a small working group consis ting of five people with expertise in special education and ASD. Communication was by face -to-face meetings and teleconferences. Additional expertise was incorporated through feedback from a consultancy group. The group developed practice questions which were sent to the consultancy group for feedback and the generation of further questions. The group conducted its own searches of the literature up until April 2004, assisted by the library at the Ministry of Education. Because of time and resource constrain ts, evidence was drawn primarily from existing published guidelines and published reviews of relevant literature. When insufficient material was found from this method, searches were undertaken for single research studies and other writing from established experts in the field. The ERIC, PsycINFO and Australian Family Index databases were searched using the descriptors 'autism spectrum disorders '. 'autism ', 'asperger(s) syndrome ', 'pervasive developmental delay ' and 'education '. Searches were also undertake n Appendices New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 283 to seek material on effective practice, adolescents, families, behaviour, transitions and inclusion in relation to ASD. The criteria for selection of studies were as follows: For guidelines: published in 1998 or later contained an education focus evidenc e of an evidence -based approach. For literature reviews and single articles: published in a peer reviewed journal in 1998 or later had a focus on education and ASD. Recurring themes were identified. The published evidence was critically appraised and evide nce tables developed with levels of evidence for each study. The content of the guideline was decided upon by consensus, based on the sources of evidence. The content was reviewed by the consultancy group for feedback and where that feedback was supported by the evidence, it was added to the document. Consensus was also used to develop recommendations based on the content of the section. Each recommendation was graded according to the strength of evidence that supported it. Workstream 3 This workstream, set up by the Ministry of Health and the Disability Services Directorate, was made up of two workstream leaders and a virtual team of ASD subject matter experts from across New Zealand. The writers contributed separate sections, reflecting the different exper tise of the team members. The workstream leaders were responsible for all of Part 5 of the guideline on the support needs of people with ASD in the community and the transition into adulthood, and half of Part 1, the assessment and diagnosis of young peopl e and adults. Additional contributions were merged into Parts 2 and 4. The scope of topics to be included was initially wide ranging but refined after consultation, because of resourcing and time issues. The following topics relevant to young people and ad ults with ASD were excluded: skills for independent living socialisation, relationships and sexuality behaviour support occupational therapy physiotherapy communication support care and protection alternative treatments interface between relevant New Zeala nd agencies people with ASD over the age of 65 years transitions within school, for example, early childhood education to primary school, primary school to secondary school. Practice questions and topics were defined and a systematic, hierarchical search o f medical, psychological and social science databases was performed in July 2004. Further searches were also performed by accessing relevant organisations and internet websites for policy and position papers, textbooks, reports and guidelines. The identifi ed literature was appraised using the New Zealand Guideline Group process. Qualitative research was appraised using the CASP (critical appraisal skill programme) tool. Evidence tables were constructed with levels of evidence for each study. This team consu lted an advisory group on a regular basis during the development of the sections. Appendices 284 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Date range for inclusion of studies For all workstreams, systematic searching was performed until 2004. Papers published after the completion of searching and, in some cases before the search dates, were suggested by members of all workstreams and incorporated in the text and evidence tables, where appropriate. In future updates of the guideline, systematic searching will commence in 2004 to ensure a systematic evaluation of a ll the literature is achieved. Mori and Pacific perspectives The process underlying the chapters on Mori and Pacific perspectives is described within these chapters. Consultation An open consultation process was undertaken requesting input from stakehold ers and other interested individuals and groups, both within New Zealand and overseas. Parallel review of the draft ASD Guideline was also undertaken by a number of experts in ASD nominated by the workstream leaders. Feedback was sought on identification o f gaps in the content, links between evidence and recommendations and suggestions on presentation. The workstream leaders considered all the feedback and made amendments supported by additional references, where appropriate. Evidence tables The evidence ta bles that support this guideline can be accessed on the Ministry of Health website (http://www.h ealth.govt.nz/our ) No evidence tables were provided for the assessment and diagnosis of children as this section of the guideline was an ada ptation of the NAPC UK Guideline. The evidence tables for the remainder of the guideline are in two separate formats. Evidence tables assessing the benefits and harms of medications follow a strictly quantitative format, based on study design. This format was considered unsuitable to describe the evidence for all other sections of the guideline which include expert opinion and qualitative evidence as well as quantitative studies. All other evidence tables have a broader, more general format to deal with the variety of evidence that has been gathered. Grading Each of the recommendations in this guideline is followed by a 'strength of evidence ' grading, designated by the letters 'A', 'B', 'C', 'I' or '' immediately after the recommendation. These strength of evidence gradings indicate the amount, general quality and clinical applicability (to the guideline topic or question) of scientific evidence used as the basis for each guideline recommendation. The NZGG grading system was used for developing these 'stren gth of evidence' grades. Prior to this decision being made, Workstream 1 had used the grades applied by the NAPC UK Guideline. These grades were analysed and converted to NZGG grades, where possible. The NZGG grading system is a two -tier system with the fo llowing steps: 1. Critical appraisal of individual studies Each relevant study was critically appraised using a checklist and was assigned an overall level of evidence, indicating whether the study had met most or all of the criteria in the checklist (+), some of the criteria (~) or very few or none of the criteria ( -). Appendices New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 285 2. Weighing the body of evidence and development of graded recommendations For each clinical question, the relevant body of evidence summarised in evidence tables was considered. Decisions were made on the quality (level of evidence), quantity, consistency, applicability and clinical impact of all the studies forming the body of evidence that were relevant to each question. Recommendations were developed based on the evidence by the guideli ne writers. The recommendations were graded by the following system: Recommendations: Grade The recommendation is supported by GOOD evidence (where there are a number of studies that are valid, appli cable and clinically relevant). A The recommendation is supported by FAIR evidence (based on studies that are mostly valid, but there are some concerns about the volume, consistency, applicability and/or clinical relevance of the evidence that may cause some uncertainty, but are not likely to be overturned by other evi dence). B The recommendation is supported by EXPERT OPINION only (from external opinion, published or unpublis hed, eg, consensus guidelines). C No recommendation can be made. The evidence is insufficient (either lacking, of poor quality or confl icting, and the balance of benefits a nd harms cannot be determined). I Where a recommendation is based on the clinical and educational experiences of members of the Guideline Development Team, this is referred to as a good practice point. Good Practice Po int: Where no evidence is available, best practice recommendations are made based on the experience of the Guideline Development Team or feedback from c onsultation within New Zealand. In interpreting the grades attached to each recommendation, it is im portant to note: The strength of evidence grading does not reflect the importance of the recommendation or its direction. For example, it is possible to have A evidence that an intervention works or A evidence that it doesn 't work (and that therefore the i ntervention is not recommended). The grading of 'A' reflects the 'strength of the evidence ' that supports that recommendation. In other cases, it may not be practicable or feasible to perform rigorous scientific studies for some types of interventions or p rograms. Nevertheless, there may be universal consensus among ASD experts that such an intervention or programme is effective at producing desired outcomes. In this situation, a good practice point would recommend a certain course of action, based on conse nsus among the workstreams. Thus, the attached grading reflects the rigour of the studies providing the evidence rather than an indication of the importance of the recommendation.

A total of six (or more) items from (1), (2) and (3), with at least two from (1), and one each from (2) and (3): (1) qualitative impairment in social interaction, as manifested by at least two of the following: (a) marked impairment in the use of multiple nonverbal behaviours such as eye -to- eye gaze, facial expression, body postures, and gestures to regulate social interaction (b) failure to develop peer relationships appropriate to developmental level (c) a lack of spontaneous seeking to share enjoyment, interests, or achievements with other people (eg, by a lack of showing, bringing, or pointing out objects of interest) (d) lack of social or emotional reciprocity (2) qualitative impairments in communication as manifested by at least one of the following: (a) delay in, or total lack of, the development of spoken language (not accompanied by an attempt to compensate through alternative modes of communication such as gestures or mime) (b) in individuals with adequate speech, marked impairment in the ability to initiate or sustain a conversation with others (c) stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language (d) lack of varied, spontaneous make-believe play or social imitative play appropriate to developmental level (3) restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behaviour, interests and activities, as manifested by at least one of the following: (a) encompassing preoccupation with one or more stereotyped and restricted patterns of interest that is abnormal either in intensity or focus (b) apparently inflexible adherence to specific, non - functional routines or rituals (c) stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms (eg, hand or finger fl apping or twisting, or complex whole body movements) (d) persistent preoccupation with parts of objects B. Delays or abnormal functioning in at least one of the following areas, with onset prior to age 3 years: (1) social interaction, (2) language as used in social communication or (3) symbolic or imaginative play Appendices 298 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline C. The disturbance is not better accounted for by Rett 's Disorder or Childhood Disintegrative Disorder 299.80 Asperger 's Disorder A. Qualitative impairment in social interaction, as manifested by at least two of the following: (1) marked impairment in the use of multiple nonverbal behaviours such as eye -to-eye gaze, facial expression, body postures, and gestures to regulate social interaction (2) failure to develop peer relationships appropriate to developmental level (3) a lack of spontaneous seeking to share enjoyment, interests, or achievements with other people (eg, by a lack of showing, bringing or pointing out objects of interest to other people) (4) lack of social or emotional reciprocity B. Restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behaviour, interests, and activities, as manifested by at least one of the following: (1) encompassing preoccupation with one or more stereotyped and restricted patterns of interest that is abnormal either in intensity or focus (2) apparently inflexible adherence to specific, non functional routines or rituals (3) stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms (eg, hand or finger flapping or twisting, or complex whole -body movements) (4) persistent preoccupatio n with parts of objects C. The disturbance causes clinically significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. D. There is no clinically significant general delay in language (eg, single words used by age 2 years, com municative phrases used by age 3 years). E. There is no clinically significant delay in cognitive development or in the development of age - appropriate self -help skills, adaptive behaviour (other than in social interaction), and curiosity about the environm ent in childhood. F. Criteria are not met for another specific Pervasive Developmental Disorder or Schizophrenia. 299.80 Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (Including Atypical Autism) This category should be used when there is a sever e and pervasive impairment in the development of reciprocal social interaction associated with impairment in either verbal or nonverbal communication skills or with the presence of stereotyped behaviour, interest, and activities, but the criteria are not m et for a specific Pervasive Developmental Disorder, Schizophrenia, Schizotypal Personality Disorder, or Avoidant Personality Disorder. For example, this category includes 'atypical autism ' - presentations that do not meet the criteria for Autistic Disorder because of late age at onset, atypical symptomatology, or subthreshold symptomatology, or all of these.

American Psychiatric Association. Appendices New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 299 2. ICD-10 F84 Pervasive developmental disorders A group of disorders characterized by qualitative abnormalities in reciprocal social interactions and in patterns of communication, and by a restricted, stereotyped, repetitive repertoire of interests and activities. These qualitative abnormalities are a pervasive feature of the individual 's functioning in all situations. Use additional code, if desired, to identify any associated medical co ndition and mental retardation. F84.0 Childhood autism A type of pervasive developmental disorder that is defined by: (a) the presence of abnormal or impaired development that is manifest before the age of three years, and (b) the characteristic type of ab normal functioning in all the three areas of psychopathology: reciprocal social interaction, communication, and restricted, stereotyped, repetitive behaviour. In addition to these specific diagnostic features, a range of other nonspecific problems are comm on, such as phobias, sleeping and eating disturbances, temper tantrums, and (self - directed) aggression. Autistic disorder Infantile: autism psychosis Kanner 's syndrome Excludes: autistic psychopathy (F84.5) F84.1 Atypical autism A type of pervasive develop mental disorder that differs from childhood autism either in age of onset or in failing to fulfil all three sets of diagnostic criteria. This subcategory should be used when there is abnormal and impaired development that is present only after age three ye ars, and a lack of sufficient demonstrable abnormalities in one or two of the three areas of psychopathology required for the diagnosis of autism (namely, reciprocal social interactions, communication, and restricted, stereotyped, repetitive behaviour) in spite of characteristic abnormalities in the other area(s). Atypical autism arises most often in profoundly retarded individuals and in individuals with a severe specific developmental disorder of receptive language. Atypical childhood psychosis Mental ret ardation with autistic features Use additional code (F70 -F79), if desired, to identify mental retardation. F84.5 Asperger 's syndrome A disorder of uncertain nosological validity, characterized by the same type of qualitative abnormalities of reciprocal soc ial interaction that typify autism, together with a restricted, stereotyped, repetitive repertoire of interests and activities. It differs from autism primarily in the fact that there is no general delay or retardation in language or in cognitive developme nt. This disorder is often associated with marked clumsiness. There is a strong tendency for the abnormalities to persist into adolescence and adult life. Psychotic episodes occasionally occur in early adult life. Autistic psychopathy Schizoid disorder of childhood F84.8 Other pervasive developmental disorders F84.9 Pervasive developmental disorder, unspecified The diagnostic criteria for ICD -10 have been reprinted with permission from the World Health Organization.

Intellectual disability or global developmental delay should be consi dered as preferential diagnoses Appendices 302 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Appendix 5: The role of diagnostic tools in diagnosing ASD Autism is a behaviourally defined disorder for which no biological markers currently exist. In addition, there is controversy about diagnostic entities within the autism spectrum disorder continuum such as Asperger syndrome/disorder and pervasive developmental disorder (PDD). Scre ening and diagnosis therefore depend upon behavioural observation within conceptual frameworks that are reflected in the structure of different tools. It is evident that appropriately developed tools guide observation and history taking, allowing earlier, more reliable and repeatable assessment. A range of tools with different characteristics exist for both screening/surveillance and diagnosis. The development of new tools is ongoing. Therefore, it is recommended that tool selection be reviewed on an ongoin g basis to allow new tools with appropriate sensitivity and specificity to be incorporated into future iterations of the New Zealand ASD Guideline. Process A literature review was undertaken to address the role of diagnostic tools in diagnosing ASD. This t opic was broken down into specific questions on each identified tool as follows: 1. What evidence is there that the tool is a valid instrument for the diagnosis of ASD? 2. What population has the tool been validated on? 3. Is the tool applicable to a New Z ealand setting? Can the tool be used without modification with Mori, Pacific and Asian individuals? 4. How long does it take to administer the tool? 5. How many professionals are needed to administer the tool? 6. What is needed to make the tool available in New Zealand? Training? Qualifications required? Where can training be accessed? What is the cost of training? Ongoing costs - royalties? 7. What evidence is there that the tool leads to earlier or more accurate diagnosis? 8. How does the cost of using t he tool compare with other methods including experienced clinician assessment? A bibliography was prepared by NZHTA in April 2004 at the request of Lester Mundell, Chief Advisor, Disability Support Services, Ministry of Health. The search strategy is outli ned in the report that was submitted to the Ministry of Health. In summary, a comprehensive number of online bibliographic databases, review - and evidence -based databases, library catalogues and international government health websites were searched using a variety of search terms, together with related words, around the themes of 'differential diagnosis ', 'questionnaires ', 'sensitivity and specificity ' and 'autism '. Abstracts and/or titles (where the abstract was not available) from the resulting 327 items were scanned for relevance. Articles were selected on the basis of relevance to answering the Appendices New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 303 above questions. Articles relating to adults, pilot studies, short reports or tools that were not developed or available in English were eliminated from consider ation. During the process of selection of evidence, an important review was identified, that had analysed systematically all relevant evidence (2750 articles) published up to 1998.44 This report was the work of a multidisciplinary Consensus Panel initiated by the Child Neurology Society and the American Academy of Neurology and later expanded to include representatives of nine professional organisations, four parent organisations with liaison from the US National Institutes of Health. It was decided to accept this review as a definitive summary of all evidence before 1998. Twenty -one additional relevant studies were identified from the search from 1998 onwards. The following recommendations were developed from individual questions. 1. What evidence is there that the tool is a valid instrument for the diagnosis of ASD? Conclusions: Grade Sensitive and specific developmental screening instruments include: Ages and St ages Questionnaire (ASQ) BRIGANCE Screens Child Development Inventories (CDI) Parents ' Evaluations of Developmental Status (PEDS). A Autism -specific scr eening tools that have adequate sensitivity and specificity include: Checklist for Autism in Toddlers ( CHAT) Autism Screening Questionnaire (ASQ). B Diagnostic tools for autism that have been shown to have adequate sensitivity and specificity include the following: Gilliam Autism Rating Scale (GARS). This is a checklist, DSM -IV based, with an age range of 3-22 years, giving a global rating of autism symptomatology. Parent Interview for Autism (PIA). This is a structured interview with 118 items that takes 45 minutes to deliver. Autism Diagnostic Interview - Revised (ADI -R). This is currently one of the two best available reference points for diagnosis of ASD. It is a comprehensive structured parent interview which takes one hour to deliver, with specific training and validation procedures. Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS). This is a structured interview and observations with 15 items, designed for children > 24 months, which takes 30-45 minutes to deliver. Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule - Generic (ADOS -G). This is currently one of the two best available reference points for diagnosis. It is a semi -structured observational assessment in four modules. It gives DSM -IV and ICD -10 diagnoses with definitive cutoff scores and takes 30 to 45 minutes to deliver. B The Denver II tool cannot be recommended. B Appendices 304 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline There are several other tools under development, some of which are mentioned in the American Practice Parameter45 but which have not yet achieved wide acceptance. Note: Screening instruments are generally less expensive, less time consuming and require less t raining than diagnostic tools. 2. What population has the tool been validated on? 3. Is the tool applicable to a New Zealand setting? Can the tool be used without modification with M ori, Pacific and Asian individuals? 4. How long does it take to administe r the tool? 5. How many professionals are needed to administer the tool? 6. What is needed to make the tool available in New Zealand? Training? Qualifications required? Where can training be accessed? What is the cost of training? Ongoing costs - royalties ? No autism -specific screening or diagnostic tool has been validated in either the New Zealand or Australian settings. Although some tools reported in the English language literature have been adapted and utilised in Chinese and in Japanese populations, no reports exist of studies in Mori or Pacific populations. This represents a clear opportunity for New Zealand to do this work as a part of the internal audit of the guideline. 7. What evidence is there that the tool leads to earlier or more accurate diagn osis? Recomme ndations: Grade Experienced clinicians are usually necessary for accurate and appropriate diagnosis of autism. Clinical judgment may be aided by diagnostic guides such as DSM -IV or ICD-10 as well as assessment tools , checklists and rating sca les. B Comprehensive multidisciplinary assessment is recommended as being most important for autism diagnosis compared with other developmental disabilities. B 8. How does the cost of using the tool compare with other methods including experienced clinic ian assessment? Cost analysis was not a part of the search strategy for this literature review so no formal answer is possible. However, it is unlikely that there are any cost analyses comparing diagnostic tools with clinician assessment in the literature. Different tools have been compared with each other yielding kappa scores for agreement from as low as 0.23 to as high as 0.8. Appendices New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 305 Appendix 6: The role of cognitive assessment in diagnosing ASD Process A literature review was undertaken to address the role of cognitive assessment in diagnosing ASD. This topic was broken down into specific questions as follows: 1. Does performing a baseline cognitive assessment in individuals with ASD improve outcome? 2. Does performing a baseline cognitive assessment in individ uals diagnosed with ASD enable more effective planning of an intervention programme and more efficient use of resources? A bibliography was prepared by The Clearing House for Health Outcomes and Health Technology Assessment in March 2004 at the direction o f Lester Mundell, Chief Advisor, Disability Support Services, Ministry of Health. The search strategy is outlined in the report submitted to the Ministry of Health. In summary, a comprehensive number of online bibliographic databases, review - and evidence -based databases, library catalogues and international government health websites were searched using a variety of search terms (together with related words) around the themes of 'cognitive ', 'diagnosis ' and 'autism '. Abstracts and/or titles (where abstract s were not available) from the identified studies (n = 183) were analysed and given a preliminary grading on the basis of the likely degree of relevance in terms of capacity to answer the above questions. The selected articles are included in evidence tabl es with the following relevance grading: Highly relevant (n=18) Probably relevant (n=36) Possibly relevant (n=23) Not relevant (n=106) The 77 articles selected as being relevant were obtained through online and available library sources. Not all were able to be obtained for the first analysis. Of the above articles or publications, 15 of the Highly Relevant (83%), 19 of the Probably Relevant (53%) and 11 of the Possibly Relevant (52%) were obtained. The list and abstracts of those not obtained were peer - reviewed by a subgroup of the Guideline Development Team, and a decision was made to seek a further four articles. Eighty -one were finally subjected to analysis. The analysed articles had a number of different study designs: reviews, guidelines, cohort studie s (of groups of \"higher functioning \" autistic children who had cognitive tests at baseline and at follow -up) and studies of cognitive differences and styles in autism versus controls (either normal peers or those with intellectual or language difficulties) . Relevant cohort and case control studies were reviewed using an evidence template. Appendices 306 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Conclusions Grade There are particular patterns of skills and weaknesses on formal tests of cognition associated with autism (but none are so specific that they significa ntly contribute to the clinical diagnosis). A Specific underlying cognitive deficits are postulated to be at the core of the symptoms observed (theory of mind deficit, executive function deficit, weak central coherence). C Achievement level in formal tes ts of non -verbal cognition (ie, IQ score) and language are consistently identified as the best predictors of outcome/prognosis. A Recommendation: Grade Formal baseline cognitive and/or developmental assessment is recommended at diagnosis. B Answers to the research questions can be summarised as follows: 1. Does performing a baseline cognitive assessment in individuals with ASD improve outcome? There is no evidence for or against this, but there is good evidence it allows better prediction of prognosis. 2. Does performing a baseline cognitive assessment in individuals diagnosed with ASD enable more effective planning of an intervention programme and more efficient use of resources? There is no evidence for or against this, but extrapolation from studies supports the conclusion that better definition of learning skills and prognosis by cognitive assessment will assist planning optimal intervention. Expert supporting opinion from the studies can be summarised as follows: (a) Cognition is not part of the cli nical criteria for autism but it is an important variable that influences diagnosis, is related to associated medical disabilities (such as epilepsy ), and predicts outcome. Measures of nonverbal problem solving in \"high functioning \" individuals with autism correlate with outcome (whereas ) the severity of autistic behaviours is a poor predictor of prognosis.434 (b) It is now recognised that assessment of cognitive functioning is crucial to the differentiation of A SD from other disabilities and to the identification of concomitant impairment in a child with an ASD. Cognitive ability also has an important role in prognosis and intervention planning. An estimation of potential is necessary for the following reasons: Appendices New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 307 Functioning level, which includes cognitive and adaptive evaluation, is important for differential diagnosis and intervention planning. A diagnosis of ASD is appropriate when a child shows communicative, social or interest deficits that are inconsistent wit h overall cognitive functioning. For example, a child of 4 who is functioning at a 12 -month developmental level would not receive a diagnosis of ASD if he or she displayed communicative and play behaviours similar to that of other 12 -month -old children. It is also extremely difficult to document significant social and communicative deficits below this age level. Treatment research generally has supported the notion that response to various treatment approaches has some relation to overall cognitive function ing.436 For example, certain intensive behavioural approaches have been shown to be less successful with children at lower cognitive levels who are unlikely to develop spoken language. Degree of cognitive functi oning may indicate expected rates of progress. This, of course, is dependent upon the relative degree of certainty with which cognitive impairment can be established.41 Appendices 308 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Appendix 7: Core elements of effective tea ching of individuals with ASD In Appendix 7, the core elements of effective teaching described in 3.4 Education sector organisation and management are expanded and tables show possible barriers and ways to implement these elements in the New Zealand contex t. Considerations and barriers at two age levels (roughly equating to primary and secondary) are summarised in the accompanying text boxes. This material has been drawn from the work of Marks et al. and from the practice experience and knowledge of the Gui deline Development Team from the education workstream .229 1. Individualised supports and services This element includes incorporating a focus on the child 's strengths and weaknesses, as well as family preference s, and the child and young person preferences and interests to determine the most appropriate intensity and level of instruction to meet their individual goals. 7-12 years 13-20 years Incorporating the child 's preferences and special interests It is poss ible to include the student 's preferences and special interests into the learning objectives for teaching in almost any curriculum area in the primary area. It is particularly important that teachers consider the student 's skills and preferences when askin g students to demonstrate their learning (eg, the use of video and other technologies, rather than writing , which is often a difficulty). At this level the actual content becomes more prescribed and more difficult to adapt. Therefore, teachers should: give students options, such as courses within their interest studied by correspondence consider flexible ways for students to demonstrate their knowledge work with students to give them the social understanding to be able to interpret the achievement criteria. Individual attention to the child 's needs to determine intensity and level of instruction Provide professional learning and development for teachers so they are skilled and knowledgeable enough to make assessments to determine the student 's needs and p riorities. Interventions should use the student 's strengths and find accommodations for their weaknesses to allow them to participate as much as possible. It is essential that the student 's stress levels are monitored and that planned down time is incorpor ated into a programme where necessary. Specialists and teachers need skills in writing appropriate, specific and achievable individual educational plans that focus on the key competencies. Goals need to be carefully thought out and planned step -by-step, a nd every person who works with the student needs to understand the purpose and the steps towards attaining the goals. Students do not need a goal for every subject. The key goals can be adapted and generalised across all subject areas. At a certain point, adaptive behaviours may need to become the priority. Children and young people with ASD often suffer from fatigue. They may need to do fewer subjects than other students and have study periods in which to do their homework at school. Appendices New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 309 2. Systematic instruc tion This involves carefully planning for instruction by identifying valid educational goals, carefully outlining instructional procedures for teaching, implementing the procedures, evaluating their effectiveness and adjusting the instruction based on the evaluations. 7-12 years 13-20 years Teachers and specialists require professional learning and development to have the expertise to target meaningful skills that need to be taught and to plan and implement systematic instruction and data collection. Prog rammes need to set priorities with an emphasis on communication and social skills along with other 'pivotal' skills. It is important that all instruction is well considered and goal directed. Curriculum adaptation is usually required, but there is often a tension about who will do this. This needs to be addressed. It is likely there will be different solutions for different students. Provision may need to be made for a number of teachers to receive release for professional learning and development. The emph asis needs to be on: - the student's understanding of the aim of the task - getting step -by-step (visual) instructions - the social, communication and cognitive elements being transparent - student motivation and feedback. 3. Comprehensible and structured learnin g environments This includes strategies such as organising the instructional setting, providing a schedule of activities that is kept up to date, carefully planning and providing choice -making opportunities, providing preventive behavioural support and pro viding supports to assist with transitions, flexibility and change. 7-12 years 13-20 years Providing a comprehensible learning environment requires good planning, time to communicate with others, access to resources for making visual supports, and an unde rstanding of and empathy with the student's perspective. This provides significantly more challenge at this level as students have multiple teachers, use different rooms and have different timetables. It is important that one person takes responsibility for coordinating what is required so that everyone understands the situation and has the right information. Students with ASD require clear boundaries and expectations. It is particularly important that students have a lot of support at the beginning of eac h year to learn the routines and rules, as well as the exceptions. Appendices 310 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 4. Specific curriculum content This component describes prioritising the core difficulties for individuals with ASD in the areas of communication and social interaction, and the skills tha t are required to participate. 7-12 years 13-20 years Children with autism need to be taught skills based on an individual assessment, with consideration for the family's preferences for targeting goals. Careful consideration should be given to the functi onality of the skills, with an emphasis on skills that: are most likely to be useful for the student to control his or her environment will increase the student's independence and quality of life will increase the student's competent performance. A goal fo r all students is to communicate effectively, even if the form is non -traditional. There can be a tension in setting goals between the needs of the student and the needs of the teacher. Communication and social interaction goals are clearly part of the ke y competencies in the New Zealand Curriculum. Teachers do not always have the skills to teach these competencies to children with ASD. All specialists and teachers who work with students with ASD need to be given professional learning and development to he lp them take a long - term view of their students' needs and to be able to implement communication and social interaction teaching strategies such as contemporary ABA, augmentative communication, use of technology, PECS, pivotal response training, peer tutor ing and social stories. If students have not mastered writing and other forms of traditional communication by this age, then quality of life and social validity issues become the priority. Teachers and specialists need to work to find alternatives or accom modations that enhance participation in the student's environments. It is particularly important that teachers continue to have high hopes for the students they work with and to continue to examine what the student can do and how their interests and the sk ills they have acquired can be enhanced or used to increase their motivation and ability to participate. It is also crucial that there is continuity to any communication systems that have been established. This highlights the importance of good documentati on of the student's skills, taking the time to observe and work with the student before transitions and information about the student (in the form of a profile) being kept up to date. Appendices New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 311 5. Functional approach to problem behaviour This describes the proce ss by which the child 's problem behaviour is not merely decreased or eliminated, but is replaced with an appropriate alternative or replacement behaviour that results in the same or similar consequences (this is described in detail in section 3.2.e : Self- management skills and addressing challenging behaviour in education settings ). Primary Secondary Schools often have consequence -based behaviour management policies that can be in conflict with the functional behaviour principles and these need to be discus sed and resolved. Teachers, principals and boards of trustees need to examine their policies and discuss the potential for conflict. The principles of functional behaviour assessment are not well understood by teachers and some specialists, and professiona l learning and development is needed. 6. Family involvement Primary Secondary Schools need: policies and practices that make parents feel welcome and encourage them to participate to support parents to get the information they need to make informed decis ions to adopt and support effective home -school communication systems. Systems are needed to help parents to learn about the curriculum, service provision and cross -sector initiatives. Communication at this level tends to be less regular and often only on e of the teachers (such as the SENCO) is involved. Very few individual educational plans include all teachers. Appendices 312 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Appendix 8: Educational interventions Backgr ound The following educational programmes are currently being used within New Zealand or have an i nfluence on other programmes currently in use. The list, however, is not exhaustive. These programmes have not been extensively reviewed in this guideline. It is intended that in -depth evaluations of particular programmes will occur in the future. This mat erial has been drawn from the following references .104 137 437 Educational programmes TEACCH (Treatment and Education of Autistic and Communication - Handicapped Children) This programme comes from Division TEACCH, at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The programme was developed by Eric Schopler and his colleagues in 1972. It has a behavioural base and uses aspe cts of naturalistic approaches. TEACCH is used widely in both the United States and other parts of the world. The significant features of the programme include the use of visual information to enhance comprehension and the provision of structure and predic tability. Students are moved towards increasing independence. Many of the strategies which are commonly used in New Zealand are based on those in the TEACCH programme, for example, visual supports. This programme is intended for use with children of all ag es as well as adults. Early Intensive Behaviour Intervention (EIBI)/Intensive Behavioural Intervention (IBI) EIBI and IBI are generic titles for intensive and comprehensive behavioural programmes. The work of Ivor Lovaas at the University of California h as been a strong influence on these programmes. Goals have a strong focus on developing language, cognitive skills, self -help skills and decreasing challenging behaviours. The intervention is usually delivered on a one - to-one basis in the child 's home by p arents or a therapist for 30 to 40 hours per week. A discrete trial format is typically used, especially in the beginning stages. Skills are broken into discrete steps and successes are reinforced. Naturalistic teaching approaches This approach includes pr ogrammes such as Incidental Teaching (developed by the Walden Early Childhood Programme) and Pivotal Response Training (developed by Koegel and Koegel). These programmes were developed to increase generalisation of learning. Their theoretical base is appli ed behaviour analysis but they also draw on the parent - child interaction and developmental pragmatic literature. Activities are typically based around the child 's interests and choices. The Incidental Teaching programme includes children in classrooms with typically developing peers. Teaching is provided during regular activities. The focus is on the development of sustained engagement, functional verbal language, responsiveness to adults and peers and independence in daily living skills. Appendices New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 313 Pivotal Response T raining focuses on the underlying skills to support learning such as self -motivation, responding to multiple cues and self -management with an aim for children to participate in inclusive education settings. Instruction involves some discrete trial teaching but moves towards more naturalistic methods. Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) Developed by Lori Frost and Andy Bond, PECS is a programme to teach the person to initiate communication. Symbols, pictures, photographs or objects are used by the c hild or adult to exchange for a desired object. Emphasis is placed on the very careful use of prompts and planned generalisation to foster independent communication. The programme is highly structured and is based on the Applied Behaviour Analysis principl es of stimulus, response and reward. Denver Model The Denver Model is developmentally and behaviourally based and began as a demonstration programme at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Centre. In 1998 the centre -based programme was closed and int ervention was provided in the natural environments of the home and early childhood centres with typically developing peers. Play is used as primary vehicle for learning social, emotional, communication and cognitive skills. Techniques of functional behavio ur analysis are used to identify and teach more appropriate alternative behaviours. Learning Experiences, an Alternative Programme for Preschoolers and their Parents (LEAP) LEAP was developed as a university demonstration programme in Pennsylvania by Phi llip Strain. It has since been incorporated into the Denver school system. The programme includes typically developing children and children with autism in classrooms for 15 hours per week. The child with ASD is included in typical classroom activities and the curriculum is supplemented with an individualised programme to support the development of functional skills, play and social and language skills. Peer -mediated teaching is used particularly for the development of social skills. Both ABA and developmen tally based approaches are used. Daily Life Therapy/Higashi School The programme was developed in the Higashi Schools in Tokyo and Boston. The aims are to instil dignity and independent living skills. The curriculum places an emphasis on developing physica l strength and stamina through daily exercise. Music, art and drama are also a core part of the programme. Teaching is highly structured, intensive and focuses on group instruction. SCERTS (Social Communication Emotional Regulation Transactional Supports) The SCERTS framework was developed by research collaborators Barry Prizant, Amy Wetherby, Emily Rubin and Amy Laurent and published in 2006. It is based on a variety of well -researched methodologies. Appendices 314 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline This comprehensive multidisciplinary model addresses th e key challenges faced by children with ASD. Intervention goals focus on the development of spontaneous communication, teaching and supporting the child to regulate their emotional state and providing supports to the child, the family and the professionals working with the child (transactional supports). Teaching goals are embedded in the natural contexts and routines of the child and family. Practices from a variety of approaches are incorporated into the model including behavioural and developmental appro aches. Social stories Social stories were developed by Carol Gray. They involve written or drawn stories which explain social situations and sometimes contain suggestions for socially appropriate responses. The stories are individualised for each person an d can be used with both children and adults. Developmental Individual Difference Relationship -based model (DIR)/ 'Floortime ' This model was developed by Stanley Greenspan at the National Centre for Clinical Infant Programs in the United States. The developm entally based model has a focus on building relationships, communication and thinking as the basis for future development. The model is used with young children and has an emphasis on interactive play where an adult follows the child 's lead in activities a nd interactions. Relationship Development Intervention (RDI) The model was developed by Steven Gutstein at the Connection Centre. RDI is a developmentally based, relationship model. The aim is to increase the child 's interest and motivation in relating wit h others. Many activities and strategies are recommended which support social development. The role and style of interactions of the 'partner ' are a key element. Options Programme/Son -Rise The Options method was developed by Barry and Samahria Kaufman in t he 1980s as a means of working with their son. The aim is to develop communication and relationships as the basis for future learning. This intensive home -based programme is delivered primarily by the parents in an environment which is as distraction -free as possible. The adults follow the child 's lead and join in preferred activities. When the child is attentive, the adult expands on the activity and attempts to encourage interactions. Parents are trained to alter the manner in which they interact with the child and to become more accepting of their activities and behaviours. Parent -focused programmes Hanen 'More than Words ' 'More than Words ' is an autism -specific parent education programme developed by the Hanen Centre in Toronto, Canada. Its aim is to tea ch parents to facilitate functional communication in their young children through embedding learning in everyday activities and routines. It is based on social pragmatic developmental and behavioural principles. Parents are taught the strategies in groups. Feedback and coaching are also given to parents in their own homes through reviewing videotapes of parent -child interactions. There is an emphasis on the use of structure and visual supports to enhance the child 's learning. Appendices New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 315 EarlyBird Earlybird was devel oped by the National Autistic Society in Britain. Its aim is to support parents of children under five who have autism in the development of general management strategies and particularly with social communication and the development of appropriate behavio urs. Parents meet in group teaching sessions. They are also supported through home visits where videos of the parent interacting with his or her child are discussed. Other parent focused programmes developed by the National Autistic Society are 'Spell ' and 'Help! ' for children five years and over. Programmes based on the creative arts Music therapy Music therapy uses music in a planned and creative manner to promote good health and to address physiological, emotion, cognitive and social needs through the development of a therapeutic relationship .137 Music therapy has also been promoted as an effective treatment in facilitating communication by offering a means by which alternative communication can be established to help achieve engagement, interaction and relationships .438 At present, the evidence for the effectiveness of music therapy is unclear .438 Standardised models of a ssessment in music therapy should be considered for future development. No large scale randomised control trial involving young children with autism has been conducted. With this level of evidence, broad claims about the universal effectiveness of music therapy for all children with autism must be met with caution and tested through studies with appropriate design and methodological rigour .137 Creative arts and drama therapy Dramatherapy focuses on the healing powers of drama, movement and theatre as it integrates the mind, emotions and physical body. The therapy encourages creativity and imagination for learning, insight and growth. Dramatherapy can also support the person to learn how to manage social situations .439 At present, the evidence for the effectiveness of both creative arts and drama therapy is unclear. More research in the form of well -designed primary randomised controlled studies of creative arts and drama therapy is recommended.

Following an open tendering process, the Ministry of Education funded two groups to critically appraise t he relevant literature: (i) the New Zealand Guidelines Group (NZGG) ,441 and (ii) a consortium of New Zealand academics with expertise in ABA, led by Dr Oliver Mudford at the University of Auckland .442 These tech nical reviews, conducted independently and in parallel, were peer reviewed, subsequently revised and presented to the ASD cross -government Senior Officials Group in February 2009. Living Guideline Group process A living guideline process was set up to keep the NZ ASD Guideline current and a Living Guideline Group (LGG) was convened by NZGG to carry out this process. The first topic considered by the LGG was ABA. As the two technical reviews referred to above were based on research published to December 2007 , a review update of additional high level secondary evidence (systematic reviews) published to August 2009 was undertaken .443 This review update and the two technical reviews were considered by an independent t echnical expert, Professor Margot Prior (University of Melbourne). The LGG held a two-day meeting to consider the evidence from the two literature reviews on ABA, the update of more recently published ABA reviews, and Professor Prior 's summary comments. Additional notes Definitions of ABA and Early Intensive Behavioural Intervention (EIBI) are important for this review, and are provided in the Glossary. Appendices 322 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Readers should take note of the recommendations in the guideline particularly relevant to interventions b ased on ABA: Recommendations 3.1.5, 3.2.5.3, and 4.3.3. Legislation, standards and policies highlighted in the guideline are also relevant, including the United Nations Convention for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2008). Review of ABA evidence a nd impact on recommendations Unchanged recommendations Grade 3.2.5.2 Educational interventions should incorporate principles of positive behaviour support, particularly a focus on understanding the function of the child 's behaviour. Additional text: The u se of the term positive behaviour support in the NZ ASD guideline has caused confusion due to the implication that it might refer to a different , specific intervention package in ASD called 'Positive Behaviour Support. ' For an understanding of positive beh aviour support as a general set of professional standards and values, see discussion under section 3.2.e under \"positive behaviour supports \" of the NZ ASD guideline. Rationale: General agreement that Recommendation 3.2.5.2 and its grade are accurate and sh ould remain unchanged, but supporting text is needed to define what is meant by positive behaviour support to avoid any ambiguity. A Revised recommendations Grade 4.3.4 Behaviour management techniques should be used to intervene with problem behaviours. Changed to: 4.3.4 Behaviour management techniques should be used to intervene with problem behaviours following functional behaviour assessment. Rationale: The addition of the phrase 'following functional behaviour assessment ' at the end of the recommenda tion is supported by e vidence relating to functional behaviour assessment both in the NZ ASD guideline (section 4.3.a, and Recommendation 4.3.5 ) and by the new evidence presented to the LGG. The importance of conducting a functional analysis prior to condu cting interventions with challenging behaviour was implied in the original recommendation but needed to be made explicit. There was agreement that the grade of A does not need to change . A Appendices New Zealand A utism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 323 Revised recommendations Grade 4.3.6 Consumers of behavioural interventions should refer to recen tly published guidelines for identifying, selecting and evaluating behaviour analysts with people with ASD. Changed to: 4.3.6 Consumers of applied behaviour analysis interventions should refer to recently published guidelines for identifying, selecting and evaluating behaviour analyst services for people with ASD. Rationale: Changed behavioural to applied behaviour analysis to be more explicit about the recommendation being linked with considered ABA evidence. Note that the guidelines are those referred to in reference 292 of this guideline. The LGG d ecided no further supporting text is needed as the guideline provides a rationale a nd outlines qualifications and training issues relevant to ABA. Also d ecided to reword for clarity with the addition of 'services for '. C New recommendations Grade 4.3.5a Interventions and strategies based on applied behaviour analysis (ABA) principles should be considered for all children with ASD. Additional text: ABA does not refer to one programm e or technique. In the evidence considered by the LGG, there was little or no New Zealand -based research showing the appropriateness of ABA to the New Zealand context and population. There is a lack of knowledge about the suitability of ABA for persons wit h an Asperger Syndrome diagnosis, and for participants aged 15 years or above. Rationale: The LGG decided to use 'based on ABA principles ' to make connection with research evidence around ABA explicit as many interventions include behavioural components. The LGG decided to use the term ASD as consistent with terminology used in NZ ASD Guideline. Agreed that the phrase 'interventions and strategies ' encompasses a range of approaches, as explained in the definition of ABA offered in the Glossary . A Appendices 324 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline New recommendations Grade 4.3.5b Early intensive behavioural intervention (EIBI) should be considered as a treatment of value for young children with ASD to improve outcomes such as cognitive ability, language skills, and adaptive behaviour. Additional text: There is substantial individual variability in outcomes ranging from very positive improvements, through minor or minimal improvements, to no effects. Families need to be advised of this conditional evidence about treatment outcomes. We still cannot specify which attributes of participan ts, families, treatment methods etc., are critical to outcome, apart from findings that higher IQ and language competence in individuals at the pre -treatment stage are predictive to some extent of greater gains post treatment, and at longer follow up. Ther e is as yet insufficient research comparing high quality intensive 'other ' treatment with EIBI to allow comparative judgements of treatment effectiveness. There is a lack of knowledge about the suitability of EIBI for the diverse ethnic and cultural groups of New Zealand and for people with a diagnosis of Asperger Syndrome. Individual trajectories in progress are the norm. Research suggests substantial individual variability in outcomes, ranging from very positive improvements, through minor or minimal impr ovements, to no effects found. Regular monitoring and evaluation of intervention effectiveness is therefore crucial (refer to Recommendation s 3.1.5 and 4.3.3). Rationale: Uncertainty about the optimal intensity of hours, and who it benefits, is reflected i n the grade allocated to this recommendation. As evidence relating to spontaneous, social communication competencies is equivocal, the recommendation refers to language skills . B New good practice points Grade 4.3.11 Applied behaviour analysis (ABA) int erventions and strategies should be relevant to the child 's context and culture Rationale: The need to weave cultural sensitivity throughout the NZ ASD guideline was agreed as important at the first LGG meeting. 4.3.12 Interventions based on the princip les of ABA can be introduced before the diagnosis of ASD is confirmed in a child displaying some of the symptoms of ASD. Rationale: There was a concern about issues relating to diagnosis as some people have a delay in diagnosis which could delay effective treatment. Recommendation 3.1.1 supports this good practice point: 'Services should not wait for the diagnostic process to be completed but should be available as soon as a significant developmental need is identified. ' (Grade C) Appendices New Zealand A utism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 325 10.2 Summary of Supplem entary paper on Pharmacotherapies The full Supplementary Paper, describing the Living Guideline Group 's (LGG) modified recommendations from the first edition of guideline, and newly developed recommendations and good practice points, is available from the Ministry of Health website .13 The supporting systematic review can be downloaded from another online source .444 Preamble ASD can be associated with substantial impairment and people with ASD and/or their caregiv ers can be particularly vulnerable to trying pharmacological treatments without solid supporting evidence. It is therefore crucial that clinicians provide consumers with clear information about the limits of the evidence available, the potential for side e ffects and adverse events, and alternatives open to them. The Living Guideline Group process The Living Guideline Group considered updated evidence relating to three pharmacological interventions for people with ASD : the hormone, melatonin. The NZGG conducted a systematic review updating evidence from the NZ ASD Guideline on these three pharmacological agents .444 Any controlled study assessing effectiven ess was eligible for inclusion, as well as systematic reviews of the interventions. Assessment of the updated evidence relevant to the three pharmacological interventions resulted in a number of revised and ne w recommendations. Aripiprazole There is currently no mention of aripiprazole in the ASD Guideline. Eight studies were critically appraised in the review update: six systematic reviews and two randomised controlled trials. The LGG discussed the relative ad vantage of aripiprazole over risperidone in terms of its side effect profile, especially with respect to weight gain. It was ag reed that aripiprazole may be a potentially effective alternative to the first line atypical antipsychotic risperidone where this medication has not been effective or where significant metabolic or adverse effects have arisen, or are likely to arise. However it was noted that there has been no comparative or head - to-head study of aripiprazole with risperidone or other agents from it s class. Whil e the mechanism of action of aripiprazole is unclear, it was acknowledged that this is also the case for other antipsychotics. The LGG agreed that the evidence suggests a cautious approach to the use of aripiprazole at the present time. Lower initial and target doses are advisable for those most vulnerable to side effects , including children, and particularly in the treatment of irritability and aggression in people with PDD . Ongoing monitoring of metabolic parameters is also recommended, including weight or body mass index, pulse, blood pressure, glucose and lipid metabolism , and possibly serum prolactin. Appendices 326 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline As the possibility of aripiprazole causing tardive dyskinesia cannot be excluded, baseline and periodic testing using the Abnormal Involuntar y Movements Scale (AIMS) was highlighted . The LGG noted that aripiprazole should be initiated within the care of secondary care clinicians. The LGG advise that careful consideration, informed consent and ongoing monitoring is necessary before this medicati on is considered as a first -line treatment in people with ASD. Revised recommendations Grade 4.4.4 There is insufficient evidence to make any specific recommendation regarding atypical antipsychotic agents other than risperidone. Clinicians prescribing th ese drugs need to keep up to date with current literature. I Changed to: 4.4.4 In most circumstances risperidone should be the first medication used when indicated for significant irritability in children and young people with ASD. Aripiprazole could be u sed as a second -line treatment where individuals have demonstrated poor efficacy to risperidone or where there is concern regarding significant metabolic or adverse effects. Clinicians prescribing these drugs need to keep up to date with current literature . B Citalopram Citalopram is included in Appendix 9 of this Guideline (Table 9.1 ) as an SSRI used in NZ for people with ASD. The review update identified preliminary open -label trials of the use of citalopram , for people with ASD , two good quality systematic reviews, and a high quality multi -centre, triple blinded study of 149 children and adolescents . The LGG recognise that repetitive behaviours are not always a concern for a person with ASD, and that it is import ant to determine the interference of the behaviour with daily functioning, harm to self and others, and distress , when assessing the need for intervention. The LGG discussed w hether there may be a class effect generally with SSRIs , in view of the conclusio ns of a Cochrane review .445 However as the current NZGG review focused on the role of citalopram alone, this was outside the scope of the LGG 's guidance. The LGG concluded that the balance of evidence for benefi t and harm at a clinical level was such that citalopram could not be currently recommended for the pharmacological treatment of repetitive behaviour in children and young people with ASD. Caution was also urged in its use for established comorbid indicatio ns in this population , given the evidence of adverse events. It should be noted that the study sample upon which the new recommendations were developed were children and adolescents. Whilst the review update was not restricted in its scope to younger peopl e, unfortunately there is a lack of new research in adult populations. Caution is necessary in translating results from one age/developmental group to another, hence the specification of children and young people in the new recommendations relating to citalopram. Appendices New Zealand A utism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 327 Revised recommendations Grade 4.4.1a Citalopram cannot currently be recommended for the treatment of repetitive behaviours in children and young people with ASD. B 4.4.1b Citalopram 's use for established comorbid indications for children and youn g people (eg, anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder) should be considered with significant caution on a case -by-case basis, after full disclosure of side effects to the individual and their family and careful ongoing monitoring. C Melatonin The review up date appraised four systematic reviews, and one cross -over trial of good quality. The LGG agreed that Recommendation 4.4.7 should be strengthened in view of the updated evidence. It is important to consider the level of impairment to quality of life as a f unction of sleep problems, for the individual and their family, in deciding whether to use melatonin. There is as yet no consensus on the therapeutic dose of melatonin for children and adolescents . The studies cited have generally used a 5mg dose, however the LGG suggested that in clinical practice it is appropriate and useful to initiate with lower doses, of 1 or 2 mg. There was a suggestion that controlled release melatonin is not always practical for children with ASD , as many children with ASD are not a ble to swallow tablets or capsules whole, but it may have advantages over fast -release formulations for those children who have trouble sustaining sleep. The LGG note that the evidence has a number of limitations. The re are few controlled trials. There are no long -term investigations of melatonin, with the longest follow -up in controlled studies being one month. In one small open -label study446 extending over two years, improved sleep appeared to be maintained at 12- and 24 -month follow -up but sleep problems returned for 16 of 25 children when melatonin was discontinued. Such findings suggest that sleep difficulties can be a chronic problem requiring ongoing treatment. The benefits and side effects of longer -term treatment require further investigation under controlled conditions. This need is captured in the development of a new research recommendation. As for citalopram, the evidence base is predominantly derived from children and young people , and its applicabil ity to adults is uncertain. Given these uncertainties, the LGG recommended caution in the administration of melatonin over the longer term, and that behavioural strategies including improvements to sleep hygiene should also be attempted in parallel with me latonin . Sleep hygiene is the regulation of daily activities and environmental factors aimed at maintaining good quality sleep and daytime alertness. Strategies might include having a quiet bedroom, employing a regular sleep time schedule, and the avoidanc e of stimulants and late night recreations. Appendices 328 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Revised recommendations Grade 4.4.7 Melatonin may be useful for improving sleep in children with ASD who have impaired sleep. Changed to: 4.4.7 Melatonin can be recommended for use in children and young people w ith ASD who are experiencing significant sleep problems . B New recommendations Grade 4.4.7 a Benefits and adverse effects of longer term treatment of melatonin require further investigation . C 4.4.7 b Behavioural strategies (eg, sleep hygiene) should alw ays be used in conjunction with melatonin. C 10.3 Summary of Supplementary paper on Supported Employment The full Supplementary Paper, describing the Living Guideline Group 's (LGG) modified and newly developed recommendations and good practice points, and the supportive systematic review, is available from the Ministry of Health website .14 Preamble Supported employment are formal programmes providing ongoing support (flexible, individualised, for an indefinite t ime) to find and maintain real paid work (paid at no less than market pay rates and under standard conditions) in 'integrated ' settings alongside people without disabilities . In some conventions, minimum hours of employment may be specified (eg, at least 1 6 hours per week) or minimum periods of employment. Less comprehensive forms of assistance which do not provide ongoing on -the-job support are termed employment supports . Employment supports, and more specifically supported employment, can be offered by em ployment services as described in the guideline. Supported employment is to be distinguished from sheltered employment where people work alongside other people with disabilities in a segregated, specially tailored settings and are commonly paid below marke t-rate wages. People with ASD are often disadvantaged in the competitive job market in finding, applying for, securing and keeping real, paid jobs. Poor employment outcomes including unemployment, and under -employment, have led to the development of suppor ted employment services. These provide ongoing support (flexible, individualised, and for an indefinite time) to find and maintain real work (paid at no less than market pay ra tes and under standard conditions) in 'integrated ' settings (ie, alongside peopl e without disabilities). Appendices New Zealand A utism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 329 The Living Guideline Group process The Living Guideline Group considered a systematic review on the effectiveness of supported employment services for young people and adults (aged 16 years or over) with ASD14 which updated evidence from the NZ ASD Guideline on this topic. The appraised body of evidence consisted of eight separate studies: two systematic , largely narrative reviews, and six primary studies: four case series studies , a non -randomised experimental tri al, and a cohort study . Revised recommendations Grade 5.1.9 Known support needs of people with ASD who also have an intellectual disability should be taken into account when transitioning into any work environment. Changed to: 5.1.9 Any k nown support needs of people with ASD, including those relating to cognitive ability, should be taken into account when transitioning into any work environment . Rationale: The updated evidence indicated that all people with ASD need their support needs considered, not just those with intellectual disability. The LGG was concerned that the recommendation implied that only those with intellectual disability have any known support needs considered. The revised wording refers to any known support need s for all people with ASD but also identifies cognitive ability as one area that may need to be taken into account in assessing support needs. It is also acknowledged that some people with ASD may not have support needs requiring intervention from a suppor ted employment service. Cognitive ability was considered by the group to be the more relevant and specific term. B 5.1.10 Specialist employment services for people with ASD should be developed. Changed to: 5.1.10 Supported employment services for people w ith ASD should be developed Rationale: the term \"supported employment services \" is used to refer to the services described as specialist employment services in the ASD Guideline. C 5.1.11 Specialist Employment Services should incorporate both known featur es of best practice employment for people with an intellectual disability and ASD - specific strategies. Changed to: 5.1.11 Supported employment services should incorporate known features of best practice employment for people with an intellectual disability and ASD -specific strategies. Rationale: Minor changes were made for improved readability and consistency with other recommendations and terminology. B Appendices 330 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline Revised recommendations Grade 5.1.12 Symptoms of ASD that may have impact in the work setting (both as strengths and as needs) should be taken into account when planning transition into work, and when making choices about work and career. C Changed to: 5.1.12 Any characteristics of ASD that may have impact in the work setting (both as strengths and as needs) should be taken into accoun t when planning transition into work, when making choices about work and career and in accessing ongoing in - work support. Rationale : Changed 'symptoms ' to 'any characteristics ' in line with the positive framework the guideline takes for people with ASD and the recognition that characteristics of ASD vary widely across individuals. Also added 'in providing in - work support ' to broaden this recommendation to considering support provided at the workplace, which is a key component of successful supported employm ent services. Grade also changed from C to a B to reflect updated evidence with respect to supported employment. B 5.1.13 Specialist employment services should work with workplace supervisors to maximise success in work placements . Changed to: 5.1.13 Supported employment services should work with employers, managers and colleagues to maximise success in work placements . Rationale: Changes were made to ensure consistent terminology. The wording was changed to refer to workplace personnel more broadly and n ot just supervisors. B Note: Recommendation 5.1.8 was considered out of scope of the evidence considered and remained unchanged. In the absence of any additional evidence, good practice points 5.1.15 and 5.1.16 remain unchanged. New recommendations and Good Practice Points Grade 5.1.13 a Supported employment services are recommended and should be available for all people with ASD. Rationale : By recommending supported employment for all people with ASD, the LGG observed that the evidence supports the effica cy of supported employment compared with no supported employment or less intense forms of employment supports. However the LGG recognise that, as with many services, it will not lead to 100% success and people with ASD continue to experience inequity in em ployment. B Appendices New Zealand A utism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 331 New recommendations and Good Practice Points Grade 5.1.13 b 'Supported employment services should make available, where required: Individualised job matching based on the person 's career goals, strengths, and interests Pre-placement assessment of work tasks and work environment Promoting unders tanding of any support needs within the work environment, including training employers and colleagues in the goals, processes and benefits of supported employment services. On-the-job provisions, including training of work tasks, acclimatisation to the work environment, social integration, developing communication and interpersonal skills, and management of stress and any contextually inappropriate behaviour Job coaches with level of support is determined by need Workplace modifications Long -term support in developing natural supports (eg, upskilling managers) and, where needed, external supports (eg, follow -up, assisting with issues which impact on work). Rationale : The group specified the key characteristics of successful supported employment services iden tified in the review update. These features are recommended as being 'made available where required ' to reflect that services should reflect what is required and requested by the client with ASD. Recommendation 5.1.13. b. emphasises that the workplace and s taff need to consider how they may need to adjust to support the needs of a worker with ASD and the benefits of having a diversity of staff in the workplace. The LGG noted that the term 'inappropriate behaviour ' (Rec ommendation 5.1.13b) was used in the literature to specifically refer to behaviour deemed by the employer to be inappropriate in that particular workplace. Management can include changes made by the supported worker, co -workers and/or the workplace. Follow -up refers to the job coach checking in with the supported worker regularly via site visits and phone - calls to identify any problems and provide ongoing support. B 5.1.13 c Methodologically rigorous research is greatly needed to examine and improve the effectiveness of New Zealand -based supporte d employment services for people with ASD . Rationale : As part of the systematic review update a wide search of grey literature in New Zealand was conducted. Whilst many supported employment services were identified, no evaluations were found which met incl usion criteria. 5.1.13d New Zealand based research should consider the effectiveness of supported employment services for people of different ethnicities with ASD. Rationale : Research from one large cohort study indicated that employment rates for clien ts receiving supported employment services varied as a function of ethnicity such that rates were lower for people identifying themselves as African American .33 Ethnicity is likely to be an important factor in t he success of supported employment services in New Zealand also and worthy of future research reflecting the div ersity of the local population. Appendices 332 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 10.4 Summary of Supplementary paper on Gastrointestinal Issues The full Supplementary Paper, describing the Living Guideline Group 's (LGG) modified and newly developed recommendations and good practice points, and the supportive systematic review, is available from the Ministry of Health website .15 This document needs to be read in context of the recommendations in the ASD Guideline that all children with ASD to undergo a comprehensive health and developmental assessment. Preamble Gastrointestinal (GI) problems may be more common in ASD than in the general population. The reasons why some conditions may occur more commonly in people with ASD is not well understood .11 Whilst GI problems arising in people with ASD may have the same causes as GI problems in people without ASD , some researchers have suggested that people with autism are especi ally susceptible to gastrointestinal dysfunction. Gastrointestinal problems refer to dysfunction that is evident in clinical symptoms, usually chronic, persistent, recurrent, frequent or exces sive in nature, which do not have clear anatomic, metabolic, or pathologic process. These problems , flatulence. It should be noted that encopresis might be a symptom of constipation. The Living Guideline Group process The Living Guideline Group considered a systematic review of evidence relating to gastrointestinal (GI) problems in children and young people (aged 18 years or under) with ASD15 which updated evidence from the first edition of the NZ ASD Guideline on this topic. The apprais ed body of evidence consisted of 14 studies, including three systematic reviews, three retrospective cohort studies and eight cross -sectional behavioural studies. Appendices New Zealand A utism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 333 Revised recommendations Grade 4.6.1 When challenging behaviours are evident, people with ASD need to be assessed for co -morbid conditions such as seizures, ADHD, anxiety disorders and depression. Changed to: 4.6.1 When challenging behaviours are evident, people with ASD need to be assessed for co -morbid conditions such as seizures, ADHD, anxiety disorders, depression, and gastrointestinal problems. Rationale: Challenging behaviour may be the primary or sole symptom of gastrointestinal problems. This evidence is based on consensus expert opinion and cross -sectional studies. C Note: Recommendation 2.3.9 and 4.1.4 remain unchanged. New recommendations Grade 4.1.4a Gastrointestinal problems, specifically constipation, chronic diarrhoea, altered bowel habits, and encopresis (faecal soiling), are more common in children and young people with ASD compar ed with typically developing peers. Rationale : There was a consistent trend observed across studies indicating that gastrointestinal problems were significantly more prevalent in children and young people with ASD than in those without ASD. However, a grad e of B was given to reflect the limitations of the evidence. Limitations to study designs introduce biases to determining the prevalence of GI outcomes in individuals with ASD and without ASD, and lead to the wide variations evident in the current review. Major sources of variation between studies which impacted on prevalence estimates include: how the diagnosis of ASD in sample participants was made and confirmed how the sample and control group members were identified and recruited how gastrointestinal pr oblems were defined how gastrointestinal problems were assessed. B 4.1.4b Children and young people with ASD should have a full evaluation that includes a thorough assessment of gastrointestinal function. Some children, particularly those with social comm unication difficulties, may have atypical presentations such as increased anxiety, irritability, disordered sleep patterns, and unusual vocalisations and movements. Rationale : A thorough assessment of GI function would often consist of a dietary history, h istory of bowel function, relevant family history, physical examination of the abdomen, and, where indicated by symptoms or signs of disorder, further investigations or specialist consultation. This evidence is based on consensus expert opinion and cross -sectional studies. Recognition and evaluation of gastrointestinal problems in children and young people with ASD can be more challenging due to the communication difficulties characteristic of ASD. C Appendices 334 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 10.5 Summary of Supplementary paper on the implications of the DSM -5 for the guideline The full Supplementary Paper, describing the Living Guideline Group 's (LGG) modified and newly developed recommendations and good practice points, and the supportive systematic review, is available from the Ministry of Healt h website .16 Preamble This review describes the changes to diagnostic criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) published in the latest version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - Version 5, the DSM -518 and their rationale, critically summarises relevant empirical research, and outlines key clinical, social and research issues potentially impacted by the application of these changes. The pr imary goal was not to judge whether or not the diagnostic changes were necessarily a good idea, but to focus on whether and how the the first edition of the New Zealand ASD Guideline need ed to change to reflect them. The Living Guideline Group process The Living Guideline Group considered a review of evidence16 relating to changes in the diagnostic criteria for ASD published in the DSM -5,18 and the implications for the guideline. Key changes in DSM -5 Key changes in the diagnostic classification of ASD in the DSM -5 include: The previous version of the manual distinguished conditions as separate subtypes including autistic disorder, Asperger 's disorder (Asperger syndrome) , and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD -NOS). However the new version (DSM -5) subsumes these conditions under a single diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) with the subtypes no longer specified. Criteria previously organi sed into three symptom domains are now presented under two domains: (1) social communication and social interaction (2) restricted, repetitive patterns of behaviour, interests, or activities. The number of symptoms within the domains has been streamlined f rom 12 to 7. For a diagnosis of ASD, all 3 criteria on the social -communication domain must be present and 2 of 4 criteria in the restricted interests domain must be met. Notably, behaviours do not have to be currently present ; they may be present only in history (eg, observed in childhood). Sensory behaviours (hypo - and hyper -reactivity to sensory input or unusual interest in sensory aspects of the environment), absent from DSM -IV21 criteria for ASD, are now included under the restricted, repetitive patterns of behaviours domain. Appendices New Zealand A utism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 335 Dimensional elements have been introduced to reflect how much a condition affects an individual (its \"severity \" level) in terms of broadly indicating how much support a person needs and in what areas of function. Clinical \"specifiers \" have been introduced to help describe accompanying difficulties and need for supports, including their intellectual ability, language impairment, and co-occuring medical conditions. Delays in language will affect an individual 's clinical presentation but is not a defining diagnostic autism spectrum criterion. The requirement that symptoms be evident before the age of 36 months has been removed and replaced with a more open definition of \"present in the early developmental period \". A new ASD criterion requires that the constellation of symptoms together must \"cause clinically significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of current functioning \". Another new ASD criterion requires tha t these disturbances are not explained by alternative diagnoses of intellectual disability or global developmental delay. Diagnosis of comorbidities including attention -deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), stereotyped movement disorder and psychiatric co nditions such as anxiety states and schizophrenia are now permitted with ASD. A new condition called \"social communication (pragmatic) disorder \" (SCD) has been included. This applies where someone exhibits the social communication and interaction aspects o f an ASD diagnosis, but does not show restricted, repetitive patterns of behaviour, interests or activities. The DSM -5 advises that people who already have a definitive diagnosis of Autistic disorder, Asperger 's disorder (Asperger syndrome) or PDD -NOS will (continue to) retain a diagnosis of ASD . Response to the DSM -5 changes The Living Guideline Group echo es the UK 's National Autistic Society (NAS)447 in finding the DSM -5 revised diagnostic criteria helpful, be ing clearer and simpler than the previous DSM -IV criteria, and in welcoming the development of dimensional measures of severity, the inclusion of sensory behaviours, and the emphasis on identifying the full range of difficulties that an individual may expe rience as well as other relevant factors. The LGG also observe that whilst Asperger syndrome may no longer be a distinct diagnostic entity diagnosed under the DSM -5, the concept retains clinical utility in terms of family understanding, self-identity, and as a tool for guiding educational and behavioural interventions and informing services and supports. The Living Guideline Group recognise that people who identify closely with the term Asperger syndrome may continue to use it in everyday language. And so, regardless of the changes to the classification of ASD in what is fundamentally a diagnosticians ' clinical manual, individuals may choose to self -refer using their own terms of belonging to a culture that transcends psychiatric diagnosis. Appendices 336 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline The first edition of the guideline was prescient in recognising the movement toward considering autism as a spectrum condition and in the guideline 's title and frequently throughout the text and recommendations, the umbrella term of Autism Spectrum Disorder has been used. Nevertheless, when the original guideline was written the DSM -IV-TR manual was current and the terms Asperger syndrome and PDD -NOS were used in research. The Living Guideline Group advise that, in view of the DSM -5, where these terms are used in the guidel ine they should be read as refer ring to ASD. Revision of guideline recommendations Good P ractice Points Grade 1.3.5 Diagnosis of ASD in itself may be sufficient. Attempts to delineate ASD from Asperger syndrome may not be valid and are not necessary. Dele ted. Rationale: This Good Practice Point was removed as considered redundant in view of DSM -5 criteria where DSM -IV specified subtypes including autism and Asperger syndrome are subsumed under the one condition of autism spectrum disorder . Revised reco mmendations Grade 1.2.6 Test users should ensure that they are aware of the validity, reliability and appropriateness of tests wh en assessing people with ASD and take these limitations into account when forming opinions and reporting results Unchanged. Rationale: Some diagnostic tools in use are based on DSM -IV21 criteria, however tools based on DSM -5 are currently in development. It remains the case that the reliability, validity and appropriateness of assessme nt tools need to be considered when assessing ASD. C 1.2.5 Standardised autism, Asperger syndrome and ASD assessment interviews and schedules should be used. Change d to: 1.2.5 Standardised ASD assessment interviews and schedules should be used. Rationale : Words \"autism, Asperger syndrome and \" removed. Under DSM -5, DSM -IV21 specified subtypes including autism and Asperger syndrome are subsumed under the one condition of ASD . B B Appendices New Zealand A utism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 337 Revised reco mmendations Grade 1.2.7 The assessment of intelle ctual, adaptive and cognitive skills associated with autism, Asperger syndrome and ASD should be seriously considered and, where possible and appropriate, formally assessed. Changed to: 1.2.7 The intellectual, adaptive and cognitive skills associated with ASD should be seriously considered and, where possible and appropriate, formally assessed . Rationale : The words \"assessment of \" were removed as redundant in the sentence structure. Words \"autism, Asperger syndrome and \" removed. Under DSM -5, DSM - IV specifie d subtypes including autism and Asperger syndrome are subsumed under the one condition of ASD . B B 6.2 Education and training of local health care professionals in the administration of standardised autism, Asperger syndrome and ASD assessment intervie ws and schedules should be provided.

Changed to : Professionals administering standardised ASD assessment tools should be provi ded with appropriate training. When reporting the results of ASD -specific tests, caution shou ld be exercised as New Zealand norms have not yet been established. Rationale : Wording of the first sentence was altered to improve readability and to recognise th at not only \"local health care professionals \" may administer assessment tools. Words \"autism, Asperger syndrome and \" removed. Under DSM -5, DSM -IV specified subtypes including autism and Asperger syndrome are subsumed under the one condition of autism spect rum disorder. C C 6.3 Norms should be developed for autism, Asperger syndrome and ASD assessment tools specifically for the New Zealand population Changed to: 6.3 Norms should be developed for ASD assessment tools specifically for the New Zealand popu lation.

C New Good Practice Points Grade 1.2.14 Assessment should consid er the influence of diversity such as sense of self, ethnicity, culture, gender, sexuality, religion, socio -economic status, and geographic factors. Rationale: Good practice point was proposed to reflect evidence in the review relating to how cultural, soc ial, demographic and economic factors have been shown to influence access to and process of diagnostic classification under DSM -IV.21 Appendices 338 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline New Good Practice Points Grade 1.2.15 Assessment of an individual should elicit and consider whether that person requires, would value, and would benefit from a diagnosis of ASD. Additional text: In addition, the LGG wanted it recognised that decisions about assessment should consider whether a person wants or sees the ne ed for a clinical diagnosis. 10.6 Summary of Supplementary paper on social skills groups for young people and adults The full Supplementary Paper, describing the Living Guideline Group 's (LGG) modified and newly developed recommendations and good practice points, and the supportive systemat ic review, is available from the Ministry of Health website .17 Preamble Social skills groups refer to interventions which provide structured sessions in social skills training in small groups of people of a simi lar age group and with similar social problems. A session typically includes teaching a specific skill, demonstration of the skill through role playing, practice of the skill, and individualised feedback. Groups meet on a regular basis, typically for 1 -2 hours, for several weeks, facilitated by at least one trained instructor/ therapist. Parents are typically provided training in concurrent sessions to encourage their children to practice newly learned skills at home. In considering the evidence identified and synthesised in the systematic review update, the LGG acknowledge the challenges and limitations of evaluating behavioural interventions. In particular, the LGG are aware that lack of consistency within and between outcomes measured across different stu dies does not necessary reflect a flawed evidence base. Rather, the variability reflects the complex, dynamic and multidimensional nature of social competence indicators and th e richness of the research data. It should be noted that social skills groups ar e distinguished from peer mediated strategies in the guideline (endorsed in Recommendation 3.2.2.4) with respect to the source of instruction. Peer mediated approaches are based around interactions with trained, typically developing peers whereas social sk ills groups involve instruction from adult instructors/therapists. The Living Guideline Group process The Living Guideline Group considered a systematic review of evidence relating to social skills groups in children and young people (6 -21 years) with ASD15 which updated evidence from the NZ ASD Guideline on this topic. Eligible studies wer e randomised controlled trials of group -based social skills training; that is, a series of group -based training sessions whic h focus on developing social skills for young people with ASD. Comparison groups were wait list controls, or those receiving usual care and/or no treatment. Eligible outcomes included social competence, social communication, emotion recognition, quality of social interaction/play, problem behaviour, and observed specific behaviours; quality of life (including anxiety and depression); and programme knowledge. Appendices New Zealand A utism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 339 Eligible designs were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which compare (at least 10) children and y oung people with ASD randomised to receive a social skills group intervention with those randomised to wait list control, usual care or no intervention . The appraised body of evidence con sisted of 12 studies, including two systematic reviews, and 10 RCTs. Revised recommendations Revised recommendations Grade 4.2.1 The development of social skills and community support groups for young people and adults should be undertaken to minimise and avoid problems. Unchanged. Rationale: This Recommendation was unchan ged. It is broader in scope than the current research which focused on structured and facilitated social skills groups. C New recommendations and Good Practice Points New recommendations and Good Practice Points Grade 4.2.1a Facilitated and structured so cial skills groups should be considered for high functioning children and young people with ASD . Additional text : Social skills groups as refe rred to in this new recommendation are defined as interventions which provide structured sessions in social skills training in small groups of people of a similar age group and with similar social problems. A session typically includes teaching a specific skill, demonstration of the skill through role playing, practice of the skill, and individualised feedback. Groups meet on a regular basis, typically for 1 -2 hours, for several weeks, facilitated by at least one trained instructor/therapist. Parents are typically provided training in concurrent sessions. Whilst it is acknowledged that the term \"high functioning \" is no t universally favoured in the context of autism, in this recommendation the term \"high functioning \" is used to refer to people with higher cognitive functioning either as established by intelligence tests (generally indicated by full IQ scores of 70 or above), or through the diagnosis of \"high -functioning autism \" or Asperger syndrome (under DSM -IV criteria). There is insufficient evidence relating to people who are not verbally fluent, people who use augmentative and alternative communication (AAC), people with intellectual disability, adults, and pre -schoolers. It is not currently possible to offer clear conclusions about the necessary content, approach and intensity of social skills groups. Further research is needed, particularly considering social skills interventions conducted and evaluated in naturalistic settings, and into the generalisation and maintenance of acquired social compete nce and other salient outcomes. There is insufficient evidence relating to the relative benefits of social skills groups versus other group -based interventions, or individu al social skills interventions. B Appendices 340 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline New recommendations and Good Practice Points Grade Rationale : Whilst there is overall evidence of benefit from participating in social skills groups, the recommendation is graded B to reflect the variability in programme content, approach and intensity, large range of outcome variables and measures, and uncertainty about the applicability and generalisability to the New Zealand context. Participants in the included studies were required to demonstrate a level of cognitive and/or verbal ability above a stated threshold as determined from standardised IQ tests (generally indicated by full IQ scores of 70 or above). 4.2.1b Social skills groups approaches in New Zealand need to be responsive to the cultural and linguistic div ersity of the group participants. Rationale : Further research is needed to explore the applicability and effectiveness of social skills groups in the New Zealand context. 4.2.1c Decisions about participating in social skills groups should be guided by whether a person with ASD values it, and whether they are expected to benefit from it. Rationale : Interest in participating in a social skills group was a common inclusion criteria for participants in the research trials appraised. Other factors such as th e ability to attend, and the ability to participate in the group, may also be considered by the person with ASD, their family, and the programme instructors, in deciding whether a social skills group is suitable. It is noted that the new Recommendation (4. 2.1a) and Good Practice Points (4.2.1b and 4.2.1c) could equally sit in Chapter 3, Section 3.2 of the NZ ASD Guideline , after Recommendation 3.2.2.4. 10.7 Summary of Supplementary paper on cognitive behaviour therapy for adults The full Supplementary Pa per, describing the Living Guideline Group 's (LGG) modified and newly developed recommendations and good practice points, and the supportive systematic review, is available from the Ministry of Health website .18 Preamble Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), also known as cognitive behavioural therapy, is a structured, goal -directed form of psychotherapy directed toward solving current problems by modifying unrealistic and unhelpful thinking and behaviour. CBT aims to help individuals notice and understand the relationship between their thoughts, behaviours and emotions and to develop more helpful ways of thinking about, coping with, and responding to challenging situations. CBT techniques include questioning and tes ting assumptions or habits of thought that might be unhelpful and unrealistic, gradually facing activities which may have been avoided, and trying out new ways of behaving and reacting. Relaxation and distraction techniques are also commonly included. Appendices New Zealand A utism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 341 In addition to traditional cognitive and behavioural techniques, so -called \"third wave CBT\" approaches incorporate mindfulness, meditation, metacognitive therapy, compassion focused therapy, and \"acceptance and commitment\" therapies. These place less focus on addressing unhelpful cognitions, and more on teach ing people to accept phenomena (bodily sensations, thoughts, feelings, sounds) as they appear , to counter avoidance strategies, and reduce anxiety . Cognitive behaviour therapy tends to be short -term and tim e-limited (often fewer than 16 sessions). Whilst traditionally CBT has been delivered individually on a one -to-one basis, it is also being delivered in group -based formats, and through guided self -help using web -based resources . The l iving Guideline Group process The Living Guideline Group considered a systematic review of evidence relating to the effectiveness of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for improving social interaction, communication, emotional and mental health outcomes of adults (aged 18 years and over) with autism spectrum disorder18 which updated evidence from the NZ ASD Guideline on this topic. The review also aimed to describe recommended adaptions to CBT that have been employed with adults on the autism spectrum . Eligible designs were randomised controlled trials (RCT s), pseudo -experimental designs, single case experimental designs, case series, and case studies, where they reported at least one pre - and post -treatment relevant outcome measure . Primary outcomes included self- report, informant -report and/or clinician/assessor -report ed measures of any outcome relevant to social interaction, communication skills, emotional and mental health, gen eral well-being, adjustment and quality of life. The appr aised body of evidence consisted of 1 3 studies, including three recently published systematic reviews, three randomised controlled trials, two pseudo -randomised and one non - randomised experimental studies, and four small -sampled observational studies. Revi sed recommendations Revised recommendations Grade 4.3.9 Cognitive behaviour therapy should be considered as a suitable treatment for many behavioural, emotional and mental health difficulties . Unchanged. Rationale: Recommendation 4.3.9 related to evidence for people with ASD of all ages. As the effectiveness of CBT for children and young people was out of scope and therefore excluded from the current review update, the Recommendation was left unchanged. To incorporate the updated evidence, a new Recommenda tion 4.3.9a was developed relating specifically to adults . C 4.3.10 Cognitive behaviour therapists should adapt their techniques to take into account the characteristics of people with ASD . Unchanged. C Appendices 342 New Zealand Autism Spectrum Disorder Guideline New recommendations and Good Practice Points New re commendations and Good Practice Points Grade 4.3.9 a Broadly defined cognitive behaviour therapy, adapted for ASD, may assist adults with mental health conditions . Additional text : CBT is broadly defined as incorporating traditional cognitive and behaviour al techniques in addition to so -called \"third wave CBT\" approaches which incorporate mindfulness, meditation, metacognitive therapy, compassion focused therapy, and \"acceptance and commitment\" (ACT) therapies. These place less focus on addressing unhelpfu l cognitions, and more on teaching people to accept phenomena (bodily sensations, thoughts, feelings, sounds) as they appear, to counter avoidance strategies, and reduce anxiety. It should be noted that the evidence base considered in developing this recom mendation related to adults with ASD who do not have an intellectual disability . Rationale : The LGG expressed some concern about the term \"suitable\" in the original Recommendation 4.3.9 as they considered that CBT that has not been modified for people on t he autism spectrum may be unsuitable. Therefore the recommendation included a specification that CBT be adapted for ASD. It was challenging to grade this new recommendation given the inconsistency of response of CBT, and the methodological limitations of the research. C 4.3.9 b Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) has been designed and evaluated predominantly for people without ASD. More research is recommended to further develop and evaluate effective cognitive behaviour therapies and their necessary adaptat ions for people on the spectrum as well as appropriate and valid outcome measures for research in this field . As it seems likely that some individuals receiving CBT benefit and some do not, future research should also investigate what personal characterist ics and aspects of therapy best predict treatment effectiveness . Additional text: The heterogeneity and complexity of the current evidence base makes it difficult to draw general conclusions about cognitive behaviour therapy's (CBT) effectiveness. The find ings for similar outcomes varied across as well as within studies. There was wide variability in the evidence with respect to programme content, components and intensity; whether the therapy was delivered in groups or individually; the outcomes measures employed for assessing similar outcomes; and whether there were control groups, and if these were offered active interventions including cognitive behavioural components themselves . It was not possible to qualitatively discern a pattern as to what are the mediators and moderators of treatment effectiveness with respect to these factors . Appendices New Zealand A utism Spectrum Disorder Guideline 343 New re commendations and Good Practice Points Grade 4.3.10a The f ollowing adaptations to cognitive behaviour therapy are recommended : Use a structured approach and minimise anxiety about the therapeutic process by being expl icit about roles, times, goals and techniques. Extend the number of sessions and time provided to conduct tasks to accommodate slower information -processing and the mental demands of the therapeutic process. Be flexible about the length of each session and offer breaks to allow for cognitive and motivational deficits. Provide psycho -education about autism, emotions, and mental health challenges relevant to the client. Concentrate on well defined and specific difficulties as the starting point for interventi on, with less emphasis on changing client's cognitions. Be more active and directive in therapy, where appropriate, including giving suggestions, information, and immediate and specific feedback on performance. Examine the rationale and evidence for inacc urate, automatic thoughts and collaboratively develop alternative interpretations, concrete strategies and courses of action. Teach explicit rules and their appropriate context, including the use of verbal, nonverbal and paralinguis tic cues to a social sit uation. Incorporate specific behavioural techniques where appropriate, such as relaxation strategies, meditation, mindfulness, thought stopping or systematic desensitisation. Communicate visually (eg, using worksheets, images, diagrams, 'tool boxes', comic strip conversations, video -taped vignettes, peer -modelling, and working together on a computer). Avoid ambiguity through minimising the use of colloquialisms, abstract concepts and metaphor. Use specific and concrete analogies rela table to the client's co ncerns. Incorporate participants' interests in terms of content and modes of content delivery to enhance engagement. Involve a support person , such as a family member, partner, carer or key worker (i f the person with autism agrees) as a co -therapist to imp rove generalisation of skills learned within sessions. "}
