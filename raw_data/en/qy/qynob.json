I'm here to help determine what's wrong and how to best help. If a medicine is helpful, I'm trained to prescribe it. In most situations, medicine, alone, is not enough to help people disentangle themselves from the feelings, thoughts, or behaviors that have interfered with their functioning or caused such discomfort. Problematic patterns have developed over a long time, but for 'good reasons'. Until we know why, we're unlikely to change them.

It has proven ineffective and has divided the practice of medicine into specialties, forgetting that the body functions in a constant state of homeostasis- all systems reliant on each other to function optimally. I believe that treating the underlying issue, down to the molecular basis, is what needs to be addressed in order to treat and eventually heal the disease. Unfortunately diseases have been categorized into separate entities when there is a common thread that is shared between them. My goal is to heal the mind & body as whole through integrative medicine.

In treatment situations, I attempt to elaborate and elucidate the way a person thinks in order to help that person see the connections between their thinking and behavior, and what troubles that person. The symptoms which a person presents with help to lead us in the direction of discovering what the underlying problem is. It is a truism that one needs to know a problem is present in order to be able to do something about it.

How does treatment for ADHD work? Effective treatment for ADHD often consists of medication, behavioral therapy, and lifestyle changes. Stimulant medications such as Adderall and Ritalin work by altering levels of neurotransmitters in the brain; higher levels of dopamine and norepinephrine are known to improve attention and focus. Therapy works by helping people with ADHD understand the condition, discuss their areas of difficulty, and develop behavioral strategies to manage their symptoms. In some cases, modifying one's diet and exercise can also help improve symptoms. Are there specific medications for ADHD? Medications to treat ADHD are generally stimulants, the most common are Adderall and Ritalin. There are two categories of used as an alternative if stimulants aren't effective or viable for a particular patient. How long does treatment for ADHD take?

It may take time to identify the right medication and dosage, but the medication itself is fast-acting. In terms of therapy, it takes time to develop skills and put them into practice, but you will likely see improvements within a few weeks or months. About Psychiatrists, meds and Psychiatric Nurses.
