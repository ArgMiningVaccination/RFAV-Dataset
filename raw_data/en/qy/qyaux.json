Binga The S KEPTICAL INQUIRER is the official journal of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, an international organization.Editor's Note \"...promotes science and scientific inquiry, critical thinking, science education, and the use of reason in examining important issues.\"COMMITTEE FOR SKEPTICAL INQUIRYThe Scourge of Cancer Idoubt there are many families not affected in some way by the subject of our cover article\u2014cancer. In \"The War on Cancer: A Progress Report for Skeptics,\" Dr.Reynold Spector, clinical professor at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New Jersey, gives a sober assessment of the progress\u2014in some cases, the lack ofprogress\u2014we've seen against this terrible set of diseases. Some notable gains have beenmade, for which we are all grateful. With other cancers, advances are difficult to dis-cern. I think it is a valuable article\u2014evidence-based, nuanced, calm, and reasoned. Several years back, The New York Times ran a front-page article after a cancer-research meeting reporting that cancer was close to becoming a chronic, treatable disease. Thatsounded wonderful. Then in three noteworthy 2009 articles, respected New York Times medical writer Gina Kolata delved deeply into the statistics and found much less reasonfor such optimism. In his article this issue, Spector, using tables and charts of data, findssome recent progress but overall reinforces Kolata's view. Biomedical scientists, cancer researchers, oncologists, surgeons, pharmaceutical researchers, nurses, and techs have fought valiantly to diminish the suffering cancerbrings. I have deep admiration for them. I myself am alive due to their efforts. Asfriends and colleagues know, starting in 1999 I battled colorectal cancer (treated firstby surgery, then chemo and radiation). It returned in late 2003 as metastasized colorectal cancer in the lung. My prognosis was poor. But with two lung surgeries,more chemotherapy and anti-inflammatory drugs, plus the then brand new (fiveweeks after FDA approval) genetically engineered drug Avastin (subject of a criticalsection in Spector's article), I have been tumor free (one can never say cancer free) andfit since late 2005. What part of that combination of treatments was most responsi-ble, I can't say. But I am grateful. And very fortunate. But cancer has a way of forcing its way on us. As this issue neared layout, our daughter, still helping raise three children, was struck by another form of invasive can-cer, and it has apparently also entered the lymph nodes. She had major surgery fourdays ago as I write, and she now faces chemo, radiation, and a formidable battle.Families encounter such diagnoses every day, everywhere. What a scourge is cancer! One cancer physician with whom I shared our cover article, a longtime CSI fellow, called it very good but said we should note that cancer deaths increase with longevity(more chance to develop cancer) and as the proportion of cardiovascular/stroke deathsdecrease. He also noted that the questions, conflicts, biases, stats, and cost-benefit issuesDr. Spector raises are on the minds of oncologists, other physicians, insurance reviewers(also physicians), and economists all the time. They struggle with these matters daily. I invited one such oncologist to comment at the end of the article. We welcome the per-spectives and input of other cancer researchers, oncologists, medical policymakers, andphysicians\u2014and of course patients and readers. Perhaps this can be the beginning of aconstructive forum. * * * Other articles in this issue range over topics more typical for us\u2014alternative practi-tioners' strange assertions, parapsychologists' rationalizations, creationists' latest tac-tics, fact and folklore about the so-called Coral Castle in Flordia, and an interviewwith actor/writer/skeptic Stephen Fry. \u2014K ENDRICK FRAZIERSI Jan Feb 2010 pgs 11/12/09 10:15 AM Page 4SKEPTICAL INQUIRER January / February 2010 5NEWS AND COMMENT Notes on the News: Deception, Notoriety, and Credulity in Our Infotainment Age KENDRICK FRAZIER The media frenzy about a homemade bal- loon launch supposedly carrying a FortCollins, Colorado, family's six-year-oldson into the sky and the resulting revela-tion that it was (surprise!) all a hoax illus-trate what has gone wrong with moderntelevision infotainment. How such a triv-ial event could have become a worldwidemedia extravaganza tells us a lotabout the symbiotic relationshipbetween television and the de-ceivers, prevaricators, and celeb-rity-seekers among us. The real-ity show mentality has so per-meated culture that truth and\"real\" reality too often take a sec-ondary, at best, position.Television loves such stuff\u2014itjust can't seem to resist\u2014andTV stations and networksincreasingly fall victim to pranksand hoaxes that play to that fact. Such a flimsy balloon could- n't have carried much of any- thing, let alone a thirty-seven-pound boy, yet there it was,shown on live TV (in footagethat was repeated endlessly over the fol-lowing days). Suspicions did arise ratherquickly when it turned out RichardHeene, the boy's father, had called a localtelevision station before calling 911. Andthe red flags really went up when it wasreported that Heene and his family hadalready appeared on the ABC realityshow Wife Swap. Then (surprise, sur- prise!) it was revealed that the incidentwas all a hoax concocted to land anotherreality TV show for the family. A Denverassociate of Heene told authoritiesHeene had told him earlier he was plan-ning a media stunt to shop a proposedreality series billed as \"Mythbusters-meet-mad scientist.\" It called for release of aflying-saucer-shaped balloon to gainattention for the Heene family, the pro-posed show, and UFOs. Most likely none of this would have occurred if not for the way human venality is encouraged by the new genreof television shows that seek sensationand blur all the lines between fictionand reality. In fact, as I write, investiga-tors are examining the possibility thatother conspirators might include amedia outlet, described by a LarimerCounty deputy sheriff as one that blurs \"the line between entertainment and news,\" which had supposedly agreed topay money to the Heenes regarding theballoon incident. Whether or not theproposed reality show has been calledoff (as some reports indicated), orwhether threatened legal charges are infact pursued to the end, the Heenesachieved new levels of celebrity andnotoriety. These days, that combinationis a bankable commodity. With the com-plicity of any of the nearly endless arrayof cable TV outlets seeking something tofill airtime, we should not be surprised ifthe family is still able to cash in. * * * The bizarreness quotient ratcheted upeven more when a connection toanother crazy current of contemporarypseudoscience surfaced. A lawyer for Heene's Denver associ- ate revealed that \"Heene believes theworld is going to end in 2012. Becauseof that, he wanted to make moneyquickly, become rich enough to build abunker or something underground,where he can be safe from the sunexploding.\" * * * An almost amusing sidelight inthe media coverage was ABCGood Morning America 's October 19 guest to comment about theballoon-hoax incident. The guestwas Clifford Irving, himself thepromulgator of one of themost widely known publicityhoaxes ever engineered. Irvinghoaxed his publisher McG raw- Hill and the American public inthe early 1970s by asserting unre-servedly that reclusive, idiosyn- cratic industrialist HowardHughes had given Irving exclu- sive rights to his biography.None of it was true. Irvingserved time in prison for that hoax (which became the subject of apretty good 2007 film starring RichardGere as Irving). As for the Heenes,Irving predictably tried to minimize thedeleterious effects of their balloon hoax,saying it provided entertainment to thepublic and \"nobody got hurt.\" The timeand expense local agencies spent search-ing for the boy and dealing with the mat-ter don't count, apparently. Irving, also Richard Heene speaks with media in front of his home in Fort Collins, Colorado, on Saturday, October 17, 2009.

The thriving symbio-sis between television and tainted celebri-ties was never so starkly illustrated. * * * With widespread concerns about theH1N1 virus and the availability of vacci-nations against it this flu season, it is notsurprising that flu vaccine scams haveemerged. They include an ultraviolet lightthat will \"destroy swine flu virus,\" a dietarysupplement claiming to be \"more effectivethan a swine flu shot,\" pills, filters, andhundreds of other bogus swine flu deter- rents and cures. The Food and DrugAdministration issued an advisory tellingconsumers to use \"extreme care\" whenpurchasing online products that claim todiagnose, treat, or prevent the H1N1virus. It sent warnings to eighty Internetpurveyors of such products. \"It's veryimportant that consumers know theseproducts can be deceptive and saidthe deputy director of FDA's Office . . and take advantage of peoplewho are fearful.\" * * * I doubt I was the only one amused thispast summer by some Washington com-mentators' belated shock that there arepeople out there willing to believe any-thing, no matter how outlandish. I refer toreaction to the \"birthers\" movement, theloonies who maintain against all evidence that President Barack Obama was notreally born in the United States and there-fore can't be president. The fact thatObama was born in 1961 in Hawaii (partof the United States, last we checked) hasbeen repeatedly attested to. But the claimsand scenarios continue to be advanced,and believed, by many. To Washington's shocked columnists, I say welcome to our world\u2014the universeof unbelievable-yet-still-believed conspir-acy theories and willing self-deception andgullibility that we skeptics deal with everyday and have been investigating andexposing for decades. Claims of psychicpowers, unknown-to-science energy forcesthat affect healing, imaginary cities on themoon, assertions that evolution can't betrue and Earth is only 6,000 years old\u2014allthis is our daily stock-in-trade. So whenthe same kind of nonsense invades politi-cal discourse, who should really be sur-prised? But it presents to political writersthe same kind of dilemmas we have always Fans of Bigfoot, Ogopogo, the chupa- cabra, and other \"mystery creatures\" a place absentia. After years ofsearching, cryptozoologist Loren Cole-man finally found a permanent place forhis large collection of monster-relatedartifacts and ephemera. On November1, 2009, the International Crypto-zoology Museum opened in downtownPortland, Maine. The centerpiece of thecollection is an eight-foot, four-hun-dred-pound Bigfoot created by aWisconsin artist, and the museumincludes hundreds of monster-relatedtoys and souvenirs from around theworld: artifacts, sculptures and art, afull-scale coelacanth fish model, overone hundred casts of (alleged) Bigfootprints, jackalopes, and much more. Themuseum is located in the Arts District at661 Congress Street. Hours of opera-tion are 11 AMto 7 PMT uesday through Saturday and noon to 5 PMSunday. Admission is $5, and well-behavedskeptics are welcome. \u2014Benjamin Radford Benjamin Radford is a writer and inves-tigator with the Committee for SkepticalInquiry.

The next morn-ing he discovered a dead animal unlikeany he'd ever seen\u2014a beast many wouldcome to call a chupacabra (the mysteri-ous vampiric animal of Hispanic folk-lore). The creature weighed about eightypounds and resembled a coyote or dog,but its front legs were a few incheslonger than those of most coyotes, and itwas almost completely hairless. The carcass was taken to local taxider- mist Jerry Ayer, who agreed to stuff thebeast. \"I don't know what it is,\" Ayer toldme in an interview. \"It's very coyote-like,though. It resembles the shape of the coy-ote, it's got canine teeth, it's got the basicskeletal structure of a coyote . . . but I don'tnecessarily believe it's just a coyote with abad case of mange.\" Ayer doesn't think it's the bloodsucking beast either: \"I don't believe in chu-pacabras,\" Ayer said emphatically. \"I don'tbelieve in any mythical beasts whatsoever.We labeled it that because everyone elsewas calling it that.\" Though Ayer does notbelieve in the chupacabra, he soon foundthat many others do. News of the findbroke out just before Labor Day, and the taxidermy school where Ayer worksstarted to receive up to one hundred callsa day from people asking about the chu-pacabra. He fielded interview requestsfrom CNN, Good Morning America , and dozens of other media sources around theworld. Ayer soon tired of the press blitzand sold the animal to John Adolfi, a realestate agent and part-time museum cura-tor in New York state for an undisclosedsum (likely near $10,000). The story of the Blanco chupacabra took an even stranger twist when Adolfiexhibited the beast as an example ofthe fallibility of science. His LostWorld Museum (named after Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's 1912 novel in whichdinosaurs still exist) features items andartifacts that he believes prove that scien-tists don't have all the answers. A cre-ationist, Adolfi believes that Earth wascreated 6,000 to 10,000 years ago byGod. By displaying the chupacabra, hebelieves that he has cast doubt on thecredibility of mainstream scientists: Ifscientists scoff at the chupacabra's exis-tence (yet here it obviously is!), couldthey also be wrong about evolution andthe age of Earth? The identity of the Blanco chupacabra remains a mystery for the time being. Tissue samples were taken, but DNAresults have not yet been revealed. Thetwo most common explanations are thatit is either a hairless Mexican dog breedcalled Xoloitzcuintli (Xolo for short) or amangy coyote. Indeed, chupacabrasfound in nearby Cuero, Texas, in 2007were discovered to be coyote. A closer look at the animal's discovery suggests nothing unusual or odd aboutthe find. In fact, there was no indication of the chupacabra's signature attack:blood mysteriously drained from chick-ens, goats, or other livestock. The circum-stances are completely unlike the chupa-cabra and instead are consistent with anordinary dog or coyote attack. \"We don'tknow anything about that,\" said Ayer.\"All he knew is that the animal was tear-ing up animals in his barn, so he put poi-son out.... There was no witness of any kind of blood sucking going on.\" The Lost World Museum may hold the world's first stuffed and mountedauthentic chupacabra. Or, once theDNA tests come in, Adolfi may findthat he has purchased and displayed theworld's most expensive dead dog or coy-ote. Only mainstream science\u2014the verykind Adolfi seeks to discredit\u2014willreveal the \u2014Benjamin Radford Latest Texas 'Chupacabra' Exhibited in Creationist Museumfaced. As columnist Eugene Robinson concluded: \"T rying to analyzethe 'birther' phenomenon would meantaking it seriously, and taking it seriouslywould be like arguing about the color ofunicorns. About all that can be said is thata bunch of lost, confused, and frightenedpeople have decided to seek refuge in con-spiratorial make-believe. I hope they'reharmless. And I hope they seek help.\" I often feel the same way about many of the self-deluded people we deal with in our pages.

SI Jan Feb 2010 pgs 11/12/09 10:10 AM Page 78VOLUME 34, ISSUE 1 SKEPTICAL INQUIRERCSI's 'UFOs: The Space-Age Mythology' DAVE THOMAS The Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI, publisher of theS KEPTICAL INQUIRER ) held a workshop titled \"UFOs: The Space-AgeMythology\" in T ucson, Arizona, Octo-ber 9-11, 2009. It brought scientists andresearchers together with attendees fromaround the country for three days ofintense discussions on \"UnidentifiedFlying Object\" (UFO) sightings andclaims, practicalities of space travel, methodologies for finding life elsewherein the universe, and much more. James McGaha, chair of the proceed- ings, started off the workshop with ageneral introduction to the history ofthe UFO movement. McGaha, directorof the Grasslands Observatory in T ucson,is a scientific consultant to CSI and a fel-low of the Royal Astronomical Society.An astronomer and retired USAF pilot,he has logged over 40,000 hours ofnighttime observations and spent thou-sands of hours flying, observing the sunand atmospheric phenomena. Duringthat phenomenathat have led to numerous spuriousUFO reports. He mentioned the trio ofvision, perception, and interpretation andtold the audience these topics would beexplored heavily in the workshop. McGaha also gave the next presenta- tion, titled \"Lights in the Sky,\" about the\"Phoenix Lights\" affair that occurred theevening of March 13, 1997. Thousandsof witnesses reported a silent object overa mile wide that \"must have been a UFOor secret weapon.\" McGaha showed thatthe \"object\" was a severalmilitary flares (and/or the planes deploy-ing those flares) and that witnesses seeingthe mile-wide UFO were simply \"con-necting the dots.\" The \"StephenvilleLights,\" seen in Texas on January 8,2008, were also caused by military flares.This time, however, a major at the basenearby announced early on that \"therewere no F-16s from this unit operating\"that night. McGaha inquired with theFAA and found that the base was deploy- ing flights at that time. He wrangled anew press release from the 301st FighterWing correcting the error. The Betty Hill abduction claim was addressed by Robert Sheaffer, an SIcolumnist, investigator, and author ofUFO Sightings (Prometheus 1998). This story involves Betty and Barney Hill(both now deceased), who claimed in1961 that a bright object near the moonfollowed their car in New Hampshire.Soon Betty began dreaming of beingabducted by aliens. Under hypnosis,Betty described being shown star mapsby the aliens. Skeptics who examinedclaims about the star maps, includingCarl Sagan, found they relied on datafudging and cherry-picking. When shespoke to an initially friendly audience atthe National UFO Conference in NewYork in 1980, Hill lost the audiencewith hundreds of unconvincing \"UFO\"blobs. Sheaffer concluded that this sup-posed abduction demolished the use ofhypnosis to \"recover repressed memo-ries.\" Betty Hill clearly showed herself\"to be a spinner of tall tales, and anextremely unreliable witness.\" Saturday's session began with a talk by physicist and mathematician DaveThomas, a CSI fellow, on the mostfamous UFO case of all, the RoswellIncident. A rancher's discovery of someodd-looking debris prompted the Armyto announce a \"flying saucer\" had beenfound near Roswell. After being exposedas a balloon, the incident faded fromview until the late 1970s, when it arosewith an all-new mythology. Photographsof Major Jesse Marcel and others withthe debris in Fort Worth, Texas, clearlyshow the remnants of a radar-reflector/balloon assembly (since identified as part CONFERENCE REPORT Dave Thomas, a CSI fellow, is a physicsand mathematics graduate of New MexicoInstitute of Mining and T echnology and iscurrently a scientist/programmer at IRIS/PASSCAL in Socorro, New Mexico.

The weather officer on dutythat day was puzzled that Marcel was try-ing to convince him that alien writingappeared on the radar targets shown inthe photographs. Attendance at Roswell'sannual UFO festival commemorating theevent has plummeted recently. Robert Sheaffer examined the topic of UFOs in Mexico. When Venus wasmistaken for a UFO during the eclipseof July 1991, the Mexican \"UFO Blitz\"was on. UFO promoter Jaime Maussanhas produced scores of popular videoson paranormal events. Carlos Diaz ofTepoztlan claims several photographs of\"plasma ship\" UFOs. The active volcanoPopocatapetl is considered a UFObase by many in the region.Sheaffer attended the \"BeyondBoundaries\" tour in 1996, featur- ing visits to Mexico's \"hottestUFO hotspots.\" But nothingunusual was seen at the UFOClub in Metepec, alleged to be the\"hottest UFO spot\" in the country.The only physical evidence pre-sented was a broken stick. The cel-ebrated Campeche Infrared UFOVideo of March 5, 2004, turnedout to be just a couple of far-off oilrig flares enhanced by an infraredcamera (see Sheaffer's Septem-ber/October article). Shea-ffer UFO-logists, giddily discussingUFOs swarming volcanoes, areextremely skeptical of U.S. UFOabduction stories. David Morrison, director of the NASA Lunar Science Ins-titute and senior scientist forastrobiology at the NASA AmesResearch Center, spoke on \"ETLife: Finding It.\" He stressed that\"looking for aliens\" is sameas \"looking for alien life.\" Manyastrobiologists study microbial life in extreme environments righthere on Earth, since we haven't yet obtained any extraterrestrialmicrobes. The closest indication of lifebeyond Earth so far was possible fossilmicrobes from Martian meteoriteALH4001; these assertions have sincebeen discounted (though not dis-proved). In fact, it's difficult to evendefine \"life.\" By analogy, we longdescribed water as a clear liquid with char- acteristic properties, but only relativelyrecently have we been able to define water as an H 2O molecule. Methane on Mars and liquid water under Europa's ice aretantalizing areas of further investigation ofthe most basic of questions: what is life's beginning, distribution, and future? Morrison also discussed lunar and Martian conspiracies. The \"Face onMars\" was spotted by the Viking orbiterin 1977. Richard Hoagland says it's arti-ficial, finding confirmation in the geom-etry of nearby \"pyramids.\" When theMars Observer failed, believers blamedaliens. When the Mars Global Surveyor clearly showed the face was just a rubblepile, believers claimed NASA had bombedit to pieces. Hoagland also claims largeartificial glass structures exist on theMoon. But at least he thinks the Apollolandings really happened and were not agigantic hoax. Those arguing the Moonlandings never took place cite immaturetechnology, converging shadows, deathbeyond the Van Allen belts, fakedimagery, and alleged assassination of dis-senting astronauts. Disproving the hoaxare 400,000 NASA Apollo workers; adozen Apollo astronauts who walked onthe Moon; kilograms of unique lunar sam-ples they gathered; tracking by Britain andthe USSR; laser mirrors left on the Moon; and recently, crisp new images oflanders, ALSEP packages, footprints of UFOs.\" The sup-posed Aztec, New Mexico,UFO landing of 1948 was saidto involve recovery of a 99.99-foot-long Venusian saucer. WhenTRUE magazine reporter J.P . Cahn managed to snatch an alleged sample from the manwho started the claims, oilswindler Silas Newton, testsshowed it was just ordinary alu-minum. An acorn-shaped objectwas recovered after a fireball\"landed\" near Kecksburg, Penn-sylvania, in 1965, but the inci-dent was actually caused by theGreat Lakes Fireball of De-cember 9, seen all over theregion. Believers still considerthe T rent photographs of asaucer from McMinnville, Or-egon, in 1950 some of the bestin existence. A common truckmirror not only matches theshape of the alleged saucer, butits reflective surface explainswhy the image of the saucerappears to be far away.

When UFO reports are made by pilots, military personnel, or the police, believers say the witnesses are credible \"trainedobservers.\" James McGaha noted that noobservational training is provided for suchcareers. Pilots and police don't learn aboutlocating Venus and other planets and starsor about bizarre atmospheric phenomena(sun dogs, mirages, refraction, lenticularclouds, etc.). A pilot who knows jets or air-planes might not be able to identify abolide (meteor) or a high-altitude researchballoon. V ision itself is only a model of reality and can be fooled in myriad ways. Optically, the human eye is a fee-ble low-resolution system affected bysevere chromatic aberration and astig-matism. It's no surprise that amateurastronomers, who are trained as ob- servers of the sky, have the lowest rate of making UFO reports. Up next was \"Aliens Among Us.\" McGaha noted that 45 to 60 percent ofAmericans believe aliens and UFOs arereal and that 71 percent think the gov-ernment is hiding related evidence.Because there are so many stars and plan-ets, believers feel that intelligent life must have visited Earth. He discussed main-stream efforts to find out if we are alonein the universe (Fermi Paradox, DrakeEquation, and others). As for wormholesbeing an easy way out of the problemsfacing space travel, McGaha remindedthe audience of stew: \"First, a dragon.\" Hecalculated the energy required to send alarge ship on a space journey; whateverfuel is needed to just get up to near lightspeed will be quadrupled for a round-trip journey to a remote star. Such ajourney would require billions of timeshumanity's historical production ofenergy. McGaha declared the idea ofalien visitation a \"failed hypothesis.\" Dave Thomas began the Sunday ses- sion with another look at the allegedAztec, New Mexico, UFO landing of1948. About ten years ago, the town ofAztec started an annual UFO festival,and the mysterious \"Mr. X\" (since re-vealed as Scott Ramsey) has successfullyrevived the mythical story. One of themost famous landing cases was reportedin 1964 by Socorro, New Mexico, police-man Lonny Zamora. Besides aliens fromspace, conjectures for that event include ahoax to promote the town, an early bal-loon flight, a Lunar Surveyor landingtest, and a college prank. A Surveyor craftwasbeing tested near Socorro that day, suspended from a small Bell helicopter.An old letter from the local college presi-dent to Linus Pauling, saying the affairwas a student's hoax, has rekindled inter- est in that hypothesis. Destruction of Earth by a rogue planet was the next topic. David Morri- son said that fears of Planet X, or Niburu,began with books by Zecharia Sitchin.Nancy Lieder sparked fear on theInternet when she warned Planet Xwould destroy Earth in 2003. When thatdidn't happen, the rogue planet was re-scheduled to destroy Earth in 2012, coin-cident with the supposed end of theMayan calendar. On his \"Ask an Astro-biologist\" Web page, Morrison answersimpassioned letters from people withcomments like \"My wife is pregnant, andshe has been unable to sleep for the pastweek because she is afraid about the com-ing destruction of the Earth.\" Hollywoodmade things worse by creating a fakeWeb site to promote the November 2009movie 2012. (For more, see Morrison's \"Update on the Niburu 2012 Dooms-day,\" SI, November/December 2009.) A lively question and answer session capped off Sunday morning, touching on various topics including global warming(of which McGaha and Sheaffer were skep-tical and Morrison and Thomas werealarmed). Several attendees went on thetour of the Pima Air and Space museum.All in all, it was a successful and enjoyableconference. /hwysquareSI Jan Feb 2010 pgs 11/12/09 10:17 AM Page 11INVESTIGATIVE FILES JOE NICKELL Belgian Miracles 12 VOLUME 34, ISSUE 1 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER Amember of the European Union, Belgium is locatedbetween the Netherlands, Germany, and France. The coun- try takes its name from its firstrecorded inhabitants, ancient Celtsknown as Belgae, and has a richhistory, having been a province ofthe Roman Empire, the heart ofthe Carolingian dynasty, and acelebrated medieval textile center.Today, among its many greatattractions are such historic citiesas Brussels, Ghent, and Bruges,together with museums of Flemishart. While it is a country of scien-tific advances (a world leader inheart and lung transplants as wellas in fertility treatments [World2000, 129]), it is also, according tomany, a place of miracles. I made my first investigative pilgrimage to Belgium in 1998 (accompanied by local skeptic TimT rachet). I returned in 2006 (withDutch science writer and translatorJan Willem Nienhuys) as a side excur-sion from travels in the Netherlands(Nickell 2007a). On both occasions, Ilooked at purported wonders such as thehealing shrine known as the BelgianLourdes, an ancient miracle statue, and avial of the Holy Blood of Christ.The Belgian Lourdes I have twice visited the Shrine of Our Lady of Lourdes (named after thefamous healing-spring grotto in Belgium.The shrine's most celebrated miracle isthe healing of a laborer named Pierre DeRudder, whose lower left leg was brokenby a felled tree in 1867. Reportedly, DeRudder refused amputation and for eightyears suffered constant pain from hisopen and festering wound. Thenin April 1875, he visited theOostakker where, allegedly,he was instantaneously healed,after which he \"walked normallyuntil his death in 1898\" at age sev-enty-six (Neiman 1995, 100-101).On July 25, 1908, the Holy Seeof Bruges declared the healingsupernatural. Over time, a number of leg- ends grew up about the case, in-cluding a claim that De Rudderhad been treated by professorThiriar, physician to King L\u00e9opoldII (a claim dropped by the mirac-ulists after a denial by Thiriar him-self). More significantly, it wasclaimed that prior to 1875 DeRudder's unmended leg could betwisted at the fracture point to theextent of revolving the foot half aturn (i.e., putting the heel infront). Then, when De Rudderwas allegedly cured in 1875, themending was \"instantaneous.\"Unfortunately, most of the important testimony in the case went unrecorded for eighteen years, andmemories of this age are subject to error(Delcour 1987). For example, Dr. Van Hoestenberghe claimed that he had performed the twisting movement on De Rudder's leg,when in fact the physician's recollectionwas a false memory. A letter he had writ-ten on May 12, 1875 (which had be-come lost by the time of a canonicalinquiry in 1893 but was rediscovered by Figure 1. The lower left leg bones of Pierre De Rudder, allegedly healed by a miracle in 1875. Joe Nickell, CSI's senior research fellow, is author of many books, including Lookingfor a Miracle and Relics of the Christ. His Web site is at www.joenickell.com. Copy photo from shrine at Oostakker, Belgium, by Joe NickellSI Jan Feb 2010 pgs 11/12/09 10:17 AM Page 12SKEPTICAL INQUIRER January / February 2010 131957) revealed that he had not per- formed the twist, nor even seen it, buthad only heard persons talk about it. Moreover, the twist was apparently not demonstrated at the point of the fracture by showing the naked leg.Instead, it was done with the leg clothed,so the observers could not know wherethe twist actually occurred. This is a cru-cial point because certain supple personscan turn their feet almost completelyaround, like De Rudder, withoutbenefit of any abnormal mobility. 1 Although some claimed the leg wasuncovered when they saw DeRudder twist it, two men who werepresent for his demonstrations \"wellover a hundred times\" stated the legwas never naked on those occasions(Delcour 1987). De Rudder'seagerness to demonstrate the effectat every opportunity suggests not asuffering man happy to suffer morebut someone performing a stuntwith a purpose\u2014one that will soonbecome clear. As to the supposed instanta- neous nature of the healing, thatclaim depends on the dubious testi-mony of just three persons: an illit-erate woman who was apparentlyrepresented by hearsay and a fatherand son who seemed eager to helpcertify a miracle. (Their story evenimproved over the years.) In contrast is the evidence that De Rudder had actually undergone\"a certain improvement\" aboutfourteen months after the accident.We know that the Viscount whoemployed De Rudder at the time ofthe accident gave the invalidworker a pension, characterized as a \"nicesalary.\" It was rumored about the villagethat De Rudder was malingering in orderto effect a life of ease. After the Viscount died on July 26, 1874, his heir stopped the pension,whereupon De Rudder's wife and daugh-ter had to begin working. Some eight months later, De Rudder may have hiton a clever plan that would allow him toabruptly end his pretended disability sohe could, necessarily, return to work: hewent to Oostakker and claimed a mirac-ulous cure. However, he returned homewith a scar that, reported by Dr. VanHoestenberghe, was \"such as one finds along time after a healing\" (qtd. inDelcour 1987). Other medical evidence likewise sup- ports the view that De Rudder's healingwas less than miraculous. A broken legsuch as he suffered could\u2014with immo-bility and good hygiene\u2014have healedwithout amputation. Besides, the bones(see figure 1) grew together obliquely in a fashion a surgeon would not have been proud of. Also, that which would haveindeed been beyond nature\u2014the recon-stitution of De Rudder's dead tendon\u2014did not occur (De Meester 1957, 106).One touted proof that the cure wasinstantaneous comes from the absence ofthickening of the bone callus at themending site, but this thickening couldhave been reabsorbed by the body in sev-eral months or a few years (EncyclopediaBritannica 2009, s.v. \"callus\"). Adrien Delcour (1987) concludes that thephysicians who consider the De Ruddercase miraculous almost unanimously doso on the basis that the cure was instanta-neous, and that, as we have seen, is depen-dent on dubious testimony. Indeed, thereis evidence to the contrary. The De Rudder case gives one pause regarding other claims of miraculoushealing at Oostakker, Lourdes, and else-where. Such certifications are often vagueand unscientific. Miracle is not a scientific concept, and miracle claims aretypically only those found to be\"medically inexplicable.\" Thus,claimants are engaging in a logicalfallacy called \"arguing from igno-rance\"\u2014that is, drawing a conclu-sion based on a lack of knowledge(Nickell 2007, 202-205). The DeRudder case is even worse, sincethere is evidence that an injury,healed long before, was passedoff as instantaneous\u2014a miraclethat wasn't. for \"sharp hill\") in thenorth-central part of the country.There, in the Middle Ages, stooda great, solitary oak that was visi-ble from all around. The spotwas a center of superstitiouspractices and pagan worshipuntil, in the fourteenth century, asmall wooden figure of theVirgin Mary was affixed to thetree, and the makeshift shrinebegan to gain fame. In time, mir- acles began to be attributed tothe little statue (see figure 2). The first reputed miracle occurred in 1514 when, according to apious little legend, a shepherd or shep-herd boy discovered the figurine lyingon the ground and intended to take ithome. However, the Virgin Mary mirac-ulously transfixed him\u2014froze him inplace\u2014preventing statue's removal.Subsequently, the shrine became morewidely known. In 1602, a little wooden chapel was built at the site, and the following year anew miracle was reported: the statuewept bloody tears, reportedly in protest Figure 2. This little statue of the Virgin at Belgium's most- frequented pilgrimage site is said to be miraculous despitebeing a replacement.

Still another miracle was said to have occurred in 1604 when troops of theArchduke Albert (the Spanish-appointedgovernor of the Low Countries) routedthe Protestants and retook Ostend. Albertand his wife, the Archduchess Isabella,determined to thank God by commis-sioning the erection of a monumentalbaroque basilica at the site, inaugurated in1627. Albert died in the meantime, but Isabella walked to the inauguration, giv- ing rise to pilgrimages that have contin-ued ever since, supplicants seeking theirown miracles in Scherpenheuvel-Zichem n.d.; \"Scherpen- heuvel-Zichem\" 2009). What are we to make of the alleged miracles of Scherpenheuvel? First, weshould remember that the site was con-sidered magical before it was taken overby Catholic Christians, part of a com-mon process known as syncretism inwhich one religion is grafted ontoanother. (For example, Catholic con-quistadors in Mexico erected a shrine tothe Virgin Mary on a hill where theAztecs had a temple to their virgin may ask,are the alleged miracles of Scherpen-heuvel attributable to the statue of theVirgin and the power of the Virgin her-self or to pagan deities? Or might therehave been no miracles at all? The story of the transfixed shepherd boy is one of those vague, pious folktaleslacking any evidence to support it. If weare prepared to believe a shepherd boyconsidered taking the statue, we can alsobelieve it was only an attack of con-science that stayed his hand, and the restof the tale is attributable to exaggeration. As to the statue's bloody tears, that figurine was not the same one that hadtransfixed the shepherd boy. The origi-nal had been stolen in 1580 when theregion was pillaged by Dutch Protestanticonoclasts (those hostile to the worshipof images). In other words, the statuethat legendarily saved itself from a shep-herd's grasp was unable to stave offmarauding anti-idolaters, suggesting atbest its powers were limited. Thus the bloody tears were produced by a replacement statue, and in any case, the phenomenon\u2014judging from numer-ous modern examples\u2014was likely apious fraud. In 1985, for instance, astatue of the virgin that wept and bled inthe home of a Quebec railroad workerproved on examination to have anapplied mixture of blood and animal fat. When the room warmed from the body heat of the pilgrims, the substance lique-fied and trickled realistically. In anothercase in Sardinia, Italy, in 1995, DNAtests on the blood revealed that itbelonged to the statue's owner (Nickell2007b, 227-228). (Her attorney ex-plained, \"Well, the Virgin Mary had toget that blood from somewhere.\") The 1604 military victory at Ostend does not seem so miraculous if one adoptsthe perspective of the Protestants or if onewonders why we should think statuesmiraculous when desirable things happen(a statue's theft is prevented, a battle Figure 3. Joe Nickell appears to be venerating the Holy Blood at Bruges but is really only getting a good look at it! Photo by Jan Willem NienhuysSI Jan Feb 2010 pgs 11/12/09 10:31 AM Page 14won) but not unmiraculous when bad things occur (a statue is stolen, maraud- ers overrun the land). Given the image of the Virgin Mary as healer and protectress (Mullen 1998, 10),it is not surprising that desperate peoplestill seek miracles at Scherpenheuvel,where I have witnessed the votive candles,the fervent prayers, the posted notesbeseeching \"Moeder Maria\" for supernat-ural assistance. Such help may seem tocome to those who count only the goodluck; otherwise they discount the bad oreven\u2014sad to say\u2014blame themselves fornot praying hard enough. The Holy Blood John Calvin (1543, 226) critically ob- served that alleged blood of Jesus \"isexhibited in more than a hundred places,\"one of the most celebrated being theBasilica of the Holy Blood in Bruges. Itwice visited the site, and on the secondoccasion (October 25, 2006) I was able tohold in my hands the reliquary suppos-edly containing the very blood of Christ(figure 3). It has been called \"Europe'sholiest relic\" (Coupe 2009, 132). According to legend, the Bruges relic was obtained in Palestine in the mid-twelfth century, during the SecondCrusade, by Thierry of Alsace. He al-legedly received it from his relativeBaldwin II, then King of Jerusalem, as areward for meritorious service. How-ever, chronicles of the crusades fail tomention the relic being present inJerusalem (Aspeslag 1988, 10). Sourcesclaim that Thierry, Count of Flanders,brought the relic to Bruges in 1150, whileanother source reports it arrived in 1204.In any event, the earliest document thatrefers to it housed in the twelfth- century Basilica of the Holy Blood, is nowbrought out daily for veneration by thefaithful. Although mistakenly character-ized by at least one source as \"a fragmentof cloth stained with what is said to be theblood of Christ\" (McDonald 2009, 145),it in fact consists of \"clotted blood\" con-tained in a vial set in a glass-fronted cylin-der, each end of which is covered withgold coronets decorated with angels. Thevial (made of rock crystal rather than glass) has been determined to be an eleventh-ortwelfth-century Byzantine perfume bottle. In 1310 Pope Clement V issued a papal bull granting indulgences to pil-grims who visited the chapel at Brugesand venerated the blood. At that time,believers claimed the blood miracu-lously returned to its original liquid stateevery Friday at noon. This not onlysounds like a magic trick, but it evokes thesimilar \"miracle\" of the blood of St.Januarius at Naples\u2014a phenomenon thatforensic analyst John F . Fischer and Ireplicated, utilizing a mixture of olive oil,melted beeswax, and red pigment. Inaddition to St. Januarius, some twentyother saints have reportedly yielded liquefying blood. My Italian col-league, chemist Luigi Garlaschelli, exter-nally examined one of these in its sealedvial and discovered that the \"blood\" sim-ply liquefied whenever the temperaturerose (Nickell 2007c, 44-49, Holy Blood at Bruges soon stopped liquefying, suppos-edly as the result of some blasphemythat occurred later in 1310. The miraclerecurred only one more time, in 1388(Aspeslag 1988, 11). Naturally, I wanted to get a good look at the \"blood,\" so I twice stood in the pilgrims' line, supposedly to prayover the reliquary (again, see figure 3).In fact, although I bowed respectfully, Iused the two brief occasions to scruti-nize the substance. I observed that it hada waxen look and was bespeckled with\"coagulated drops\" that have red (Bruges real blood, which blackens withage (Kirk 1974, 194-195). In brief, the Holy Blood of Bruges lacks a credible provenance, since it has no record for a dozen centuries after thedeath of Jesus and is contained in amedieval bottle. It appeared with a pro-fusion of other dubious blood relics,including several with which it had incommon the property of liquefying andresolidifying, suggestive of a magic trick.Both that behavior and its currentappearance are incompatible with gen-uine old blood and are instead indicativeof a pious fraud.

Ringer Thomas (Tommy) Gold was born in Vienna in 1920 and died inIthaca, New York, in 2004 at age eighty-four. Few scientists since Keplerhave combined such brilliant intuitiveinsights with views considered flaky bycolleagues. Gold has become an out-standing example of a modern iconoclast.As Freeman Dyson wrote in his forewordto Gold's only book, The Deep Hot Bio- sphere (1999), \"Gold's theories are always original, always important, usually con-troversial\u2014and usually right.\" A professor of astronomy at Cornell, Gold first became well known, alongwith Hermann Bondi and Fred Hoyle,as one of the three big defenders of thesteady state theory of the universe. Itwas a respectable theory until it was shotdown by the discovery of microwaveradiation left over from a Big Bang. Gold's first unorthodox theory dealtwith the workings of the inner ear. Itwas widely attacked as nonsense byphysicists until to their surprise it wasproved correct. Next, Gold suggestedthat the pulsating radiation of a pulsarwas caused by the rapid rotation of aneutron star. The theory was so vigor-ously attacked by astronomers that Goldwas denied permission to speak at the first international conference on pulsars. His conjecture was soon confirmed afterthe discovery of a giant pulsar in theCrab Nebula. While NASA was preparing to land astronauts on the Moon, Gold was inthe news for predicting that they andtheir spacecraft might sink in several feetof what was called Gold dust. Gold soonrevised his prediction to a few inches,which turned out to be the case. TheMoon's surface is indeed covered with apowdery substance. Gold's most controversial conjecture, which he defended tirelessly in his lateryears, was a conviction that petroleum,or black Gold as it is sometimes called,was not a product of life forms, such asdecomposing ferns and fishes. It origi-nated in ancient deposits of hydrocar-bons, such as methane, going back to theearliest centuries of Earth's history. Overbillions of years, this nonbiological \"oil\"slowly seeped upward, contaminated bybiological molecules along the way, tobecome trapped in pools under lime-stone domes. In brief, contrary to thealmost unanimous opinion of geologistseverywhere, oil is not a fossil fuel! Goldwas convinced that if we could tap intothese deep and vast deposits of hydrocar-bon, we could obtain ten times the oilnow reachable by our shallow drilling. Almost no one, even in Russia where a similar theory about the origin of oilhad been advanced, paid attention toGold's vigorous promotion of his theory.Eventually he persuaded a group inSweden to test his theory by drillingextremely deep wells, but the wells failedto confirm his conjecture.

Hecites as examples the initial opposition tohis theory about how the inner ear processes sound and the later opposition to his theory that pulsars are rotating stars. Gold details the herd mentality that he believed caused such violent opposi-tion to his theory about the origin of oil.It almost completely stopped research,making it nearly impossible to getpapers published defending the theoryor to obtain funding for research. This herd mentality was not always there, Gold writes, especially in the arts.He quotes passages from an amusingbook titled The Experts Speak. Edouard Manet wrote to Claude Monet: \"Renoirhas no talent at all, that boy .... T e l l him to give up painting.\" Rembrandt, Gold adds, was considered inferior to that \"extraordinarily gifted artist, Mr.Ripongill.\" William Blake, painter as well as poet, called Titian and his fellow Venetianartists \"idiots and mediocrity.\"Gold writes: \"I have made people absolutely wild, shaking wild, shaking their fists at me, when I proposed in mytalks that there was some uncertaintyabout the origin of petroleum.... That is my sad story.\" Will Gold's theory about the origin of black gold eventually hold up? Will hebecome another Alfred Wegener? Almostall geologists once assumed that the obvi-ous fit of the east side of the SouthAmerican continent with the west side ofthe African continent was sheer coinci-dence. Wegener believed the continentswere once joined but drifted apart. Hedied of exposure after he got lost in theArctic and never knew that his theory ofcontinental drift was finally verified.Indeed, it is continental drift, via sea-floorspreading and plate tectonics, that crum-ples Earth's crust into mountain ranges. Will Gold's theory of oil's origin some day be confirmed? This seems nowto be very unlikely.

Thenews was quickly picked up by interna-tional media. As soon as the Reuters agency sent out a press release, newspa-pers and television outlets around theworld took notice. The reason is quitesimple: for the first time, Garlaschellihas reproduced a life-size replica of theShroud of T urin. Measuring fourteen feet, four inches by three feet, seven inches, the shroudbears the image of a crucified man somebelievers say is Christ, eerily reversedlike a photographic negative. The history of the shroud is long and controversial. After first surfacing inFrance, it was brought by Italy's formerroyal family, the Savoys, to their seat inT urin in 1578. In 1983, ex-King Um-berto II bequeathed it to the late PopeJohn Paul II. The shroud was nearlydestroyed in 1997 when a fire ravagedthe Guarini Chapel of the T urin cathe-dral where it is held, but a firemanrisked his own life to save the cloth. The cloth was branded a medieval artifact after carbon 14 dating. Themost definitive study occurred in 1998and consisted of tests by three separateinstitutions, which were granted permis- sion by the Vatican. Laboratories at theUniversity of Oxford, the University ofArizona, and the Swiss Federal Instituteof Technology used radio carbon datingon different portions of the cloth. Theyfound the shroud dated from circa1260-1390. However, many still believe it is the real burial cloth of Jesus on the basis ofother evidence. Part of the controversyarises from the fact that, until now, it hasproven difficult to understand the mech-anisms of its formation and to obtain bysimple means an acceptable replica of theshroud and its features. That's why manycall it \" an impossible image.\" The Lab Experiment \"The most likely explanation, in my opinion,\" said Garlaschelli, a professor oforganic chemistry at the University ofPavia, \"is that the image, as it can be seennowadays, is a chemical etching of thecellulose of the linen fibers. This degra-dation can be accounted for by non-neu-tral impurities contained in the ochrethat a mediaeval artist used to generatethe image by a simple frottage technique.The original pigment came off during themany years of the shroud's history, leavingthe well-known weak ghostly image. Thishypothesis, originally put forward by JoeNickell, had never been experimentallytested before.\" As he did fifteen years ago with the \"miracle\" blood of St. Januarius, Garla- schelli set out to reproduce the full-sizedshroud using materials and techniques that were available in the Middle Ages. Garlaschelli placed a linen sheet, hand woven for the occasion, flat over a volun- teer and then rubbed the linen with a pig-ment containing traces of acid. The face was obtained from a bas-relief in order to avoid the inescapable wrap-arounddistortion. Garlaschelli then retouchedthe image by hand after laying the clothflat on a tabletop. He artificially agedthe pigment by heating the cloth in anoven and washing it, removing the pig-ment from the surface but leaving thefuzzy, half-tone image similar to that onthe shroud. Garlaschelli then addedblood stains, burnt holes, scorches, andwater stains to achieve the final effect. The result is impressive. The Shroud of T urin and Garlaschelli's replica lookremarkably alike. \"Our goal was not to show that the Shroud of T urin is a fake, but rather thatit is possible to reproduce somethingwhich has the same characteristics of theshroud,\" said Garlaschelli. \"We have alsoshown that pigments containing tracesof acidic compounds can be artificiallyaged after the rubbing step (by heatingthe cloth in an oven) in such a way that,when the pigment is removed, an imageis obtained having all the characteristicsof the Shroud of T urin. In particular, theimage is a pseudo-negative, is fuzzy withhalf-tones, resides on the topmost fibersof the cloth, has some 3-D embeddedproperties, and does not fluoresce.\" Garlaschelli does not expect to con- vince the believers, which was never hisgoal. \"If they don't want to believe car-bon dating done by some of the world'sbest laboratories, they certainly won'tbelieve me. However, we think that ourattempts represent an interesting addi-tion to the ongoing debate on thismaybe-not-so-impossible image.\" The Shroud of Turin Duplicated 18 VOLUME 34, ISSUE 1 SKEPTICAL INQUIRERNOTES ON A STRANGE WORLD MASSIMO POLIDORO Massimo Polidoro is an investigator of the paranormal, author, lecturer, and co-founder and head of CICAP , the Italianskeptics group.

It helps usmake sense of our complex and often chaotic world. A classic prob-lem in philosophy is whether our classi-fications \"cut nature at its joints,\" as thesaying goes, i.e., whether human classi-fication reflects the realities of the worldinstead of just being an arbitrary heuris-tic device that helps us muddle throughthings. Of course, we have good exam-ples of both types of situation: The peri-odic table of the elements does seem toreflect a fundamental structure of theworld itself regardless of the humanpenchant for organizing things.However, classifying Pluto as a planet,planetoid, or giant asteroid is, to a largedegree, a matter of astronomers' arbi-trary preferences (see \"Thinking aboutScience,\" SI, January/February 2006). The same kind of problem arises when we want to put some order intothe barrage of academic disciplines thathave developed during the past severalhundred years. So that universities canbe run with a semblance of efficiency,we distinguish a department of philoso-phy from one of biology and even sepa-rate groups of disciplines into differentcolleges or divisions (humanities versussciences, for instance). This makes sensefrom an administrative point of viewand helps faculty focus on the kind ofteaching and scholarship they are inter-ested in doing, but it also carries thedanger of compartmentalizing resourcesand people to the point of making cross-disciplinary interactions inordinately difficult. Having made a career of walk- ing the line between disciplines, I amcertainly aware of the dangers andwasted opportunities caused by arbitraryand rigid divisions where flexibilitywould be more sensible. Still, it is unde-niably true that the kinds of things I amdoing now as a philosopher are very dif-ferent in nature from the kinds of thingsI was doing as a biologist.Discussions of the (arbitrary?) dis- tinction between basic and applied sci-ence are often heard in the hall of scien-tific meetings and at pubs, especially bybasic scientists griping that their appliedcolleagues get a much larger share offederal funding (true) or by applied sci-entists who grumble that the most rec-ognizable honors and prestigious jour-nals tend to be reserved for the otherside (also mostly true). Recently, an op-ed piece in The New York Times by Stephen Quake (February 19, 2009)brought the discussion to the attentionof the general public. Quake, a professorat Stanford University and an investiga-tor at the Howard Hughes Medical Ins-titute, is a quintessential example of thescientist who straddles both worlds.Perhaps predictably, Quake argues thatthe basic/applied divide in science iscompletely spurious, and he lists a num- Is There a Difference between Basic and Applied Science?

There is a long tradition of arguing like this: cherry-picking the few anecdotesthat best fit the bill. Quake himself, ofcourse, starts out with the archetypalexample of Archimedes. Yes, he discov-ered the basic principle of buoyancy(though stepping into one's bath isn'texactly the sort of research that the NationalScience Foundation [NSF] would give youmoney for these days), but his eureka cryreferred to an applied problem: he neededto determine whether a jeweler had swin-dled King Hiero by selling him a crownthat was not actually made of solid gold. (Itturns out that Hiero had in fact beencheated, though I do not know what theking did to the jeweler after Archimedesexposed the fraud.) From more modern times, we know the entire field of radioastronomy wasmade possible by the invention of radarfor military purposes, and basic researchinto the nature of atoms led to the con-struction (and use) of nuclear weaponsduring World War II. But for every oneof these anecdotes I can marshal hun-dreds, nay thousands, of examples wherethere is little to no overlap between basicand applied science. The overwhelmingmajority of medical research, for in-stance, feeds on previous medical re-search and only occasionally gets a boostfrom new discoveries in molecular orcell biology. Yes, medical scientists needto be knowledgeable about basic notionsin those fields (and in genetics, physiol-ogy, and anatomy, for that matter), butthat isn't the same point that Quake wastrying to make. Conversely, I assure you that the over- whelming majority of grants I see fundedby NSF and similar agencies\u2014and corre-spondingly the greatest number ofresearch projects that are pursued by fac-ulty and graduate students in basic sciencedepartments all over the world\u2014havenothing whatsoever to do with applica-tions if one defines an \"application\" as aresult that is directly useful to human wel-fare. I am not trying to make the pointthat basic research is uninteresting, noram I arguing that there is no connectionbetween basic and applied science.Rather, I am cautioning against simplisticscenarios at both extremes of what is acomplex, nonlinear, and highly idiosyn-cratic spectrum: much basic research goeson without any application at all, andmuch applied science does not depend(other than in a vague and very straight-forward manner) on basic research. Thereis a good reason theoretical physicists andengineers, evolutionary biologists andmedical doctors, and mathematicians andsoftware developers work in differentplaces and are funded by different agen-cies. By all means, let's keep talking toeach other and celebrate the occasionalcrossover, but let's not fool ourselves andthe public by selling a view of science thatsimply doesn't cut nature at its joints.

But well-known UFO expertRichard Boylan of Sacramento, Cali-fornia, isn't fooled; he knows that it's \"aCabal project to annihilate a Star Visitorcolony living in a crater near the Moon'sSouth Pole.\" Boylan, a former psycholo-gist who lost his license over allegedlyimproper behavior, is a board member ofa group called The Academy of ClinicalClose Encounter Therapists. Boylan notonly works with those who believe theyare victims of UFO abduction but alsodetects and counsels \"Star Kids\" andadult \"Star Seeds,\" people who believethey have special advanced abilities and aspecial alien mission on Earth. His Website, www.drboylan.com, helpfully pro-vides a checklist for those who believethat they or their children may be Star-special. Answer \"yes\" to twenty or moreof the questions, and your child is\"absolutely a Star Kid.\" Boylan explains: The Cabal within NASA know that there is a colony of Star Visitors livingwithin Cabeus A Crater. The Cabal'ssecret objective is to use the LCROSSand attached rocket stage to obliteratethe Star Visitor settlement residingwithin that crater .... I note that the Cabal is indeed engaged in unlawfulwar crimes and attempting to posi-tion the United States, and by exten-sion, all Earth nations, in an act ofwar against star civilizations. Sincethis is not a true act of the UnitedStates Government but a rogue act byCabal infiltrators within NASA, thenthe official government of the UnitedStates, and by extension the UnitedNations, would repudiate this actionas unlawful once its true intentbecomes known.

That Joint PsychicExercise will take place simultaneouslyglobally on October 8 (the day beforesupposed impact).\" Boylan called this the \"Joint Psychic Exercise to deflect and disintegrateLCROSS space probe and its Centaurbooster rocket\" and gave the hour in eachtime zone for his followers to performtheir feats of psychic action-at-a-distance. However, a week before the launch, NASA changed its mind about whichcrater to impact. NASA scientists decidedthat the main crater, Cabeas, was morelikely to contain significant amounts ofwater, and they directed LCROSS and its Centaur rocket to the new target. Sothe energy from the future Joint PsychicExercise probably went back in time,causing NASA to direct its impact awayfrom the Star Nations visitors. Or elseBoylan's urgent message finally gotthrough to Star-Visitor-Overseer JoeBiden, who averted an interplanetarywar by moving the LCROSS target. ButBoylan himself seems unaware of the re-targeting or at least did not mention iton his Web site. Precisely at the predicted time, the Centaur rocket, followed quickly byLCROSS itself, both undeflected andundisintegrated, slammed into the lunarcrater Cabeas at a speed of about 40km/s. Nonetheless, Boylan proclaimedthe exercise a success, claiming that theprobe and rocket were \"deflected\" fromthe Moon and \"disintegrated in space.\"Boylan explained how he projected him-self astrally through time and space and(still apparently unaware of probes' retargeting) \"went out psychically to LCROSS and Centaur theywere streaming towards Moon. Next Ienwrapped LCROSS in a telekinetic forceand redirected it onto a course to the leftso it was aiming towards one Moon-diameter's width left of the Moon's leftside. Then the same was done with theCentaur booster rocket.\" But merely todeflect the objects was not enough: I engaged first one, then the other, with strong dissolution energy tounbind the Strong Force bonds hold-ing their atoms together as molecules.[That, however, is an electromagneticbond, not a nuclear one.] Movingfrom top to bottom, I un-did theStrong Force bonds, causing the com-ponent materials of these space vehi-cles to come apart at the molecularlevel. This process also safely disman-tled the advanced munitions whichwere secretly aboard these space vehi-cles.... This was confirmed this morning by Star Nations, whosemembers were also at work on thesetwo space vehicles during our JPE, toassure thorough deflection and disin-tegration. Thus the star folks lunar colony within Cabeus A Crater is safefrom overhead bombardment. Perhaps this explains why no ground- based telescopes observed any dustejected from the collision. * * * Attack of the Drones? Starting in 2007, pic-tures of weird, spindly shaped UFOs startedto turn up in UFO Web sites and maga-zines, usually submitted anonymously.Looking like a cross between a wire basketand a ceiling fan, \"drone UFOs\" startedpopping up all over the place. The first such photos supposedly came from a fellow in Bakersfield, Cali-fornia, known only as \"Chad.\" In May of2007, he submitted a total of six droneUFO photos to the Coast-to-Coast AMWeb site, which posted them. He wrote,\"My wife and I were on a walk when wenoticed a very large, very strange 'craft' inthe sky .... The craft is almost com- pletely silent and moves very quickly .... I see this thing very often.... I t i s almost totally silent but not quite. It makes kindof 'crackling' noises .... I t m o v e s almost like an insect.\" The object in the photohad five protruding arms, one muchlonger than the others. Before long, a second set of drone UFO photos was allegedly taken at LakeTahoe near the Nevada-California line,submitted anonymously to the MutualUFO Network (MUFON) and posted ontheir Web site. This craft had four arms,two significantly longer than the others.Soon six more anonymous drone photosfrom Capitola, California, were posted onthe Internet by a person calling himself\"Rajman.\" This one had some sort of\"alien writing\" on it. A few days later,somebody known only as \"Stephen\" pro-duced three drone photographs suppos-edly taken at Big Basin Park, not far fromCapitola. The object is somewhat distant,and details are hard to see. About ten dayslater, a guy named \"Ty\" submitted twelvedrone photos, supposedly taken at BigBasin Park the same day as Stephen's andseen by his cycling group. Ty's photos areamazingly close-up, one to seeevery gear, sprocket, and spike in cleardetail. After that, a few more pictures \"I note that the [NASA] Cabal is indeed engaged in unlawful war crimes and attempting to position the United States, and by extension, all Earth nations, in an act of war against star civilizations.\" \u2014 Richard BoylanSI Jan Feb 2010 pgs 11/12/09 10:20 AM Page 22trickled in from here and there, but the fad for photographing drone UFOsseemed to have run its course. Somebodycalling himself \"Isaac\" wrote a letterexplaining how he used to work on a clas-sified project called \"Caret\" that utilizedcaptured alien technology to produceantigravity. He also produced what hepurports is a technical manual, portionsof it heavily redacted, showing parts thatseem to have come from a drone UFO. In 2008, a woman in London who said she was with the \"Open MindsForum\" contacted California privateinvestigator T.K. Davis. She wanted tohire him to find out who photographedthe drones, as thus far every photogra-pher has only given a first name. Shedidn't want to be identified, either. Shehad emailed Rajman with some ques-tions, but he closed his e-mail accountafter only a brief reply. So Davis and hiscolleague Frankie Dixon headed toCapitola to identify the specific tele-phone pole seen in the photo. Thewhole affair is starting to sound like aHumphrey Bogart movie. On September 10, 2009, the T ele- graph of London published a strange photo with a story titled \"UFO or Ptero-dactyl over Argentinian Lake? A S trange Object Photographed over a Lake inArgentina Has Been Described as Eithera Flying Saucer or a Flying Dinosaur.\"The somewhat blurry photo, taken witha cell phone, shows a round object withfive arms or spikes protruding from it,causing anyone who has been watchingthe carnival described above to immedi-ately exclaim, \"It's a drone!\" The photowas taken by Rafael Pino (at least thisman has a first and last name!) who sayshe was driving his truck when he spottedthe object and stopped to snap three pho-tos. However, one alert reader inArgentina wrote, \"It does look like a wind-shield cracked by a rock.\" An analysis ofthese photos on the blog Forgetomori(http://forgetomori.com) suggests that \"indeed, the 'UFO' is apparently in thesame perspective in all photos, as if it did-n't really move. Note that in the secondphoto, the line of horizon is tilted . . .but the UFO's rightmost 'spike,' whichis actually a crack, is still parallel to it.So, a cracked windshield looks like agood and obvious explanation.\" By the way, there's a lot of interesting investigativematerial on Forgetomori, whose motto is\"Extraordinary Claims, Ordinary Investi-gations.\" But many of the investigationsseem well beyond the \"ordinary,\" so Isuggest you have a look. Yet another photo of a spiky drone from the Netherlands was quickly identi-fied by several readers as a \"Waldorf boxkite,\" which indeed does have the samespiky shape. Of course, the clear anddetailed, but anonymous, drone photosfrom California are not the result ofcracked windshields or kites but probably are courtesy of Photoshop or similar soft- ware. In fact, some computer graphicswhizzes have already produced impressiveanimated videos of drone UFOs. For onefine example, see the admittedly hoaxedvideo at www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBEYc5OUUtw.

Hall served in theU.S. Air Force and attended T ulaneUniversity before taking a job with theNational Investigations Committee onAerial Phenomena (NICAP) in Wash-ington, DC, in 1958. At that time,NICAP was the largest and most influ-ential UFO group in the U.S. Hall even-tually became NICAP's assistant direc-tor, working under NICAP DirectorMaj. Donald Keyhoe of the founding fathers of contem-porary UFOlogy, whose sensationalistmagazine articles and books, such asFlying Saucers from Outer Space, helpedcreate the public's belief in alien visitors. Hall is best known as the author of The UFO Evidence (1964), a com- pendium of carefully selected best casesin the NICAP files. Upon publication,the book was sent to every member ofCongress in hopes of attracting interest inthe UFO mystery. When Keyhoe wasousted from NICAP in 1969, Hall fol- lowed, leaving full-time UFOlogy to take jobs as a technical writer and editor. Heremained active with other UFO groupssuch as MUFON and the Fund for UFOResearch. He also wrote numerous pub-lished articles on other subjects, especiallyCivil War history. Dick, as he was always known, was a strong supporter of the ExtraterrestrialHypothesis for UFOs and had a reputa-tion for contentiousness. He was oftenfeuding not only with skeptics but withmany UFO believers. The few times Imet him, Dick was polite but clearlyhad a very low tolerance for UFO skep-ticism. Like so many in the UFO field,he believed that the evidence was \"outthere\" for anyone to see if only theywould open their eyes. That his UFO Evidence falls far short of the require- ments of science was something DickHall was unable to understand.

Why wouldboosting the amount of oxygen in thebrain have any effect? Before completely dismissing the possibility of hyperbaric therapy, how-ever, we should take note of one studyconducted by Dr. Daniel Rossignol ofFlorida's International Child Develop-ment Resource Center. His team exam-ined fifty-six children between the agesof two and seven, all of whom had somedegree of autism. Following forty one-hour treatments in a hyperbaric cham-ber, almost one-third of the childrenwere reported to have significantly in-creased functioning. While the results are interesting, the study had several important limitations,including the very small sample size andthe fact that the experiment was notdouble-blinded, since the childrens' par-ents, who were the ones rating any im-provement in function, knew whethertheir child had been exposed to the realtherapy or not. Furthermore, hyperbarictreatments are expensive; a course of treat-ments matching those in the study couldcost over $30,000. As dubious as hyperbaric therapy is, it does have one advantage over mostother therapies: it is harmless (except, ofcourse, to the pocketbook). Until andunless better-controlled studies are con-ducted, the efficacy of the therapyremains unproven and unlikely. /hwysquare Hyperbaric Therapy for Autism: Airy Promises 24 VOLUME 34, ISSUE 1 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER Image: WikipediaSI Jan Feb 2010 pgs 11/12/09 10:21 AM Page 24SKEPTICAL INQUIRER January / February 2010 25In 1971, President Nixon and Congress declared war on cancer.

She argues that there has been very littleoverall progress in the war on cancer. In this article, I will focus on adult cancer, since child can- cer makes up less than 1 percent of all cancer diagnosed. I willthen place the facts in proper perspective after an overview ofthe epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment (especially withsmart drugs) of adult cancer in the United States. The Cancer Facts Figure 1 shows the ten biggest killers in the United States in 2006. Cancer (23 percent) has almost caught up with heart dis-ease. Figure 2 shows the death rates from cancer in men andwomen (adjusted for the size and age of the population) since1975; the cancer death rates have declined in men but not inwomen. The decline in men is largely due to fewer lung cancerdeaths in men due to less smoking (see figure 3). However, therewere about 200,000 more deaths from cancer in 2006 than1975 because of the substantial increase in the U.S. population. These summary statistics show that the war on cancer has not gone well. This is in marked contrast to death rates fromstroke and cardiovascular disease (adjusted for the age and sizeof the population), which have fallen by 74 percent and 64percent, respectively, from 1950 through 2006; and by 60 per-cent and 52 percent, respectively, from 1975 through 2006(Kolata 2009a). These excellent results against stroke and heartdisease are mainly due to improvements in drug therapy, espe-cially the control of high blood pressure to prevent stroke andthe use of statins, aspirin, beta blockers, calcium channel block-ers, and ACE inhibitors (now all generic) to prevent and treatheart disease. Cancer therapy is clearly decades behind. However,these data conceal a great deal of useful information and do notprovide guidance on how to make progress against cancer.

For example, there are several typesof detection bias. First, if one discovers amalignant tumor very early and starts ther-apy immediately, even if the therapy isworthless, it will appear that the patient liveslonger than a second patient (with an identi-cal tumor) treated with another worthlessdrug if the cancer in the second patient wasdetected later. Second, detection bias canalso occur with small tumors, especially ofthe breast and prostate, that would not harmthe patient if left untreated but can lead tounnecessary and sometimes mutilating ther-apy. Another type is publication bias, wherebypositive studies (especially those funded bythe pharmaceutical industry) tend to be pub-lished while negative studies do not. What is cancer? Cancer is a large group of diseases characterized by the uncontrolledgrowth and spread of abnormal cells locally, regionally, and/ordistantly (metastatically) (American Cancer Society 2009). Acarcinoma (cancer) in situ is a small cancer that has notinvaded the local tissue. Some cancers grow very slowly, andthe patient may survive for ten years or more with minimaltreatment. Other cancers (e.g., lung and pancreas) growquickly and, even today, kill more than half of the patients inless than one year (see table 2) (American Cancer Society2009). The therapy for cancer is generally surgery, if possible,and/or chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. Chemo-therapy aims to kill the cancer cells, but most chemotherapeu-tic drugs are nonspecific and also kill sensitive normal cells,especially in the intestine and bone marrow. Radiation therapyis also nonspecific. In chemotherapy and radiation therapy, apartial response is defined as shrinkage of the tumor in eachTobacco Use in the U.S., 1900-2005 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER January / February 2010 27Table 2 Common Cancers Current Death and Survival Statistics (American Cancer Society 2009) Cancer Origin Percent of One-Year Five-Year Cancer Deaths Survival (%) Survival (%) Lung 28 41 15 Colon/Rectum 9 83 64Breast 8 >95 89Pancreas 6 24 5Prostate 5 * *Leukemia ** 51Lymphoma 4 82 68Liver 3 <10Other 33 *Survival statistics for prostate cancer are very misleading since they include many treated cancers that would not haveharmed (or killed) the patient (see text). **Leukemia is a heterogenous group of diseases.

Median survivalis the length of time in which one-half of the patients in acohort die. What Do We Know about Cancer? The \"causes\" of cancer are shown in table 3 (American Cancer Society 2009), though there is still much we don't know. Forexample, we do not know exactly how smoking causes cancer; inmost cases, we do not know how \"acquired\" mutations cause can-cer. In some cancers, there are more than five hundred identifiablegenetic abnormalities\u2014no one knows which one(s), if any, is\"causative\" (Downing 2009). The importance of epigeneticchanges is currently speculative. It is quite possible that there is acompletely unknown causal mechanism in many cancers. The diagnosis of cancer today is relatively straightforward with imaging techniques (x-ray, CAT, MRI, PET) and biopsiesthat are subjected to routine histology, electron microscopy,and immunological techniques. Cancer Therapy To have a reasonable discussion of cancer therapy, we need to agree on the objectives of therapy (Fojo and Grady 2009), asshown in table 4. Everyone agrees that meaningful prolongationof life, preferably complete surgical removal of the tumor andcure, is a high priority. The treatment should also improve thequality of life. But, as is well known, many chemotherapeuticand radiation regimens cause mild to devastating\u2014even fatal\u2014side effects. Nathan (2007) compares conventional chemother-apy to \"carpet-bombing,\" an extreme but realistic metaphor.Finally, the results of a cost-benefit analysis must be reasonable(Fojo and Grady 2009). (In some cases, justifiably and impor-tantly, chemotherapy and/or radiation and/or other drugs areused as palliative measures exclusively to counter symptomsfrom the disease [e.g., pleural effusions in the chest cavity orbone pain] or from the treatments [e.g., vomiting, mucositis,low white blood counts, heart failure, nerve damage, diarrhea,and/or inflammation of the bladder]). In the final analysis, whatcounts are the criteria in table 4. Partial or even complete remis-sions, unless they prolong life and/or improve the overall qual-ity of life at a reasonable cost, are scientifically interesting but oflittle use to the patient. Currently there are a few metastatic cancers that can some- times be cured with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy,but unfortunately these cures make up a very small percentageof the whole cancer problem. These cancers include testicularcancer, choriocarcinoma, Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lym-phoma, leukemia, and rare cases of breast and ovarian cancer.A few cancers can be made into chronic diseases that requiredaily treatment, e.g., chronic myelogenous leukemia. Returning to table 2, lung cancer, the most common cancer, is a devastating disease; if the surgeon cannot totally remove it,the diagnosis is grim. In fact, about 60 percent of lung cancerpatients are dead within one year of diagnosis with the bestavailable therapy, and only 15 percent survive five years. There has been some progress in the death rate from colo- rectal cancer (figures 4 and 5), especially in women. This ismainly due to earlier diagnosis and surgical therapy. Cancer of the breast is often a slow cancer and has a five- to ten-year median survival rate with just surgical therapy. As canbe seen in figure 5, there has been a modest decline in deathrates from breast cancer since 1975. It is worth noting that cur-rently, if the breast cancer is metastatic, five-year survival is only27 percent (American Cancer Society 2009). However, breastcancer presents a serious dilemma. Early detection of invasivebreast cancer by screening is good; however, about 62,000 casesof ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) are also discovered everyyear (American Cancer Society 2009). In greater than 50 per-cent of these women, especially older women, these lesions willnot progress and do not need treatment. However, it is difficultto predict who will not need therapy, so the American CancerSociety (2009) recommends all patients with DCIS undergotherapy\u2014generally breast surgery. Thus, more than thirty thou-sand patents annually are unnecessarily treated (Evans et al. 2009). We need to figure out which DCIS are harmless inorder to avoid unnecessary treatment. On balance, I feel thatbreast cancer screening has a small but positive net benefit(Esserman et al. 2009). Pancreatic cancer is devastating (see table 2 and figures 4 and 5), and little progress has been made against it since 1975.Pancreatic cancer is very challenging because the tumors aresurrounded by dense fibrous connective tissue with few bloodvessels (Olson and Hanahan 2009). Because of this, it is diffi-cult to deliver drugs to pancreatic tumors. Moreover, thisexplains in part why chemotherapy is so ineffective for pan- Table 4 Criteria for Utility of Cancer Therapy (Fojo and Grady 2009) 1) Meaningful prolongation of life or cure (mortality) 2) Improvement of quality of life (symptoms)3) Value of treatment (compared to cost) Table 5 Bevacizumab (Avastin)\u2014Utility Cancer Evidence for Pr olongation of life; time* Bowel/ Yes, four months (median survival) Rectum with other drugs Lung No + Breast No Kidney No Glioblastoma (Brain) No *Compared to randomized control (if available) +\"No\" means a lack of a statistically significant pr olongation SI Jan Feb 2010 pgs 11/12/09 10:23 AM Page 28SKEPTICAL INQUIRER January / February 2010 29creatic cancer (see table 2). Better animal models are needed. Prostate cancer mortality has declined slightly since 1975 with an unexplained increase in the mid-1990s (see figure 4). But prostate cancer therapy also presents a serious quandary.At autopsy, approximately 30 percent (or more) of men havecancer foci in their prostate glands, yet only 1 to 2 percent ofmen die of prostate cancer. Thus less than 10 percent ofprostate cancer patients require treatment. This presents a seri-ous dilemma: whom should the physician treat? Moreover,recently, two large studies of prostate cancer screening withprostate specific antigen (PSA) have seriously questioned theutility of screening. In one study, the investigators had toscreen over a thousand men before they saved one life. This ledto about fifty \"false positive\" patients who often underwentsurgery and/or radiation therapy unnecessarily (Schr\u00f6der et al.2009). The second study, conducted in the United States, wasnegative (Andriole et al. 2009), i.e., no lives were saved due to the screening, but many of the screening-positive patients withprostate cancer were treated. Welch and Albertson (2009) andBrawley (2009) estimate that more than a million men in the U.S. have been unnecessarily treated for prostatecancer between 1986 and 2005, due to over-diag-nostic PSA screening tests. In the end, screening forprostate cancer will not be useful until methods aredeveloped to determine which prostate cancersdetected by screening will harm the patient (W elch and Albertson 2009; Brawley 2009). Many men\u2014especially ofprostate cancer elect \"watchful waiting\" with no ther-apy, a rational strategy (Esserman et al. 2009). There are many other things we do not under- stand about cancer\u2014even on a phenomenologicallevel. For example, in the United States, the inci-dence and death rates from cancer of the stomachhave fallen dramatically since 1930 (see figures 4and 5). The reason for this is unknown but may bedue to changes in food preservation; it is not dueto treatment. Smart Drugs David Nathan (2007) extols the virtues and poten- tial of the new \"smart drugs.\" Smart drugs aredefined as drugs that focus on a particular vulnerabil-ity of the cancer; they are not generalized but ratherspecific toxins. But the Journal of the American Medical Association (Health Agencies Update 2009)reports that 90 percent of the drugs or biologicsapproved by the FDA in the past four years for can-cer (many of them smart drugs) cost more than$20,000 for twelve weeks of therapy, and manyoffer a survival benefit of only two months or less(Fojo and Grady 2009). Let us take bevacizumab(Avastin), the ninth largest selling drug in America($4.8 billion in 2008), costing about $8,000 permonth per patient (Keim 2008). Bevacizumab, aputative smart drug, is an intravenous man-madeantibody that blocks the action of vascular endothe-lial growth factor (VEFG). It sometimes worksbecause tumors (and normal tissues) release VEFGto facilitate small blood vessel in-growth into thetumor. These small blood vessels \"nourish\" thetumor (or normal tissue). The idea is to \"starve\" thegrowing tumor with once or twice monthly intra-venous injections of bevacizumab. The FDA has approved bevacizumab for the cancers listed in table 5 (Physicians Desk Reference Cancer Incidence Rates* Among Men, U.S., 1930-2005 *Age-adjusted to the 2000 U.S. standard population Sources: U.S. Mortality Data 1960-2005, U.S. Mortality Volumes 1930-1959, National Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2008100 80 604020 0Rate per 100,000 StomachLung and Bronchus Colon RectumProstate Liver Leukemia1930 193519401945195019551960196519701975198019851990199520002005 Figure 4 Figure 5Cancer Incidence Rates* Among Women, U.S., 1930-2005 *Age-adjusted to the 2000 US standard population Sources: U.S. Mortality Data 1960-2005, U.S. Mortality Volumes 1930-1959, National Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2008100 80 604020 0Rate per 2010 pgs 11/12/09 10:23 Page 2930 VOLUME 34, ISSUE 1 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER[PDR] 2009; Health Agencies Update 2009). Since the median survival of colorectal cancer is eighteen months, beva-cizumab therapy would cost about $144,000 (in such apatient) for four months prolongation of survival (Keim2008). In the other cancers in table 4, there is no prolongationof survival. Moreover, bevacizumab can have terrible sideeffects, including gastrointestinal perforations, serious bleed-ing, severe hypertension, clot formation, and delayed woundhealing (PDR 2009). By the criteria in table 4, bevacizumab isat best a marginal drug. It only slightly prolongs life, demon-strable only in colorectal cancer, has serious side effects, and isvery expensive. Bevacizumab is frequently cited as an example of the so- called newer smart drugs. But by interfering with small bloodvessel growth throughout the body, it is a nonspecific toxin\u2014and hence has serious side effects. It is not so different fromthe older non-specific chemotherapy. The use of bevacizumab and similar drugs raises another issue. According to Gina Kolata, 60 to 80 percent of oncolo-gists' revenue comes from infusion of anti-cancer drugs in theiroffices. Many believe that such economic incentives are the rea-son for the substantial overuse of expensive chemotherapeuticdrugs (Kolata 2009c). However, it is very difficult to documentthe extent of the overuse of cancer chemotherapy. Does it makesense to employ such expensive drugs that do not prolong life(see table 5) and have such serious side effects (Fojo and Grady2009)? Moreover, although VEGF and bevacizumab are inter-esting science, there has been gross exaggeration of beva-cizumab's clinical utility in the press (see tables 4 and 5). So why does the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approve bevacizumab (and other drugs) that do notimprove longevity and/or the quality of life (see table 5)? Theanswer is that bevacizumab coupled with other drugs cancause partial remissions, \"stabilization\" of the cancer, or \"lackof progression\" for several months. However, this often doesnot lead to prolongation of life in most of the cancers in table5. Moreover, many patients pay a heavy price in terms of sideeffects and cost. It is also worth noting that several Europeannational regulatory authorities do not accept the utility ofsome of these smart drugs and do not license them for sale intheir countries. In agreement with the Europeans, scientists atthe U.S. National Cancer Institute are urging the oncologycommunity, regulators, and the public to set limits on the useand pricing of such marginal drugs (Fojo and Grady 2009).They view the current situation as unsustainable. Why Has the War on Cancer Failed? As documented above, unlike the successes against heart dis- ease and stroke, the war on cancer, after almost forty years,must be deemed a failure with a few notable exceptions(Watson 2009). Why? Is it because cancer is an incrediblytough problem, or are there other explanations? In table 6, Ihave listed six reasons for the failure, although there is littledoubt that effective, safe therapy of the various cancers is a dif-ficult problem. Where Should We Go from Here? In my view the principal problem is that we just do not under- stand the causes of most cancers. We don't even know if theproblem is genetic or epigenetic or something totallyunknown. In theory, problems 2 through 6 in table 6 are allcorrectable with political and scientific will and more knowl-edge. Even though we know cancer of the lung is caused bycigarette smoking, we do not know the mechanism, and(except for surgery) we do not know how to meaningfullyintervene (see table 2).

Wewill make no progress if there are five hundred or more geneticabnormalities in a single cancer cell. Where would one begin? What Should We Do Now? We can still do a lot even today (see table 7). Smoking and hormone replacement therapy are a cause of lung and breastcancer, respectively, and should be stopped or minimized. Forhepatitis B (which causes over 50 percent of liver cancer)(Chang et al. 2009) and papilloma virus (which causes almostall cervical cancer and some anal and mouth cancers), we canvaccinate with vaccines that are essentially 100 percent effec- tive. Helicobacter (the probable cause of some stomach cancer) can be easily eliminated with antibiotics. Prophylactic finas- teride and tamoxifen (both generic) can decrease prostate andbreast cancer, respectively (in high risk patients). We must alsodecrease alcohol intake (liver and esophageal cancer) and obe-sity. Obesity is associated with increased cancer risk but themechanism, if causal, is obscure (Dobson 2009). We can screen for cervical, colorectal, and breast cancer, although the value of breast cancer screening is not clear (dueto overdiagnosis), as I discussed above (Singer 2009). How-ever, in my view, the benefit of breast cancer screening slightlyoutweighs the harm. For example, if DCIS treatment could berationalized and provided only to those who need it, breastcancer screening would then be unarguably useful. Allattempts to screen for lung cancer, even in smokers, have so farbeen futile (Infante et al. 2009).If all these recommendations were followed, we could cut cancer deaths in half. Moreover, with better mechanistic understanding of cancer, we could make truly \"smart\" drugs,as has been done in recent years for atherosclerosis (heartattacks), hypertension (strokes), gastrointestinal diseases(ulcers), and AIDS\u2014with truly remarkable results. Let ushope cancer is next. /hwysquare Acknowledgments I wish to thank Michiko Spector for her help in preparation of this man- uscript and Dr. June Spector for her critical reading of the manuscript.

In a sense, looking at cancer treatmentfrom a large scale\u2014looking at thewhole nation or the whole world\u2014the overall progress is minimal. How-ever, from a personal perspective, thedifference is noticeable. As I can tell, Dr. Spector is not an oncologist. My view of effective treat-ment in cancer is not necessarily a cureor prolonged survival. I have patients with very sympto- matic cancer, who are not able to swal-low from esophageal cancer, not ableto chew due to head and neck cancer,not able to ambulate due to diffusebone pain from multiple myeloma orprostate cancer, not able to speak ormove one of their limbs due to a braintumor, not able to breathe due to lungcancer. Many of those patients im-proved with treatment\u2014they areswallowing better, walking into theclinic on their own, able to chew andenjoy food, and able to greet me orshake hands with me due to treatmentof their brain tumor. I know treat-ments may not extend the lifeexpectancy of many of these patients,but I know that when their tumorswere responding to treatments, theirlives were improved. These are gratify-ing experiences for physicians treatingcancer patients. Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer used to succumb to their diseasewithin a few months when I was a fel-low at UCLA. Now I expect thesepatients to live about two years.Patients with chronic myeloid leu-kemia used to expire within a few shortyears. Now I do not know how longthey are going to live. Then there are patients who beat all the odds and survive. I treated aretired chemistry professor with stageIIIB lung cancer in 1999. The mediansurvival for patients with his stage ofdisease is only about ten months. Heis still alive today and doing very well.Years ago, I had a patient with diffusemetastatic disease from his lung can-cer. He did not respond well tochemotherapy, and I discussed hispoor prognosis with him. He decidedto go into hospice care but his wifeasked me to give him something forhis appetite. I prescribed thalidomidefor him. Almost three months later,his name showed up on my clinicschedule list and I thought someonehad made a mistake. He walked intoclinic looking so well that I was theone in shock. He continued to do verywell for almost two more years onthalidomide before the disease finallyreturned and killed him. He had agood life. I had a patient with a brain tumor whose daughter is now a fellow in thedivision of hematology/oncology. Heresponded to temozolomide so wellthat he recovered his ability to speakand walk and was able to make manytrips to Las Vegas just for fun. I believehis disease finally recurred almost twoyears into treatment. He had a good life. I am still following a young woman, now age twenty-seven, withmetastatic rectal cancer. She had manytreatments. Concurrent chemoradi-ation followed by surgery for primaryrectal cancer, then metastatic liverlesion, then radiofrequency to anotherliver lesion. Her boyfriend left her,and she went into a deep depression.This all happened within the first yearof diagnosis. She is now almost threeyears out from the initial diagnosiswith no detectable recurrence. She isdoing well. There are many other sim-ilar personal stories, and that is thereason why I can continue doing myjob. As an oncologist treating all walks of life, every patient is a book to readand an adventure we share. Most of my patients have died, but many ofthem had a good, enjoyable life beforethe end. Some are particularly memo-rable. The progress I have experiencedthe past twelve years, as a foot soldierconstantly standing at the front linefighting cancer one patient at a time,is very rewarding. Unfortunately, a rewarding per- sonal experience does not translateinto a global improvement in cancercare. From a health policy point, theimprovement in cancer treatment out-come versus cost is hard to justify. ButI also have no doubt that many of mypatients benefited from treatments;they did not necessarily live longer, butthey lived better for the time they had. There are some points where I think Dr. Spector is not correct. Forexample, we do not know if tomixifenreally prevents breast cancer. It mayonly delay the development of breastcancer. We also do not know if estro-gen replacement therapy causes breastcancer. The general thinking is thatestrogen may not cause breast cancerbut simply promote the growth of asmall breast cancer. One interestingthing Dr. Spector did not mention isthat women with a background ofusing estrogen who develop breastcancer seem to live longer, or survivelonger, with their breast cancer thanthose women with breast cancer whohave never used estrogen. These are just some of my thoughts. /hwysquare Fa-Chyi Lee, MD, is associate professor ofmedicine at the University of NewMexico Health Sciences Center, Divisionof Hematology/Oncology, Albuquerque,NM, and an oncologist in the UNMCancer Research and Treatment Center.

I guess what they're trying to say is that something must have been wrong in the first place to allow the disease to develop. But they don't have any better insight into what that somethingmight be than scientific medicine. All they have is wild, imagi-native guesses. And they all disagree with one another. The chi-ropractor says that if your spine is in proper alignment, you can'tget sick. Acupuncturists talk about the proper flow of qi through the meridians. Energy medicine practitioners talk about distur-bances in energy fields. Nutrition faddists claim that people whoeat right won't get sick. None of them can produce any evidenceto support these claims. No alternative medicine has been sci-entifically shown to prevent disease or cure it. If it had, it wouldhave been incorporated into conventional medicine and wouldno longer be \"alternative.\" Are these practitioners treating the underlying cause, or are they simply applying their one chosen tool to treat everything?Chiropractors treat every patient with chiropractic adjust-ments. What if a doctor used one treatment for everything? Youhave pneumonia? Here's some penicillin. You have penicillin. You have diabetes? Here's somepenicillin. Acupuncturists only know to stick needles in people.Homeopaths only know to give out ridiculously high dilutionsthat amount to nothing but water. Therapeutic touch practi-tioners only know to smooth out the wrinkles in imaginaryenergy fields. They are not trying to determine any underlyingcause; they are just using one treatment indiscriminately. How do you define \"cause\"? We don't know what causes gravity, but we understand enough about how it works to over-come it with elevators, airplanes, and rockets to the moon. Wemay not know what ultimately causes asthma, but we knowenough about the causes of airway constriction and inflamma-tion to devise effective treatments. Let's take a simple example: strep throat. The symptom is throat pain. Doctors don't just treat the pain; they do a throatculture, they determine that a strep infection is causing thepain, and they treat the infection with an antibiotic. But whatcaused the strep infection? The body had to host the bacteriaand respond to their presence by developing symptoms; thebacteria had to be capable of multiplying in the human body.The patient had to be exposed to another person who had astrep infection, who in turn had caught it from someone else,involving a chain of social and epidemiologic causes. The bac-teria had to evolve from ancestor bacteria and the human fromancestor animals. And so on. So you see, it involves a chain of causation and there can even be several simultaneous causes. \"Cause\" can mean prettymuch anything you want it to. But however you look at it,doctors definitely do not \"just treat symptoms.\" Philosophy has studied causation. Aristotle said everything had four causes: material, formal, efficient, and final. And heintroduced complications: proper (prior) causation and acci-dental (chance) causation. Potential or actual, particular orgeneric. Reciprocal or circular causality as a relation of mutualdependence or influence of cause upon effect. The same thingas the cause of contrary effects when its presence and absenceresult in different outcomes. He recognized that the subject ofcausation was complicated. Alternative providers are more \"simple\" minded. They often claim to know the one true cause of all disease, which is curiousbecause medical science defines several categories of causes fallingunder the mnemonic VINDICATE: V - Vascular I - - Drugs/toxinsI - - Congenital/developmentalA - AutoimmuneT - T raumaE - Endocrine/metabolic And sometimes more than one cause is involved (e.g., a trau- matic injury gets infected). Where science finds complexity, alter- native medicine imagines simplicity. As H.L. Mencken said,\"For every complex problem, there is an answer that is clear, sim-ple\u2014and wrong.\" Some homeopaths claim to treat \"genetic\" illness, tracing its origins to six main genetic causes: tuberculosis, syphilis,gonorrhea, psora (scabies), cancer, and leprosy. Bet you didn'tknow tuberculosis was genetic! Neither did I. Science classifiesall these as infectious except for cancer, which is neoplastic.Homeopathy disregards science and redefines genetic to suit its own inscrutable purposes. Science finds many causes for disease and sometimes more than one cause for a given disease. Pseudoscience has identifiedthe one true cause of all disease\u2014many times. I did an Internetsearch and found sixty-seven single causes of all disease (seeaccompanying box). This is not an exhaustive list but rather anexhausted list (I stopped when I got tired of searching). It never seems to bother proponents of alternative medicine that others have found different \"one true\" causes. In his book Harriet Hall is a retired physician.

One insisted that the number-one health problem in the United States is magnesium defi-ciency; another was convinced that the expanded use ofacupuncture could revolutionize medicine; and so it wentaround the table, with each touting his or her preferred ther-apy. But there was no sense of conflict or rivalry. As eachspoke, the others would nod in agreement. The purpose of theOAM, I began to realize, was to demonstrate that these dis-parate therapies all work. It was my first glimpse of what holdsalternative medicine together: there is no internal dissent in acommunity that feels itself besieged from the outside. When scientists encounter two mutually exclusive claims, it bothers them. They experience cognitive dissonance and try diligently to find evidence to reject one of the hypotheses andleave a winner. They eventually reach a consensus. Alternative medicine pseudoscientists don't seem to mind cognitive disso-nance. They are content to look for evidence to support theirown chosen treatment while blithely disregarding competingclaims. They don't want to look for evidence that somethingdoesn't work. While each claims to know the one cause of dis- ease, they don't seem interested in looking for the one truth. Live and let live? Create your own reality? T ruth is only rel- ative? The same thing may be simultaneously true for me andfalse for you? Maybe it boils down to a mutual tolerance ofdelusions (okay, I'll believe that you are Jesus if you believe thatI'm Napoleon).

Some argue that there exists overwhelming evidence either for or againstthe psi hypothesis, while others believe that it simply isn'tpossible to answer the question one way or the other. One ofthe main obstacles to closure on the psi question involves theway in which null results are viewed (Alcock 2003). Manyparapsychologists have adopted a \"heads I win, tails youlose\" approach to their work, viewing positive results as sup-portive of the psi hypothesis while ensuring that null resultsdo not count as evidence against it.'Heads I Win, T ails Y ou Lose' How Parapsychologists Nullify Null Results Parapsychologists have tended to view positive results as supportive of the psi hypothesis while ensuring that null results don't count as evidence against it. Here's how this self-deceptive process works and four suggestions to overcome it. RICHARD WISEMANSI Jan Feb 2010 pgs 11/12/09 10:35 AM Page 36SKEPTICAL INQUIRER January / February 2010 37Cherry-Picking New Procedures Parapsychologists frequently create and test new experimental procedures in an attempt to produce laboratory evidence forpsi. Most of these studies do not yield significant results.However, rather than being seen as evidence against the exis-tence of psychic ability, such null findings are usually attrib-uted to the experiment being carried out under conditions thatare not psi-conducive. They are either never published (the\"filedrawer effect,\" see Douglas M. Stokes, \"The ShrinkingFiledrawer,\" SI, May/June 2001) or are quietly forgotten evenif they make it into a journal or conference proceeding. Oncein a while one of these studies produces significant results.Such studies frequently contain potential methodological arti-facts, in part because they are using new procedures that haveyet to be scrutinized by the research community. In addition,the evidential status of these positive findings is problematic tojudge because they have emerged from a mass of nonsignifi-cant studies. Nevertheless, they are more likely than non-significant studies to be presented at a conference or publishedin a journal, usually viewed by proponents as tentative evi-dence for psi, acting as a catalyst for further work. To my knowledge, only one paper has revealed an insight into the potential scale of this problem. Watt (2006) summa-rized all of the psi-related final-year undergraduate projectsthat have been supervised by staff at Edinburgh University'sKoestler Parapsychology Unit between 1987 and 2007. Watttracked down thirty-eight projects, twenty-seven of which pre-dicted overall significant performance on a psi task with theremainder predicting significant differences between experi-mental conditions. The work examined a range of new andestablished procedures, including, for example, dowsing for ahidden penny, the psychokinetic control of a visual display ofa balloon being driven by a fan onto spikes, presentiment ofphotographs depicting emotional facial expressions, detectingthe emotional state of a sender in a telepathy experiment,ganzfeld studies, and card guessing. Interestingly, Watt's paperalso demonstrated a reporting bias. Only seven of the thirty-eightstudies had made it into the public domain, presented as papersat conferences held by the Parapsychological Association. All of these papers had predicted overall significant performance onthe psi task. There was a strong tendency for parapsychologiststo make public those studies that had obtained positive find-ings, with just over 70 percent (five out of seven) of the stud-ies presented at conferences showing an overall significantresult, versus just 15 percent (three out of twenty) of those thatremained unreported. Watt's analysis, although informative,underestimates the total number of psi-related studies under-taken at Edinburgh University because it did not include pro-jects undertaken by students prior to their final year, experi-ments run by postgraduate students and staff, or any workconducted before 1987. Multiply these figures by the numberof parapsychologists who have conducted and supervised psiresearch across the world over the last sixty years or so, and thescale of the issue becomes apparent. Explain Away Unsuccessful Attempted Replications If a procedure seems to yield significant psi effects, additional follow-up studies using that procedure are conducted.Although these additional studies occasionally take the form ofstrict replications, they usually involve some form of variation.If these follow-up studies obtain significant results, they areoften the subject of considerable debate: proponents arguethat the findings represent evidence of psi, and skeptics scruti-nize the work for possible methodological and statistical short-comings. However, any failure to replicate can be attributed tothe procedural modifications rather than to the nonexistenceof psi. Perhaps the most far-reaching version of this \"get out ofa null effect free\" card involves an appeal to the \"experimenter effect,\" wherein any negative findings are attributed to the psi- inhibited nature of the parapsychologist running the study. This nullifying of null findings permeates parapsychological literature. For example, Kanthamani and Broughton (1994)report a large-scale attempt to replicate the alleged ganzfeldtelepathy effect, wherein one participant (referred to as areceiver) experiences a mild form of sensory deprivation and isthen asked to identify a target being viewed by another person(a sender) in a distant location. Parapsychologists haveemployed various types of targets in these experiments, includ-ing photographs and drawings (static targets) and video clips(dynamic targets). In the studies described by Kanthamani andBroughton, the target material consisted of randomly chosenpictures (mainly postcard-sized art prints). The project involveda huge amount of work: researchers ran a series of experimentsover a six-year period and conducted more than 350 individualganzfeld sessions. The studies yielded a nonsignificant cumula-tive effect. However, Kanthamani and Broughton spent no timediscussing whether this null finding might act as evidence againstthe psi hypothesis and instead simply concluded that \"it is prob-ably safe to say that static picture targets remain a less than idealchoice for ganzfeld experiments.\" Once again, this process represents the \"heads I win, tails you lose\" principle.

Data Mining In addition to explaining away null findings via allegedly failed procedural modifications, some parapsychologists also adopt an\"any anomaly will do\" attitude and data mine in an attempt toproduce some kind of psi-related result. Although such posthoc data mining might help guide future work, it has little ifany evidential value. Nevertheless, parapsychologists often pre-sent it as tentative evidence in support of the psi hypothesis. Willin's (1996) description of his ganzfeld psi studies pre- sents a striking example of this process at work. Willin con- ducted one hundred ganzfeld sessions over a fifteen-month period, taking the unusual step of using musical clips as targets.The study obtained a nonsignificant result. However, ratherthan explore whether this null finding counts as evidenceagainst the psi hypothesis, Willin conducted a series of post hocanalyses, exploring, for example, the relationship between par-ticipants' psi scores and their age, profession, hobbies, previousparanormal experiences, and relationship with the person act-ing as the sender. Additional analyses explored psi scoring as afunction of the month and time of day each trial was con-ducted. Most of these analyses yielded inconclusive results, butWillin eventually found that trials conducted early in theexperiment obtained a higher hit rate than those conductedlater and suggested that this might have been due to \"less inter-est being shown by the Receivers and the Senders or by anunintentional goat effect being displayed by the Experimenter.\" This type of data mining again shows the \"heads I win, tails you lose\" principle in action, with any null effects being nulli-fied by the apparent discovery of post hoc findings. Meta-Analyses and Retrospective Data Selection After several studies have been conducted using a new proce- dure, parapsychologists usually carry out some form of meta-analytic review of the work. If the combined outcome of thestudies is significant, the meta-analysis is usually the subject ofconsiderable debate, with proponents believing that the findingrepresents evidence of psi and skeptics arguing that it may havea normal explanation (including, for example, publication bias,inappropriate inclusion criteria, and poor methodology).However, if the cumulative effect is nonsignificant, parapsy-chologists often attribute this null effect to the non-psi-con-ducive procedural variations described in the preceding section. Perhaps more important, the procedurally heterogeneous collection of studies usually presents parapsychologists with anopportunity to \"explain away\" overall null effects by retrospec-tively identifying a subset of studies that used a certain proce-dure and yielded a significant cumulative effect. A striking illustration of this occurred in the late 1990s during a meta-analytic debate surrounding the ganzfeld psistudies. In 1999, Milton and Wiseman published a meta-analysis of all ganzfeld studies that were begun after 1987 andpublished by the start of 1997, and they noted that the cumu-lative effect was both small and nonsignificant (Milton andWiseman 1999). Some parapsychologists criticized this analy-sis, arguing that they had included all of the ganzfeld studies conducted during this period and that they should have insteadfocused on those that had employed a \"standard\" procedure developed by parapsychologist Charles Honorton and his col-leagues during a seminal set of ganzfeld studies conducted atthe Psychophysical Research Laboratory (PRL) in the late1980s. The difficulties with this approach became clear whenresearchers were unable to settle on what would constitute a\"standard\" set of procedures (Schmeidler and Edge 1999).Eventually, Bem, Palmer, and Broughton (2001) set out totackle this issue experimentally, asking several people to ratethe degree to which the studies in our analysis had employedHonorton's \"standard\" ganzfeld procedure and then correlat-ing their ratings against the effect size of each study. Ratherthan provide their own description of this \"standard\" proce-dure, Bem, Palmer, and Broughton had the raters read relevantsections in two previous papers describing the PRL studies.However, they also added a series of additional conditions,informing their raters, for example: You should treat as standard the use of artistic or creative sub- ject samples (as one of the most successful components of thePRL experiments used such a sample) or subjects having hadprevious psi experiences or having practiced a mental disci-pline such as meditation (as such subjects were shown to bethe best scorers in the PRL experiments). The addition of participant selection as an allegedly \"standard\" condition was not mentioned in the method section of eitherof the papers describing the PRL work. As such, it could beseen as an excellent example of retrospective data fitting,wherein parapsychologists decide which studies to analyze (or,in this instance, the weight assigned to them) on the basis oftheir known outcome. Once again, it's the \"heads I win, tails you lose\" principle. A significant overall effect is seen as evidence for psi while a nulleffect initiates post hoc searching for pockets of significance. Decline Effects and Jumping Ship The alleged psi effects associated with a certain procedure fre- quently have a curious habit of fading over the course ofIn addition to explaining away null findings via allegedly failed procedural modifications, some parapsychologists also adopt an \"any anomaly will do\" attitude and data mine in an attempt to produce some kind of psi-related result.SI Jan Feb 2010 pgs 11/12/09 10:36 AM Page 38SKEPTICAL INQUIRER January / February 2010 39repeated experimentation. Skeptics argue that this is due to the parapsychologists identifying and minimizing potentialmethodological and statistical flaws over time. However, someparapsychologists have come up with creative ways of explain-ing away this potential threat, arguing that such decline effectsare either an inherent property of psi or that psychic abilityreally does exist but is inversely related to the level of experi-mental controls employed in a study (see Kennedy 2003 for areview of this approach). The decrease in alleged psi often causes some parapsychol- ogists to abandon ship in search of a new procedure, placingthem back at square one, ready to repeat history. This is not anew observation. For example, writing over thirty years ago,parapsychologist Joseph Gaither Pratt noted: One could almost pick a date at random since 1882 and find in the literature that someone somewhere had recentlyobtained results described in terms implying that others shouldbe able to confirm the findings. . . . One after another, how-ever, the specific ways of working used in these initially suc-cessful psi projects have fallen out of favor and faded from theresearch scene\u2014except for the latest investigations which, onemay reasonably suppose, have not yet had enough time to fal-ter and fade away as others before them have done. (Pratt 1978) This constant \"ship jumping\" is one of the defining features of psi research, with new paradigms emerging every decade or so.Take, for example, the different trends in ESP research thathave emerged over the years. Initial work, conducted betweenthe early 1930s and late 1950s, primarily involved card guess-ing experiments in which people were asked to guess the iden-tity of specially printed playing cards carrying one of five sim-ple symbols. By the mid-1960s parapsychologists had realizedthat such studies were problematic to replicate and so turnedtheir attention to dream telepathy and the possibility of par-ticipants predicting the outcome of targets selected bymachines. In the mid 1970s and early 1980s, the ganzfeldexperiments and remote viewing took over as dominant para-digms. In 1987, a major review of the area by parapsycholo-gists K. Ramakrishna Rao and John Palmer argued that twosets of ESP studies provided the best evidence for the replica-bility of psi: the ganzfeld experiments and the differential ESPeffect (wherein participants apparently score above chance inone condition of an experiment and below chance in another).More recently, parapsychologists have shifted their attention toalleged presentiment effects, wherein participants appear to beresponding to stimuli before they are presented. Finally, thereare now signs that the next new procedure is likely to adopt aneuropsychological perspective, focusing on EEG measure-ments or functional MRI scans as people complete psi tasks. Conclusion Parapsychologists have tended to adopt a \"heads I win, tails you lose\" approach to their work, viewing positive results assupportive of the psi hypothesis while ensuring that nullresults do not count as evidence against it. This involvescherry-picking new procedures from a mass of chance results,varying any allegedly \"successful\" procedures and then blam-ing these variations for any lack of replication, searching for pockets of post hoc significance whenever a meta-analysis pro-duces a null result, explaining away decline effects as an inher-ent property of psi, and finally jumping to the next newpromising procedure. This giddy process results in an ambigu-ous dataset that, just like the classic optical illusion of the oldhag and attractive young woman, never contains enoughinformation to allow closure in one direction or the other. To help the field move forward and rapidly reach closure on the psi question, parapsychologists need to make four impor-tant changes in the way they view null findings. First, theyshould stop trying lots of new procedures and cherry-pickingthose that seem to work and instead identify one or two thathave already yielded the most promising results. Second, ratherthan varying procedures that appear successful, they shouldinstead have a series of labs carry out strict replications that areboth methodologically sound and incorporate the most psi-con-ducive conditions possible. Third, researchers should avoid thetemptation for retrospective meta-analysis by pre-registering thekey details involved in each of the studies. And finally, researchersneed to stop jumping ship from one experimental procedure toanother and instead have the courage to accept the null hypoth-esis if the selected front-runners don't produce evidence of a sig-nificant and replicable effect. I hope that this process will help consign the psi debate to the history books and parapsychologists will no longer findthemselves sitting on the fence arguing the \"there is enoughevidence to justify further work but not enough to concludeone way or the other\" position. Rather than nullify nullresults, experimenters should be brave enough to give it theirbest shot and finally discover whether psi actually exists. /hwysquare References Alcock, J.E. 2003.

Its five-year objectives (1999-2003) also include a lit-tle-noticed item that the CSC activated after Kitzmiller: \"Legalreform movements base legislative proposals on design the-ory.\" Execution of this objective, which began in 2007 and wasaimed at state legislatures, succeeded in 2008 when Louisianaadopted legislation that was partially crafted by the CSC (CSC2008; Winkler-Schmit 2009). Most regrettably, however, the willingness of ID sympa- thizers at the state level to assist in promoting ID has causedtangible harm to an innocent person: Texas Director ofScience Christina Comer, who was fired in 2007 ostensibly forviolating the \"neutrality\" toward creationism that her employ-ers at the Texas Education Agency (TEA) required. This saddevelopment is ultimately the fruit of the CSC's relentless pur-suit of the Wedge Strategy. The Firing of Christina Comer Texas is a creationist's haven. The CSC has invested much time and energy there, such as when it tried to influence the TexasBoard of Education's (TBOE) selection of biology textbooks in2003 (Evans 2003). Several CSC fellows, most notably WilliamDembski and Walter Bradley, reside in Texas. The erstwhile chairof the Texas board, creationist dentist Don McLeroy, worksclosely with the CSC, whose operatives he called \"the creationistintelligent design people\" in a 2005 Sunday school sermon at hischurch (McLeroy 2005). In May 2009, McLeroy's confirmationas chair failed in the Texas Senate (Scharrer 2009) only after (andbecause) he and fellow creationist board members wreaked havocwith the state's science standards\u2014an episode in which the CSCwas involved (NCSE 2009c). However, although such antics arecommon in Texas, no one foresaw that the TEA would fireChristina Comer. McLeroy's self-avowed creationism alerted Texas pro-science advocates that creationists would attack the standards, the revi-sion of which was slated for 2008. In 2007, the T exas Observer discovered a recording of McLeroy's Sunday school lecture(Wilder 2007), in which he boasted about the CSC's assistanceduring the textbook flap: \"We had a bunch of the leaders:Dembski and all these people had come down to help us in thedebate\" (McLeroy 2005). Consequently, Governor Rick Perry'sJuly 2007 appointment of McLeroy as board chair spelled trou-ble. Kathy Miller, director of the Texas Freedom Network,warned, \"Dr. McLeroy will now be in charge of the board'sscheduled revision of the state's science curriculum standards,an area where he has already cast his lot with extremists whowant to censor what our schoolchildren learn\" (Stutz 2007).McLeroy's appointment catalyzed hostility toward teachingevolution at the highest levels of Texas educational leadership. In October 2007, Comer had been the director of science at the Texas Education Agency for nine years, after a longcareer as a science teacher. On October 23, she received an e-mail from Glenn Branch at the National Center for ScienceEducation announcing my lecture \"Inside Creationism'sT rojan Horse: A Closer Look at Intelligent Design,\" scheduledfor November 2 in Austin. After verifying my credentials viaan Internet search, she forwarded Branch's e-mail to severalindividuals and two small science education groups, as she had Barbara Forrest is a professor of philosophy at SoutheasternLouisiana University and co-author with Paul R. Gross ofCreationism's T rojan Horse: The Wedge of Intelligent Design.A Committee for Skeptical Inquiry fellow, her first-person reporton her testimony in the Dover trial, which ruled that intelligentdesign is not science, appeared in the January/February 2007S KEPTICAL INQUIRER and is reprinted in the new SI anthology Science Under Siege (Prometheus 2009). Texas is a creationist's haven. The Discovery Institute has invested much time and energy there, such as when it tried to influence the Texas Board of Education's selection of biology textbooks in 2003. SI Jan Feb 2010 pgs 11/12/09 10:41 AM Page 4142 VOLUME 34, ISSUE 1 SKEPTICAL INQUIRERin the past with similar announcements. She was soon sum- moned by her supervisor: \"Ms. Comer said that barely an forwarding the e-mail . . . about Dr. Forrest's talk, she was. . . informed that Lizzette Reynolds, deputy commissioner forstatewide policy and programs, had seen a copy and complained,calling it 'an offense that calls for termination'\" (Blumenthal2007; NCSE 2007). Reynolds, who worked for George W. Bushduring his governorship, had arrived at the Texas EducationAgency in January and had never met Comer (NPR 2007). What had Comer done that was so egregious? TEA em- ployee Monica Martinez, who wrote the termination memo,described her offense: The [forwarded] email states that the speaker [Barbara Forrest] is a board member of a science education organization[NCSE], and the email clearly indicates that the group opposesteaching creationism in public education. . . . Ms. Comer's email implies endorsement of the speaker and implies that TEA endorses the speaker's position on a subjecton which the agency must remain neutral. (Martinez 2007;Forrest 2008d) Comer was ordered to send out a retraction and was subse- quently forced to resign for violating the TEA's \"neutrality\" policy. However, Steven Schafersman of Texas Citizens forScience offers a more likely explanation for her firing: The real reason . . . Comer was forced to resign is because the top TEA administrators and some SBOE [State Board ofEducation] members wanted her out of the picture before thestate science standards . . . were reviewed, revised, and rewrit-ten . . . beginning in January 2008, and she would have someinfluence to make sure the standards were scientifically accu-rate and of high quality. (Schafersman 2007) The following timeline of events makes this explanation plausible: (1) Reynolds arrived at the TEA in January 2007. (2) McLeroy became TBOE chair in July 2007. (3) Reynoldsbecame head of the TEA's curriculum division in September2007. Comer reported that \"we were actually told in a meetingin September that if creationism is the party line, we have toabide by it\" (Heinauer 2008). (4) In November 2007, Comerwas fired. (5) Revision of the standards began in January 2008.On June 30, 2008, Comer sued the Texas Education Agency, contending that \"by professing 'neutrality,' the Agency credits creationism as a valid theory when it is actually a reli-gious belief\" (Christina Castillo Comer v. Robert Scott, Com-missioner, and T exas Education Agency 2008). Consequently, shecontended, the policy endorsed religion, meaning that Comerwas fired for violating an unconstitutional policy. She requestedreinstatement and an injunction against the policy. On March31, 2009, a federal judge dismissed her case (NCSE 2009a).The Discovery Institute issued a gloating response: \"Thank-fully, a judge has now tossed this stuntfrom court\" (Luskin 2009). This response reflects DI's callous-ness about the well-being of public school students and educa-tors. Comer's lawsuit addressed the genuine injustice that theTEA committed against one of its most dedicated employees.She lost both her job and the confidence of knowing that herstate appreciated her service. In August 2009, she appealed thedismissal (Christina Castill Comer v. Robert Scott, Commissioner,and T exas Education Agency 2009). The next step rests with the Fifth Circuit of Appeals. \"Academic Freedom\"\u2014ID Style Creationists have invoked \"academic freedom\" for decades, as young-earth creationist Henry Morris did in 1975: \"[Teachingboth evolution and . consistent with traditional principles ofreligious freedom, civil rights, freedom of information, scientificobjectivity, academic freedom, and constitutionality\" (Morris1975). Louisiana's 1981 Balanced T reatment of Creation-Science and Evolution-Science Act, which the U.S. SupremeCourt declared unconstitutional in 1987, was defended byLouisiana legislators and defense attorneys as protective of acad-emic freedom. The Court disagreed: \"'Academic freedom' doesnot encompass the right of a legislature to structure the publicschool curriculum in order to advance a particular religiousbelief\" (Edwards v. Aguillard 1987). With little recourse after Kitzmiller except to disguise ID with shopworn creationist code language, the DiscoveryInstitute's Winter 2006 newsletter announced, \"We haveentered a new front in the debate over intelligent design\u2014theneed to protect academic freedom, particularly on college cam-puses\" (DI 2006). However, other than production of the fre-netically marketed, pro-ID pseudodocumentary Expelled: NoIntelligence Allowed, showcasing creationists whose universityemployers supposedly persecuted them (Premise Media 2008),ID's strategy foundered on the college front. The producers' ruseto deceive prominent ID critics into being interviewed has beenexhaustively exposed (Scientific American 2008; Scott 2008). Nonetheless, the Discovery Institute's academic freedom charade breathed life into its promotion of \"legislative propos-als [based] on design theory.\" In September 2007, DI posted itsModel Academic Freedom Statute on Evolution on theInternet (DI 2007). In 2008, variants of it\u2014written in the codelanguage that DI must now use\u2014were introduced in six states,including Louisiana. The deceptive title of this \"statute\" hasfooled no one. Louisiana Senator Ben Nevers stated frankly With little recourse except to disguise ID with shopworn creationist code language, the Discovery Institute announced, \"We have entered a new front in the debate over intelligent design\u2014the need to protect academic freedom, particularly on college campuses.\"SI Jan Feb 2010 pgs 11/12/09 10:41 AM Page 42SKEPTICAL INQUIRER January / February 2010 43that he introduced the Louisiana Academic Freedom Act on behalf of the Louisiana Family Forum (LFF), a Focus on theFamily affiliate, because \"they believe that scientific data relatedto creationism should be discussed when dealing with Darwin'stheory\" (Schon 2008). CSC fellow David DeWolf helped craftthis law, and CSC staffer Casey Luskin accompanied Expelled\"victim\" Caroline Crocker to Louisiana to testify for it (CSC2008; Crowther 2008). After the legislature passed a renamed ver-sion of the bill with only three dissenting votes, Governor BobbyJindal signed the Louisiana Science Education Act (LSEA) onJune 25, 2008 (LA Legislature 2008). The LSEA requires Louisiana's Board of Elementary and Secondary Education (BESE) to \"allow and assist teachers, prin-cipals, and other school administrators\" to promote \"criticalthinking skills, logical analysis, and open and objective discus-sion of scientific theories being studied including, but not lim-ited to, evolution, the origins of life, global warming, andhuman cloning\" through the use of \"supplemental textbooksand other instructional materials\" (LA Legislature 2008). Thelaw includes an almost verbatim restatement of the DiscoveryInstitute's telltale religion disclaimer in its model statute:\"Nothing in this act shall be construed as promoting any reli-gious doctrine, promoting discrimination for or against a par-ticular set of religious beliefs, or promoting discrimination for oragainst religion or non-religion\" (DI 2007). By including other\"theories,\" the bill's authors tried to deflect accusations that evo-lution was being targeted. However, LFF operatives have rou-tinely addressed only evolution in their public comments.Furthermore, analysis of the LSEA's historical provenance andterminology demonstrates that it is a creationist bill written inidentifiable language traceable creationist origins (Forrest 2008a). In addition,the LFF , whose mission is \"to persuasively present biblical prin-ciples in the centers of influence\" (LFF 2009b), has promotedcreationism for almost a decade (LFF 2003); it currently pro-motes creationist textbook addendums and the DiscoveryInstitute's \"DVD teaching modules\" (LFF 2009b). Making matters worse, in January 2009 the LFF persuaded Louisiana's Board of Elementary and Secondary Education togut the policy under which school administrators must imple-ment the LSEA. The Department of Education, which BESEordered to draft the policy, worded it carefully, including twoessential safeguards: (1) \"Religious beliefs shall not be advancedunder the guise of encouraging critical thinking\"; and (2)\"Materials that teach creationism or intelligent design or thatadvance the religious belief that a supernatural being createdhumankind shall be prohibited for use in science classes\"(Forrest 2009). However, apparently using political pressure,the LFF got the first safeguard deleted sometime before finalconsideration of the draft in January 2009 (Sentell 2009). AtBESE's January 13 meeting, the LFF , its attorneys, and its cre-ationist supporters persuaded BESE and State SuperintendentPaul Pastorek to delete the second safeguard as well (Forrest2009). On January 14, LFF director Reverend Gene Millsannounced to a fundamentalist news service that \"Louisiana isopen for business. . . . And academic freedom and inquiry arewelcomed here in the state of Louisiana\" (Chagnon 2009). How Did This Happen? Academic freedom bills in five other states failed in 2008, as did six bills in 2009, making Louisiana\u2014so far\u2014the only statewith such a law. The Discovery Institute benefitted from severalfactors. First, Louisiana has become increasingly conservative,and although the Religious Right has lost momentum nation-ally it has grown stronger in Louisiana. One newspaper observed that \"the new [2008] Legislature is probably the most conservative Louisiana has had since Reconstruction . . . andit's possibly the most religious\" (Hasten 2008). Mills agreedthat this legislature was \"family and faith friendly\" with \"anacute sense of the need to protect basic values\" (Hasten 2008). Second, although the LFF has lobbied the legislature aggressively for ten years, they needed a friendly governor inorder to pass creationist legislation. Bobby Jindal was\u2014andis\u2014their man. He supported teaching creationism during his2003 and 2007 gubernatorial campaigns (Forrest 2008b). Hecultivates Religious Right allies; the LFF is his closest such allyinside Louisiana (Forrest 2008c). After the 2007 election, theLFF threw a \"Christmas gala\" at which Jindal was the star. In Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal Image via NewscomSI Jan Feb 2010 pgs 11/12/09 10:41 AM Page 4344 VOLUME 34, ISSUE 1 SKEPTICAL INQUIRERa YouT ube video of the event, Mills presides in front of gala attendees as Jindal undergoes the \"laying on of hands,\" appar-ently by some of the \"forty or forty-five\" pastors who, Millsannounces, \"have sacrificed and come in from all over thestate\" (LFF 2008). Third, since Jindal's inauguration, the LFF controls Louisiana's social policy agenda. New Orleans columnist JamesGill is right: \"The Family Forum has this administration in itsclutches\" (Gill 2009). In 2008, no legislator would cross eitherJindal or the LFF , and the LFF was DI's direct connection toLouisiana lawmaking. LFF operative Darrell White had pub-licly supported DI's 2003 attack on the Texas textbook selec-tion process by attending hearings and sending a supportiveletter to the Texas Board of Education (White 2003); DI washappy to reciprocate in 2008. Moreover, when the LFFattacked the BESE policy, CSC Associate Director John Westdivulged that DI is giving the LFF legal advice (Barrow 2009).After biding their time until the final star aligned with Jindal'selection, they struck, working hand-in-hand. Their connivinghas done tangible harm to Louisiana. The Price of Success In February 2009, the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology (SICB), which wrote to Jindal in 2008 asking him toveto the LSEA, wrote to him again: \"We will not hold theSociety's in June 2008\" (Satterlie 2009). Instead, thesociety will meet in Utah, where the State Board of Educationadopted a strong statement of support for teaching evolution(UT State Board of Education 2005). Whereas Louisiana'spassage of the LSEA attracted virtually no national attention,this news flew across national newswires (Nossiter 2009) andInternet blogs. The LFF was caught off guard by news of the damage that its law has done to Louisiana. In a letter to the Baton Rouge Advocate defending the LSEA and dismissing SICB \"decision makers,\"Mills launched a nasty attack on \"Darwin's ideas,\" which \"left intheir wake a trail of feticide, genocide, racism, hatred, war andterrorism\" (Mills 2009). But the Discovery Institute plunged itshypocrisy to a new low in its \"Open Letter to the Society forIntegrative and Comparative Biology,\" penned neurosurgeonand Expelled \"victim\" Michael Egnor (NCSE 2009b): The SICB's opposition to academic freedom in science class- rooms and its interference in the right of the citizens ofLouisiana to set educational policy for their children in theirschools without interference by national scientific organiza-tions is repellant. . . . Your attempt at censorship and your boy-cott are a sneer at the citizens of Louisiana. . . . But you misun-derstand the people for whom you clearly have such disdain. . .(Egnor 2009) The DI's newly acquired concern for Louisiana's well-being is unimpressive. There were ample opportunities for a show of concern in 2005 after two killer hurricanes, Katrina on August29 and Rita on September 24. Dembski weighed in on thetragedy of Katrina\u2014but not in the same manner as most of hisfellow Christians. In his September 3 Uncommon Descentblog post \"[Offtopic:] How to Deal with Looters,\" dated fivedays after Katrina struck, he posted an April 18, 1906, news-paper clipping of a proclamation that the mayor of SanFrancisco had issued, as Dembski noted, after \"a devastatingearthquake.\" The true meaning of Dembski's post was unbe-comingly obvious: [Dembski:] In 1906 a devastating earthquake hit San Fran- cisco. The mayor at that time was one E.E. Schmitz. MayorSchmitz issued the following proclamation: [clipping:] PROCLAMATION BY THE MAYOR The Federal T roops, the members of the Regular Police Force and all Special Police Officers have been authorized by me toKILL any and all persons found engaged in Looting or in theCommission of Any Other Crime. . . . (Dembski 2005; NPR 2004) On September 3, people were drowning in New Orleans. Bodies were bloating in the Louisiana sun. And this was allDembski could find in his heart to say. And Now . . . Louisiana now has the distinction of passing legislation that more than half a dozen other states were sensible enough toreject. The fact that Louisiana has already gifted the nationwith a Supreme Court ruling against teaching creationism car-ried no weight with the governor and the legislature. AsReverend Mills announced, \"Louisiana is open for business.\"Creationists are welcome in the public schools of the PelicanState.

During hisuniversity years he teamed up with House, M.D. actor Hugh Laurie to appear on the whimsical sketch show A Bit of Fry and Laurie. He has written several very well-receivedbooks, including The Liar, The Hippopotamus, and half an autobiography called Moab is My Washpot. More recently he produced a scholarly but friendly guide to understandingand writing poetry, The Ode Less Travelled. He also appearedon popular British TV shows like Blackadder, Jeeves andWooster, and the quiz show Q.I. En route to one of the last filming locations in Australia for his new documentary, Last Chance to See, Stephen FryStephen Fry\u2014 Last Chance to Think KYLIE STURGESSSI Jan Feb 2010 pgs 11/12/09 10:43 AM Page 46SKEPTICAL INQUIRER January / February 2010 47snapped a quick photo from his hotel window and posted it on the popular online site T witter. The whole T wittosphereimmediately knew where he was, for the arch of the SydneyHarbour Bridge was in the background. He was in Sydney butonly for a short time. Within a few hours, I had contacted Mr.Fry's agents and organized an interview. K YLIESTURGESS :You have just returned from a lengthy around-the-world investigation based upon Douglas Adams's book Last Chance to See , written in 1990, which I use when teachinghigh-school English. What inspiredyou to recreate the journey that heand Mark Carwardine completed[when they teamed up to find outwhat was happening to exotic,endangered creatures worldwide\u2014animals that they may never havegotten another chance to see]? S TEPHEN FRY:Douglas did describe it as his favorite book, and I think that was because it changed his life.[It was] his \"second chapter,\" if youlike. He never had a third chapterbecause of his early death, but Iknow how important it was for himto go around the world and look atthe extraordinary habitats and therare creatures that relied on them.And caring for the disappearingspecies was something he devoted alot of time to. Now, what inspired me to recreate the journey was, firstly, that Douglas's family asked me to; plusit was a desire I've always had to go into the wild. Like so manypeople of my generation I grew up on natural history on TV,and it never occurred to me that one day I would actually belooking at lions close by, that I'd be with hippopotamuses,gorillas, lemurs, rare birds, diving turtles, and all these amaz-ing things . . . blue whales breaching in front of your very eyes.It affected me profoundly, and it affected Douglas. It's very hard to say which was my most influential experi- ence. There are one or two moments which bring one close tothe most ecstatic euphoria that one can ever experience (withoutthe use of pharmaceuticals or alcohol). I'd say it was seeing hun-dreds of green turtles hatching out of their nest and streamingover the dunes into the sea. This was off the coast of Malaysia. It's not until the female turtle is about twenty-five years old that she can lay eggs\u2014that the \"turtle is fertile,\" as they'd sayin America. She mates with the male and then she swims in\u2014not necessarily on a moonlit night; there's a great mistakenbelief that this is keyed to some biodynamic phase of theMoon; it's not actually true\u2014to the place where she was bornand crawls up the beach (not having been on land since she was born, she finds the place againusing Earth's magnetic field), lays80 to 120 eggs and covers themup. And I was right beside thishuge beautiful animal doing justthat; she took 90 minutes to laythe eggs, an incredible sight, andthen she lumbered back into thewater. S TURGESS : In that documentary, apparently there's an account of a healing ceremony in Madagascar,which is something you've touchedupon before in your novel TheHippopotamus. Why do you thinkpseudoscientific claims, such asholistic healing, continue to per-vade our society despite advancesin medicine? F RY: Well, my interpretation is no more valid than anyone else's, butI would say in terms of medicine,people want to take control oftheir own lives, and ironically they seem to think that they are taking control of their lives moreby using so-called complementary or alternative medicinesthan by using orthodox medicine. In other words, they thinkit's a statement of originality and individuality. To you and meit seems self-evidently ridiculous, this homeopathic medicine.It is so preposterous, and yet some people I know and respectinsist on believing it. The powers of the placebo are so strong that it may be morally wrong to call homeopathy a lie because the momentyou say it then a placebo falls to pieces and loses its power. Iam a great believer in double-blind random testing, which isthe basis of all drug testing. People still insist on things likeholistic healing and things that have no real basis in evidencebecause they want it to be true\u2014it's as simple as that. If you'redying of cancer or very, very ill, then you'll cling to a straw. Ifeel pretty dark thoughts about the kind of people who throwstraws at drowning, dying men and women, and I'm sure mostof us would agree it's a pretty lousy thing to do. Some of thesepeople perhaps believe in the snake oil they sell or allow them-selves to believe in it. That's why James Randi is so good,because he knows what magicians know: if you do a card trickon someone, they will report that it was unbelievable, theydescribe the effect the magician wanted, and they miss out all Kylie Sturgess has completed her master's degree in the measurementof paranormal belief, works as a research assistant at CurtinUniversity, Western Australia, and is a member of The Skeptic Zone, the Australian podcast for Science and Reason (www.skep-ticzone.tv).

Peoplewill swear that a clairvoyant mentioned the name of their auntfrom nowhere, and they will be astonished if you then play arecording that shows that thirty-two names were said beforethe aunt's name, none of which had any effect on them. That'sbecause they wanted to hear their aunt's name; they wantedthe trick to work, so they forgot all the failures in the same wayas people forget all their dreams that have no relevance to theirlives, but they mark when they dream of someone they haven'tmet for ages that they see the next day. I would be astoundedif everyone had coincidences like that\u2014yet people say that issomehow closed-minded of me! S TURGESS : Of course, it's not just the pseudosciences that per- vade; there are also paranormal beliefs. I was wondering if you're surprised that the same beliefs exist today? FRY: No, I am not surprised. I hope I know enough about his- tory and human nature to agree that there is one born every minute and to know that there is desperation to make sense ofthings, and making sense of the universe isn't easy. Makingsense of our own lives isn't easy. There are different ways ofdoing it\u2014by observing people, by reading novels and poetry,by looking at paintings, listening to music, allowing our mindsto concentrate on the experiences we had and the observationswe've made about how people behave. Then in a wider sense wecan look at the world and make observations about how ani-mals behave and what they look like and why they look like it,why rain falls, and all kinds of phenomena that occur, and wecan do this by observation, experiment, repetition, and under-standing. This is essentially what we call the scientific method,the empirical method, more importantly. Or, we can cheat\u2014we can just say \"there's an invisible per- son that makes it happen,\" or the stars tell you, or it's all pre-destined, or it's something to do with an inborn power of themind, which isn't the power of learning. In other words, youcan be lazy; instead of bothering to find how numbers work orobserving how animals behave, you just say it's all according tosome cosmic vibration. Sad, but people naturally want to cutcorners, much as water wants to go the shortest route to thesea, so human beings want to find the shortest route to thetruth, but unfortunately that takes them to the great \"ocean ofbullshit\" that lies out there and to all those people prepared tomake money out of them. All the cold-reading clairvoyantsand the nonsensical astrologers and absurd ESP merchants andother such people who talk about vibrations and energies .... God, if there's a word that drives me mad it's \"energy\" used ina nonsensical way\u2014don't get me started! Let's just say that, to me, the true mystery of the universe is something that is available to all, not through the arcane rulesof some nonsensical, unprovable drivel\u2014but is there for youreyes, it is there to see by just simply recognizing observablelaws and repeatable instances of things like sunsets and howthey work. And seeing what we've done on the basis of thatunderstanding, so every time that you flick a light switch orturn on a GPS, you have to realize on what that GPS is pred- icated, on the science\u2014without it the GPS couldn't possiblywork. The fact that Earth must be round, the fact that it mustmove at this speed, the fact that geostationary orbit meansthis, the fact that triangulation means that\u2014all these thingstell us so much how science is right. S TURGESS : You're also the host of a TV show in the United Kingdom called Q.I., which stands for \"Quite Interesting.\" It's been described as a \"comedy panel quiz,\" yet it could very wellbe called a show that questions illogical thinking and danger-ous beliefs. Do you consider comedy to be a \"way in\" for peo-ple to challenge irrational thinking? F RY: Comedy is always about the real world. Philosophers or religionists will make a pompous, abstract statement and a comedian will say, \"Is that true on a Wednesday?\" Comedians want a cut and dried example of the facts of the world. Becausecomedy is about observation\u2014as is science\u2014it's about repeat-able patterns, and it's testing some statement that may be pre-posterous or may be true. Statements made of grandeur andabstract truth are always tested by comedians, so in that sense,comedy is a very good way to get the credulous onside, if youlike. Because it says \"Is that true? Is it really true? Let's see!\" S TURGESS : Finally, your love of technology is well known\u2014 you've written for many years on technology in a variety of publications; you have a very popular podcast called Podgrams that is available on your Web site and on iT unes. Recentlyyou've embraced T witter and written about the experience andhave been the focus of media attention because of it. Do youthink that your love of technology is an important part of yourappeal to your audience? And what do you hope for techno-logical advances in the future? F RY: My audiences all share an interest in technology because those that don't have stopped being my audience. It's about what one hopes for and what happens. Of course like everyone else Ihope for 3-D television and for fantastic robots I can have sexwith that then turn into machines that clean my room! I'm ahuman being\u2014I want slavish satisfaction; I want joy and plea-sure to be brought to me by the machines. But I also love theconnections that technology gives me with other people. I amworried about privacy and that one day the machines mightstop and we won't know what to do with ourselves and not beable to cope! So my hope for technology is that it will continueto be free and open and will become dominated not by businessinterests as now, not by politicians, religious fundamentalists, ormaniacs, but by the general sum of humanity, whom I think tobe good and enlightened for the most part. I know there are dark and hideous slimy corners of the Internet, but one is able to avoid them. The Internet is like a great city; of course it has slums and red-light districts andweird temples and strange churches, but it also has grand cul-tural palaces, remarkable museums and libraries, places ofentertainment, shops and stores, and exciting parks. /hwysquareSI Jan Feb 2010 pgs 11/12/09 10:44 AM Page 48SKEPTICAL INQUIRER January / February 2010 49Tourists flock to Florida to visit the state's beaches, national parks, and theme parks. They don't usuallytravel to the tiny town of Homestead, between Miami and the Florida Keys, to see Coral Castle. Even some of thelocals hadn't heard of the place. Yet this unassuming rock gar-den has been called the Eighth Wonder of the World, com-pared by some to the Great Pyramid of Giza and Stonehenge,and is indeed known as \"America's Stonehenge.\" At the veryleast it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The story of Coral Castle is ingrained in folklore, but no two stories are the same. At the age of twenty-six, Leedskalninwas engaged to sixteen-year-old Agnes Scuffs. The night beforethe wedding, Scuffs broke off the engagement and brokeLeedskalnin's heart. Lovesick Leedskalnin left Latvia seekingopportunity overseas. Employed in various manual labor jobs, hetraveled through Europe to Canada and across the United States.During these travels he contracted tuberculosis. H earing that Florida had a climate beneficial to this condition, Leedskalninrelocated there around 1918. He spent a few years recuperat-ing from his illness before purchasing ten acres of property inFlorida City around 1920. This land was unfavorable to culti-vation yet favorable to quarrying oolite, the native limestonebedrock (technically, the \"castle\" isn't coral). The eccentricLeedskalnin proceeded to build \"Ed's Place,\" Rock Gate Park,over the next three decades. Undoubtedly, the project had immense personal significance for Leedskalnin.When asked why he built the park, Leeds-kalnin would answer mysteriously, \"For mySweet Sixteen.\" It is widely believed that\"Sweet Sixteen\" was a reference to AgnesScuffs. Some sources present her surname as the more Lettish-sounding Skuvst (Stansfield 2006). Latvian account Kora u Pilsasserts that this woman did indeed exist, although her name was Hermi-ne Lu-sis (Stavro 2005). Sweet Sixteen never saw Rock Gate Park. This sad and strange story was the inspi-ration for Billy Idol's 1987 song \"Sweet Sixteen\" and for muchparanormal and pseudoscientific conjecture. The modern Coral Castle is a courtyard of prehistoric-look- ing carvings covering a small section of three acres. Rooms with-out walls house sculptures of stone furniture, including a two-tonheart-shaped table and a twenty-foot-long table carved in theform of Florida. A family bedroom contains four beds, a child'srocker, and a rocking cradle. A throne room displays five rock-ing chairs. Indoor features are combined with outdoor ele-ments; a moon fountain is flanked by eighteen-ton first andlast quarters of the moon and a full moon fish pond weighingtwenty-three tons. There is a children's playground based onthe fairy tale \"Goldilocks and the Three Bears.\" Bizarre stonestocks stand in the repentance corner for punishing a fictionalwife or children for any misbehavior. There is a forty-foot-tallobelisk and a sun dial that records the hours between 9 AMand 4 PM. A thirty-ton lens-less Polaris telescope is fixed on the North Star, and various cosmological sculptures include eigh-teen-ton carvings of Mars and Saturn and a twenty-three-toncrescent moon. The sculptures are mostly ornamental, although a well, outdoor bathtub, and barbecue cooker are functional. Palmtrees and plants grow in the gravel floor, but there is no roof.It's an inside-out \"house,\" although it is uninhabitable, withseparate living quarters and a two-story tower built of blocksweighing four to nine tons each. The room downstairs func- tioned as Leedskalnin's tool shedand workshop, and he lived upstairsin Spartan conditions. There are two unused rock en- trances (hence \"Rock Gate Park\"), athree-ton gate and nine-ton that with the slightesttouch of a pinkie finger!\" before itwas affected by erosion. The garden issurrounded by four walls measuringeight by three by four feet. The northwall is composed of three sections;the middle block is the heaviest in thepark, weighing thirty tons, and istopped with four blocks creating a\"crown.\" These measurements aresupplied on site, but some are e.g., Stansfield claimsthe \"nine-ton gate\" weighs 5.59 tons(Stansfield 2006). The sculptures have been compared to Michelangelo, although they are rough-hewn and rudimentary in design.They are more striking for their sheer size, and this aspect gen-erates the most debate about Coral Castle: How did Leed-skalnin move these massive stone blocks? Surprisingly, no one asks the prior question: How did Leedskalnin quarry the blocks from the bedrock? He came from a family of stonemasons and was himself trained in thistrade, specializing in carving tombstones (Stavro 2005). Beforebuilding Coral Castle, he worked in lumber camps and partic-ipated in cattle drives (Coral Castle 2008). Leedskalnin hadbeen sick, but despite the popular belief that he was frail, hehad strength and requisite knowledge and skills. Oolite limestone is a porous, soft sedimentary rock that can be mined with hand tools, known for its relative ease of extrac-tion and suitability for carving (Hoffmeister 1974). Leed- Karen Stollznow is a linguist, researcher, and writer with a PhDin linguistics. She is the author of the CSI Web column \"TheNaked Skeptic.\" \u00a9 Karen Stollznow pgs 11/12/09 10:44 AM Page 50SKEPTICAL INQUIRER January / February 2010 51skalnin split the rock using \"truck springs sharpened into wedges to break blocks of coral loose from their bed\" (CoralCastle 2008). His background in stonemasonry provided himwith sculpting experience, which counters claims that he usedparanormal powers rather than tools: \"In looking at thesechairs and other carvings, notice the absence of chisel marks.Notice that the coral does not appear to have been carved\"(Coral Castle 2008). However, chisels and hand saws are ondisplay in Leedskalnin's tool shed,and tool marks can be observed onthe chairs and other sculptures inthe park despite natural erosion.Some speculate that Leedskalninused magic, not mortar, in his join-ery. Conversely, we find he \"usedcement in joining the blocksbecause of the hurricanes we have[in Florida]\" (Coral Castle 2008). When asked how he moved the blocks, Leedskalnin would answercryptically, \"I have discovered thesecrets of the pyramids.\" theories this apparent theories about Stonehenge,some believe Leedskalnin enlistedthe assistance of extraterrestrialbeings. Stories variously credit himwith superhuman strength, super-natural powers, or secret knowl-edge. Contradicting claims he wasweak, Leedskalnin was allegedly observed \"lifting the blockswith his (Nimoy 1981). Others believe heemployed \"Tibetan Monk techniques\" of singing to the stones,using these sound waves to somehow lighten their weight inorder to lift them (Joseph 1998). The most popular theory is that Leedskalnin levitated the blocks using telekinesis or magnetic currents. Some claim that\"ley lines\" exist beneath Coral Castle, producing electricalforces that enabled him to levitate the blocks (Kohler 2009).Some believe Leedskalnin harnessed electromagnetism toreduce the gravitational pull of the earth or that the park isbuilt on a position of harmonic resonance, on a grid that cre-ates anti-gravity allowing the blocks to be levitated (Nimoy1981). Adapting theory of Mars\" that Leedskalnin tapped energy fromdifferent planes to levitate the blocks (Hoagland 2004). The hallmark of urban legend, there are conflicting reports that no one ever witnessed him at work (Coral Castle 2008).This version claims Leedskalnin constructed Coral Castle insecrecy, alone and at night, so no one could watch him work.Allegedly, he had a sixth sense and could tell when people werespying on him, at which point he'd cease working (Nimoy 1981). Fueling the hearsay, it is true that Leedskalnin worked alone and at night. Therefore, the poor lighting would havemade it difficult for anyone to see him working. His reluctanceto work during the day can be attributed to Florida's relentlessheat and sun. A tour guide insisted that Leedskalnin spent hisdays reading in a \"health chair\" that lies over a \"sweet spot\" ona ley line grid that \"spontaneously cured him of tuberculosis\"and also \"repels arthritis.\" Sadly, the chair didn't cure him ofhis chronic tuberculosis or his terminal stomach cancer. Leedskalnin is portrayed as a paranoid loner. But he had no family nearby, only a nephew in Mich-igan who eventually inherited the pre- mises. Homestead was, and still is, a remote, low-densitytownship of open agricultural land. Leedskalnin was relativelyisolated, and there were only a few distant neighbors whocould possibly have observed him at work. The park walls pro-tected his private residence and business. In fact, they weren'terected until 1940, after his move, when most of the sculp-tures were already built (Coral Castle 2008). In 1934 a groupof young men intruded and attacked Leedskalnin; this inci-dent likely prompted his eventual move, and the walls andsome lookout points were later added as security measures. These factors are not to be construed as secrecy, as Rock Gate Park was open to the public. \"If you rang the bell twice,and Ed was not busy, he would unlock the gate, and take youon a tour of the Castle\" (Coral Castle 2008). This was hislivelihood. By 1936 he'd had over 15,000 visitors (Leedskalnin1936). After he died, his life savings of $3,500 were found onthe premises, funds mostly raised by a 10\u00a2 (later 25\u00a2) entrancefee. Rare footage and interviews suggest that Leedskalnin wasfriendly and welcoming; he enjoyed exhibiting his park to vis-itors (Nimoy 1981). Perhaps he was more lonely than loner. Moreover, it doesn't appear his project was covert because \u00a9 Leedskalnin 2008 \u00a9 Leedskalnin 2008SI Jan Feb 2010 pgs 11/12/09 10:45 AM Page 5152 VOLUME 34, ISSUE 1 SKEPTICAL INQUIRERhe published his theories and philosophies in a series of pam- phlets and public advertisements (Leedskalnin 1946a, 1945b,1945a, 1945b, 1936). Some of the legends may be attributableto the pseudoscientific ideas he expresses in these writings. Forexample, the following quote is probably the source of thebelief that he had powers of telekinesis and a sixth sense:\"Many of you have noticed if you are looking with a concen-trated look at someone's back while the person doesn't know it,the person is liable to get restless and look around. I havenoticed sometimes that I can chase the mosquitoes away fromthe wall by only giving a sharp look at them.\" Leedskalnin's first publication, A Book in Every Home (1936), is a political and moral treatise of draconian values that implies his \"Sweet Sixteen\" wasmore an ideal than a real-ity. Mineral, Vegetable, and Animal Life (1945b) and Magnetic Current (1945a) discuss his fringetheories about magnetic currents and antigravity and speak of a\"perpetual motion holder\" that actually works\u2014as long as it'spowered by electricity. Leedskalnin's writing is obscure, suggest-ing that his theoretical knowledge was self-taught and unre-fined. Evidently he had practical skills but not a sound under-standing of scientific theory. The literature on Coral Castle is mostly the realm of Web sites, tabloids, travel guides, and paranormal books. Mostworks are expository rather than explanatory and recycle falla-cious research and formulate spurious theories. Coral Castle buffs ascribe hidden meaning to the premises. The numbers 7129-6105195 are inscribed on the entrance toLeedskalnin's living quarters, and he is misquoted as claiming thisis the \"secret to the universe.\" Enthusiasts attempt to decode thisnumber. In an interview on Coast to Coast AM, George Noory and author Joe Bullard hypothesize that this number includes\"the angle the Great Pyramid is formed on,\" that it represents the\"Golden Ratio,\" and by isolating \"51\" we have Leedskalnin's pre-diction of the year he would die (Noory 2007). A listener calledand explained that these numbers appear on Leedskalnin's citi-zenship certificate (cf. Stavro 2005), but the host and guestrefused to accept this simple and factual explanation. Coral Castle appeared on Ripley's Believe It Or Not and In Search Of and was featured in Fateand National Enquirer. The sensationalism is good for business, and the proprietors care-fully cultivate the mystique. However, they banned Bullard'sbook in which he links Coral Castle to a confusing array ofphenomena, including Atlantis, the Bermuda T riangle,Stonehenge, UFOs, the Bible, Edgar Cayce, and Adolf Hitler(Bullard 2004). The most recent so-called investigative bookconcludes uncritically, \"The story of how he accomplishedthese amazing feats remains a mystery\" (McClure 2009). There are very few skeptical treatments of the subject (cf. Dunning 2009; Radford 2006; Stansfield 2006) and no scholarlyexaminations, despite Coral Castle's claims that the site has beenexamined by academics. When asked to provide evidence of thisresearch, no representatives could provide references (Radford2006). This is borne out by my own inquiries. Perhaps the \"baf- fled scientists, engineers,and scholars\" are merelyuninterested because thereare natural explanations forthe supernatural claims. Shows like In Search Ofare quick to \"recon- struct\" Leedskalnin levi-tating the blocks but notso quick to enter his toolshed and reveal real evi- dence: the rusty cogs, chains, hooks, hoists, pulleys, grindingwheels, winches, and other tools, both homemade and indus-trial. These extant artifacts are proof that Leedskalnin usedsimple machines and hard work to build Rock Gate Park. Leedskalnin was a self-sufficient handyman and hobbyist. He fashioned tools from scrap metal, using his cooker as ahearth for blacksmithing, and built a hand-cranked electricalgenerator and a radio receiver and transmitter. He utilized nat-ural resources by building a well and used solar power to warmhis bathwater. He recycled automobile and bicycle parts andimprovised instruments, making a wheelbarrow \"from thebrake drum of an old truck. Ed used it to move coral\" (CoralCastle 2008). The nine-ton gate balances on the axle of aModel T Ford rather than a vortex that supposedly lies beneath. \u00a9 Leedskalnin 2008 Photo: NewscomSI Jan Feb 2010 pgs 11/12/09 10:46 AM Page 52SKEPTICAL INQUIRER January / February 2010 53One source states that when Leedskalnin was asked how he moved the blocks he would respond, \"It's easy, if you know how,\" or, \"Ed would say that he understood the laws of weight andleverage\" (Coral Castle 2008). These answers are probably closerto the truth. Suspended by chains on a pulley system,Leedskalnin's well, cooker, and the \"hanging\" bed and chair in hisliving quarters are clues to the methods he employed. We don'thave photographic evidence of Leedskalnin levitating the blocks,but we do have photographic evidence of him raising them usingseveral tripods (although some insist these were staged). Leedskalnin often posed with his tools and creations for a box Brownie camera. One image shows a sturdy tripod con-structed of three wooden poles with steps, the poles connectedby a brace. There is a platform around the tripod, and pulleys,chains, and hooks are suspended from the brace. The tripodsare not on display; they have probably long since disintegrated,and other tools have been stolen or removed. (The UtahGeological Survey site shows contemporaneous images ofoolite limestone quarrying using the same equipment.) Leedskalnin didn't need forklifts, cranes, and laser drills to build Coral Castle. Modern equipment makes the task easier,although it is not impossible without it. Former constructionworker Wally Wallington has demonstrated how one personcould replicate Stonehenge using materials and techniquesthat don't require modern technology (Wallington 2007) oreven the technology used by Leedskalnin. Leedskalnin usedthe mechanical advantage afforded by the levers, pulleys,screws, winches, and wedges that he used to raise and place theblocks\u2014these simple machines and time. Leedskalnin's relocation provides insight into the time frame required for moving the blocks. Circa 1936 he disassembled RockGate Park and relocated to a new site with a quarry in Homestead.Some believe he made a miscalculation and so moved ten milesnorth where the \"telluric forces\" were stronger. Occam's razorwould have us favor the alternative explanation: Florida City wassuccumbing to encroaching urbanization and Leedskalnin movedfor privacy, especially following the break-in and attack. There are claims that people saw the carvings being conveyed along the old Dixie Highway, but supposedly \"no one saw himload or unload the blocks.\" In contrast, a witness to the movenamed Mr. Biggers actually assisted with his tractor (also sug-gesting that Leedskalnin could have had assistance in buildingCoral Castle). Still, this was no easy or fast task. For the obeliskalone, \"By account of Mr. Biggers, the man who drove the trac-tor pulling the trailer upon which this rested, it took Ed threedays to place it into position\" (Coral Castle 2008). This is incontrast to one claim that Leedskalnin raised the entire parkovernight using levitation (Nimoy 1981). Furthermore, by1936 the park had not yet been completed, and the walls weren'teven built, so there was less material to transport. Still, the entire move from Florida City to Homestead took three years (Stansfield 2006). Time is a crucial factor; it tookLeedskalnin almost thirty years to build Rock Gate Park. \"Eddid not have another job; he devoted his life to building theCastle\" (Coral Castle 2008). How did Leedskalnin build Coral Castle? A sign in his toolshed provides the simple answer: \"The most frequent ques-tion overheard here is: 'How did one man without assistanceconstruct the coral castle?' The answer is: with an uncannyknowledge of the laws of leverage and balance, engineeringand sculpture; and with the aid of simple tools such as metalfalls, (block and tackle) rollers, jacks, wedges, slings, cablessledges and chisels. And above all, infinite patience and atremendous imagination.\" In December 1951, Leedskalnin became ill. He put a sign on his front gate, \"Going to the Hospital,\" and took a bus tothe Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami. He died three dayslater at the age of sixty-four. Some lament that Leedskalnin\"took the secrets of Coral Castle to his grave.\" Instead, it seemshe left the evidence behind\u2014reliable historical and eyewitnessaccounts, equipment, photographs, and Rock Gate Park itself.These provide natural explanations for the paranormal andpseudoscientific claims, regardless of whether or not anyonewants to believe them. A skeptical explanation doesn't diminish Edward Leedskal- nin's remarkable achievements, his poignant story, or thestrange beauty of his creation. He was clearly an experiencedtradesperson and an amateur inventor, engineer, physicist, andastronomer. A sign at the entrance to Ed's Place announces, \"You will be seeing unusual accomplishment.\" Coral Castle is a marvel, nota mystery. Supernatural explanations underestimate EdwardLeedskalnin's unusual accomplishment. /hwysquare References Bullard, J. 1999. Waiting for Agnes. Inspired by the True Story of Coral Castle.

Thetopic of same-sex marriage (SSM) became an espe- cially hot issue when the rather conservative CaliforniaSupreme Court concluded that it was unconstitutional todeny marriage licenses to gay and lesbian couples. SinceCalifornia is so often the leader in social trends in this coun-try, concerned religious leaders and many others stronglycondemned this development, hoping to forestall it fromspreading to additional states. In the 2008 national election,nearly $40 million was donated to successfully passCalifornia's Proposition 8, which nullified the state supremecourt's ruling. (Opponents raised more than $43 million,Religious Fundamentalism and Same-Sex Marriage Americans' attitudes toward same-sex marriage have rapidly changed, defining it now as a civil-rights issue. Nearly all the remaining determined opposition appears to be based on the Bible, ignoring modern scholarly sources. ANTHONY LAYNGSI Jan Feb 2010 pgs 11/12/09 10:47 AM Page 54SKEPTICAL INQUIRER January / February 2010 55making it the most expensive social-issue ballot initiative ever.) Presently, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Iowa, New Hamp- shire, and Vermont allow same-sex couples to marry, and New York and Washington, DC, recognize such marriages if legallyperformed elsewhere. New Hampshire's gay marriage measurewas approved by the state senate and signed by its governor inJune 2009. On November 3, Maine voters overturned thatstate's law allowing same-sex marriage. Even so, most attitudepolls on this topic make it pretty clear that an increasing num-ber of Americans are finding SSM acceptable. And this is espe-cially so among younger voters. According to a CNN pollreleased in May 2009, 58 percent of those from eighteen tothirty-four years of age believe that same-sex couples should beallowed to marry. Even older voters, most of whom still opposeSSM, generally favor civil unions for gays and lesbians. So itseems just a matter of time before SSM is allowed in other states. California was the leader in legalizing interracial marriage in 1948, and it was not until 1967 that the U.S. Supremecourt declared laws against interracial marriage unconstitu-tional. Again, it was the younger voters who led the way ascivil-rights activists and others in favor of racial equality. OlderAmericans who were inclined to hold more conservative socialattitudes eventually modified their views on race or died off.The SSM social movement may be taking the same course.Fifty-one percent of California voters now favor SSM, and,again, younger advocates greatly outnumber older ones. Nearly all of the remaining determined opposition appears to be based on what the Bible says about this subject\u2014or at leastwhat is presumed to be in the Bible. Those who most stronglyobject to SSM seldom cite the Koran, possibly because itendorses polygyny. The Bhagavad-Gita is also ignored eventhough both of these sacred texts have nothing good to say abouthomosexual relationships. Actually, the Bible contains very littleinformation about SSM, only that, \"Thou shalt not lie withmankind, as with womankind; it is an abomination\" (Leviticus18:22). The fact that Democrats did so well in the 2008 nationalelection suggests that biblical literalism is losing the politicalinfluence it had during the early Bush years. It is notable and understandable that those who are so adamant against SSM generally ignore modern scholarlysources in defense of their stand. There is, after all, a good dealof information available on this subject that can be verified,unlike Bible verses. For example, there is an increasing amountof scientific evidence that homosexuality is inborn, deter-mined before birth, as is heterosexuality. Also, in countrieswhere SSM is allowed (Canada, the Netherlands, Belgium,Norway, Sweden, South Africa, and Spain), the divorce ratedoes not correlate with sexual orientation; same-sex marriagesare about as enduring as other marriages. However, when gaysmarry straights, a practice encouraged by stigmatizing homo-sexuality, those unions tend to be especially fragile. It is now evident that gays and lesbians who desire to be married do so, in large part, because of economic benefits, thesame benefits enjoyed by opposite-sex spouses. And historyshows us that same-sex marriages were acceptable under cer-tain economic circumstances in Egypt, China, Greece, Rome,Japan, and Africa. It was the rise of Christianity and Islam thatencouraged persecution of homosexuals and denying themcivil rights. Under early Christian emperors homosexualitywas made illegal, and many of those judged guilty were pub-licly burned alive. But why in America today is there lingering opposition to granting marriage licenses to homosexuals, a right that the restof us take for granted? In addition to the states that havepassed constitutional amendments barring recognition ofsame-sex marriage, nineteen states now exclusively define mar-riage as a union between one man and one woman. Arizona isthe only state to defeat a constitutional amendment limitingmarriage to opposite-sex couples. After James Dobson ofFocus on the Family complained in 2008 that presidential can-didate John McCain was not doing enough to convince hisArizona voters to oppose SSM, McCain immediately began toencourage Californians to ban same-sex unions. Then-candi-date Barack Obama supported civil unions, but he andMcCain both said they opposed SSM. It is difficult to knowhow they actually feel about this, but their public pronounce-ments on this subject did seem to reflect the dominant opin-ion of American voters at the time. An increasing number of states are allowing civil unions and domestic partnerships for gays and lesbians. MostAmericans, even those who oppose SSM, agree that homosex-uals should have nearly all the benefits and protections enjoyedby heterosexuals. So apparently, the economic consequences ofmarriage have little to do with most of the remaining opposi-tion to SSM. Religious beliefs appear to be the major factorshere. And, accordingly, religious-right groups such as Focus onthe Family, The Family Research Council, The T raditionalValues Coalition, Family Friendly Libraries, and The ChristianCoalition continue to vigorously condemn SSM. The most outspoken opponents, many of them clerics like Dobson, repeatedly insist that SSM threatens traditional mar-riage, even though there is no objective evidence to verify thisclaim. Some still insist that homosexuality is \"unnatural,\" butthat is too easily challenged now in light of scientific researchconducted in the last twenty years. And the old scare tactics ofclaiming that legalizing same-sex marriages will inevitably lead to Anthony Layng is emeritus professor of anthropology, at ElmiraCollege.

MARY M. LIVINGSTON and JEROME J. TOBACYK Sensitivity to human subjects issues is important and praiseworthy, butthere is some confusion regarding the formal definition of human subjectsresearch. In the United States, an Insti-tutional Review Board (IRB) decideswhether a study qualifies as human sub-jects research. The argument that AWARE (AWAreness during REsuscitation study,the topic of \"NDE Experiment: EthicalConcerns,\" SI, of Office for HumanResearch Protections (OHRP) guidelinesis contingent upon when one becomes a human subject. Consent is not necessaryuntil the person formally becomes aresearch subject. The federal OHRP regu-lation specifies: (f) Human subject means a living indi- vidual about whom a researcher ob- tains (1) Data through intervention orinteraction with the individual, or (2)Identifiable private information . Inter- vention includes both physical proce-dures . . . and manipulations of the subject or the subject's environmentthat are performed for research pur-poses. Interaction includes communi- cation or interpersonal contact .... Private information includes informa- tion about behavior that occurs in acontext in which an individual canreasonably expect that no observationor recording is taking place. . . . 1 There is clearly no interaction of the researcher with the AWARE subject re- garding out-of-body experiences (OBE)until the post-recovery interview. There isno expectation of privacy in an emergency ward where medical procedures are con-ducted and observed by multiple onlook-ers. For example, researchers can collectpolygamy, incest, and marriage between people and animals are now less often resorted to since there is absolutely no evidence tosupport this assertion from countries that allow SSM. Anotherspurious argument against SSM is the religious right's insistencethat churches would be forced to perform such marriages. As therecent Iowa Supreme Court decision striking down that state'sban on SSM states, \"A religious denomination can still definemarriage as a union between a man and a woman.\" By far the most popular strategy consists of quoting the Bible to \"prove\" that monogamous marriage is a God-givensacred institution. The Bible, an anthology of myths andhighly ethnocentric observations by tribal elders, is childishlynaive compared to the standards of modern scholarship. Thestudy of ancient cultures makes it clear that marriage becamethe norm long before religion emerged, and secular marriage isnow common in numerous societies. Even in our own society,nearly a third of all marriages occur without any religiousendorsement. The belief that marriage is something sacred issupported only by religious faith. Long before the current social movement to extend the right to marry to homosexuals, there was a long history of gaybashing and ridicule that grew progressively vitriolic. Whensame-sex couples began to insist that they be allowed to legallymarry, a surge of opposition to gay rights emerged, as if grant-ing them the right to marry was \"the last straw.\" And it is inreligion where these stalwart opponents found the most con-vincing justification for their reactionary stand, a rationale that most of us choose not to challenge because it is consideredvery bad taste to question matters of faith and because theBible is held in such high regard in this country. At the sametime, many other Americans began to view homosexualitymore tolerantly. In various circles, especially among the bettereducated, it became politically incorrect to criticize gays andlesbians for their lifestyle and sexual preferences. I remember when interracial marriage was condemned by white Southerners as unnatural and offensive to God, and a lotof risqu\u00e9 literature was banned and burned in the name of God.Today, even most religious fundamentalists no longer considerinterracial marriage and racy novels a serious threat to society.We may anticipate that more and more biblical literalists andother homophobic Americans will come to realize that grantingsame-sex couples the right to marry is merely an overdue demo-cratic reform that, even though it offends superstitious and out-dated notions, is not a threat to the institution of one man/onewoman marriage or anything else worth preserving. Increasingly, Americans are defining bans on SSM as a civil-rights issue. Changing attitudes are taking us to a not toodistant future when political correctness will include accep-tance of SSM. Then we will look upon remaining religiousopponents as quaintly out of touch with America's commit-ment to equality and fair play.

However, if theresearcher interacts with (e.g., interviews) the subjects, consent would be neededunless the IRB, in offering approval, eitherwaived consent or waived documentationof consent, in compliance with 46.116c. 1 Thus, from the perspective of an IRB, thepatients are not considered human sub-jects until the interviews are conducted.Therefore, it is not necessary to obtainconsent earlier. The only remaining question is \"Does hanging a picture in an emergency roomconstitute an intervention or manipula-tion of the environment?\" In its discus- sion of observation, the ProtectingHuman Subjects Institutional ReviewBoard Guide Book uses as an example anartificial \"staging of emergencies\" wherethere is the potential for psychologicaldistress. 2Even in this example, only review by the IRB, which would deter-mine whether the intervention requiresprior consent, is required. Placing a pic-ture on the wall (or ceiling) would bemuch like planting pansies or petuniasin the aforementioned park. It is likelythe IRB would see this interior decora-tion change as involving \"minimal risk\"\"not greater than that ordinarilyencountered in daily life.\" 2 It is fallacious to contend that there is no difference between AWARE's proce-dures and the procedure of weighing thesubject while unconscious, an examplethat Dieguez uses to argue against theAWARE study. Weighing the subjectinvolves an active intervention that wouldnot otherwise be performed and furthermight distract from ongoing lifesaving procedures. The contention that \"neitherdoes it matter that surviving patientsmight provide informed consent duringrecovery\" is clearly in error because that iswhen the first interaction occurs and the patient first becomes a research subject. Ifthe patient does not wish to discuss theNDE/OBE, the patient has the right towithhold consent, as is standard in allIRB-approved research. /hwysquare Notes 1.

The article begins,\"Skeptics are rightly challenged to assessclaims made by all parties when an issueof major public importance arises. ... Questions related to global warming . . .represent such an issue today.\" Dealingmore with the political debate surround-ing proposed climate-change legislationthan with specific scientific facts aboutglobal warming, Jordan later notes: Both sides have made significant efforts to establish scientific credibilitywith the public....

After thus laying the groundwork for the following ostensible no-brainer,Jordan ends by rhetorically asking \"theskeptic who is not acquainted with therelevant science where he or she thinksthe most credible scientific assessmentlies\u2014with the scientists whose pub-lished research is reported in the IPCC- Gary Posner, MD, founded the T ampa Bay Skeptics (a special interest group ofCenter for Inquiry/T ampa) and is a CSIscientific consultant.

When Iinquired as to whether this reflected \"anevolution on CFI's part,\" OPP executivedirector Toni Van Pelt is true,Gary, that your many e-mails [I routinelycopy her when corresponding on this sub-ject] influenced my decision to commis-sion this research.\" Because I harbor my own doubts about the existence of a man-made global warm-ing crisis, I anxiously awaited the details of the Credibility Project's assessment ofthe skeptical scientists. Its most signifi-cant finding constitutes the deck ofJordan's piece: \"CFI vets list of 687 'dis-senting 80 percent haven't publishedpeer-reviewed climate research.\" Largelyfor this reason, in its July 17 press release,OPP concluded that its findings \"exposea lack of credibility among dissentingscientists challenging man-made globalwarming.\" But in my follow-up to Toni, I ex- plained why \"it simply does not logically follow that [those skeptical scientists] necessarily lack the credibility to speakto the issues at hand,\" any more than Ilack the legitimacy to critique, for exam-ple, medical studies touting prayer andhealing, as I have done in CFI-spon-sored magazines despite never havingpublished studies of my own in thepeer-reviewed literature. Speaking further to Jordan's key point that \"80 percent haven't published peer-reviewed climate research,\" S KEPTICAL INQUIRER columnist Robert Sheaffer e- mailed a letter to the editor (see page 64),which was copied to other interested par- ties (including Jordan and myself), point-ing out that OPP also should have vettedthe list of IPCC scientists, since perhapsas few as 20 percent of them have had anyprofessional dealings with climate, muchless published in the peer-reviewed cli-mate literature. In his e-mailed reply to Sheaffer (et al.), Jordan advises: One of the favorite tactics of global warming deniers is to refer to the[IPCC's summary] report for thesummary report] it is true that themajority are not climate scientists,because they are presenting a sum-mary, that is based upon the sciencereport, to government officials, in thelanguage of policy recommendations.Clearly this is comparing apples andoranges. The IPCC-2007 report titled\"The Physical Science Basis\" is a truescience report, written by and summa-rizing the work of approximately2,000 real scientists. However, Sheaffer's letter compares ap- ples to apples\u2014he does not reference the\"summary\" report, authored by fifty-onemembers of the IPCC. In an addendumoffered after Jordan's initial response,Sheaffer points out that OPP apparentlyalso failed to ascertain how many of the\"2,000 real scientists\" actually con-tributed to the writing of the sciencereport (620), and how many of thosehave published in the relevant literature. Thus it seems that the Credibility Project, conceived by CFI's Office ofPublic Policy for the purpose of \"expos-ing fake 'scientists'\" who dare dissentfrom the prevailing climate of climate-change alarmism, has some credibilityproblems of its own. After polishing theproject's clouded lens, as one again exam-ines Jordan's question about whether \"themost credible scientific assessment report,\" the answer doesn'tappear to be such a no-brainer after all. /hwysquareFOLLOW-UP 58 VOLUME 34, ISSUE 1 SKEPTICAL INQUIRER SI Jan Feb 2010 pgs 11/12/09 11:05 AM Page 58SKEPTICAL INQUIRER January / February 2010 59FOLLOW-UP This issue presents contributions by Gary Posner (above) and RobertSheaffer (letters section) cri- tiquing the Credibility Project I helpedproduce. (See www.centerforinquiry.net/OPP/CredibilityProject.) They suggestthat the Senate Minority Report criticizedby the Credibility Project is just as valid asThe Intergovernmental Panel on ClimateChange (IPCC) Physical Science Report-2007, and one of them notes, correctly,that the full subtitle of this IPCC report is\"The Physical Science Basis.\" I have sev-eral comments on their main points. The Senate Minority Report was generated with encouragement from aUnited States senator notorious formaking bogus statements to the effectthat \"global warming is the biggest hoaxperpetrated on the American People.\"That claim is patent nonsense. Globalwarming over the past three decades isan observationally based scientific fact.Even the current period, cool only rela-tive to the twenty-five-year rise endingin 2005, was predicted by the best cli- mate models, which also predict thatwithin a decade\u2014and possibly muchsooner\u2014we will experience anothersharp global temperature rise. Vetting aquestionable report was the motivationfor our Credibility Project, and no suchmotivation existed for us to vet theIPCC-2007 science report. It still doesn't. We were careful in defining what a climate scientist is, andour definition was rather broad. Whetherthe same definition was used by the sci-entist quoted by Sheaffer is not clear, butit is not hard to find a few contrarianswilling to define terms to suit their con-clusions. As for the number of scientistsactually doing climate science, properlydefined, even if \"only\" 620 appear as actual authors of the sections in IPCC-2007 science report, this work is sup-ported by well over 2,000 climate scien- tists whose work in the peer-reviewed lit-erature is referenced in that document. As for the science itself, recalling that peer-reviewed science is a self-correctingprocess, not only has the predictivepower of global climate science beenconfirmed, but actual observations of melting icecaps in Greenland and dete- riorating conditions in the Arctic paintan even more dire picture than wasavailable in the IPCC-2007 sciencereport, as noted in our CredibilityProject. In contrast, no scientific resultsbased on observations have emerged tochallenge the large consensus of the cli-mate science community. Those whoinvoke the solar cycle, to which there isno global temperature correlation evenif one allows for phase shifts, or who citepossible increases in solar flux, of whichobservations show none over this warm-ing epoch, are especially off the mark.Yet many contrarians continue to pro-pose the Sun as the dominant driver ofglobal warming, possibly for lack ofother hypotheses. What about the cautious nature of the stated conclusions in our CredibilityProject? We leave it to the reader todecide if we are pursuing \"an agenda.\"Consider our penultimate sentence, inwhich we make it clear that we arerestricting ourselves to what we knowbest\u2014the science: \"The authors of thisCredibility Project are not qualified toassess the engineering and economicquestions associated with proposed leg-islation addressing climate change.\" At this point, it may be best to move the debate into the halls of Congress, where there is a huge scientific commu- nity prepared to defend the legitimacy ofclimate science against the small numberof scientific claims to the contrary. I havehad a civil exchange with one of the abovecritics of our project and think bothSheaffer and Posner are sincere in theirskepticism. I also commend the S KEP- TICAL INQUIRER for presenting both sides of this issue while reminding the readerthat this does not imply equal weight toall positions when science is involved.Following the above quote from our con-clusion is our final, summary statementon the Credibility Project: \"We are dis-turbed by any document that may mis-represent the state of the global scientificeffort to address this problem.\" We stand by that statement.Response to 'Assessing the Credibility of CFI's Credibility Projec t' STUART JORDAN I also commend the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER for presenting both sides of this issue while reminding the reader that this does not imply equal weight to all positions when science is involved.

By Dan Brown, Doubleday, New York, 2009. ISBN: 978-0-385-50422-5. Hardcover, $29.95. Dan Brown has done it again. He's produced another page-turning,thrill-a-minute novel, offering up more pseudohistory and pseudo-science in the process. Just like his earlier The Da Vinci Code (2003), The Lost Symbol (2009) begins with a gruesome discovery in a publicgallery and proceeds\u2014by solving devil-ishly cryptic puzzles, analyzing artworks,and uncovering lost histories\u2014on a questfor a fabled treasure, while the hero andheroine are dogged by both a freakish,maniacal killer and equally relentlessauthorities. To borrow from Yogi Berra,\"It's d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again!\" Brown claimed portions of The Da Vinci Code were based on fact. In particu- lar, he asserted that a secret society calledthe Priory of Sion was \"a real organiza-tion\" founded in 1099 and that parch-ments that surfaced in 1975 listed amongits noted members Leonardo da Vinci.Actually, Les Dossiers Secrets were proven to have been part of a hoax, one thatsnookered the authors of two popularpseudohistories, Holy Blood, Holy Grail and The T emplar Revelation. Brown's reliance on such sources earned himdeserved Da (see \"Deciphering Da Vinci'sRealCodes\" [Nickell 2007]).Now, The Lost Symbol\u2014featuring a quest for the hidden secrets of theancients, namely the veiled truths of theFreemasons, and set in Washington,DC\u2014takes a leap of faith into somethingcalled \"Noetic Science.\" Time Noetic Science? Well, ithas more to do with noetic (after a Greek word suggesting \"inner knowing\") thanwith science. The concept, advanced by the of Noetic Sciences (IONS) inNorthern is \"balanced bypersonal and collective wisdom\" in order\"to support a shift in consciousness thattransforms present global conditions intoa world grounded in freedom, wisdom,and love\" (according to the IONS Website [Institute 2009]). In addition to host-ing retreats and workshops, IONS\"explores the frontiers of consciousness\"and \"researches subtle energies and thepower of healing,\" among other things. Its vision stems from an \"epiphany\" that astronaut Edgar Mitchell had in1971 when, on the Apollo 14 Moonmission, he saw planet Earth suspendedin space. According to Mitchell, \"Thepresence of divinity became almost pal-pable, and I knew that life in the uni-verse was not just an accident based onrandom processes. . . . The knowledgecame to me directly\" (Institute 2009). In fact, Mitchell was already involved in the paranormal, conducting his ownprivate unauthorized ESP experimentduring the Apollo 14 mission. Althoughhe touted the results at odds of about3,000 to one, it was only by citing a\"negative ESP effect,\" as he termed it(Mitchell 1974, 34), \"because the num-ber of hits was amazingly low\"! Un-deterred, Mitchell also came to believethat plants could perceive and compre-hend human thoughts and that spoon-bending magician Uri Geller had gen-uine psychic and psychokinetic powers(Randi 1995, 203-204). Mitchell is a repeat conspiracy theo- rist, claiming that the reality of UFOs,the crash of a flying saucer at Roswell,and the study of recovered alien corpseshave all been subjected to government\"disinformation\" to hide the truth fromthe public. His organization, IONS,suggests he has found reality more com-plex than \"conventional science had ledhim to believe\" (Institute 2009). How- Joe Nickell, PhD, is CSI's senior research fellow.

While reading the article by Dr.Lakshmikumar about the lack of interactionbetween cellular phones and microwaveovens with organic tissue, I noticed (as I amsure many others have) that he is making anerror amounting to three orders of magni-tude in the frequency (thus energy) of micro-wave oven radiation. The frequency is muchlower, actually 2.45 GHz, and the wave-length of this radiation in air is approxi-mately 12 cm as opposed to 0.1 mm, as canbe easily observed by melting butter withouta rotating platter, say: maximum heatingoccurs every 6 cm, i.e., every half wavelengthof the radiation. This oversight of coursedoes not invalidate his argument. Christian GigaultAssistant Professor, Department of Physics University of OttawaOttawa, Ontario In \"Power Line Panic and Mobile Mania\"there is a rather important error. At first Ithought it was just a typo, but instead it is ref-erenced further in calculations and results in amisleading conclusion. Household microwaveovens operate in the Industrial, Scientific, andMedical (ISM) frequency band of 2.4GHz-2.5GHz, which is 2.45 /c450109, not 2.45 /c4501012, as stated in the article. This can be verified forany microwave by simply opening the doorand reading the FCC label. This same errorwas reproduced in the end of the article whenthe writer states that the wavelength of amicrowave oven is 0.1 mm; rather, the wave-length of a microwave is about 12 cm in free space. A cell phone wavelength is somewherebetween 33 cm and 16 cm in free space. Anthony ValenzanoElectrical EngineerArchbald, Pennsylvania The article \"Power Line Panic and MobileMania\" by S.T. Lakshmikumar is quite nice.But there is an important error: the fre-quency used for a household microwaveoven was erroneously specified. The correctfrequency is 2.45 GHz (= 2.45 /c450109Hz) not 2.45/c4501012Hz. Thus the energy for the pho- tons from the microwave oven is about thesame as the energy from photons from thecell phone; they do not differ by a factor of1,000, as cited in the next sentence. Gerald Jay SussmanProfessor of Electrical Engineering Massachusetts Institute of Technology S.T. Lakshmikumar responds: An apology. The mistake was typographical. I made one mistake of using /c450 10 12rather than /c450109. Then I made a second consequential mistake when I calculated the wavelength fromthe wrong number used earlier. I seriously wentthrough the text to see if changes are required.The passage microwave oven is 2.45 /c4501012Hz. There- fore the energy of photons in these sources will be lower by a factor of a thousand forthe microwave oven and a million for themobile hand set. should have read microwave oven is 2.45/c450 109Hz. Therefore the energy of photons in these sources willbe lower by a factor of a billion for themicrowave oven and/or the mobile hand set. And the passage The wavelength of a photon in a micro-wave oven is approximately 0.1 mm. should have read The wavelength of a photon in a micro-wave oven is approximately 10 cm. Violent Video Games? As long-term researchers in the field of psy- chology of children and the media and sub-scribers to S KEPTICAL INQUIRER , we are seri- ously concerned with the article on researchconcerning violent video games by Christo-pher Ferguson (SI, September/October 2009). He disagrees with the conclusions of the manyexperiments that relate children's and teen-agers' playing of violent video games to higherlevels of aggression, angry thoughts, and lackof helping behaviors. He claims that thesestudies are essentially fallacious and that thereports by highly respected investigators arepseudoscience. Since the research has been generally published in the best critical peer-reviewedjournals, we do not understand why S KEP- TICAL INQUIRER could print this article with- out a significant rebuttal. Ferguson's ownmeta-analyses are more cherry-picked thanthe ones he criticizes that demonstrate theassociation between aggression and violentvideo game playing. The author ignores theextensive body of research that supports thesocial learning theory in psychology initiatedby Professor Bandura of Stanford that hasproved influential in cognitive, developmen-tal, and personality psychology. No serious researchers have called for censorship, nor have they made claims thatthe violence of children in school shootingswas solely caused by violent video game play-ing. There are many factors in a child's lifethat may evoke aggressive actions, but itappears now that playing specifically andconsistently with especially violent gamesmay be a further influence. Jerome L. Singer and Dorothy G. Singer Yale University I thoroughly enjoyed Ferguson's article, espe-cially his \"insider information\" on how thesestudies are performed. As a \"hard\" scientist(PhD in chemistry) I have always wonderedhow one could possibly study \"violence\" inany controlled, objective way: How would\"informed consent\" work in that case? The answer, of course, is that researchers don't really study violence, except as after-the-fact anecdotes. (Of course, incarcerated violentcriminals, the sharp ones at least, often seize onthe latest media darling as self-justification\u2014porn lit, video games, whatever. How reliableis that?) Violent behavior is, almost by definition, aggressive. However, as Ferguson points out, it ishardly definitive that aggressive behavior is anykind of predictor of a propensity for violence. In fact, saying that such a connection is a matter of\"open debate\" seems overly kind to me. In some venues\u2014football comes to mind immediately\u2014aggression and violence are cer-tainly correlated, encouraged, in fact. Thathardly equates to ordinary day-to-day living. The inverse relationship between Youth Violence and Video Game Sales (on the chart, SI Jan Feb 2010 pgs 11/12/09 11:07 AM Page 62SKEPTICAL INQUIRER January / February 2010 63LETTERS TO THE EDITOR page 40) invites an intriguing hypothesis: Violence-laden video games let young people\"blow off steam\" (express their frustrations)and make them less likely to engage in real- world violence. This may sound weird, but itis every bit as defensible as saying that gamespromote violent acts. Evan E. Filby, PhDIdaho Academy of Scienceias_biz@earthlink.net Christopher J. Ferguson responds: I thank Dr. Filby and Drs. Singer for their responses. Dr. Filby raises numerous points forconstructive dialogue; unfortunately the Singersprovide mainly misinformation. One might be forgiven, reading the Singers' letter, concluding there is consistent researchshowing harmful effects of VVGs. Yet this simplyisn't the case no matter how often some researcherstry to make this claim. It is indefensible that somehave chosen to ignore data incongruent withtheir beliefs and falsely communicate consistencyto the scientific community. Contrary to theSingers' implication, my meta-analyses (them-selves published in highly ranked peer-reviewedjournals) include many studies by anti-gameadvocates. By contrast the \"cherry-picked\" natureof previous reviews has been noted, not just byme, but by the federal courts of the United States(e.g., ESA, VSDA, and IRMA v. Blagojevich, Madigan, and Devine, 2005). As for censorship, the Singers appear unaware of Gentile, Saleem, and Anderson's (2007) callfor journalists to stop citing critics of the anti-game view in what they entitle the \"misappliedfairness doctrine.\" Neither are the Singers appar-ently aware of the \"Cologne Declaration\" (2008)signed by numerous German scholars, which callsfor a ban on violent games and labels opposingscholars as \"collaborators and accomplices\" of theVVG industry. Some American scholars simplyreplace \"censorship\" with \"regulation,\" but theintent is clearly the same. As to their last com-ment, in fact, I never stated anti-game scholarsclaim games are the only cause of violence. Just because anti-game advocates acknowledge othercauses doesn't imply they can't be wrong aboutvideo games. I assure the Singers I am well awareof the full range of video-game studies andequally assure the readers of this magazine thatthey add up to very little, certainly far less thansome scholars have irresponsibly claimed. NDE Experiment Ethics? Regarding ethical objectionseems frivolous. 1) Although Dieguez refersto the study as an \"experiment,\" it is not an experiment; it is a field study. 2) Dieguezasserts: \"In such an experiment the indepen-dent variable is the pre-selected target.... \"No, the real independent variable is the dif-ference in two kinds of brain states, one ofunconscious subjects in cardiac distress andone of \"normal\" subjects. 3) Involvement ofsubjects does not begin until they are askedfor their informed consent. This occurs afterplacement of hidden targets, which does notrequire their consent. To think otherwise israther silly, in my opinion. 4) Dieguez pre-sents no evidence that the placement of hid-den targets or the request for informed con-sent from patients is harmful to them. 5)Dieguez talks as though the Parnia study isone \"on cardiac arrest resuscitation\"; it is not.It is an investigation about the brain-mindrelationship in human beings. 6) The study, ifproperly conducted, has a design that enablesvalid inferences about important hypotheses.In conclusion, the objections by Dieguez tothe Parnia study appear totally unfounded.The French and Blackmore critiques follow-ing the article were much too tepid. Gary J. WhittenbergerTallahassee, Florida Dieguez argues that suspending a target abovea patient being treated for cardiac arrest so thatit can't be seen except from an \"out of body\"point of view, then asking the recoveredpatient about seeing it in a near death experi-ence (NDE) afterwards, violates rules for medical ethics since informed consent can't beobtained until a conversation with the recov-ered patient, by which time the patient has already \"participated\" by having the targetin place. I see no reason to believe that NDE out- of-body experiences and other such parapsy-chological phenomena are anything otherthan nonsense, but I believe that Dieguez isstretching ethics rules for informed consentwell beyond their intent. Those rules are inplace for a reason\u2014to avoid things being\"done to\" patients that might put them at riskor violate their privacy unless they agree to it.Things that have no effect on their treatmentor privacy do not fall within the rules ofinformed consent, even if there is no benefitto the patient whatsoever. Thus, hospitals canaccumulate after-the-fact statistics on num-bers of patients treated, admission conditions(how many broken bones, cardiac arrests, kid-ney stones, etc.), and treatment outcomes andpublish analyses of the statistics without spe-cific permission from every patient. Sincerecording and using these data does not vio-late patients' privacy or affect their treatment,\"informed consent\" is not required. Suspending an invisible target has con-siderably less effect on the patient and treat- ment than, say, changing the hospital's inte-rior paint color. Asking the patient aboutwhat they may have seen after recovery andgiving them the informed choice not torespond or participate at all fulfills any pos-sible need for \"protection\" from manipula-tion or privacy violation and thus fulfills anyethical requirement I can imagine. Joel S. DavisAlbuquerque, New Mexico I find it difficult to accept Sebastian Di-eguez's argument that the proposed NDEexperiment is unethical. However, to allevi-ate his concerns, it is important for theexperimenter to provide full disclosure whenasking the patient to participate. In theexample he provides, it does seem that theexperimenter is pulling a bait and switch. Inreality, something like the following shouldsuffice: \"We are conducting a study into theexperiences people have when they are in adeep coma, including asking about things thatsome people would consider impossible. Wouldyou like to participate?\" If the person agrees to participate, he has given informed consent and there is no ethi-cal problem. If the person refuses to partici-pate, it would be quite a leap to say that hehas \"already been involved in a parapsycho-logical experiment without his consent.\"According to Dieguez's basic assumptions,the mere prior placement of the hidden tar-gets cannot have had any affect on the patient's mental state (otherwise ESP exists!). There-fore it is not reasonable to think that this actsomehow unethically \"involves\" the patientin an experiment. Ron KarrSunnyvale, California Sebastian Dieguez suggests in his article onNDEs that the AWARE study is unethicaldue to the unavailability of consent in car-diac arrest patients. While I appreciate hisarticle, I differ with his conclusion. Themain thrust of his argument seems to be thatthere is no medical benefit expected as aresult of this type of research. He fails to dis-cuss the suffering and financial losses thatoccur in patients who turn to pseudosciencein times of illness (though admittedly notduring cardiac arrest). There is also some-thing to be said for providing an answer to aquestion that provides a major pillar of belieffor the religious (I refer the reader to SamHarris's End of Faith). A scientific examination of OBEs in the setting of NDEs may provide a reasonedresponse to the question of life after death. SI Jan Feb 2010 pgs 11/12/09 11:07 AM Page 6364 VOLUME 34, ISSUE 1 SKEPTICAL INQUIRERMembers of the lay public may not have the level of training and education to appreciatecomplex arguments regarding neurophysiol-ogy and consciousness, relying on anecdotalreports and urban myths. I believe AWAREresults may provide a simple skeptical re-sponse based on a study that is easy to under-stand. Dieguez asks how AWARE differsfrom weighing patients before and afterdeath. Though I am atheist, I assume believ-ers would discount such results citing theweightlessness of a soul. In contrast, OBEsare either genuine or hallucinatory experi-ences that can be scientifically examined. (Iwould also be interested to know if similarstudies have been performed on meditation,also claimed to produce OBEs, without con-sent problems.) Although I am not an investigator for AWARE, as a clinician I would have noproblem with participation in such a study,and as a skeptic I will be looking forward tothe results of a rational investigation into thelife-after-death meme. Dallas Smith, MDEmergency PhysicianSherman Oaks, California (See also the Livingston and Tobacyk Follow-Up column \"When Does a Person Become aHuman Subject?\" in this issue. \u2014E D.) Disclaimers on Paranormal TV Programs I was not surprised to read of Wiseman, French, and Watt's failure to find significanteffects for disclaimers placed in TV shows thatdepict the \"abilities\" of a medium (SI, Sep-tember/October 2009). I have published sev-eral studies on the effects of media depictionson paranormal beliefs, including one experi-ment that did find evidence for the effects of disclaimers (see my article in SI, July/August1998). However, there were significant differ-ences between the disclaimers that I used andthe ones reported by Wiseman, French, andWatt. Their research deliberately focused onthe types of disclaimers that actually appear onbroadcast TV. As such, these disclaimers aretypically presented in small text and carry amessage that doesn't disclaim with much force.It might even be argued that several features ofthe disclaimers used in this research could haveencouraged some to believe even more in a medium's psychic ability. For just one example among many that could be selected, if a phenomenon has not yetbeen subjected to \"controlled scientific investi-gations,\" as one of their disclaimers stated, someviewers could draw the conclusion that whatthey've seen is so convincing and unusual thatscientists simply haven't had the chance to studyit yet. They may be left with the impression thatonce scientists do study it, they too will find outthat mediums really do have great abilities. While Wiseman, French, and Watt's contri- bution clearly points out that the typical dis-claimers currently in use are weak, their resultsdon't mean that other stronger disclaimersmight not affect viewers exactly as they areintended. In my own study, I used disclaimersthat were presented both visually (in large read-able text) as well as acoustically (viewers hearda male voice-over saying the text as it appearedon screen). One of the effective disclaimersstated that what was being seen was fictitiousand presented only for entertainment; anotherwas even stronger and asserted that the depic-tions violated the known laws of nature andnothing like them had ever actually occurred. All of this is to suggest that we shouldn't simply conclude that disclaimers have no effect.Their effectiveness may have everything to dowith how the disclaimer is presented and exactlyhow the depicted events are disclaimed. Theoverriding problem may be to convince broad-casters to take greater interest in including morepowerful disclaimers in their programs. Glenn G. SparksProfessor of CommunicationPurdue UniversityWest Lafayette, Indiana Christopher French replies: Glenn Sparks's interesting comments have, of course, hit the nail on the head with respect towhere the main problem lies in the use ofappropriately worded disclaimers in this con-text. Makers of paranormal programs are nodifferent from other program-makers insofar astheir top priority is viewing figures. They knowthat such programs will be watched predomi-nantly by believers and that such viewers wantto believe that the events portrayed involve realparanormal activity. Therefore they will try toget away with using very weakly worded dis-claimers (presented almost subliminally) oreven wording that implies the events really areparanormal. It is difficult to see how they couldbe persuaded to use stronger wording thatmight result in lower viewing figures. Climate Change: Science and Politics I was interested to read Stuart Jordan's com- mentary, \"Can a Reasonable Skeptic SupportClimate Change Legislation?\" theSeptember/October issue of the S KEPTICAL INQUIRER .The article's deck reads, \"CFI vets list of 'dissenting Senateminority percent haven't Jordan likewise vettedthe U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel onClimate Change (IPCC), described as a groupof \"approximately 2,000 scientists worldwide.\"If this vetting was not done, why not? Did CFIsimply assume that all 2,000 are professionalclimate researchers who have published peer-reviewed research? Very bad assumption! Fortunately, this question has been ad- dressed elsewhere. In a recent debate with JohnChristy, Professor William Schlesinger, a leadauthor for the IPCC, admitted that only 20percent of IPCC scientists deal with climate.Schlesinger said, \"Something on the order of20 percent have had some dealing with cli-mate\" (see http://tinyurl.com/b5uaqq). Inother words, 80 percent of the IPCC mem-bership had absolutely no dealing with the cli-mate as part of their academic studies. Jordan's\"knockout So, these two groups appear tohave approximately the same makeup in termsof actual scientists. In fact, the dissentinggroup appears stronger because their 20 per-cent is held to a higher standard (peer-reviewed research) versus the IPCC's (hadsome academic study of climate). Elsewhere, Jordan has objected that his article specifically refers only to The PhysicalScience Basis (although I do not find that title in his paper). Presumably this is the same astheIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Physical Science Report-2007, which hispaper mentions. However, this does not solvethe problem. That document is the product of620 authors or contributors, a far cry from theclaimed \"approximately 2,000 scientists world-wide.\" Furthermor e, while many of the con- tributors are evidently credentialed climate sci-entists, we do not know for certain that all 620of them have published at least one climate-related paper in a peer-reviewed journal, thecriterion by which the other group is mea-sured. This whole exercise is logically flawedand invalid unless both groups are \"vetted\" bythe same criteria and the results compared. Robert SheafferLakeside, California (See also Gary Posner's Follow-Up column,\"Assessing the Credibility of CFI's 'CredibilityProject,'\" in this and Stuart Jordan's responsethere to Posner and Sheaffer. \u2014E D.) I do not believe the underlying problem con-fronting the skeptic considering climate legis-lation is correctly posed by Stuart Jordan in hiswell-researched commentary. Science, whenbased on conclusive and irrefutable evidence,can form the basis for legislative action.Consensus opinion is not, however, scienceLETTERS TO THE EDITOR SI Jan Feb 2010 pgs 11/12/09 11:08 AM Page 64SKEPTICAL INQUIRER January / February 2010 65LETTERS TO THE EDITOR and should not of itself form the basis for leg- islative action. Nevertheless, since the potentialfor harm from global warming from humanactivity exists and the failure to act couldenhance the consequences of such activity,consideration of the issue is still mandated. Until the scientific theory is proven or dis- proven, the decision to act or not to act andhow to act must at present be based on theo-retical possibilities. This political decisionmaking is similar to the decision-makingprocess involved in economic policy and simi-lar government programs. Valid science isunrelated to consensus viewpoint, but itsabsence does not bar considered thought inthe presence of conceivable potential harmthrough inaction. Michael L. AshnerCove Neck, New York Logophobia and Regarding Pigliucciinforms us, logophobia , which translates to the fear of rational thoughts, is not just a joke forskeptics to bandy around. I believe it goesdirectly to the core of the problem. In my bookThinking Rationally in an Irrational World Ihave used the term aletheiaphobia, which trans-lates to fear of the truth\u2014reason, truth, andreality being one and the same. It is not just the creationists that suffer from this illness; it is a universal problem.Harriet Hall (\"Playing by the Rules,\" SIMay/June 2009) states the case for science butfails to be entirely objective. Waiting patientlyfor all the evidence to come in (otherwiseknown as letting time be the judge) causesvalid ideas to fall into the \"yet to be fullyunderstood\" basket. What one person seesclearly, others try to bring down. If there isanything personal at stake, our instinctivereaction is to kill the messenger. Hall also said that it is wrong to put one's ideas before the public expecting to influencescience. At a time when doctors lost theirlicenses for even suggesting vitamin supple-ments, they took their findings to the public.Those who hadn't gotten help from their doc-tors benefited immediately and were calledhealth nuts. The symptoms that were not intheir doctors' books were the early signs ofmalnutrition. Hall uses the example of Helicobacter and ulcers to show that science does change itsmind; she overlooks the long and wasted time ittook to accept the evidence. It is right for sci-ence not to act too quickly, but there is noexcuse when the evidence is obvious. There isalso the need to interpret the evidence correctly;this depends on using our rational mind\u2014wemight even say that the need for reasoningcaused our prefrontal cortex to evolve. In my book I show that reasoning does work, and we can know the truth once weunderstand what a whole truth is. I also give acorrected interpretation of evolution as itapplies to human behavior, which I believewill be the ammunition needed to stop thefundamentalist surge. Is anybody interested?Does anybody care? Judging by the strict rulesof science, time will be the judge, but do wehave that much time? As Pigliucci concludes, \"fighting the spread of logophobia is a primary responsibility ofevery critically thinking person despite theunfavorable odds, which is why thoroughknowledge of the disease and of its symptomsis so crucial.\" I second that motion. Joan MorroneSebring, Florida It's easy to win an argument if you set up astraw man to demolish. I think that this iswhat Massimo Pigliucci has done in his col-umn \"Logophobia.\" He criticizes MichelFoucault and other postmoderns for theirstance science and thus castigates thewhole postmodern movement as antiscience. However Foucault and the other post- moderns weren't scientists but philosophers,and they were not talking about science butabout how science operates in society.Postmodern thought doesn't say there is notruth but that objective truth is very, veryhard to achieve because of the difficulty peo-ple have in being objective. The scientistdoes not hold a mirror up to nature but aprism in which what is observed is distortedby one's experience, by cultural assumptions,by a language that is biased, by power rela-tionships, and many other factors. Does that mean that we should give up in despair and stop looking for truth? Of coursenot. It simply means that we should be a littlemore humble and less arrogant in the search. Myra Jonesmjones672@tampabay.rr.com Bobby Fischer and Others While Martin Gardner (\"Bobby Fischer: Genius and Idiot,\" SI, September/October2009) correctly stated that Sir Arthur ConanDoyle firmly believed in the wee folk, thismight have left the mistaken impression thatthe creator of the rigorous, detached, scientif-ically minded Sherlock Holmes was himselftotally and utterly credulous about the littlepeople. In Doyle's defense and in the name offairness, it should be noted that in his 1922book The Coming of the Fairies Doyle ex- pressed serious doubts that their \"little fairyhorses\" existed as \"mentioned by several writ-ers\" for, if so, then \"why not dogs?\" And hewarily concluded, \"I have convinced myselfthat there is overwhelming evidence for thefairies, but I have by no means been able toassure myself of these adjuncts.\" Don Nigroni Glenolden, Pennsylvania I love your magazine and all it stands for, and I have had a great deal of respect for MartinGardner for over thirty years; however, his useof the word \"idiot\" in the title of his columnon Bobby Fischer (SI, September/October2009) was a little harsh. It seems obvious thatFischer suffered from some mental illness,which to me would explain his erratic behav-ior. The use of the term \"idiot\" is degradingand unfair, in my opinion.

Ask The Outlaw Skeptic Mr. Outlaw, What's it called when someone sees an image of an animal in the clouds or aman's face on Mars? I know the termstarts with a \"P ,\" but there are simplytoo many p-words in the dictionary toknow where to begin. I'm askingbecause I clearly see an image of theMonkey God in an oily spot on mydriveway. Well? \u2014Puzzled in California Dear Puzzled, I think the word you're looking for is \"psychotic.\" Since you live in theU.S., culturally the only religiousimages you're likely to see in ordinaryobjects are Jesus, the Virgin Mary, orL. Ron Hubbard, which would actu-ally be described as pareidolia. Your\"Monkey God\" sighting is a delu-sion. Although I'm somewhat skepti-cal about psychiatrists, I suggest youthink about seeing one. Then again,in your particular nut-job case, ahypnotherapist might be the bettermatch. You deserve each other. \u00a9 2009 Reprinted by permission, King Features Syndicate Rob PudimSI Jan Feb 2010 pgs 11/12/09 11:11 AM Page 66COMMITTEE FOR SKEPTICAL INQUIRY |SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL CONSULTANTS Gary Bauslaugh, editor, Humanist Perspectives , Victoria, B.C., Canada Richard E.
