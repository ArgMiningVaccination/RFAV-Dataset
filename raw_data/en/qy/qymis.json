In addition, OMB works to ensure enacted law is carried out as efficiently and effectively as possible. In meeting these responsibilities, OMB reviews agency budgets, management, legislative, regulatory, financial, procurement, and other proposals; assures that all such proposals are consistent with relevant sta tutes and Presidential objectives; provides both short -range and long -range analysis and advice to government officials on a variety of subjects; and develops Government- Wide policies. A s a core part of its mission (and working with the White House and Fe deral agencies), OMB develops the President 's budget proposals, submits the President's Budget to Congress and supports its enactment, and oversees the Executive Branch 's implementation of the enacted appropriations (including through the apportionment of funds). OMB ensures agencies develop, express, and implement policies and practices in accordance with the President's priorities and statutory direction and is committed to improving the effective , efficient, and equitable design and implementation of gov ernment programs. OMB also serves as the central point for review and clearance of Executive Branch legislative proposals, executive orders, and presidential memorandums. O MB derives its basic authority from Title 31 of the U.S. Code, based on provisions originally enacted in the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, as amended. This Act provided the first comprehensive national budget system and established the Bureau of the Budget (the Bureau), the precursor to OMB, in the Department of the Treasury . The Ac t called for the Bureau to assemble and correlate, as well as recommend changes to, the requests for appropriations of the Executive Branch. The Bureau was further authorized to make detailed administrative studies that would help in securing greater econo my and efficiency in the conduct of the public service . The Bureau moved from the Department of the Treasury to the Executive Office of the President (EOP) in 1939 and was reorganized into OMB by Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1970. O rganizational Responsib ilities O MB plays a pivotal role in developing and supporting the President's management, budget, and legislative agenda . OMB components assist the President in the preparation of the Federal budget and in managing its execution throughout the departments and agencies . In helping formulate the President's spending plans, OMB examines the effectiveness of agency programs, policies, and procedures; assesses competing funding demands among agencies; recommends funding priorities; and provides policy options . The following illustrates OMB 's work in budget and policy development, budget and policy enactment , budget and policy implementation, and management and performance: Executive Office of the President Office of Management and Budget OMB -4 Budget and Policy Development - Every year, OMB staff are involved in the development of new program policies , including policies proposed to be put forward in the President's Budget, by executive order , or in some other appropriate manner . OMB staff are involved at every stage, from inception of policy ideas to detailed analysis and comparison of options . Each new program or policy requires close engagement of OMB staff and policy officials with White House staff and agency staffs. Budget and Policy Enactment - OMB staff support Admi nistration officials , working with the Congress, in enact ing the President's Budget and legislative programs and in responding to congressional inquiries . OMB works to ensure that proposed legislation, testimony, reports, and policies are consistent with A dministration policies, including the President's Budget. Budget and Policy Implementation - OMB staff monitor the implementation of major programs and policies , review the performance of government programs, and perform analyses to inform future policy m aking. In doing so, they identify \u2014and help to resolve \u2014issues that arise in (1) the development of initial regulations and program guidance, (2) program implementation and management, (3) data reporting and analysis, and (4) long range evaluation and research designs . Management and Performance - OMB develops and executes a Government -wide management agenda that includes service delivery, information technology, cybersecurity, financial management, procurement, performance, and human resources . In this capa city, OMB oversees agency management of programs and resources to improve efficiency, effectiveness, equity, and accountability, and to achieve legislative goals and Administration policy. It also oversees agency program evaluation activities to determine their net effects, success or failure, and how agencies respond to these findings by making management improvements and developing new budget and policy proposals. The following is a brief summary of the functions of each of the offices within OMB: Resou rce Management Offices (RMOs) - RMOs examine agency budget requests, programs, regulatory and legislative proposals, and management activities in order to ensure consistency with the President's policies, coordination among Federal agencies, and effective implementation of enacted legislation . The RMOs are: National Security Programs; Transportation, Homeland Security, Justice, and Services Programs; Housing, Treasury, and Commerce Programs; Climate, Energy, Environment, and Science Programs; Education, Inc ome Maintenance, and Labor Programs; and Health Programs. These offices are the core source of expertise on all matters pertaining to the programs and operations of Federal departments and agencies. Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) - OIRA reviews collections of information imposed on the public; provides guidance concerning the acquisition, use , and management of Federal information resources; coordinates policy direction on Federal statistical activities; and implements executive regulatory oversight activities under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) and Executive Order 13563 (Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review). Executive Office of the President Office of Management and Budget OMB -5 Office of Federal Financial Management (OFFM) - OFFM develops and provides direction on the implementation of financial management policies and systems . This office also supports the effective and equitable u se of Federal financial resources by improving the quality, utility, and transparency of financial information, advancing program integrity, and protecting against waste, fraud , and abuse in the Federal Government. Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OF PP) - OFPP provides overall direction of procurement policies, regulations, and procedures for Executive agencies . It prescribes Government -Wide procurement policies to be implemented in the Federal Acquisition Regulation and provides leadership and coordination in the formulation of Executive B ranch positions on procurement and procurement- related legislation . The Cost Accounting Standards Board, an entity within OFPP, exercises the authority to make, promulgate, amend, and rescind cost accounting standards. OMB -Wide Support Offices - OMB -Wide Support Offices provide executive direction and coordination for all OMB activities . These offices include: Communications and Strategic Planning, General Counsel , Legislative Affairs , Economic Policy , Management and Operations , Legislative Reference , Budget Review , and Performance and Personnel Management. OMB -wide support offices provide overall leadership for the agency's activities . develop and coordinate instructions and procedures for a wide range of management, legislative, legal, economic, budgetary, operational, and IT -related issues , coordinate OMB review of agency activities , and prepare the President's Budget documents. Overview For fiscal year (FY) 2023, the estimated funding requirement for OMB is $128,035,000, supporting a full -time equivalent (FTE) level of 510 (516 including a n internship program). This request is $ 21,435,000 (20.1% ) above the F Y 2022 annualized continuing resolution level of $106,600,000. The increased funding will support an additional 59 FTEs compared to OMB's current 451 projected FTE s level for FY 2022, or 65 FTEs counting the internship program . More than half of the requested increase in staffing ( 44 FTEs) are for positions that OMB has not filled since FY 2020, as OMB's FY 2020, FY 2021, and FY 2022 resources were not sufficient to maintain staffing levels . The requested increase is entirely for career positions and would generally restore total staffing levels (excluding interns) to their FY 2012 ( pre-sequestration ) levels. We are r equesting this increase to provide for: Unavoidable Costs (+$6,528,000) The OMB FY 2023 budget request provides $6,528,000 for unavoidable costs including: +$4,396,000 for personnel compensation and benefit increases including the FY 2022 and FY 2023 pay adjustments and fully funding existing staff costs. Executive Office of the President Office of Management and Budget OMB -6 +$2,000,000 to restore MAX Budget Systems funding that was leveraged in FY 2021 and reallocated in FY 2022 to cover personnel costs. ( $38,000) or a 0.53% decrease in rental costs for office space from the General Services Administration ( GSA). + $170,000 for cost increases associated with Information Technology contractor support. This includes support in the following functional areas: Help Desk, Engineering, Development , and the MAX Information System, which is used to support OMB 's Government-w ide management and budget processes. Investing in OMB's Workforce (+$ 11,475,000) OMB requests additional funding to restore a portion of previous staff cuts to strengthen it s ability to meet core responsibilities and new statutory requirements and continue improving its effectiveness . The requested staffing level is essential for OMB to continue its work on developing and executing the President's Budget and key Administration priorities, overseeing the performance of Federal agencies, implementing the President's Management Agenda, and effectively undertaking the significant and critically important Administration priorities. O ver the past decade, OMB has taken on new resp onsibilities , such as advancing evidence -based policymaking through implementation of the Foundations of Evidence -Based Policymaking Act of 2018 and advancing and integrating customer service and service delivery across High Impact Service Provider (HISP) agencies. OMB has also been charged with additional responsibilities such as developing a Federal Program Inventory , which requires the agency to be fully staffed to further advance and build on initial efforts . M oreover, OMB took on numerous new respons ibilities due to its Government- wide leadership of the COVID -19 response and is also playing a key role in implementing the American Rescue Plan (ARP) and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). OMB's role in IIJA implementation includes working closely with agencies on spend plans, hiring, and other implementation activities and issuing Government- wide guidance to ensure program integrity, transparency, and effective implementation . O MB is also helping to lead implementation of numerous Executive O rders (EOs) with sweeping and significant impact, including - but not limited to - EO 14058, Transforming Federal Customer Experience and Service Delivery to Rebuild Trust in Government , EO 13985, On Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government , and EO 14005, Ensuring the Future is Made in All of America by All of America's Workers . These implementation efforts require OMB to coordinate across agencies and the EOP , as well as through the President's Management Council and other executive management councils OMB chairs . In addition, within OMB, the Made in America Office \u2014 established through EO 14005 and codified through IIJA \u2014 is working with agencies to maximize the use of Federal procurement and Federal financial assistance for domestic goods and services that Executive Office of the President Office of Management and Budget OMB -7 provide good value while strengthening the U.S. industrial base in critical sectors and creating good-paying jobs and economic opportunities in communities across the Nation. D espite its growing responsibilities , OMB's budget and staff have not increased significantly in many years . To the contrary, total staffing levels are 60 FTEs lower than just over a decade ago, and over 35 FTEs less than six years ago . And as a result of staffing reali gnments made across OMB since FY 2018, many OMB offices essential to the successful implementation of key Administration priorities have lost and been unable to fill critical positions . This has left OMB with substantial staffing challenges in leading the Administration's efforts at addressing its critical priorities . For example, across OMB's RMOs, tota l career staffing is 82 FTEs (22% ) lower than just over a decade ago and over 36 FTE s (12%) lower than six years ago. S tarting in FY 2020, OMB was forced to reduce its staffing level by not filling vacancies, and made significant operational reductions, eliminating funding for training and travel and making cuts to IT contracts . In FY 2021, OMB continued to face significant funding challenges with its appropriation just covering OMB's unavoidable cost increases, including annual pay adjustments, increases in agency retirement and benefit contributions, and significant terminal leave payouts. These factors, along with a lower -than-normal attrition, and other unexpected costs relating to FOIA and litigation, have resulted in OMB's inability to fill nearly all career positions vacated in FY 2020, FY 2021, and FY 2022 - which make up close to 10 percent of the already limited workforce. In FY 2021 and FY 2022, OMB was again forced to make significant adjustments in its operating plan, including eliminating funding for training and travel, and making even deeper cuts in IT contract funding. O MB is a personnel -intensive agency, and reductions in staffing level s directly impact the agency's ability to respond to and address new and existing responsibilities . OMB's FY 2023 request for funding to support additional OMB staffing above FY 2021 levels will ensure that OMB can perform its critical mission and provide effective leadership in implementing key Administration priorities . Specifically, OMB is seeking resources for: +$10,037,000 for Increased Staff . This request will allow OMB to hire additional career staff (59 FTEs , plus 6 FTE s associated with the intern program) for a total FTE level of 510 (516 including interns) to meet its significant and growing responsibilities . While most of these resources would go to restore OMB career FTE levels in core areas, this request will also allow OMB to fill new position s, such as institutionalizing and staffing the Made in America Office in OMB . + $918,000 for Awards. This request will allow OMB to fully implement important performance and developmental priorities to support rewarding, recognizing, and retaining exceptional talent across the workforce. + $520,000 for an Intern Program. This request will allow OMB to restore a paid intern program, which is key to establishing a strategic recruitment and outreach effort tostrengthen the pipeline of highly qualified , diverse, and historically underrepresentedExecutive Office of the President Office of Management and Budget OMB -8 candidates into OMB and to promote the Administration's priority to advance equity, remove barriers to equal opportunity, and attract top talent that reflects the nation . Other Funding Initiatives (+ $3,432,000) The FY 2023 request will also fund anticipated costs associated with increased FOIA workload and legal settlements costs and migration of the MAX Budget System. + $2,400,000 for the MAX Budget Systems. This increase supports the transition of MAX.gov capabilities to GSA, which will have Government- wide benefits but cost implications within OMB's own budget . This increase covers the cost of supporting the MAX technology platform completely within OMB's Budget . The cost of OMB's MAX technology platform has been partially offset over the past 12 years by efficiencies gainedthrough a shared infrastructure with the Budget Line of Business ( LoB) and MAX.gov. As MAX.gov transitions to GSA, O MB's budget needs to backfill costs that are currently supported, in part, by agency contributions toward MAX.gov Shared Services . This increase will also accommodate the need for OMB to support data collection andcollaboration activities that are not inc luded in the GSA product suite. + $1,032,000 for FOIA Contractor Support and Legal Settlements. Over the last several years OMB has experienced an increase in FOIA workload and legal settlement costs,which have historically been funded with resources available through personneldepartures .

Executive Office of the President Information Technology Oversight and Reform Fiscal Year 2023 Budget Executive Office of the President Information Technology Oversight and Reform ITOR -3 Background Since fiscal year (FY) 2012, funding for Information Technology Oversight and Reform (ITOR) activities has allowed the Federal Government to achieve better efficiency, effectiveness, and security across its information technology (IT) investments. Technology is a critical enabler of Federal agency missions and continues to serve as the underpinning for the evolution of service delivery for the public. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB), through the Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer (OFC IO), has used this fund to provide analytical oversight of the Government- wide $90 billion IT spend, and drive results in the adoption and advancement of modern information technology and services. ITOR also funds the United States Digital Service (USDS) t hat is leading t he charge on enhancing the Federal Government's most critical public - facing digital services through its design and technology expertise. These offices serve at the intersection of policy and implementation for the Executive Branch. On behalf of the OMB Director, OFCIO provides strategic direction and oversight for the development and management of IT and cybersecurity. OFCIO and USDS partner across the Executive Office of the President (EOP) and the Executive Branch to confirm that IT and cybersecurity policy objectives translate into cost- effective solutions and implementation. USDS and OFCIO work across OMB and with the General Services Administration's ( GSA) Technology Transformation Service to identify areas that inhibit effective techn ology implementation and to collaborate on developing policies and solutions to remove those barriers across the Government, fostering successful technology implementation. Overall ITOR funding allows OFCIO and USDS to identify innovative ways to solve business problems with technology, improve service delivery, invest in customer experience, reduce overall waste in IT spending, bolster cybersecurity defenses, and manage the F ederal Government's overall technology and cybersecurity risk. Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer Promoting a Digital Evolution Advancing Federal Technology Transformation In support of Administration priorities, OFCIO develops policy and guidelines for Federal agencies to adopt modern and automated technologies to make their operations more effective. These efforts include making appropriate use of cloud technology ,1 transitioning to Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6 ),2 and addressing the challenges in extending network service contracts via GSA 's Enterprise Infrastruc ture Solutions (EIS) initiative .3 As agencies continue to modernize their infrastructure, this will facilitate savings such as those achieved with using cloud services. 1 Refer to https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp -content/uploads/2019/06/Cloud- the President Information Technology Oversight and Reform ITOR -4 Improving Mission Delivery and Customer Experience through Digital Services In alignme nt with the 21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act (IDEA) and needs borne by the COVID -19 pandemic, OFCIO will accelerate efforts to deliver on the outcomes intended by Congress through the 21st Century IDEA. This includes issuing guidance to agenc ies as needed to remove barriers in digital service adoption and driving agency pilots to better utilize technology for improving user experience and enabling digital mission delivery. Further, OFCIO and other OMB offices are working to meet the charge of Executive Order (EO) 14058 on Transforming Federal Customer Experience and Service Delivery to Rebuild Trust in Government , which directs OMB to fulfill a centralized role in coordinating Government- wide customer experience management maturity and standard s of High Impact Service Providers, coordinating cross -agency life experience projects, and removing other common barriers to good service delivery, such as navigating interagency data sharing or systems integrations. Streamlining IT Portfolio Managemen t ITOR funding supports many aspects of Federal IT activities and investment oversight, with most policy- making, oversight, and analysis falling directly under OFCIO. OFCIO leads the major technology policy and oversight agenda focused on Federal IT modernization. OFCIO supports implementation for modernization of out -of-date and inefficient IT, securing Federal IT systems and the agency data within, and improving the governance of IT projects and services. OFCIO also leads integrated strategic planni ng, working to improve coordination between agency financial and budget data, and data from agency Chief Information Officers (CIOs) on IT budgets. OFCIO also oversees the enhancement and continuity of data made available to the public on Federal IT spendi ng. OFCIO uses ITOR funds to improve the transparency, consistency, granularity, and quality of Federal IT spending information while reducing over -emphasis on compliance. Helping agency CIOs understand, manage, and demonstrate value for the money spent on IT resources will increase the strategic value of IT and improve IT budgeting. Oversight of the Technology Modernization Fund ITOR funding will allow OFCIO to guide implementation in agencies that use the Technology Modernization Fund (TMF), a fund administered by GSA . 4 Through the American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act of 2021, Congress appropriated $1 billion of emergency funding for the TMF. The $1 billion investment in TMF through ARP represents a substantial down- payment on technology modernization and cybersecurity. Executing successfully and swiftly on the current TMF investment, with Congressional support, is important to maintaining the momentum in accelerating Federal IT modernization. The FY 2023 Budget proposes $300 million to continue the success of the TMF. OFCIO plays a central role in facilitating agencies' use of the TMF to modernize their IT systems and replace antiquated, expensive legacy systems. This includes harnessing the fund to enable the F ederal Government to better respond to cyberse curity incidents such as SolarWinds and to emergent crises such as COVID -19, while supporting economic recovery. 4 Pub. L. No. 115- 91, National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018, Title X, Subtitle G (\u00a7\u00a7 1076 through 1078). Executive Office of the President Information Technology Oversight and Reform ITOR -5 Making the IT Workforce Central to Mission Delivery The Federal G overnment continues to have a critical shortage of qualified IT and cybersecurity professionals to manage, protect, and modernize government networks, systems, and data. Additionally, improvements are needed to better enable the workforce to operate within a digital environment. Improvements in workforce technology enablers and skillsets are vital to responding to the crises faced by Federal agencies and the N ation. OFCIO will lead efforts to transform the way in which the Federal Government enables its workforce through technology, recruits and retains talent across the co untry, and develops programs to build the next generation of IT and cybersecurity professionals. Strengthening Federal Cybersecurity Oversight of Cybersecurity Funds Strengthening the cybersecurity of Federal networks, systems, and data continues to be one of the most important challenges face d across the N ation. Federal departments and agencies vary widely in size and function, but all share a responsibility to secure the information they possess. OFCIO oversees programs that enhance Government- wide cybersecurity and ensure consistent implementation of cybersecurity capabilities as outlined in the EO 14028 on Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity . OFCIO is a careful steward of the Federal Government's cybersecurity spending. Improving Incident Respons e and Addressing Gaps in Supply Chain Risk Management In the wake of the SolarWinds cyber incident and other notable compromises, ITOR funding enables OFCIO to work with its interagency partners to tackle some of the most pressing cybersecurity issues facing Federal networks and information. This includes coordinating Federal responses to major incidents, working closely with the Office of the National Cyber Director (ONCD) , the National Security Council (NSC), the Department of Homeland (DHS) Cybersecurit y and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Department of Defense (DoD), and other partners, developing methods to better quantify risk to Federal agencies, integrating threat intelligence into agency risk management, and leading efforts to manage the Information and Communication s Technology (ICT) supply chain through the Federal Acquisition Security Council (FASC), as established by 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 1322. Maturing Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM) and Public Identity Management Digital identity is foundational to the secure delivery of services in support of agency missions. OFCIO is continuing its work enhancing secure digital identity management at agencies, achieving the goals of Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12, and improving how the Federal Government conducts identity proofing for public -facing services. Beginning in FY 2020 and through FY 2022, OFCIO worked with GSA and the United States Postal Service (USPS) to pilot approaches to identity proofing , allowing Federal agencies to use the post office as the front door of the G overnment. In FY 2023, OFCIO will continue these efforts and will drive additional efforts to improve digital identity security including establishing privacy -enhanced services to reduce the over- reliance on Social Security Numbers (SSNs), collaborating with the National Institute of Executive Office of the President Information Technology Oversight and Reform ITOR -6 Standards and Technology to refine ICAM standards and technical specifications, and enhancing identity management across Federal cloud services. Shifting the Federal Gove rnment Towards Zero Trust Security In response to the dynamic cybersecurity threats faced by the F ederal Government, OFCIO is partnering with the CIO Council to accelerate the G overnment's shift towards Zero Trust security. The Zero Trust concept is rooted in three core principles: ( a) verify every user, (b) validate every device, and ( c) limit access intelligently. The adoption of this security model would have proven effective in combatting the cyberattacks faced by agencies such as those executed through the compromise of SolarWinds software. OFCIO will continue efforts to align strategies, policy, and resources in support of this foundational shift in cybersecurity management. The Administration released M -22-09 on Moving the U.S. Government Toward Zero Trust Cybersecurity Principles . This memorandum established a Federal Zero Trust architecture strategy that requires agencies to meet specific cybersecurity standards and objectives by the end of FY 2024 in order to reinforce the Government's defenses against increasingly sophisticated and persistent threat campaigns. United States Digital Service USDS strategically uses design and technology to deliver better government services to the American people. USDS deploys small, responsive teams of engineers, service designers, product managers, and procurement experts to work with and support civil servants on key critical projects . These multi- disciplinary teams bring best practices and new approaches to program implementation, customer experience, service modernization, and crisis response. USDS is focused on improving how the American people interact with their Government and transforming that experience, which also leads to stronger trust in Government. USDS also plays a leadership role in an ecosystem of entities across Government that focus on improving service delivery. USDS operates on a \"tour of duty\" model where employees are hired for limited periods within the Federal Government. This model creates a steady influx of up- to-date perspectives on technology and service delivery to the Government. While many of the candidates applying to USDS come from positions with significantly higher salaries and generous private sector benefits, they are drawn by USDS' ability to positively impact the lives of millions of Americans. As USDS has grown and evolved over time, the need for in- agency talent has continued to manifest itself as a key success factor for critical work, and an essential need for longer -term stability and success of programs. As a result, USDS has evolved to supporting wider efforts to increase the number of technologists serving in roles across the Government. This includes working directly with agencies on hiring initiatives, as well as working with agencies where appropriate to support longer- term place ments for qualified USDSers. While many people who join USDS from the private sector initially come for 2 -year terms, an increasing number are joining the Government on an ongoing basis after their tenure at USDS. Several of these employees have taken on challenging CIO and Chief Technology Officer ( CTO ) roles across G overnment to lead Executive Office of the President Information Technology Oversight and Reform ITOR -7 organizations into the future, focusing on how technology and design can improve service delivery for both the Federal workforce and millions of Americans. USDS Engagements Too often, outdated tools, systems, and practices make interacting with the Federal Government cumbersome and frustrating. COVID -19 laid bare and exacerbated the Government's technology and service delivery challenges in a time of immediate need. Critical response and relief programs for families and businesses have had to rely on outdated software and infrastructure that were not designed to scale or adapt to crisis. Unfortunately, millions of Americans suffered the consequences. Families were stuck searching complicated and disparate vaccination websites . Unemployed workers have needed to work through antiquated unemployment insurance systems that crash under the volume of claims. Families with children struggling to cover basic food needs have had to navigate complicated program applications or were simply unaware of what programs they qualify for. Federal agencies and States have struggled with digital services challenges at a time when technical infrastructure and online access underpin the lifelines Americans have to Government relief. Recognizing these challenges and the critical need for stronger digital capabilities across Government , the Administration requested, and Congress appropriated, $200 million through ARP for USDS. This has allowed USDS to quickly address these technology needs , to ensure access and equity are integrated into products and processes, and to help agencies modernize their systems for long- term performance and stability. USDS' portfolio is dyna mic since it i s called to lead and support many of the Administration's most important and complex problems affecting Government services to the American public. The k ey to USDS ' success is its ability to execute high -impact projects in a technically knowledgeable, user -centered way focused on outcomes. USDS prioritize s improving Government services that have the greatest impact on the needs of the American public . Since the pandemic, a significant portion of USDS has been devoted to assisting agencies with their relief and recovery efforts. Some of USDS' most impactful recent projects include the following: CovidTests.gov: In just about three weeks, USDS partnered with the USPS to scope, build, and test a site where every household in America could order free COVID-19 tests. The results are overwhelmingly positive: 60 million people successfully ordered tests through the website by late January 2022. Report Stream: USDS partner ed with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to launch a reporting tool that has processed and routed over 5 million C OVID -19 test results as of December 2021, providing timely data to S tate, Tribal, local, and territorial health departments , as well as Federal tracking systems. C hild Tax Credit: USDS partnered with the Treasury Department in late 2021 to launch www.childtaxcredit.gov , a site to help families understand and claim their Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit. Beginning in November 2021, a USDS team created a protot ype by mid -December and launched the site in January 2022. Executive Office of the President Information Technology Oversight and Reform ITOR -8 Health & Benefits Mobile App: USDS partnered with the Department of Veterans Affairs ' Chief Technology Officer to design a mobile app with capabilities that include disability rating, claim status, letters from Veterans Affairs, secure messaging to health care teams, and access to health appointments for veterans. The app has been well - received b y the intended audience with more than 210,000 downloads (and counting) and overwhelmingly positive reviews by users. W eb Services Modernization: USDS is working with the Social Security Administration (SSA) to reimagine how SSA interacts with the public through their website. USDS has created a guided experience and transformed 78,000 pages of content into a task- based site. A fghanistan Refugee Resettlement : USDS is working with partners at the Departments of State and Homeland Security to build capacity in refugee resettlement and other humanitarian programs to support Afghans and bolster the Administration's broader refugee resettlement goals. USDS is also improving the way the G overnment does business. USDS is working to improve Government- wide practices, specifically around Federal hiring and technology procurement. USDS continues to focus on enhancing G overnment -wide hiring through a partnership with the U.S. Office of Personnel Management ( OPM ) on the Subject Matter Expert Qualification Assessment program, smeqa.usds.gov . The team released a hiring assessment and selection outcomes dashboard to provide agencies with more information on assessment practices that lead to job selectio n. The capabilities and practices develop ed by human resource specialists and subject matter experts underpin the interconnectedness of agency capacity and technology modernization. Within the last year, USDS has jointly curated Government- wide assessments that have filled critical, specialized vacancies across the Government. Current Federal procurement practices largely do not provide the flexibility required to buy and deliver modern digital services. T he pace of technological change continues to accelerate, while citizen demand for Federal digital services increases. The Office of Federal Procurement Policy and USDS developed a training program to enhance digital services acquisition expertise across agencies , the Digital IT Acquisition Program (DITAP), techfarhub.cio.gov/initiatives/ditap . Graduates of the training program receive the Federal Acquisition Certification in Contracting Core -Plus Specialization in Digital Services (FAC -C-DS). USDS continues advocating for the program and helping agenc ies navigate the purchasing and administration of digital service products and services. USDS Funding USDS is not requesting funding through the FY 2023 President's Budget as the $200 million provided through the ARP sufficiently funds USDS' immediate needs to rapidly respond to technology emergencies and modernize systems for long -term stability. With the ARP funding, USDS plans to increase personnel to 250 FTEs in FY 2023 and spend over 80% of its funding on Executive Office of the President Information Technology Oversight and Reform ITOR -9 personnel expenses. USDS uses a Schedule A hiring authority whereby staff are hired to 2- year term appointments, which allows USDS to navigate staffing and budget in a responsible manner. The ARP supplemental funding allows USDS to support increasingly strategic engagements across Government and results in a more efficient USDS operating model, lightening the administrative burden of reimbursable agreements and centralizing tools and capabilities across the Government to create momentum, leverage, and longevity for digital services. While USDS will continue to enter into some reimbursable agreements in FY 2023 for longer term work , USDS will no longer be reliant upon reimbursable funding that could inadvertently prioritize agencies with available funding over the most critical and high- priority pro jects to work on across Government , including critical interagency work that would otherwise be impossible . The ability to directly fund USDS personnel also allows USDS to respond to emergent threats and address interdependent delivery needs throughout the G overnment in a way that agency -specific funding could not accommodate. Most importantly, improving Government services direct ly impact s the American people by delivering timely, dignified services when most needed. USDS will not only develop user -centered systems that have immediate benefits , but will also have long lasting uses for improving overall government services. FY 2023 Request Overview For fiscal year (FY) 202 3, the estimated funding requirement for ITOR is $13,700,000, supporting a full -time equivalent (FTE) level of 53 in the Office of the Federal CIO. This reflects an increase of $1,200,000 from the FY 2022 annualized continuing resolution level of $12,500,000. In FY 2021, U SDS was appropriated $200 million through the ARP and all operations were realigned to this funding stream. ARP funding will sufficiently fund USDS operations for FY 2023.

Executive Office of the President Office of the United States Trade Representative Fiscal Year 2023 Budget Executive Office of the President Office of the United States Trade Representative USTR -3 Mission Statement and Background The United States Trade Representative (USTR) is responsible for developing and coordinating America's trade policy, leading trade negotiations with other nations, and enforcing compliance with our trade agreements and U.S. trade laws. USTR also coordinat es with other Federal agencies in developing trade policy and advising the President on trade matters. \"USTR\" refers both to the office and its head, the U.S. Trade Representative, who is a member of the President's cabinet. USTR is the principal trade ad visor and negotiator for the President. USTR operates in three locations: Washington, DC, Geneva, Switzerland, and Beijing, China. USTR also has a representative in Brussels serving as the USTR delegate to the European Commission's Directorate- General fo r Trade. USTR provides trade policy leadership and negotiating expertise in its major areas of responsibility. Among these are the following: industrial, textile, agricultural, and services trade policy; bilateral, regional, and multilateral trade and investment issues; trade -related intellectual property protection, labor and environmental issues; all matters within the World Trade Organization ( WTO ), and direct investment matters dealt with by international institutions such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). USTR is organized to accommodate sectoral , regional, and functional policy perspectives, which are integrated into the decision- making process and coordinated externally with the Congress, other government agencies, the private sector, and foreign entities. Overview For fiscal year (FY) 20 23, the estimated funding requirement for USTR is $76,540,000, supporting a full -time equivalent (FTE) level of 2 83. This request is $6,540,000 (9.3%) above the FY 2022 annualized continuing resolution level of $70,000,000 and represents an increase of 9 FTEs . The funding for this request is a combination of $61,54 0,000 from the general fund and $15,000,000 transferred from the Trade Enforcement Trust Fund. We are requesting this increase to provide for: Unavoidable Costs (+$2,625,000) +$919,000 for FY 2022 pay adjustments and an increase in the cost of the Federal Employee Retirement System. +$1,706,000 for FY 2023 pay adjustments.

Additional detailed information regarding the USTR 's budget requirements is contained in a separate Congressional Budget Submission document. USTR's appropriation must enable USTR to harness U.S. trade relationships to help the Administration revitalize the economy. Trade is a critical pillar of our ability to build back better and carry out our foreign policy for the middle c lass. President Biden's approach to trade includes investing in American workers to make them more competitive, ensuring that labor and environmental interests are represented in new trade negotiations, and rebuilding frayed trade and security relationships with allies. U.S. workers are at the center of the Administration's trade policy that will strive to get results for American families. T hree main trade concerns for President Biden are addressing China 's unfair trade practices, ensuring the U.S.- Mexico -Canada Agreement (USMCA) lives up to its promising potential, and launching an affirmative economic partnership for the Indo- Pacific region . The power of our trade relationships will be employed to help communities lift themselves out of the current crisis. Trade is a means to create more hope and opportunity for people. It only succeeds when the humanity and dignity of every American -- and of all people -- lie at the heart of the President's approach to trade policy. Effective trade policy requires a keen understan ding of the threats of climate change to trade as well as the need to address the climate crisis with urgency. New trade negotiations will be used to boost partners' climate commitments. Close working relationships with labor interests will guide the app roach to trade enforcement and leveling the playing field for American workers. The President's trade agenda will be strategic in how we trade and that makes us all stronger. As such, the Administration will focus on trade agreements that benefit all Ame ricans, enforcing the nation's trade laws to ensure its trading partners play by the rules, and updating the World Trade Executive Office of the President Office of the United States Trade Representative USTR -5 Organization to work for all nations. The United States will negotiate with allies to set global trading rules to counter China's grow ing influence of unfair trading practices, instead of having China and others dictating outcomes. Key issues to address include overcapacity, subsidization, China's state -led industrial planning and targeting of key sectors, disciplines on China's state - owned enterprises, and cyber theft. \"Whether it is contending with the challenges of China or making sure the USMCA lives up to its promising potential, we will only succeed if we work together. That means the administration working with Congress; Democra ts and Republicans working together; labor with capital; entrepreneurs with the keepers and defenders of our natural resources. Stakeholders across the entire spectrum of the U.S. economy...the United States working with its allies.\" 1 USMCA was facilitated by robust stakeholder engagement in partnership with the business, labor , and civil society communities. The challenge is to ensure a continual focus on this agreement, to nurture what is working and to correct course when parties alter and stray from their commitments. The Administration will continue to aggressively enforce U.S. trade laws to protect the interests of American businesses and workers. USTR will take strong actions to ensure our trading partners ' compliance with the terms of our trade agreements, including the WTO agreements. USTR will be strategic in how it addresses the harms from China's unfair trade practices. USTR continues to monitor China's compliance with the Phase One Agreement's provi sions and will investigate complaints from American businesses, farmers, and others about China's conduct. Additionally, USTR recently announced its determination to reinstate certain previously granted and extended product exclusions in the China Section 301 investigation. USTR will keep open the option of further tariff exclusions processes if warranted. Likewise, the USMCA contains a detailed process for enforcing commitments, and USTR will zealously pursue any violations of the agreement. USTR has established working groups focused in particular on potential violations of the labor and environmental provisions of USMCA and will work closely with other agencies to ensure that any potential noncompliance is investigated and, where necessary, acted up on. As necessary, USTR will pursue formal challenges to acts, policies, or practices of foreign governments that are inconsistent with WTO rules under the dispute settlement system of the WTO and will vigorously defend U.S. actions when challenged by fore ign governments. USTR is closely monitoring legislative developments in countries related to \"digital services taxes.\" The United States is engaged in discussions at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to modernize and rationalize taxation of multinational entities in a way that is fair to all countries, their consumers, and their businesses. However, some nations have undermined those efforts by imposing unilateral digital services taxes, which often are little more than thinly disguised attacks on successful U.S. technology companies. The United States will 1 Katherine Tai, 2021 NFTC Foundation Virtual Conference and Awards Ceremony, January 12, 2021. Executive Office of the President Office of the United States Trade Representative USTR -6 continue to enforce its trade laws to prevent the implementation of unfair and discriminatory taxes on U.S. companies. The United States will lead the effort on WTO refo rm. In addition to addressing the Appellate Body, seeking a new fisheries agreement, pursuing a digital commerce agreement, enforcing notifications obligations, and seeking reform of \"special and differential treatment\" for \"developing\" countries, the Adm inistration will advocate for other changes at the WTO that will have the WTO working for its Members. The Biden Administration is fully committed to positive, constructive, and active engagement with all Members to find paths forward to achieve necessary reform of the WTO. Critical to this reform effort is the new Director General. The pandemic recovery and negotiations on curbing harmful fisheries subsidies are two areas in which the U.S. would like to see movement. USTR will seek meaningful and high ambition outcomes for the upcoming ministerial, which is expected to be held in June this year . There is no topic more important than recovery from COVID -19. The Biden Administration will engage with WTO Members on how the WTO can promote recovery from t he COVID -19 crisis, in conjunction with other multilateral initiatives to amplify the international public health and humanitarian response. For the fisheries negotiations, the U.S. will look to disciplining the harmful subsidies that counteract any progr ess in achieving sustainable fisheries. The negotiations must produce a meaningful and effective agreement that will constrain the largest subsidizers and improve the status quo. The Administration will seek to reform the WTO to equip the institution to address pressing challenges confronting all nations, including global overcapacity in multiple industries that unfairly cost workers their jobs. In summary, President Biden is steadfast in changing the way we trade, and pursuing trade policies that suppor t and benefit American workers, combat the threat of climate change, fuel American innovation, and increas e America's competitiveness.

Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Executive Office of the President Council on Environmental Quality Fiscal Year 2023 Budget Executive Office of the President Council on Environmental Quality CEQ -3 Mission Statement and Background The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) was established by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4321, 4342). charges CEQ with a number of responsibilities, including: Developing and recommending to the President national policies to foster and promote the improvement of environmental quality to meet the conservation, social, economic, health, and other requirements and goals of the Nation; Identifying and assessing trends in environmental quality and recommending appropriate response strategies; Overseeing Federal agency implementation of the requirements of NEPA; and Conducting environmental investigations, studies, surveys, research, and analyses with respect to matters of policy and legislation as requested by the President. CEQ has numerous other statutory responsibilities under a number of Federal laws, including: the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7609; the Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 4751; the Department of Energy Organization Act of 1997, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7265; the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1536; the Global Change Research Act of 1990, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2932; the Marine Mammal Protection Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1401- 1403; the National Climate Program Act of 1978, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2904; the National Environmental Education Act, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5506- 5508; the Nuclear \u00a7\u00a7 10132, 10134, and 10193; the Toxic Substances Control Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2603(e)(2)(A)(iii); the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act, 23 U.S.C. \u00a7 139; the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5189g; and the Fixing \u00a7\u00a7 4370m -1, 4370m -2, and 4370m - 4. In addition, CEQ has duties and responsibilities under a number of executive orders and presidential memoranda, including: Executive Order 13990, \"Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis \" and Executive Order 14008, \"Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad\". The Chair of CEQ, a Senate- confirmed Presidential appointee, serves as Director of the Office of Environmental Quality (OEQ), established by the Environmental Quality Improveme nt Act (EQIA), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4371- 4375. The Office provides the professional and administrative staff support for CEQ to help meet its statutory responsibilities. For example, CEQ is to assist in coordinating environmental programs among the Federal agenc ies in the Executive Branch, developing environmental quality criteria and standards, and review ing the adequacy of existing systems for monitoring and predicting environmental change. CEQ is also responsible for coordinating the federal government's effor ts to address environmental injustice, including by leading the White House Environmental Justice Interagency Council and working to ensure that communities that are marginalized , underserved, and overburdened by pollution have greater input on federal pol icies and decisions. Finally, CEQ is responsible for ensuring that Federal agencies meet their obligations under NEPA. NEPA established the Federal Government's policy to \"create and maintain conditions under Executive Office of the President Council on Environmental Quality CEQ -4 which man and nature can exist in productive harmony, and fulfill the social, economic, and other requirements of present and future generations of Americans\" (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4331). Pursuant to NEPA, the Federal Government, in consultation with Tribal nations and in cooperation with State and local go vernments, and other concerned public and private organizations, must consider the effects of its actions on the quality of the human environment before making decisions. CEQ's coordinating function helps to avoid redundancy and conflict while fostering efficiency and policy innovation. CEQ's location within the Executive Office of the President places CEQ in an ideal position to chair interagency groups, balance agency positions, and encourage Government -wide and intergovernmental cooperation. Overview For fiscal year (FY) 2023, the estimated funding requirement for CEQ is $4,360,000, supporting a full-time equivalent (FTE) level of 22. This request is $860,000 (24.6%) above the FY 2022 annualized continuing resolution level and represents an increase of 5 FTEs . We are requesting this increase to provide for: Unavoidable Cost s (+$226,000) +$66,000 for FY 2022 pay adjustments and an increase in the cost of the Federal Employee Retirement System. +$160,000 for FY 2023 pay adjustments . Investing in CEQ 's Workforce (+ $634,000) +$634,000 for 5 FTEs to support three work requirements: Environmental Justice, Climate Change , and Clean Energy and Infrastructure Permitting. Without these additional staff, CEQ will not be able to fulfill the A dministration's commitment to strengthening the Federal government's efforts to address environmental injustice and toxic pollution, effectively coordinate strategies to improve the resilience of communities and natural resources to climate change, and improve the efficiency and coordination of environmental reviews that will be necessary to deploy clean energy and infrastructure investments through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (P.L. 117 -58).

Government -Wide Councils and Federal Government Priority Goals Executive Office of the President Government -Wide Councils and Federal Government Priority Goals Fiscal Year 2023 Budget Governm ent-Wide Councils GWC -3 Background Interagency groups, such as Government -Wide Councils, provide critical leadership and accountability in generating Government -Wide collaboration and innovation. Council activities generate cross -agency focus and enterprise -level performance improvements. This document highlights Council- led activities and initiatives that have played a fundamental role in improving government operations. The Fiscal Year (FY) 2023 Budget includes a Government -Wide general provision under Title VII to authorize certain interagency groups \u2014such as the President 's Management Council (PMC), the Chief Acquisition Officers Council (CAOC), the Chief Financial Officers Council (CFOC), the Chief Human Capital Officers Council (CHCOC), the Chief Infor mation Officers Council (CIOC), and the Perform ance Improvement Council (PIC) \u2014to be reimbursed by funds transferred by agencies to the \" Government -Wide Policy \" account under General Services Admi nistration (GSA) with the approval from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Consistent with previously enacted appropriations sinc e FY 2011, the amount of FY 2023 transfer authority requested totals $17 million for Government -Wide in novations, initiatives , and activities. Consistent with appropriations enacted since FY 2016, the amount of FY 2023 transfer authority requested totals $15 million for improving coordination, reducing duplication, and other activities related to the Federal Government Priority Goals (commonly referred to as Cross -Agency Priority Goals, or CAP Goals). Improved Coordination across Councils Since the FY 2019 Budget , there has been a strategic shift to better coordinate projects across Councils. Before that point, funding for Councils had focused on providing resources for Council - specific projects, with only a few initiatives having a cross -council focus. In some cases, this led to a lack of coordination across projects with similar objectives, as well as pr ojects led by individual Councils that did not fully anticipate the needs of other Councils. The FY 2023 Budget continues the approach first introduced in the FY 2019 Budget . In FY 2023, in addition to funding Council -specific projects, we will emphasize identifying cross -council projects that will meet the needs of multiple functional communities and optimize a government- wide return on investment. Specifically, the requested funding supports co- investment in c ross- council projects that benefit one or more functional areas (e.g., workforce , data man agement). Through this approach, Council meetings and cross -functional project teams will facilitate confronting similar challenges and jointly problem -solving rather than individually pursuing redundant solutions. Co-investment enables multiple organizations to share the costs of developing capacities and information systems they all need, reducing per-unit costs for all participants. This shift to a c ross-council focus demand s an appropriate decision -making process to support effective management and oversight of projects and deliverables. To meet this demand, we have established an investment review process . When allocating funds, t he process considers projects that: Benefit the larger Federal government and not a single organization Governm ent-Wide Councils GWC -4 Have no \u2014or limited \u2014alternative source s of funding that are dedicated to the effort because no single agency or organizati on is accountable for the work Impact the creation, streamlining , or implem entation of policy Have clearly identified outcomes Impact more than one C ouncil 's community and/or President 's Management Agenda priorities The remainder of this section provides the budgetary justification for each interagency Council pursuant to language in Senate Report 111- 43, which directed OMB to include this justification in the annual budget request for the Executive Office of the Preside nt (EOP) beginning in FY 2011. With the addition of transfer authority for Federal Government Priority Goals in FY 2016, this section also provides budgetary justification for the development and implementation of goals to be funded by the request. Appropriations Language \u2014Title VII Government -Wide General Provisions (Transfer of Funds ) Sec. 717. Notwithstanding 31 U.S.C. 1346 and section 708 of this Act, the head of each Executive department and agency is hereby authorized to transfer to or reimburse \"General Services Administration, Government -wide Policy\" with the approval of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, funds made available for the current fiscal year by this or any other Act, including rebates from charge card and other contracts: Provided , That these funds shall be administered by the Administrator of General Services to support Government -wide and other multi- agency financial, information technology, procurement, and other management innovations, initiatives, and activities, including imp roving coordination and reducing duplication, as approved by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, in consultation with the appropriate interagency and multiagency groups designated by the Director (including the President's Management Counc il for overall management improvement initiatives, the Chief Financial Officers Council for financial management initiatives, the Chief Information Officers Council for information technology initiatives, the Chief Human Capital Officers Council for human capital initiatives, the Chief Acquisition Officers Council for procurement initiatives, and the Performance Improvement Council for performance improvement initiatives): Provided further , That the total funds transferred or reimbursed shall not exceed $15,000,000 to improve coordination, reduce duplication, and for other activities related to Federal Government Priority Goals established by 31 U.S.C. 1120, and not to exceed $17,000,000 for Government -Wide innovations, initiatives, and activities: Provided further , That the funds transferred to or for reimbursement of \"General Services Administration, Government -wide Policy\" during fiscal year 2023 shall remain available for obligation through September 30, 2024: Provided further , That such transfers or reimbursements may only be made after 15 days following notification of the Committees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the Senate by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget . Governm ent-Wide Councils GWC -5 Achievements in FY 2021 Each Government -Wide management Council achieved noteworthy and high- impact outcomes during FY 2021, as did groups of Councils working together on shared goals. Chief Acquisition Officers Council (CAOC). The CAOC has continued to focus on implementing category management, making improvements in transparency, modernizing the data and information availability for the suspension and debarment process, and helping agencies develop smarter negotiation strategies. The CAOC invested in managing categories of comm on spend, reducing contract duplication, and building an analytic tool based on transaction data that will help agencies make smarter buying decisions and guide solution owners in the development of more competitive and streamlined acquisition solutions. T o date, category management has provided cost avoidance of nearly $58 billion, and agencies now have near real time access to metrics to help them implement these better buying practices. Consistent with the Administration 's focus on creating a more innovative, efficient, and effective acquisition system and reducing burden, the CAOC also continued to invest in tools to help agencies be more transparent in their spending, such as maintaining a platform where industry and the public can provide ideas on redu cing reporting burden, to piloting a prototype tool that can reduce the burden on companies reporting information under Federal contracts. The CAOC funded a pilot to streamline the suspension and debarment lead agency coordination process so agencies can share important information about fraud, waste, and abuse from non-responsible contractors. Finally, the CAOC recognized acquisition professionals who contribute to outstanding improvements in acquisition in the areas of program management, innovation, category management, and small business procurement through the annual CAOC Acquisition Excellence awards. Chief Financial Officers Council (CFOC). During FY 2021, the Council 's focal areas included supporting the Administration transition, supporting pandem ic-related financial management initiatives, carrying forward and expanding workforce modernization initiatives, serving as a communication and coordination conduit for our community and external stakeholders, and sharing best practice information as widel y as possible. The Council was also engaged in a strategic review of its governance, operating processes, and long- term goals. A key focus of the Council was the Workforce Modernization initiative led by an Executive Steering Committee under the CFO Council 's oversight. It has had successes in a number of areas, including: Finalizing the 10 -year workforce modernization strategy Implementing two upskilling bootcamps for senior executives as pilot efforts Developing and executing a teaming arrangement with the Department of Veterans Affairs to implement data analytics upskilling cohorts for the Financial Management community Developing and executing a teaming arrangement with the Office of Personnel Management to provide expanded career development guidance to our workforce Initial implementation of an innovative career planning/training tool that will provide guidance for our employees and establish a public/private marketplace for delivering training content Governm ent-Wide Councils gover nment -wide meetings, communications channels, websites, working groups, and stakeholder engagements \u2014championed and supported many key initiatives such as the American Rescue Plan Act, the Unique Entity Identifier implementation effort, improvements in audit and reporting, successfully concluding the final round of annual audits associated with the DATA Act, improving payment integrity across the government, maintaining close collaboration with the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee, and supporting t he development of the President 's Management Agenda. Chief Information Officers Council (CIOC). During FY 2021, the CIOC and its targeted subcommittees focused on furthering the Administration 's goals of IT modernization, developing a workforce of the fut ure, driving value in Federal IT investments, and delivering world- class digital services. Through the subcommittees, OMB has been working with interagency teams to strengthen IT policy, close critical skills gaps in the Federal workforce, and accelerate modernization of legacy infrastructure. Examples of major efforts and accomplishments include the following: The CIOC sponsors the Federal Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) Council as the primary body for interagency CISO collaboration and communication. The CISO Council addressed many emerging security risks by collaborating across agencies to respond sw iftly against adversaries. The CIOC sponsored the fourth annual Women in Federal IT and Cybersecurity Campaign, a series of videos, online webinars and discussions celebrating the success of women in Federal IT and cybersecurity, celebrating women in the Federal IT and cyber workforce, and discussing ways to continue encouraging women to join the Federal IT workforce. The Workforce Committee sponsored the Data Science Training program, partnering with the Census Bureau and the General Services Administrat ion. The effort focused on providing targeted training for current Federal professionals to upskill them with Data Science skills and the ability to apply those skills to existing challenges within the Federal government. The CIOC 's Innovation Committee s ponsored work with the Artificial Intelligence Community of practice and developed recommendations and guidance related to the recent Executive Order on Promoting the use of Trustworthy AI in the Federal Government. The group also developed an alpha Algori thmic Impact Assessment tool to help agencies gauge risk when using AI. The CIOC 's Services, Solutions, and Infrastructure (SSI) Committee developed the CIO Handbook, which served as a transition guide for incoming CIOs and their staff and has proved to be a valuable tool during the change in Administration. The SSI committee and CISO Council, in coordination with NIST, led efforts to further the Federal Government's understanding and path towards adopting a Zero Trust mindset for architecture deployments. The CIOC also sponsored an Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) Task Force to assist and coordinate agency activities in the transition to IPv6. In FY 2020/21, this Task Force provided technical analysis and support toward the acceleration of the IPv6 trans ition and acted as a liaison body between federal agencies and commercial vendors. The group is now working on a test bed in coordination with NIST and continues to provide support to agencies in collaboration with the Cloud & Infrastructure Community of P ractice. Governm ent-Wide Councils GWC -7 The CIOC sponsored an Interagency Collaboration Pilot and subsequently stood up a program management office (PMO) that is making possible federal -wide cross -agency collaboration capabilities. The ability to meet and conference virtually, send chat messages, share large files, view external calendars, and collaborate on documents is critical to operations in a modern federal government and instrumental in a telework- dominant world. The PMO is facilitating technical, policy, cybersecurity and governa nce that is resulting in interagency collaboration based on need, risk, and commonality of technology. The CIO Council sponsored a project to gather insight from implementers, executives, and potential users of Capital Planning and Investment Control (CPIC ) to understand stakeholder goals and use cases for an improved approach to IT portfolio management (ITPfM). As a result, OMB and the CIOC are executing steps to achieve an improved approach to facilitate better management of the full lifecycle of an agenc y's IT portfolio. Chief Human Capital Officers Council (CHCOC). During FY 2021, the Chief Human Capital Officers Council functions were restored to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The restoration of functions to OPM elevated the voices of CHCOs and strengthened the connection between government -wide human capital strategy and policy development, and agency -level human capital management. The CHCO Council continues to be an important conduit for sharing information across the federal human c apital community and providing valuable input into key guidance and resources issued. Examples of major efforts and accomplishments in FY 2021 include the following: The CHCO Council reinstituted monthly Council meetings and also held more than a dozen additional meetings for the CHCO community on executive orders, policy guidance, and other emerging issues. CHCOs also provided feedback directly to OPM in smaller sessions to inform policy development on a number of issues. The CHCO Council established thre e working groups that met regularly and were actively engaged on issues around reentry and the future of work, advancing the Biden- Harris Administration priorities around diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility, and strengthening CHCO Council opera tions. In partnership with CHCOs, Council staff drafted a new CHCO Council charter and framework for an Executive Steering Committee that were issued in Q1 of FY 2022. This was the first time the charter had been updated since the Council was created, and the concept of an Executive Steering Committee was envisioned to elevate the CHCO voice and advise the Council leadership on the Council's strategic direction and priorities and foster a strong relationship between the Council and OPM. Council staff impro ved communication across the Council with revamped weekly communication with CHCOs and developed a new CHCO Council website to launch in FY 2022. Staff also developed a new CHCO annual survey in FY 2021, which was launched in Q1 of FY 2022 to provide important customer feedback to OPM and to support continuous improvement of the CHCO Council. In addition, Council staff and CHCO members strengthened relationships with other cross - agency councils and participated in the first Workforce Summit hosted by GSA. Performance Improvement Council (PIC). In FY 2021, the PIC designed and facilitated a variety of performance improvement engagements and delivered useful tools to advance progress by many Governm ent-Wide Councils GWC -8 of the largest federal agencies toward their goals. The PIC provided direct support to White House leadership, OMB, and Federal agencies by fostering collaboration, disseminating best practices, building performance capabilities, and providing analytical and performance management and improvement expertise. The PIC hosted two series of virtual workshops. During the PIC 's Fall Workshop series, training was offered on risk management, performance management and data visualization. The PIC 's Spring Workshop series included sessions on communications, the performance fr amework, enterprise management, data analytics, and performance measures. In FY 2021, the PIC supported the Strategic Planning Working Group. The PIC also hosted an Agency Priority Goal (APG) Summit in September 2021, to support agencies as they develop and refine their APG action plans. The PIC continued to manage Performance.gov, implementing several new designs to showcase the new PMA. President 's Management Council (PMC). During FY 2021, the PMC continued to play a leadership role in advancing a broad set of federal management priorities through cross -agency coordination of mission delivery objectives and strong oversight of mission- support functions. The PMC was particularly instrumental in advising OMB in the overall design of the President' s Management Agenda. Cross- Council Collaboration. To accelerate progress on shared services in the federal arena, the CAOC, CFOC, CHCOC, and CIOC have been instrumental in collaborating with OMB, the Shared Services Governance Board, and the Office of Shared Soluti ons and Performance Improvement in establishing and executing the priorities of OMB Memorandum M -19-16, Centralized Mission Support Capabilities for the Federal Government . The cross -council partnership has improved the effectiveness of the initiative by e nsuring that stakeholders are informed, aligned, and acting in concert around a common objective. Additionally, the Office of Shared Solutions and Performance Improvement facilitated a Workforce Summit in Fall 2021. This event convened leadership of all of the councils in order to hear from each other regarding ongoing workforce initiatives with the goal of improving collaboration and scaling of workforce pilot projects. FY 2023 Budget Estimates The Administration proposes continuation of this transfer authority in the FY 2023 Budget. This section provides the topline funding level for Council s in FY 2023 and a description of efforts each council plans to engage in once allocations have been made. In FY 2023, we will maintain the total amount in collections for Councils at $17 million, which is the amount capped in statute and the same amount collected in FY 2022. In addition to being guided by the priorities within each of their respective functions, the Councils will also identify opportunities to jointly address shared management priorities in FY 2023 as informed by the President 's Management Agenda. A coordinated approach to these multidisciplinary issues ensures that management changes are designed and implemented more comprehensively, efficiently, and with broader buy -in from agency leadership . In recognition of the Councils ' increased focus on cross -functional issues, the cost of several such initiatives \u2014including workforce and data management initiatives \u2014will be fully allocated to Cross -Cutting Council Initiatives rather than divided among the other Councils. Specific allocations will be made to Councils following Congressional notification.

Funds will also enable the Council to continue to improve communications with Council members, including maintenance of the CHCO Council website. The Council will also continue to administer an annual CHCO survey and will do periodic pulse surveys to get real- time feedback to strengthen the Council. B uilding and Supporting a World- Class Federal Workforce: The CHCO Council will play a critical role in advancing the Administration 's priorities, particularly as they relate to ensuring safety in the workplace during COVID -19, advancing racial equity, and preparing the civil service for the future of work. In addition, the Council will help drive implementation of the Workforce Priority of the Presidents Management Agenda and will support OPM in the implementation of the agency' s strategic plan. Government -Wide Councils Chief Information Officers Council (CIOC) GWC -13 The CIOC serves as the principal interagency forum for improving practices in the design, modernization, use, sharing, and performance of Government agency information resources. The CIOC 's role includes developing recommendations for information technology management policies, procedures, and standards; identifying opportunities to share information resources; and assessing and addressing the needs of the Federal Government 's information technology (IT) workforce. The CIOC compr ises Chief Information Officers (CIOs) and their deputies from the major Federal executive departments and agencies. The CIOC was codified in the E -Government Act of 2002 (44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3603). The CIOC is focusing its efforts on cybersecurity, IT modernization, customer experience, and data as a strategic asset. Additionally, allocations made to the CIOC in FY 2023 will support efforts such as: IT Modernization: The CIOC is focused on improving the quality and efficiency of critical citizen -facing services by removing the barriers to rapidly adopt the best -in-class solutions to better meet the needs of citizens. These efforts drive efficiency by speeding the ado ption of new practices, processes, or technologies in Government that will enable Federal programs to accomplish their missions, improve the efficacy and effectiveness of technology spending and performance within and across agencies, enable entrepreneurs and other agencies to better leverage Government data, elevate the utilization and effectiveness of Government -wide shared services, and build a more flexible and productive IT workforce. R educing Cybersecurity Risks to the Federal Mission: The CIOC is fo cused on assisting CIOs and Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) in improving the execution of information security priorities across the Government, including mitigating the impact of risks to Federal agencies ' data, systems, and networks by implem enting cutting -edge cybersecurity capabilities. The CIOC chartered the CISO Council in 2016. The CISO Council functions as the CIOC 's primary cybersecurity forum. In addition, the CISO Council actively coordinates information sharing related to emerging th reats and cyber incidents and is assisting OMB, the Department of Homeland Security, and other key Government partners to dramatically improve the ability of agencies to modernize risk - based budgeting and decision- making, enhance the cybersecurity workforc e, and coordinate incident response and vulnerability management across the Federal enterprise. A dvancing the FITARA Scorecard : The CIOC is focused on working with agencies and Congress to continue progress in meeting the requirements outlined in the Feder al IT Acquisition Reform Act of 2014 (FITARA) (40 U.S.C. \u00a7 11319).

Government -Wide Councils Cross -Cutting Council Initiatives GWC -14 Funding for the Councils has historically focused on providing resources for Council -specific projects, with only a few initiatives having a cross -council focus. Over the years, however, the Councils have made a strategic shift to better coordinate projects across the Councils. In FY 2023, in addition to funding Counc il-specific projects, the Councils will continue to emphasize identifying cross -council projects that meet the needs of multiple functional communities and optimize Government -wide return on investment. Specifically, this funding will support co- investment in cross -council projects that benefit one or more functional areas as well as the Councils that address cross- cutting priorities. Allocations made to cross- cutting Council activities in FY 2023 will support activities such as: President 's Management Council (PMC) : The PMC advises the President and OMB on Government reform initiatives, provides performance and management leadership throughout the Executive Branch, and oversees implementation of Government -wide management policies and programs. The PMC com prises the Chief Operating Officers of major Federal agencies, primarily Deputy Secretaries, Deputy Administrators, and agency heads from GSA and OPM. OMB 's Deputy Director for Management chairs the PMC, and OMB 's management team works closely with the PMC to implement a range of projects. The PMC was established by a Presidential Memorandum on Implementing Management Reform in the Executive Branch (October 1, 1993). P erformance Improvement Council (PIC): The PIC, which is composed of the Performance Improv ement Officers of agencies and departments and senior OMB officials, collaborates to improve the performance of Federal programs. The PIC was codified into law in the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 (31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1124). W orkforce : Funding will support initiatives across Councils and the management community to strengthen the skills of the mission -support workforce. For instance, funding will continue to support the White House Leadership Development Program and the CXO Fellows Program, which aim to strengthen enterprise leadership across the Government by providing mid- and senior -level Federal employees with expanded perspective and skill sets to address challenges facing the country. These increasingly complex challenges span agencies and jurisdictions, requiring leaders to be trained in working across agencies and organizational boundaries while leveraging networks on a greater scale than in the past to ensure the Government continues to effectively deliver services to the American people. D ata Management : Projects under this cross -cutting area will improve data management across Council activities in order to inform decision- making, drive solutions through data - driven actions, and use data to develop innovative approaches to improve mission and service deli very. S haring Quality Services: To accelerate progress on shared services in the Federal arena, the CAOC, CFOC, CHCOC, and CIOC have been instrumental in collaborating with OMB, the Shared Services Governance Board, and the Office of Shared Solutions and Performance Improvement at GSA. This cross -council partnership will continue to improve the effectiveness of shared services by ensuring that stakeholders are informed, aligned, and acting in concert around a common objective. G eneral Operations : Using shar ed resources to leverage efficiencies, General Operations includes staffing and support for projects under Cross -Cutting Initiatives as well as for such Councils as the PMC, the PIC, and CXO Councils to help Council members achieve Government -Wide Councils Cross -Cutting Council Initiatives GWC -15 outcomes pursuant to the ir statutory missions. General Operations staff focus efforts on coordinating engagement, communicating with OMB and agency stakeholders, and managing key Council meetings by leveraging combined operations staffing. General Operations staff oversee all pro jects funded and supported by the cross -cutting and Council specific projects to ensure they align with the President 's Management Agenda. Federal Government Priority Goals GWC -16 Overview Federal Government Priority Goals (commonly referred to as Cross -Agency Priority Goals, or CAP Goals) were established by the Government Performance and Results (GPRA) Modernization Act (31 U.S.C. 1120) and are set at the beginning of each Presidential ter m in consultation with Congress. CAP Goals are a key tool used by leadership to accelerate progress on a limited number of presidential priorities to overcome organizational barriers and achieve greater performance results than one agency can achieve on it s own. For each CAP Goal, OMB identifies Goal Leaders, regularly tracks performance throughout the year through data -driven review s, holds goal teams accountable for results, and publishes quarterly results on Performance.gov . OMB, the various Government-wide Councils, and agencies have all worked to support progress on CAP Goals. In FY 2016, Congress provided $15 million in new transfer authority for cross -agenc y implementation of CAP Goals. Prior to the authority provided in FY 2016, there was no established means of funding the execution of these cross -agency efforts. Without such authority, CAP Goal leaders were constrained in their ability to implement effective solutions across agencies, leaving various federal programs and activities to address shared issues in a siloed and ad -hoc manner. The new authority allowed GSA, with the approval of the OMB Director, to collect funds from agencies to support activities related to th e implementation of CAP Goals. The Office of Shared Solutions and Performance Improvement, within GSA 's Office of Government -wide Policy , administers the funds, transferring funds from and to agencies supporting these efforts. Alignment with the President 's Management Agenda The GPRA Modernization Act requires that CAP Goals be updated or revised every four years to align with the management priorities of a new Presidential term. The statute requires the alignment of strategic and longer -term performance planning with election cycles in order to reflect the policy priori ties of the current Administration 's leadership, with the input of key stakeholders . As delineated in the President 's Management Agenda (PMA) Vision, released on November 18, 2021, the PMA will focus on strategies to advance three core priorities: 1. Strengt hening and Empowering the Federal Workforce 2. Delivering Excellent, Equitable, and Secure Federal Services and Customer Experience 3. Managing the Business of Government to Build Back Better This three -part approach is how the Biden -Harris Administration will create an effective, equitable, and accountable Government that delivers results for all. Delivering results and being accountable will steadily rebuild trust between the public and their Government. Each of the three priorities will be advanced through new and expanded cross -Government efforts on specific strategies defined in the PMA Vision. In addition, to support the se three priorities, and to drive strong Government performance across all of the Government 's work, the Administration will build on long- standing efforts to enhance Government capacity for delivering results. Agencies will continue to work together to enhance and secure Government information technology as a vital support and catalyst for mission delivery. Agencies will further enhance Fede ral data management and data science capabilities, building on more than a decade of focus across the Federal Government. Agencies will continue to nurture a culture of evidence -based policymaking and Federal Government Priority Goals GWC -17 scientific integrity. Performance management and measur ement processes, including CAP Goals, agency implementation of their strategic plans and agency priority goals, and the indicators and outcomes which will be tracked on Performance.gov, will help determine whether progress is being made toward this PMA Vis ion. More information about the PMA Vision can be found at https://www.performance.gov/pma/ . FY 2023 Budget Estimate s The Administration proposes continuation of this authority in the FY 202 3 Budget. This section provides the topline funding level for CAP Goals in FY 2023 and a broad delineation of how CAP Goal funds will be allocated . In FY 2023, we will maintain the total amount in collections for CAP Goal funds at $15 million, which is the amount capped in statute and the same amount collected in FY 2022. Funds provided by this authority will be used in FY 2023 to implement the President 's Management Agenda a nd provide critical support for driving progress on pressing management challenges that impede the effective and efficient delivery of core programs and services to the American people. This approach for funds utilization recognizes that upfront and continued capacity is required in order to address cross -cutting policy priorities across the Federal Government in a meaningful way that leverages the effective structure of CAP Goal processes and routines, in addition to providing overall support for the administration of this fund. Specific allocations will be made to CAP Goal projects following Congressional notification. Summary Funding Table by CAP Goal Cross -Agency Priority Goal1 FY 202 12 FY 202 23 FY 202 33 Federal Workforce 1,650,000 --- --- Customer Experience 3,575,000 --- --- Business of Government 1,136,000 --- --- Crosscutting PMA Support 5,639,000 --- --- Total Reimbursable Authority $12,000,000 $15,000,000 $15,000,000 1 2 3 Items in t his column reflect the core priorities delineated in the President 's Management Agenda (PMA) Vision that was released on November 18, 2021. Amounts included in this column are subject to change. FY 202 1 funds remain available for obligation through September 30, 202 2. Specific allocation decisions under the FY 202 2 and FY 202 3 authority have not yet been made. The following table broadly delineates how FY 2023 CAP Goal funds will be allocated. Consistent with previous years, OMB will determine allocations across individual CAP Goals that are aligned with priorities of the President' s Management Agenda, supporting CA P Goal initiatives and projects that will deliver tangible, measurable impacts to advance Goal progress in the near term. Future notification letters to Congress will reflect these allocations to the CAP Goals. Federal Government Priority Goals GWC -18 Cross -Agency Priority (CAP) Goals FY 2023 Individual CAP Goal Projects: Funds will support individual projects developed by CAP Goal teams. --- Cross -cutting CAP Goal Support : Continued analytical capacity and capabilities are needed in order to: Address key areas of cross -agency collaboration in a meaningful and effective way for improving coordination and reducing duplication; Identify, analyze, and evaluate risks to making progress in cross- cutting policy and management areas; and Recommend changes or modifications to strategies necessary to advance the work of CAP Goal teams. CAP Goals tend to face similar overarching challenges, such as resolving conflicts when working across agency boundaries, developing appropriate measurement techniques for hard -to-measure outcomes, and analyzing and visualizing complex data. Instead of investing in this capacity on a goal -by-goal basis, support will be made available for such high- priority needs. Support is also provided for tracking progress and ensuring accountability across the goals and the Presiden t's Management Agenda, including supporting the quality and completeness of the regular quarterly public updates through Performance.gov to keep the Congress, the public, and other key stakeholders informed of progress. --- Administration and contingencies : Administering these funds requires dedicated support for the collection of funds from agencies, disbursement of funds to agencies in support of Goal t eam initiatives and projects, contract administration, and funds control. Some funding will also initially be available to address unanticipated needs, potential shortfalls under a continuing resolution, or contingencies. --- Total Cross -Agency Priority "}
