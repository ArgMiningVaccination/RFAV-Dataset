Appropriate procedures are described below and should be adhered to in response to student complaints. Students should first attempt to resolve their complaints with the office most directly responsible for the action being challenged. Each school or administrative unit at Emory has an office of Student Services or other office that can further assist students and direct them if they are uncertain 4 about where to start. In addition, students may use the Office of the Ombuds (https://ombuds.emory.edu/ ) to assi st with complaints if they are uncertain or wish to discuss a situation confidentially before taking more formal action. Note that in cases of sexual misconduct, the Ombuds is a mandated reporter. Federal financial aid laws and regulations require that ea ch state has a process to review and act on complaints concerning educational institutions in the state. You may file a complaint with the State of Georgia Nonpublic Postsecondary Education Commission (GNPEC) website at www.GNPEC.org to submit your complaint/grievance with the state. You may also contact GNPEC by mail or by phone at the following address and/or phone number: Nonpublic Postsecondary Education Commission, 2082 East Exchange Place, Sui te 220, Tucker, Geo rgia 30084 -5305; Office: aware that: \"The Commission require s that students utilize and complete their institution's grievance procedure in an attempt to resolve any complaint or concern before submitting a complaint to the Commission. If the institution's resolution is not satisfactory, a student may then appeal to the Commission, but it will not investigate a complaint unless th e student has exhausted all available grievance procedures outline d by the institution.\" An agreement with the Georgia Nonpublic Postsecondary Education Commission permits students enrolled in distance learning programs to file a complaint with the following agencies if their complaint cannot be resolved by following Em ory University procedures: 1) the Georgia Nonpublic Postsecondary Commission, 2) the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, Commission on Colleges, and 3) a complaint to the state in which the distance learning student resides. Applicability This policy applies to current and former students who choose to make a formal written complaint against the university, its faculty, staff, or administrative personnel. Policy Details Documentation of the Complaint Student complaints must be submitted in writing and accompanied by relevant documentation describing 1) the specific action, practice or decision that is being challenged, 2) the individuals involved in or with knowledge of the action, practice or decision at issue, 3) the impact of the decision, 4) what resolution is desired, and 5) why it should be granted. Complaint Resolution Except in situations involving allegations of discrimination or harassment (where students may file complaints directly with the Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance), Emory encourages each student to pursue complaints against faculty, 5 staff, or a dministrative personnel at the school, offi ce, or unit level. Each school and administrative unit has its own procedures as described in the student handbook, school's catalog, or unit website. Academic or other concerns usually begin with student service personnel in each school or administrative unit who then typically rout e the concerns to the appropriate school or administrative authority. Student concerns can be effectively handled by school or administrative unit personnel who have staff expertise in the academic or service discipline involved, familiarity with the faculty/staff, and who have experience in hand ling similar decisions made regarding its students. To expedite a prompt resolution, complaints should include current contact information of the individual filing the complaint. In most cases, responses to the complaint, inclu ding the final decision, will be provided in writing within 30 days of receipt of the complaint. However, exceptions to this timeframe may be allowed with reasonable and regular communication to inform the student of the current status of the complaint. Record Retention The designated school or unit representative for reporting purposes should retain the written complaint along with the resolution of the complaint and any additional supporting documentation, including emails, or other communication. In addition, an action log of all complaints received should be maintained each year. Thi s action log is collected by the Off ice of Planning and Administration as a part of the Annual Report process. An example is provided below in the \"Related Link\" section. DISTANCE LEARNING: NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR STATE AUTHORIZATION RECIPROCITY AGREEMENTS Effective March 17, 2016, the Georgia Nonpublic Postsecondary Education Commission (GNPEC) approved Emory University to participate in the National Council for State Authorization Reciprocity Agreements (NC -SARA). A \"State authorization reciprocity agreement\" is an agreement between two or mo re States that authorizes an institution located and legally authorized in a State covered by the agreement to provide postsecondary education through distance education or correspondence courses to students in other States covered by the agreement. If a complaint submitted by a student enrolled in a distance learning program cannot be resolved by following the Emory University procedures, a student may file a complaint with the following agencies: 1) Georgia Nonpublic Postsecondary Commission (complete the SARA Online Student Complaint form), 2) the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC), Emory University's regional accrediting body ( \"Complaint Procedures\"), and 3) a complaint to the state within which the distance le arning student resides (file a complaint in your state). 6 State of Georqia Federal financial aid laws and regulations require that each state has a process to review and act on complaints concerning educational institutions in the state. If you have a complaint, you may file it with Emory's financial aid office or call the Trust Line at 1 -888-550-8850 or file a report online at https://www.mycompliancereport.com/EmoryTrustLineOnline . You may also file a complaint about Emory University with the State of Georgia Nonpublic Postsecondary Education Commission (GNPEC). Use the website at www.GNPEC.org to submit your complaint/grievance with the state.

Please be aware that: \"The Commission requires that students utilize and complete their institution's grievance procedure in an attempt to resolve any complaint or concern before submitting a complaint to the Commission. If the institution's resolution is not satisfactory, a student may then appeal to the Commission, but it will not investigate a complaint unless the student has exhausted all available grievance procedures outlined by the institution. SOUTHERN ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES AND SCHOOLS COMMISSION ON COLLEGES The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges is Emor y University's regional accrediting body. Students may make inquiries to SACSCOC regarding complaint procedures or about issues and concerns that could be considered complaints. Policy and procedures for filing student complaints are outlined in the docume nt \"Complaint Procedures against SACSCOC or its Accredited Institutions.\" SACSCOC asks that you read its policy statement before filing a complaint. FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID Matters pertaining to federal financial aid should be referred to the United States Department of Education . Definitions A complaint is a written description of a problem or concern that has not been resolved through normal academic or administrative processes at the office or unit level. Student complaints can be categorized into four major areas: Academic, Non - academic, Discrimination/Harassment (equityandinclusion.emory.edu),or Appeals of any of the previously mentioned areas. If a student has a complaint involving discrimination, harassment or sexual misconduct against an Emory employee, the complaint can be made directly to the Office of Inclusion and Compliance. Otherwise, a complaint should be filed with and handled by the relevant school or administrative unit. 7 The \"handling official\" is the person designated in each school or administrative unit to address the complaint. An ombudsperson is an independent, impartial individual from whom students may seek confidential guidance regarding a problem, conflict, or concern. The Emory Ombuds Office offers assistance through inform al means only and is not an advocate in grievance procedures, judicial procedures, or any other formal processes. A \"State authorization reciprocity agreement\" is an agreement between two or more States that authorizes an institution located and legally authorized in a State covered by the agreement to provide postsecondary education through distance education or corr espondence courses to students in other States covered by the agreement.

APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS A Note to Applicants for Fall 2023 The 202 2-2023 Interview Season will begin in September and end in late February and will be conducted remotely (on the Zoom platform) again this year. We will accept MCAT scores administered through October 2022, so long as your scores meet our prescreening criteria ( See Step 3 for more details), but we strongly recommend that you take the exam as early as possible. It is important to both apply early and to know your MCAT scores when you submit your AMCAS application. This will allow you to apply to schools where yo ur application will be competitive. Step 1: Course Requirements You must complete at least 90 semester hours (or 135 quarter hours) of a balanced undergraduate education from a regionally accredited institution in the United States or a similarly accredited institution in Canada. Completion of the baccalaureate degree is highly preferred. If your undergraduate degree is from a college outside the United States and Canada, you must complete all 32 semester hours of the required science coursework at a regionally accredited U.S. institution or a similarly accredited institution in Canada. International Applicants 11 Required courses must be completed prior to matriculation at medical school. Minimum course requirements: Physical Science - 8 semester hours (with lab) Biology - 8 semester hours (with lab) Chemistry - 8 semester hours (with lab) Organic Chemistry - 8 semester hours (with lab) English - 6 semester hours Humanities/Social Sciences - 18 semester hours Applicants should present a strong academic record in all coursework - not just the required courses. The average cumulative undergraduate GP A for accepted students is 3.7. Science course requirements are intended to demonstrate a sound knowledge in each of the basic science areas. We expect medical school students to have a strong foundation in these areas prior to attending medical school. An applicant's GPA in the sciences is carefully considered, although not weighted. The English requirement is intended to demonstrate competency in grammar and composition at the college level. Literature courses may be used to fill the English requirement i f the course was writing -intensive. Emory will accept some Advanced Placement (AP) and International Baccalaureate (IB) credit, as long as the credits appear on a college transcript. If you have AP and/or IB credit in any of the science areas, it is recomm ended that you complete an upper -level course to maintain your knowledge in that area. Exceptions to the course requirements can only be granted by the Admissions Committee and will be determined only once a complete application is submitted. Step 2: Experiences A strong application will include exposure to patients and physicians in a clinical setting, for example volunteering at a local hospital, clinical volunteer work abroad, clinical employment and shadowing a physician. The Admissions Committee is most interested in applicants who have face -to-face experience with the patient -doctor relationship. A strong application will also reflect a variety of extra -curricular activities, community involvement, and leadership experiences. Step 3: MCAT You mus t complete the Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT) within four years of the matriculation year AND no later than October of the year prior to the matriculation year (ex: for application for fall 2023, the MCAT must be completed between 2019 and October 2022). 12 MCAT score reports do not need to be sent to Emory. Your MCAT scores will be verified by AMCAS and reported directly to Emory. For the 2022 -23 Application Cycle, we will prescreen applicants for minimum MCAT scores. If you have taken the MCAT more than once, only your latest MCAT score will be used to determine your eligibility; however, if you have taken the MCAT more than three times, you are not eligible to receive the Emory Supplemental Application. In order to receive an invitation to subm it an Emory Supplemental Application, your latest MCAT exam must have: An overall score of 502 or higher AND A score of 124 or higher on EACH subtest We encourage you to review the resources on the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) website ( www.aamc.org ) for tips on preparing for the exam, access to practice tests, covid safety updates and more.

The ONLY decision that is made during this time is the decision to invit e for an interview. Applicants selected for an interview will be contacted by email or telephone. It is extremely critical that you keep your contact information updated with AMCAS during this time. Please also let the Office of Admissions know if you wil l be out of the country or unreachable by telephone or email for any period of time during the interview season (September - February). A personal interview is required to be considered for acceptance - there are no exceptions. (Due to the high volume of applications we receive from exceptional candidates each year, it is impossible to interview all qualified applicants. Consequently, fa ilure to be offered an interview is not an indication that a student is considered unsuited for a medical career.) ADMISSION PROCEDURE Admissions Committee The Admissions Committee will meet monthly during the interview season (October through February) and will select applicants for acceptance. Applicants will be notified of their acceptance via the US Postal Service. Applicants will NOT be notified by email or telephone. Emory School of Medicine operates on a rolling admission cycle, so applicants who are not selected for admission will remain in 17 consideration for all subsequent Admissions Committee meetings until March . No completed applicant is rejected during the interview season. At the close of the interview season, all interviewed applicants will be information of their status (accepted, rejected , or alternate). CREDIT FOR PRIOR EDUCATION AND TRAINING The MD program does not award credits from prior education and training with the exception of the MD/OMF program . ENROLLMENT POLICY Each year, Emory University School of Medicine enrolls 138 new students into the first-year class. To be enrolled in the program, students must have submitted an application, completed an interview and been selected for admission to the program by the Admissions Committee. Students must also have completed all prerequisites and obtained an undergraduate degree prior to enrollment in the program. Accepted Applicant s and Conditions of Enrollment Accepted applicants to the first -year class are asked to accept their position in the incoming class within two weeks of the receipt of their acceptance letter. The deadline for students to make a final decision for medical school is April 30. No admission deposit is required. All accepted students are expected to maintain their academic performance, personal characteristics, and behavior. Documented evidence to the contrary may result in revocation of acceptance. This includes, but is not limited to, all Emory University School of Medicine Policies and Regulations for Professionalism, Conduct and Academic In tegrity. A complete listing of policies and regulations can be found online at: http://www.med.emory.edu/handbook/. All accepted students will be asked to authorize a th ird party to perform a criminal background check and drug screen and to release all findings to Emory University School of Medicine. This requirement must be completed prior to matriculation . All applicants are expected to follow the \"AAMC Recommendations for Medical School Applicants .\" All students are required to maintain health insurance coverage that meets Emory University minimum coverage requirements throughout the entire period of enrollment at Emory University. Emory will automatic ally enroll accepted students in the Emory Student Health Insurance Plan. If the student has health insurance coverage with another carrier that meets Emory University minimum coverage requirements, the Emory Student Health Insurance Plan can be waived. 18 All incoming students will be required to complete and pass health and safety training courses prior to M1 Orientation. Courses will be available online in the summer prior to M1 Orientation. Attendance and full participation in all orientation sessions for incoming students will be required. No exceptions will be granted and all acceptances are contingent upon attendance at ALL orientation sessions. ATTENDANCE Active participation in all aspects of the medical education program is critical to students' development as physicians. Although attendance is expected at all scheduled classes, attendance is mandatory at all small group sessions, preceptorships, and patient presentations. Attendance is also mandatory for all examinations, including written, oral , and observed structured clinical exams (OSCEs). Attendance is likewise mandatory for class meetings. Daily attendance during clinical clerkships is mandatory, except for required days off as outlined below. Duty Hours on Clinical Clerkships During the clinical clerkships, students must adhere to the duty hour guidelines as outlined by the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME). Duty hours are defined as all clinical and academic activities related to the program: Patient care (both inpatient and outpatient) Administrative duties relative to patient care The provision for transfer of patient care Time spent in -house during call activities Scheduled activities, such as conferences Duty hours do not include reading and preparation time spent away from the duty site. Students on clinical clerkships are required to report their duty hours on a weekly basis via OASIS. The Executive Curriculum Committee monitors student duty hours and makes any necessary curricular revisions to ensure duty h our compliance. Punctuality In addition to attendance, it is considered part of professional duty and is the responsibility of the student to arrive on time for classes, small group sessions, clinical rounds, scheduled examinations, and all other events related to the M.D. program. 19 ABSENCES We strongly recommend students to be present for ALL educational activities. And as stated above, for many of the educational sessions attendance is required. These required sessions are described above. The practice of medicine is collaborative and colleg ial. Excellent patient care requires good communication and trust among and between colleagues. Medical education requires students to work collaboratively with each other, patients, fellow students, staff, and faculty in a regular and predictable manner. The nature of our work as caregivers requires that we notify appropriate persons when we must be absent so that patient care is not compromised, and both clinical and educational responsibilities are fairly shared. As a supportive community that values wel lness and well -being, the School of Medicine faculty, staff, and administration realize that various circumstances --emergent or otherwise --will require that members of our community must occasionally be absent from required events. Furthermore, we must wor k together to support each other during circumstances that take us away from required events. This policy outlines a process by which students can be granted excused absences. Failure to comply with this policy will be considered unprofessional behavior. Excused absences will be considered for the following reasons: Appointments for medical care that cannot reasonably be scheduled outside your MD program responsibilities Acute medical illness or family emergency To give a scholarly presentation at an academ ically relevant national meeting Running for or holding national office in a relevant professional organization Religious observances Residency interviews Participation in the MD or MD/PhD interview as an invited tour guide related to the admissions proces s Participation in meetings of the EUSOM Executive Curriculum Committee and its subcommittees Required student meetings with deans and potential/actual Discovery mentors Required MD/PhD meetings, including the annual MD/PhD retreat ABSENCE POLICY During the Foundations Phase, students should contact Dr. Ira Schwartz to be granted an excused absence. During the Application, Discovery, and Translation Phases, students should follow the Absence from Clinical Duties Policy and Process (below). 20 Request s should be made as far in advance as possible. For emergent absences, students should phone the appropriate Dean and clerkship director (for students on clinical rotations). All other requests should be made in person or by email. During Foundations If the requested absence is approved, Dr. Schwartz will notify the Foundations and course director and the student's Small Group Advisor. Any required sessions, academic assignments, etc. that are missed must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of the course and F oundations director and the appropriate Dean. Within reason, course directors will assist students to complete all work missed during excused absences, as deemed necessary by the director of the course. If an excused absence does not allow for the missed w ork to be made up before the end of the course or phase, the student may be assigned a grade of \"Incomplete\" until the work is completed. If the student is unable to complete the missed work in a timely manner, as determined by the course director, the gra de may be converted to \"Withdrawal .\" The designation of \"Withdrawal\" would require the student to repeat the course. Repeated unexcused absences during the Foundations Phase will be considered a professionalism concern and will be brought to the attention of the Progress and Promotions (P&P) committee. If a student has three or more unexcused absences, referral to the P&P committee could result in a letter of concern, warning, probation, or other ramifications as the committee deems appropriate. During Clin ical Clerkships Clinical training is an essential part of medical education and represents a critical phase of the medical student experience. Given this, any absence from clinical duties (ACD) is considered a serious matter. Clerkship directors understan d that circumstances will sometimes require a student to be absent from clinical duties. The following are responsibilities and general guidelines for a medical student considering an ACD: TERMS AND DEFINITIONS Duty hours Duty hours are defined as time spent doing all clinical and academic activities related to the program and include patient care, administrative duties related to patient care, and scheduled educational conferences. Clinical service time may occur outside of business hour s but should not exceed 80 hours/week. 21 Scheduled Days Off/Mandatory Time off/Wellness Half -Days Each clerkship will assign a number of scheduled days off, which includes the minimum mandatory time off from duty hours, as specified by ACGME guidelines. The total number of scheduled days off will be determined by each clerkship according to clinical service needs and schedules. Required wellness half -days are considered an excused absence from clinical duties and students are expected to request the allotte d amount of wellness half -days for each clerkship. Absence from Clinical Duties (ACD) This is an absence that occurs during scheduled duty hours, and does not occur during mandatory time off or on additional scheduled days off from clinical servic e. It does not include wellness half -days. An ACD will decrease the total amount of time that a student is able to invest in clinical service activities. A student who has an ACD may be required to make up the time absent, depending on what activities were missed. Extended ACD This is an ACD that is longer than the limit set based on the length of the clerkship, and which will need to be made up . Policies are enforced at the discretion of individual clerkship directors. An extended ACD is defined by the total length of a clerkship/rotation: 1-week clerkship/rotation: 1 day 3 days 8-week clerkship: 4 days Student Responsibilities 1. Students should attempt to schedule non-clerkship related activities outside of normal duty hours for that clerkship (e.g., late afternoons/evenings and weekends or scheduled time off). 2. Students must communicate all requests with advance notice (as soon as the need is known to the student) t o the clerkship director, clerkship coordinator, and Associate Dean for Clinical Education. 3. All communication regarding requests for time off should be done in a professional manner. 4. Students who are ACD are required to collect any didactic materials/notes from lectures that they may have missed during their time away. Guidelines 1. Advance communication with the clerkship director, clerkship coordinator, and the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs is required for any requested activity that could result in an ACD. These types of activities include: 1. Doctors' Appointments 22 2. Meetings with Discovery Mentors 3. Meetings or conferences at which the student is presenting (poster or podium) 4. Important personal events (graduations and weddings of close family members) 5. Residency interviews 6. Religious observances 7. Admissions committee interviews/tours 8. Curriculum committee meetings 2. With advance notice, the clerkship directors will work with the student to avoid an ACD. This may include arranging rotations or shifts to accommodate the request or helping the student select the best days/times to attend their activity and limit time away from clinical duties. If accommodations can be made to align the student's scheduled time off with their activity, the absence will not be considered an ACD. However, clerkship directors may not always be able to accommodate these requests . In this case, if the clerkship director permits the student to attend the activity, this will result in an ACD. 3. Emergency requests for ACD such as st udent illness, personal injury, or injury/illness/death of a family member should be communicated as soon as possible to the Associate Dean for Clinical Education and the clerkship director and clerkship coordinator. 4. In cases of ACD without prior communica tion with, or approval by, the Associate Dean for Clinical Education's office and the clerkship director, a Professionalism Report will be filed by the clerkship director. This includes unauthorized extension of a previously authorized ACD. Further informa tion about common reasons for missing required educational events: Excused Absences for Personal Medical Care Medical students are strongly encouraged to maintain their own physical and mental health and well -being. Whenever possible, students should sched ule non - emergent healthcare appointments during times that do not conflict with classroom and clinical activities. In the event an appointment must be scheduled during a required educational activity, students must request permission to be excused from the appropriate Dean (see above). Religious Observances The Emory School of Medicine recognizes and respects the importance of individual religious beliefs and practices. While the School of Medicine calendar includes only religious observances recognized as U.S. federal holidays, the school seeks to accommodate student religious needs reasonably and within the requirements of the academic schedule. There shall be no adverse or prejudicial effect resulting to any student requesting excused absences for religi ous observances. Students assigned to patient care educational activities may request assignments that allow the student to meet their religious needs; on occasion, students may be asked to attend patient care activities that cannot be reasonably re -schedu led, such as on - 23 call time with a care team. Required academic work missed as part of an excused absence must be made up to the satisfaction of the supervising faculty member. Residency Interviews During clinical clerkships, students MAY be granted one -day excused absences for residency interviews per each two weeks of the clinical rotation. This may vary on rotations that schedule shift clinical duties (e.g. Emergency Medicine). Students should discuss and submit requests for absence from clerkship responsi bilities to the Deans Office PRIOR to making travel or other interview plans. Regardless of absences for interviews, students must complete the requirements of the rotation by the last day of the rotation. Any deviation from this policy must be approved by the Associate Dean for Clinical Education. Participation in the MD or MD/PhD Admissions Process or Tour Guide Students actively participate in the MD and MD/PhD admissions process, serving as interviewers and tour guides. Students will not be allowed to m iss mandatory components of any clerkship to serve as an interviewer and tour guide. Participation in Meetings of the EUSOM Executive Curriculum Committee and its Subcommittees Students actively participate in the subcommittees of the EUSOM Executive Curriculum Committee. They play an invaluable role in curricular decisions. Students are allowed to attend Required Student Meetings with Deans and Potential/Actual Discovery Mentors During the required clerkships, students are required to meet with the Associate Dean for Clinical Education or his/her designee. In addition, students need to meet with faculty members in order to select a mentor for their Discovery phase project. If possible, these meetings should be scheduled during a time that m inimizes student disruptions in clinical care activities. CURRICULUM After nearly 3 years of planning involving hundreds of medical faculty and students, and key members of Emory's schools of nursing, public health, and graduate programs in the arts and sciences, Emory School of Medicine implemented an innovative medical curriculum in August 2007. This exciting program was carefully designed after extensive consultation with other renowned medical institutions and educational experts in the United Sta tes and the United Kingdom. Emory's curriculum reflects the extraordinary advances taking place in biomedical science; meets the needs of an ever -changing local and global healthcare environment; 24 takes advantage of the unique educational resources in Atla nta; and respects the intellectually gifted and highly motivated students who choose to come to Emory. Focusing on small -group learning and increased interaction with faculty, students are immersed in clinical experi ence from the very beginning. A multi tude of clinical sites provide students with extensive training in patient care, including an Outpatient Experience that begins early in the first year. A 5-month Discovery period allows time for clinical or bench research, international experience, or ot her academic inquiry. Curriculum Philosophy and Design The specific structure of the curriculum was designed by the faculty and student leadership in keeping with the following desired characteristics of Emory School of Medicine graduates: Superb clinicia ns who demonstrate the highest degree of professionalism; outstanding clinical competency and problem -solving skills; and the ability to understand and utilize basic science in the clinical setting ; Curious and creative thinkers with the ability to utilize available resources to answer clinical and research questions and to assess information critically ; Lifelong adult learners with the ability to take ownership of their own present and future educat ional needs ; Physicians who continue to be passionate about medicine and about making a difference; who are involved in and appreciate efforts to improve the health of local and global communities; who see medicine as profession that seeks to address issues of social justice ; Physicians committed to understanding the sociological, psychological, and economic issues of the patient, the family, and the community ; Future leaders eager and able to play leadership roles in their chosen field of medicine or biomedical science, and in their community . To achieve graduates with these characteristics, our curriculum: Is competency -based, through the development and assessment of core competencies as determined by the faculty ; Provides for integrat ion of basic and clinical science --both horizontally (across disciplines) and vertically (across years) --throughout all four years ; Provides an early introduction of clinical medicine and an increase in clinical experience in the ambulatory setting, inclu ding a sustained experience in a continuity clinic ; Increases flexibility throughout the four years of the curriculum ; 25 Provides an \"in -depth\" discovery phase that will enhance creativity, curiosity and the development of leadership skills. Inherent in t his opportunity is the potential of a tuition -free fifth year of study, and encouragement of year -long experiences at Emory (e.g. lab -based research, MPH at the Rollins School of Public Health) or at other institutions (e.g. CDC, NIH) ; Reduces lecture tim e and rely less on rote memorization with simultaneous creation of more opportunities for active learning ; Provides better methods of academic and clinical assessment closely linked to the appropriate competencies ; Increases student mentoring throughout the four years of medical school and increases exposure to master clinicians at all Emory clinical sites ; Increases use of clinical simulation and standardized patients for skills training and assessment . Four Phases in Four Years The MD curriculum is divided into four phases (view a chart of the 4 year MD Curriculum ): Phase 1: Foundations of Medicine . This phase provides s tudents with the core knowledge of basic and clinical sciences. Phase 2: Application of Medical Sciences . This phase provides students with core knowledge of the basic clinical medical specialties. Phase 3: Discovery . This phase is a structured time for students to concentrate in a specific area of interest, such as basic or clinical research, public health, community development, medical ethics, or other areas. Phase 4: Translation of Medical Sciences . This phase prepares the student for the transition to physician. Rotations as a Sub -Intern; advanced clinical work in an ICU; experience in the Emergency Department; and a final Capstone Course prior to graduation are required. 26 Foundation s of Medicine (18 months) Following a week -long shadowing experience, known as \"Week on the Wards,\" students begin \"Healthy Human\", five -month period during which the focus is on healthy human physiology, basic science, and epidemiologic principles. During this time, stude nts also begin their clinical skills training, meeting twice a week with their small group - forming a close relationship with classmates and their faculty mentor early on. Small group discussions about professionalism, ethics, communication, cultural comp etency, and other \"How to be a Doctor\" skills add to the \"whole person approach\" to medical education. Using these new skills, students begin seeing patients in an outpatient clinic (OPEX - outpatient experience) in the early months of medical school. Repo rting for service one afternoon every other week for twelve months, first -year medical students are able to learn from a healthcare team - and their patients - in a longitudinal experience. In January of the first year, students begin studying human diseas e in organ system -based courses for the duration of the Foundations Phase. Anatomy also takes place during this time period. Each of 24 dissection tables is equipped with a computer to display cross -sectional imaging, study guides, lecture notes, and other electronic references. 27 A central component of the curriculum involves our Society System. There are four Societies with four experienced clinician -educators (Small Group Advisors) in each Society; thus, each medical school class has 16 practicing physici ans who are dedicated clinical teachers. Every student is assigned to a Society and a Small Group Advisor who stays with the student throughout their four -year medical education. Small Group Advisors instruct students in professionalism and the art of patient care, patient -physician communication skills, and the principles of physical examination and diagnostic thinking. Small group instruction also covers many other critical topics over the four -year curriculum. An integral part of the MD student experience is the Community Learning and Social Medicine course. This structured learning experience combines community service with preparation, action and reflection. Learners work with over 50 community -based organizations/partners focused on one of fou r underserved or disadvantaged populations: elderly, disabled, economically disadvantaged, and immigrant/refugee populations. Upon completion of the formal courses in Foundations, students are given protected study time for Step 1 of the United States Medi cal Licensing Exam. Grading is Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory for the Foundations phase of the curriculum.

While the Discovery project must be a scientific inquiry based in Medicine, students are able to combine their interests in other areas, such as creative writing, public health, community development, education, or health pol icy into their project. Some students are also able to include an international experience in their Discovery project. This is a critical opportunity for students to renew their creative energies and explore a new facet of medicine under the tutelage of an Emory faculty member. Students must carry out a research project that meets the standards for the MD degree as established by the Discovery faculty. This project can be part of the student's second degree program and may be designed and undertaken as part of that program. The Discovery leadership is responsible for assuring that the project fulfills the requirements for the Discovery phase of the MD curriculum. 32 During Discovery, medical students work full time on their projects with no other commitments e xcept occasional seminars or workshops relevant to their research. Many students publish their Discovery work in peer -reviewed scientific journals and all students present their Discovery project at Medical Student Research Day in the fourth year. MD 800 Discovery Phase - 20 credit hours Director - Maureen Powers, PhD Required*, Letter Grade * Students taking an extra year to obtain a dual degree (other than MD/MBA and certain concentrations of the MD/MPH degree that do not require a thesis ) are granted an exemption from this five -month phase.

All MD/MBA students are required to participate in Research Day for their graduating class and present their research findings. Other Dual Degree Programs MD Students who wish to pursue other degrees at Emory University or other institutions must meet with the Dean of Medical Education to de termine an academic plan for the remainder of the MD requirements prior to matriculation in any other degree program or at any other institution. STANDARDS OF PROGRESS Assessment, Evaluation, and Grading Assessments are measurements of student performance conducted using instruments such as written exams or observational checklists. Evaluations are comprehensive summaries of student performance measured against a performance standard. Grades are assigned based on data collected from both assessm ents and summative evaluations. A wide variety of assessment types are used to measure students' academic and professional performance in relation to the Emory University School of Medicine . Student Physician Activities (SPAs) and are incorporated into gr ades for courses and clerkships. In addition to written exams and academic papers, instructor observational assessments are often used during small group work, during patient care on clerkships, for elective courses, and in research labs. Objective Structu red Clinical Exams (OSCEs) are a regular and vital element of student assessment. Grading Scales S/U \"S\" indicates satisfactory work; Pass \"U\" indicates unsatisfactory work and carries no academic credit; Fail A grade of \"U\" carries no academic credit. A student cannot be promoted to the next phase of the curriculum with a grade of \"U\" on their transcript. Any student who receives a \"U\" will, at a minimum, have to remediate the course, and will be susceptible to additional actions such as probation or dismissal, as determined by the Progress and Promotions Committee. 40 A-F The letter grades \"A\" through \"F\" indicate the quality of a student's performance as measured by various assessment instruments and processes : modifiers of 'plus' or 'minus' with letter grades are also used. Letter grades are derived from a comprehensive, summative evaluation of a student's achievement, both academically and professionally. Grades are assigned based on published criteria. \"A\" indi cates exceptional performance \"B\" indicates good performance with no identified weaknesses \"C\" indicates acceptable performance with improvement needed \"D\" indicates unacceptable performance on at least one criterion , and no academic credit is awarded \"F\" indicates unacceptable performance on multiple criteria , and no academic credit is awarded A student cannot be promoted to the next phase of the curriculum with a grade of \"D\" or \"F\" on their transcript. Any student who receives a \"D\" or \"F\" will, at a minimum, have to repeat the clerkship, and the student will be susceptible to additional actions such as probation or dismissal, as determined by the Progress and Promotions Committee. Any repetition of coursework must be completed as soon as possible after t he grade of \"D\" or \"F\" has been submitted. IP and I \"IP\" indicates 'in -progress' course work. Final transcripts cannot carry grades of \"IP.\" \"I\" indicates incomplete course work. The grade of \"I\" will be assigned to students who have been unable to complete the requirements of the course/clerkship due to absences approved by the dean's office. The grade of \"I\" is appropriate only when enough work has been completed at an acceptable level of performance such that the student can complete the remaining work without repeating the entire course/clerkship. If a student receives a grade of \"I,\" the remaining work must be completed within a reasonable time, as determined by Associate Dean for Clinical Education, or the grade of \"I\" will automatically convert to an \"F. \" The grade of \"I\" cannot be assigned for unsatisfactory work. The grade of \"I\" is to be viewed as a non - prejudicial entry on the student's record. W \"W\" indicates withdrawal from course or clerkship without penalty \"WU\" indicates unsatisfactory withdrawal 41 Grading in the Foundation Phase In the Foundations Phase of the curriculum, grades \"S\" or \"U\" are assigned to students for each module. Students will receive a grade of Satisfactory in any module during the Foundations phase if students meet ei ther of the following criteria: A student's total score for the course must be greater than 2 standard deviation units below the mean (i.e. z > -2.0) OR the student's total percentage score is greater than 68.2%. When appropriate, students may also be assigned the grades of \"I,\" \"IP,\" \"W,\" \"WF,\" or \"WU.\" Students may not progress to the Application Phase of the curriculum without receiving a final grade of \"S\" in all Foundations courses. Although Anatomy is not a separately graded course, students must reach a satisfactory standard of performance as defined in the Anatomy syllabus. Remediation During the Foundation Phase Assessments are used to ide ntify those students who have not achieved minimal competency during a course: remediation is the process used to improve student performance and ensure that all students achieve the designated Student Physician Activities (SPAs) before moving on to the Application Phase of the curriculum. Remediation Policy The Office of Medical Education and Student Affairs will notify students of their need to remediate a module no later than three weeks after exam completion. This email will be cc'd to the module dir ector. Schedule The student must contact the course director within one week after the notification from OMESA. It is the responsibility of the student to schedule the remediation process with the course director. Students are required to make their first attempt at remediation no later than two weeks after their notification about the need to remediate an anatomy examination, and no later than the end of the week following the next school break for all other courses. Under certain circumstances, remediation may be delayed with prior permission from Dr. David Schulman, Director of Foundations. Students with remediations outstanding at the end of the Foundations Phase must complete these remediations no later than December 31 of their second year of med ical school. All remediations must be complete before a student may move into the Application phase. Process Students requiring remediation must meet with the director of the course to be remediated. If, during this conversation, the student identifies a n on- academic contributor to their poor performance (i.e., something medical or social), this should be brought to the attention of the Executive Associate 42 Dean of Medical Education and Student Affairs, Dr. Bill Eley, jeley@emory.edu or 404 -712-9979. The process for remediation, as determined by the course director, should be tailored to the individual student through the identification and correction of specific areas of deficiency. Retaking the entire course exam should only be necessary if the student's performance in all major content areas is unsatisfactory. The course director will provide the Office of Medical Education and Student Affairs a record of the remediation process for each student. This record will outline the format of the remediation, the dates on which it occurred, and whether the student successfully remediated on that date. If the student was unsuccessful on an attempt at remediation, the course direct or will briefly outline how they were unsuccessful. This will be part of the student's record. Failure to demonstrate adequate competence will necessitate additional remediation by the student. If a student is not able to demonstrate mastery of the course material after two attempted remediations, the course director may consult with the Progress and Promotions Committee regarding appropriate next steps. Each failed anatomy exam will need to be individually remediated. If a student fails any exam on the first attempt, that failure will be documented for Progress and Promotions. To more readily identify students in academic difficulty and offer them additional support services in a timely fashion, students who need to remediate more than one course/thread will be provided with information on receiving a learning assessment, the results of which may trigger further support services that may help the student avoid the need to remediate additional courses. For students required to repeat the Foundations phase of the curriculum, student progression in anatomy will be as follows: Students will be allowed to continue in anatomy, at the discretion of the anatomy director, if they begin the repetition process after having already started the anatomy thread. In this situation, students will not be required to retake anatomy (as part of repeating Foundations) if they pass ALL of the anatomy exams. Grading in the Application, Discovery, and Translation Phases In the Application, Discovery, and required clerkship portion of the Translation Phases of the curriculum, grades \"A+\" through \"F\" are assigned to students. For electives taken during in the Translation Phase, grades of \"S\" or \"U\" are assigned. When appropriate, students may also be assigned the grades of \"I,\" \"IP,\" \"W,\" \"WF,\" or \"WU.\" If a student fails any aspect of a clerkship that is required to pass the clerkship, the student will receive a failing grade (\"D\" or \"F\") for the clerkship and be required to repeat the clerkship in its entirety. The student will be re -enrolled in the cle rkship and a second grade will be issued after repetition of the clerkship; however, the \"D\" 43 or \"F\" grade earned after completing the clerkship for the first time will remain on the student's official transcript. Students must successfully complete all App lications clerkships before proceeding to the next phases of the curriculum. Completion of Clerkship Requirements All clerkship requirements, as defined by the individual clerkship directors, must be completed by 5pm on the final day of the rotation, inclu ding but not limited to patient logs in OASIS and direct observation forms. Students who fail to complete clerkship requirements on time will be subjected to penalties outlined by the clerkship directors and may result in a grade deduction or a failing gra de for the clerkship. Remediation During the Application, Discovery, and Translation Phases Students who receive a D or F in a clerkship or Discovery will have to repeat and successfully pass the respective clerkship or Discovery in order to progress to t he next phase of the curriculum. Conflicts of Interest in Grading Residents and faculty members with a conflict of interest (e.g., professional, personal, or familial relationship to a student, including providing health services or psychiatric/psychological counseling) should not participate in assessing a student in which a conflict exists. The EUSOM Separation of Roles outlines this in further detail. On the rare occasion when a student's Small Group Advisor is also a clerkship director, the department Vice Chair for Education (or designee) will be responsible for assigning grades for those students in which a conflict exists. Grade Appeals Students are encouraged to discuss their final grades with the course, clerkship, or elective director. Although grades are assigned as an accurate and fair representation of a student's work, students have the right to appeal a grade and to receive an independent review of the grading criteria and their performance. If a student wishes to appea l a final grade, this should be presented in writing to the Executive Associate Dean of Medical Education and Student Affairs within 14 days of receiving the grade. The appeal may be based on the process that led to the grade and/or questions of factual content used in the evaluation process. The Executive Associate Dean for Medical Education and Student Affairs or his/her designee will then review the basis for the appeal of the grade. Upon review, the Executive Associate Dean for Medical Educati on and Student Affairs may find that based on process or factual content, there is no basis for a change of an evaluation or grade. Alternatively, the Executive Associate Dean for Medical Education and Student Affairs may recommend that the grade be change d. 44 After review by the Executive Associate Dean for Medical Education and Student Affairs and submission of the reconsidered grade, the student may appeal any decision to the Dean of the medical school. The decision by the Dean shall be final. It should be noted that any and all grade appeals should be conducted in a professional manner by the student involved; that is, demonstrating respectful disagreement with the perspective and judgment used by faculty members. Failure to exhibit appropriate professiona l attitudes may immediately terminate the appeal process and lead to an unprofessional conduct report. End of Phase Required Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCE) As a requirement of the longitudinal Essentials of Patient Care course, students must successfully pass the \"End of Foundation OSCE\" and the \"End of Application OSCE.\" Failure of passing either OSCE requires appropriate remediation and subsequent passing of the OSCE in order to pass the course and progress to the next phase of the cur riculum. National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) Subject and United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Requirements for Medical Students NBME Subject Exam s NBME Subject Examinations are an important part of the educational process, evaluating the performance of a large, representative group of examinees at the same stage of training. These exams are used throughout the curriculum as one part of the evaluation process. Students are required to take NBME Subject Examinations at schedul ed times and locations. Those students granted accommodations for testing must present them to Ms. Sherice Allen -Henry, Assistant Director of Medical Education, a letter from the Department of Accessibility Services each semester outlining the student's sp ecific accommodations. Individual arrangements will be made for the student at each exam in accordance with the specified accommodations. To prevent additional charges, exam orders must be placed at least 22 days prior to the testing date. Therefore, it is important for the Office of Medical Education and Student Affairs (OMESA) to know well in advance the number of students scheduled to test at every exam. Unexcused absences from NBME exams will result in the student being charged for any a dditional costs associated with rescheduling of the examination. For NBME examinations, students MUST test during the exam time (and date) supported by the medical school. A published exam schedule is available through the student portal. To ensure the sec urity of NBME materials and compliance with testing regulations, all NBME subject exams must be administered by trained proctors in an NBME - approved testing site. 45 Arriving Late for an NBME Exam or Missing Examinations It is considered part of professional behavior and the responsibility of the student to arrive on time for scheduled examinations with their Emory cards. Emory designates a Chief Proctor for NBME exams. It is the responsibility of the Chief Proctor and his or her designees to assure that NBME exams are given in strict accordance with NBME policy. As per this policy, a student may be admitted to a testing room up to 30 minutes after the exam has started, provided the student's name is on the check -in roster and the Chief Proctor approves th e late start. Students arriving late for an exam will be expected to end the exam at the same time as other examinees; no extra time will be allotted to compensate for their tardiness. For any student who is more than 30 minutes late for the exam, the NBME must be contacted by the Chief Proctor to seek approval for taking the examination. The Chief Proctor and his or her designees are not required to allow any student to start an exam late if doing so will be excessively disruptive to the other students . United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) The USMLE is an examination series with three complementary steps, the first two of which are graduation requirements for Emory University School of Medicine. Students must successfully pass Step 1 and Step 2 Clinical Knowledge in order to graduate from Emory University School of Medicine. USMLE Step 1 In addition to successful performance during the Foundation Phase, students must In addition to successful performance during the Foundations Phase, students must also earn a passing score, as set by the USMLE, on Step 1 examination of the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) prior to beginning the Application Phase of the Emory University School of Medicine curriculum. With written perm ission from the Executive Associate Dean, a student may begin the Application Phase after having taken the USMLE Step 1 before the test score has been released by the USLME. For the Class of 202 5, USMLE Step 1 must be taken by February 13, 202 3, following completion of the Foundations Phase. Prior to taking USMLE Step 1, all academic requirements of the Foundations Phase, including any necessary remediation, must be completed. For students who do not meet these deadlines, the School cannot guarant ee Application, Discovery and Translation schedules that will permit the student to graduate at the expected time. Any delay in taking USMLE Step 1 must be approved in writing by the Executive Associate Dean for Medical Education and Student Affairs or his /her designee. Students who do not meet these deadlines for completion of academic requirements and for taking and passing USMLE Step 1 may be referred to the Progress and Promotions Committee for action. The following guidelines have been adopted regardin g failure to pass the first administration of Step 1 of the USMLE. 46 A student whose overall academic record warrants promotion, but whose failing Step 1 score is 15 points or less below the passing level has two options to gain promotion into the clinical y ears: Option A - permits re -taking the test at the next available administration. Once the examination has been retaken, the student may begin clinical work. If a passing score is achieved, the student will continue the Application Phase; if a passing scor e is not achieved, the student will cease Application Phase course work and be allowed to retake the examination a 3rd time. It is highly encouraged that such students engage in an intense review of the basic sciences and consider auditing courses prior to re-taking the examination for the third and final time. Option B - grants a year's time during which time the student is encouraged to obtain remedial help and engage in an intense review of the basic sciences, with retake of the examination by February 1st of the following year. If the test is passed at that time, the student then enters th e Application Phase. Any student requesting to delay taking Step 1 must do so in writing to the Executive Associate Dean for Medical Education and Student Affairs, or his/her designee. If granted, the Registrar will be notified in writing and a detailed pl an of how best to support the student in achieving a passing score on USMLE Step 1 will be outlined. Any delay in taking Step 1 may have repercussions on the ability of a student to successfully pass Step 2 and graduate on time. For a student intending to graduate in four years, time taken in delayed entry to the clerkships must be made up later from the time allocated in the curriculum for Step 2 study and residency interviews. For multiple reasons, no student should start the clerkships with a delay of more than three months. Beyond this time, a student should enter the clerkships with the class below. USMLE Step 2 Clinical Knowledge (CK) Students are encouraged to take Step 2 CK as soon as feasible after the Application Phase. At the latest however, st udents must take Step 2 CK by October 1st of their senior year. Passing Step 2 CK is a requirement for graduation. Students will have no more than 3 attempts to pass USMLE Step 2 CK. A student who has three unsuccessful attempts to pass Step 2 CK of the USMLE will be considered for dismissal . 47 PROMOTIONAL GUIDELINES AND THE PROGRESS AND PROMOTIONS COMMITTEE PROMOTIONAL GUIDELINES A student is considered to be achieving satisfactory academic progress as long as he or she passes the sequence of courses and clerkships established by the Curriculum Committee and meets t he performance standards for the 28 SPAs as set by the Executive Curriculum Committee. The assessment of academic progress includes the domains of knowledge, skills, behaviors, and attitudes - as expressed in the form of SPAs. Hence, professionalism is an integral component when considering academic progress. Independent of the final grade, unprofessional behavior may be the sole criterion for which a student may be recommended for a letter of concern, academic warning, academic probation, suspension, dismi ssal, or other sanctions as described throughout this document. Students must be aware that the designation of academic probation or suspension may result in the loss of federal financial aid. PROGRESS AND PROMOTIONS COMMITTEE The Progress and Promotions Committee (P & P) monitors the progress of students during the EUSOM curriculum to ensure that students are performing at an acceptable level to successfully complete their present phase and advance to the next phase of the medical curriculum. I n the process of these reviews, the P & P Chair will make recommendations to the EAD regarding academic advancement and academic sanctions according to the criteria below. The EAD or his/her designee will make the final decision as to whether a student can advance with or without sanctions or if a student will receive an academic sanction. Academic Advancement At the completion of each phase of the EUSOM curriculum, the Registrar will provide the Chair of the P & P with a list of students who are scheduled to advance to the next phase of the academic curriculum. The P & P will then determine if the students meet criteria to advance to the next phase by considering all aspects of a student's performance, including course grades and adherence to the Emory School of Medicine (SOM) Conduct Code, Honor Code and medical school student policies. During the academic year, the P & P will regularly review the progress of all students to assess whether they are making satisfactory progress toward attaining the achievement levels required for promotion to the next phase of the academic curriculum. The P & P members will also determine if students are performing below standards, and may determine that a student should receive an academic sanction according to the criteria outlined below. 48 The Chair of the P & P will inform the EAD of decisions regarding individual student's pending promotion using the following criteria: 1. Adequate Progress: Students with passing grades in all courses/clerkships. 2. Inadequate Progr ess (these students would not be promoted): a) Students with performance below expectations who did not complete the course requirements; b) Students placed on academic probation who did not satisfactorily complete the necessary remediation outlined in their pr obation, or; c) Students who are on suspension. d) For those students who have two or more incompletes in any phase, this should prompt a review at the level of the EAD (or his/her designee) to create an academic plan for the student that will be shared with th e P&P committee at their next meeting. Academic Sanctions A letter of concern will be considered when the P & P has concerns about a student's performance but feel that the concern is not indicative of a pattern of underperformance, or lapses in professional behavior. The following is a non - exhaustive list of reasons why a student would automatically be recommended by the P and P to receive a letter of concern: In the Foundations Phase students will be recommended to receive a letter of concern when they require remediation of two courses. In the Foundations, Application, Discovery or Translation phases, students will be recommended to receive a letter of concern when they have a professionalism or performance issue that is significant and the P & P members are concerned, but do not feel this behavior represents a pattern of poor pe rformance or professionalism problems. An academic warning will be considered when a student's deficiencies are of a more serious nature. The following is a non -exhaustive list of academic difficulties for which a student would automatically be recommended to receive an academic warning: In the Foundations Phase, students will be recommended to receive an academic warning when they have been required to remediate three examinations and the summed credit hours for the three courses is 6 credit hours or more. For the purposes of this determination and those below for academic probation and repetition, an anatomy exam will count as 1 credit hour. During the Application/Translation phases, an academic warning will be recommended when a student is noted to h ave a deficiency in their clinical skills over more than one clerkship or course (e.g., difficulty synthesizing clinical information); or, when a student receives a grade of C in two clerkships/courses. 49 In the Discovery Phase, students will be recommended to receive an academic warning if they are late in turning in their materials to start their Discovery project. In the Foundations, Application, Discovery and Translation phases, a student will be recommended to receive an academic warning if professionalism problems are recurrent over multiple courses or clerkships or a single professionalism transgression that ris es above the level of letter of concern . The entirety of the student's academic performance is factored into decisions by the P & P, and an academic warning may also be recommended if a student had difficulties in the Foundations Phase and continues to str uggle academically in the Application Phase. An academic warning is intended to alert the student that, without improvement, they are in danger of more serious academic sanctions such as probation. Academic probation will be considered when the P & P is co ncerned about a student's performance and, without improvement, the student is in danger of being suspended or dismissed. The following is a non -exhaustive list of academic difficulties for which a student would automatically be recommended to receive an academic probation: In the Foundations Phase, students will be recommended to be placed on academic probation if they are required to remediate four courses and the total credit hours for the four courses is 10 credit hours or more. In the Application, Dis covery Phase or Translation phases, students will be recommended to be placed on academic probation if they receive a D or F in a clerkship or course. The student will not progress in the phase until they have completed remediation of the clerkship or cour se. The period of probation will continue until they have successfully completed the phase. Any student who is required to repeat a phase will be recommended to be placed on academic probation while they are repeating the phase. In any phase, a student wil l be recommended to be placed on academic probation if the student has a professionalism issues that the P & P members judge to be significant and concerning. Academic probation serves three functions: a) It is official documentation that the student is defic ient in areas related to academic performance; b) It provides a pathway and defines a timeline that the student must follow in order to regain good standing. This may include, but is not limited to, remediation, maintaining appropriate performance standards a nd/or adhering to professional expectations; c) It describes the consequences that will result if a student does not meet stated expectations during the period of academic probation. Repetition allows the student to repeat a phase of the curriculum. There are two primary reasons for repetition. 1) Students may voluntarily repeat a phase because of specific events (e.g., health, personal or family issues). This voluntary repetition 50 can only be approved by the EAD or the EAD's designee. In these cases, the student can repeat the phase without any academic penalties. 2) Repetition of a phase is recommended by the P & P, due to a concern that the student has not mastered the academic skills of that phase. The following is a non -exhaustive list of actions for which the P & P would require a student to repeat a phase or course in the curriculum: Required remediation of five or more courses Grade of D or F in the Discovery Phase. Suspension is considered for serious academic issues when the P & P has information regarding the student's academic performance or professional behavior that would support the student benefitting from a period to manage external distractions or other concerns. The period of suspension is recommended by the P & P and will incl ude the conditions for restarting the medical school curriculum. Students who are on academic suspension cannot proceed to the next phase and can only restart their program after the concerns that placed them on suspension have been resolved. Dismissal is considered for either serious breaches in professional conduct or academic concerns including failure of a course and/or clerkship. The following is a non -exhaustive list of actions that would automatically lead to dismissal: During required repetition of a phase: Any student in the Foundations Phase who is required to remediate four courses and the total credit hours for the four courses is 10 credit hours or more. In the Application, Transition or Discovery phases, students who receive a D or an F in any course or course. Two F's, two D's or a D and an F in the initial grades for clerkships in the Application Phase or the same criteria for courses or clerkships in the Translation Phase. The P & P would recommend dismissal for a professionalism violatio n that the P & P members consider gross negligence which could include negligence that, in the mind of the committee, could have led to the death or serious injury of a patient, or behavior in the clinic setting that is grossly inappropriate by the standar ds of the profession. Student Right to Appeal P & P Decisions Students may appeal any academic sanction. If a student wishes to appeal an academic sanction, this request should be presented in writing to the EAD within 14 calendar days of receiving the aca demic sanction from the P & P. The appeal may be based on the following grounds: 51 1. To consider new information, sufficient to alter the decision, or other relevant facts that the person appealing the decision feels the P & P may not have known, but should ha ve taken into account, in considering their academic sanction. 2. To allege a procedural error within the process that led to the P & P decision that may have substantially impacted the fairness of the decision. For appeals of academic sanctions not involving dismissal, the EAD will make the final decision on the appeal and will notify the student of that decision. For appeals from P & P findings that include dismissal, the EAD will convene an ad -hoc review panel of faculty members to consider the appeal. The review panel, at its discretion, can meet with the student, EAD, faculty or chair of the P & P to get clarification of any issues. The review panel reviews the documentation from the P & P and sends its recommendation to the EAD whether or not to uphold th e decision of the P & P. The EAD will ultimately make the final decision on the appeal and will notify the student of that decision. All appeal decisions are final. It should be noted that all appeals should be conducted in a professional manner by the st udent involved; that is, demonstrating respectful disagreement with the perspective and judgment used by faculty members. Failure to exhibit appropriate professional attitudes may immediately terminate the appeal process and lead to an unprofessional condu ct report. Length of Time to Complete Degree The standard MD program at EUSOM takes four years to complete; however, students may apply to postpone graduation for a year if they: 1. Want to obtain another degree (e.g., MPH) 2. Want to spend a year doing a scholarly project (or extended Discovery) 3. Want to take an additional year of formal coursework Students who need time off for extenuating medical/personal issues are advised to take a Leave of Absence (LOA) from medical school (Section 9). Students may be eligible to be enrolled at EUSOM for additional periods for purposes of remediation or completion of degree requirements. Students who plan to obtain the MD degree with no additional degrees or certificates must complete all academic requirements of the MD degree within no more than six academic years from the date of matriculation. Approval for a well - planned fifth year is required. The academic records of students who are approaching the deadline of \"Time to Degree\" for the MD degree will be reviewed by the Registrar and the Progress and Promotions Committee, with enough notice to enable the student to complete the requirement by the end of \"Time to Degree.\" 52 HONORS Alpha Omega Alpha Founded in 1902, Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Medical Society is a professio nal organization that recognizes and advocates for excellence in scholarship and the highest ideals in the profession of medicine. Students are elected based on their embodiment of the AOA mission: Alpha Omega Alpha - dedicated to the belief in the profess ion of medicine we will improve care for all patients by: recognizing high educational achievement honoring gifted teaching encouraging the development of leaders in academia and the community supporting the ideals of humanism and promoting service to others. The National AA Constitution stipulates that up to 20% of a medical school graduation class may be inducted, and up to one -half of the total may be nominated during the junior year. New members are elected by the student members of Alpha Omega Alpha. Elections occur during the spring of junior year and the fall of senior year. The AOA provides chapters the flexibility to value the diversity of qualities that contribute to high quality patient care, leadership, service, and scholarship. Membership to AOA at Emory School of Medicine takes into consideration the following: Students who are in the upper half (50%) of their class in grade point average and/or clinical performance are eligible for nomination. Additional criteria include leadershi p capabilities, ethical standards, fairness in dealing with colleagues, demonstrated professionalism, scholarship and service to the school and community at large. Gold Humanism Honor Society (GHHS) GHHS is a national honor society that honors senior medic al students, residents, role-model physician teachers and other exemplars recognized for demonstrated excellence in clinical care, leadership, compassion and dedication to service. GHHS was created by the Arnold P. Gold Foundation for Humanism in Medicine with the goal to sustain the humanistic passion that motivates physicians throughout their practice. GHHS is comprised of over 25,000 healthcare professionals in training and in practice who have been recognized for practicing patient -centered care. Peer n ominations are reviewed by the Executive Committee of the Emory GHHS Chapter. Up to 15% of a medical school class can be inducted. 53 Graduating with Academic Honors Academic honors are determined by a School of Medicine faculty committee. The designation of students graduating cum laude, magna cum laude, and summa cum laude is based on a combination of grade point average and other academic accomplishments, including Discovery and other academic pursuits, inclusive of work done as part of dual degre e work or external fellowships. REQUIRED SUPPLIES Laptops Laptops are required of all Emory University School of Medicine students. Laptops must meet technical specifications and have the required software programs installed.

Graduat e-level students are required to participate in two such experiences annually: one is a presentation, the other is a written reflection or case review. Each conference session is approximately 1 hour followed by dinner and a second session of the same leng th. In each session, there are three 10 -15 minute student presentations in which students highlights a representative case or clinical experience with differential diagnosis followed by presenting the background disease pathophysiology, and one or more re levant research articles. The faculty mentor completes each of the sessions by describing his or her own career path, hurdles overcome in his/her career, or an interesting, informative issue regarding training, education and/or career choice. This course is offered for 1 credit hour and is graded on an S/U basis based on participation and attendance. The course is directed by Holly Bauser -Heaton, MD, PhD, an interventional pediatric cardiologist and physician scientist at Sibley Heart Center at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. 109 MDPH 799R MD/PhD Clinical Joanna Bonsall, MD/PhD This course prepares MD/PhD students for the transition from graduate school to clinical clerkships. The course involves patient con tact at Grady Memorial Hospital and Emory University Midtown Hospital and is directed toward refreshing students in physical examination, patient presentations, generation of a differential diagnosis, and its use in preparing the History &Physical and trea tment plan. This course covers common diseases seen on the wards and the associated clinical presentations, disease processes, and patient management. MDPH 505R through MDPH 670R, 3-12 credits; 601R Required, Letter grade Course Director: The course director varies as a student and faculty member connect based on the students' research interest. There is no course director assigned to each of these research lab courses. Research rotations allow MD/PhD students to explore mu ltiple laboratories in their chosen departments before they commit to their dissertation advisor and project. Students complete necessary training (laboratory and/or radiation safety; animal care training) at the start of the rotation. During rotations, st udents become familiar with the primary research literature and laboratory techniques of their chosen field and participate in laboratory meetings and departmental colloquia. Before each rotation, the student prepares a proposal. At the end of the rotation , the student completes a rotation summary, and the sponsoring faculty completes an evaluation of the student's performance. All documents are reviewed by the MD/PhD Program Directors before a grade is assigned.

A professional, physical therapy curriculum was offered first by the Division of Physical Therapy in 1975 as a po st baccalaureate certificate program and then changed to a professional level, master of physical therapy degree program in 1983 and to the doctor of physical therapy degree in 2001. The Division of Physical Therapy includes educational, research, and clin ical programs. The mission of the division is presented below with objectives and curriculum information for the doctor of physical therapy degree program. Accreditation The Doctor of Physical Therapy program is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation in Physical Therapy Education (CAPTE). CAPTE is an accrediting agency that is nationally rec ognized by the US Department of Education (USDE) and the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA). Emory University is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges to award associate, baccalaureate, master's, education specialist's , doctorate, and professional degrees. Contact the Commission on Colleges at 1866 Southern Lane, Decatur, Georgia 30033 -4097 or call 404.679.4500 for questions about the accreditation of Emory. Mission The mission of the Division of Physical Therapy is to cultivate well -being of individuals in local and global communities through exemplary leadership in physical therapy education, discovery, and service. The Doctor of Physical Therapy degree program is designed to: 1. Provide study and competence in promoting optimal human movement and function based on the biological, behavioral, physical, and medical sciences, including: a. Understanding and applying concepts and principles of movement science. b. Using critical thinking and problem so lving in planning, implementing, and assessing both clinical and scientific practices. 2. Prepare proactive leaders in the multifaceted roles of clinician, educator, researcher, administrator, and consultant in individual, group, and community contexts. 3. Model and instill the values that promote professionalism and caring. 4. Facilitate student commitment to independent thinking and lifelong learning and to student realization of the intrinsic rewards of these attributes. Students obtain basic competenci es essential for physical therapy practice and for developing leadership skills within the profession. In addition, students in the DPT program conduct a research project and study in advanced specialized areas. The practical application of physical therapy skills is based on a concept of health care with three major characteristics. First, the welfare of the client is the basis of 112 health care. Second, health care is dynamic, and changes are constantly being made to incorporate advances in me thods and in delivery in care. The scope of health care today includes the promotion of health and an emphasis on the rights and responsibilities of clients. Third, the quality of health care is dependent on the process of delivery of service in the health care system and the extent to which individual needs of the patient/client are met. Optimal functional movement is the goal of physical therapy. Students develop competencies in the professional program using the problem - solving process to demonstrate ex pertise in applying a theoretical framework of basic, behavioral, social, and medical sciences as the basis for his/her practice of physical therapy. Competency is demonstrated by: 1. Using the interpersonal communication process with patients, healthcare providers and staff; including an active recognition of the rights and dignity of the individual in planning and administering programs of care. 2. Using the teaching -learning process in interactions with patients, healthcare providers and staff. 3. Exami ning and evaluating patients, and establishing an appropriate plan of care. 4. Providing appropriate therapeutic services. 5. Participating in the administrative responsibilities of a clinical physical therapist. 6. Using the basic principles of research in the critical analysis of concepts and findings generated by self and others. 7. Consulting with others in providing comprehensive care. The educational program promotes attainment of the foregoing competencies in the following ways. First, the problem -solving approach is incorporated throughout the curriculum and used to identify and affect the needs of the client and the health care sys tem. The physical therapist identifies and resolves health care problems through program planning that relates to an individual client, a specialty area, and the total health care system. This problem solving requires consideration of the theoretical frame work of the basic, medical, and psychosocial sciences, in addition to use of process skills relating to the practice of physical therapy. In each of the above contexts, the physical therapist identifies a need and alternative program plans for meeting that need, selects the most appropriate plan, implements the plan, and then evaluates and modifies the plan as necessary. The client, the physical therapist, other health professionals and the health care system all are involved and must be considered in solvi ng specific movement problems. Second, interpersonal communications, including an active recognition of the rights and dignity of the client, is emphasized in all aspects of the program. Study and practice in reflective listening occurs initially. Then t hese concepts and skills are applied throughout all classroom and clinical experiences. Opportunities to practice interpersonal skills with patients from multiple cultures are embedded throughout the curriculum. Third, the teaching/learning process is dem onstrated and applied in all contexts, especially patient and colleague education. Also, the learning process is presented 113 as it applies to the student's own learning, both during and after completion of the program. Continued learning is stressed as essen tial to professional development and evidence -based practice . Fourth, the area of expertise of the physical therapist is the movement function or dysfunction of patients/clients and/or the use of therapeutic approaches to beneficially affect function. Ge nerally, physical therapists are specialists in motor behavior, including the neuromusculoskeletal, pulmonary and cardiovascular, and cognitive systems. Basic content areas, which provide theoretical basis in the medical sciences, are: 1) Human growth and development, 2) Normal structure and function, 3) Disturbances in homeostasis as manifested by various pathophysiology, 4) Related medical and physical therapy management, 5) Ethics, professionalism and health services management. Knowledge and skills in these areas are naturally sequenced, i.e., birth to aging, function to dysfunction, and general to specific. Organization of information related to the medical and clinical sciences is based on the homeostatic model and clinical problems present ed by the patient/client as a result of disturbance of homeostasis. Accordingly, content is organized by clusters of clinical problems rather than by medical discipline or physical therapy technique. Also, integration of knowledge from the past, to present , to future is stressed. Learning of specific content areas is integrated, i.e., each content area with others, classroom experiences with clinical experiences, and content areas with the process skills. Fifth, the scientific inquiry process is applied in evidence -based practice and clinical research. Evidence -based practice underlies the clinical courses. Working in small groups with a faculty mentor, students complete an original research project. Finally, in addition to skills discussed above, administ ration, and consultation are observed and practiced by the student in both the clinic and the classroom. The problem solving, teaching -learning, and interpersonal processes are used as the student masters concepts and strategies associated with each area. Also, the student plans, implements, and evaluates a project that iis designed to meet the need of a specific administrative or consultative agenda or clinical or community setting. The doctor of physical therapy degree curriculum is approved and accredit ed by the Commission on Accreditation in Physical Therapy Education (CAPTE). , CAPTE is an accrediting agency that is nationally recognized by the US Department of Education (USDE) and the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA). http://www.capte online.org. Graduates are eligible to take the licensing examination required for the practice of physical therapy. 114 FACULTY Program Director: George Fulk, PT, PhD, FAPTA Professor s S. Blanton, E.

Visit the Master of Arts in Bioethics dual degrees website for more information. CREDIT POLICY FOR PRIOR EDUCATION AND TRAINING No credits from prior education and training may be applied to the Doctor of Physical Therapy program. ENROLLMENT POLICY To be enrolled in the program, students must have submitted an application, completed an interview and been selected for admission t o the program by the Admissions Committee. Students must also have completed all prerequisites and obtained an undergraduate degree prior to enrollment in the program. ATTENDANCE Due to the professional nature of the curriculum, and the types of activi ties and related content in each course, attendance at all classes is expected of each student. If you are ill and/or cannot attend, please contact faculty teaching the classes by email or call the office at 404 -712-5660 and leave word (we have voice mail for your convenience). If emergencies arise and you have knowledge of pending absences, you should discuss such absences with the program director, your advisor and/or 29 individual course instructors in order to make arrangements to make up your academic work. Most of the time, re -creation of a seminar, discussion, laboratory experiences, or clinical experience is not possible. This policy also applies to classes the day before or the day after vacations or holidays. NOTE: IN INSTANCES OTHER THAN UNFORESE EN ILLNESS OR EMERGENCY, PERMISSION FOR ABSENCE FROM CLASS MUST BE OBTAINED BY EMAIL, AT LEAST TWO WEEKS IN ADVANCE FROM EACH INSTRUCTOR. Failure to meet these responsibilities may seriously compromise your academic standing. Also, the faculty is not respo nsible for providing information or learning experiences in cases of student absence . Punctuality In addition to attendance, it is considered part of professional duty and is the responsibility of the student to arrive on time for classes, small group ses sions, clinical rotations, scheduled examinations, and all other events related to the DPT program. 121 Student Attendance/Absence During Clinical Affiliations The design of the clinical education experience promotes development, practice, and assessment of the student's ability to provide physical therapy services in a variety of settings. One critical aspect of the professional responsibility for service provision is being present and on time. The policy presented below is consistent with expe ctations in an employment situation. 1) WORK WEEK: The student's schedule will be determined by the service needs of the clinical site. For the most part, it is similar to the clinical instructor's (CI) schedule in terms of hours/day; days of the week sched uled, etc. No assumptions should be made about working 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday. The student's workday will continue until responsibilities are met. 2) HOLIDAYS: Clinical services in many settings are provided on holidays. No assumptions should be made about having a holiday \"off\". If the CI is scheduled to provide services on a holiday, the student may be scheduled to work. Student status does not allow special p rivileges regarding holiday work. Also, the day after a holiday (e.g., the Friday after Thanksgiving) may not be a holiday. 3) ABSENCES: The ONLY PERMISSABLE REASONS for absence are personal illness or death of a family member. If the student is ill and cann ot work, or called away for funeral services, the Clinic Coordinator of Clinical Education (CCCE)/CI must be notified immediately. It is your responsibility to find out if the facility has a specific policy that must be followed in case of an unforeseen ab sence. For example, one may require a phone call to the CCCE and another may prefer one directly to the CI. The time off MUST be made up and this scheduling is at the discretion of the CI. In certain instances, during a long -term internship only, if only one day is missed and the student's clinical performance is meeting criteria, the CI may decide that a make -up day is not necessary. The student's clinical education advisor, Patricia Bridges (Director of Clinical Education - DCE), or Tami Phillips or Donn a Smith (Assistant Directors of Clinical Education - ADCE), must be advised by the student of any absence due to illness or bereavement, and the related make -up plan. The student is responsible for providing this information to their clinical education adv isor within two days of the absence. Under no circumstances should the DCE/ADCE find out about absences after the clinical ends. 4) SPECIAL REQUESTS: Clinic absences should not occur except as described in Section #3. However, if there is a special circumst ance, the student must submit a request in writing to the DCE or ADCE PRIOR to discussing it with the CCCE/CI. The DCE/ADCE will determine if the special request merits further consideration and may give approval to negotiate this special need with the CC CE/CI. Approval from the DCE/ADCE is only permission to discuss the request with the CCCE/CI, not approval for the proposal. The CCCE must be consulted in addition to the CI regarding special requests. Approval is at the discretion of the CCCE/CI, and if obtained, the student must communicate the result to the DCE/ADCE within two days of the 122 approval. Time away from the clinic MUST be made up and this scheduling is at the discretion of the CI. 5) If the special request involves a professional development a ctivity and if only one day of clinic is missed, the CI may determine the necessity of making up the missed day if the student's performance is meeting criteria. 6) Compliance with this policy is represented on the clinical evaluation form in the behaviors f or administration competency - \"Adhere to school/facility policies and procedures.\" 7) Any questions about the policy and related procedures should be addressed to the DCE or ADCE. STANDARDS OF PROGRESS Academic Regulation regarding program completion: 1. Successful completion of a residency totaling 9 semesters, which includes academic study and 30 weeks of full -time clinical education. 2. Completion of all semester hours of work with an overall average of B. A student must have a cumulative grade point average of 3.0 or higher in order to graduate from the program. 3. A grade of B or above must be earned in each individual course. Note : Physical Therapy requires mastery of both academic and psychomotor clinical skills, therefore, an exception to this rule exists in the following clinical courses: Fundamentals of Measurement (DPT 710), Introduction to Therapeutic Interventions (DPT 740), General Medical Conditions (DPT 755), Musculoskeletal Rehabilitation (DPT 800), Pediatric Rehabilitation (DPT 815) and Adult Neurorehabilitation (DPT 810), where ALL practical examinations must be passed with a minimum score of 80% to successfully pass th e course, regardless of the student's cumulative average for that course. If a student fails a practical examination, he/she could be offered a retest at the discretion of the course instructor(s). If the student fails the final practical, the retest is of fered no more than 4 weeks after the initial practical examination. If the student fails the retest, this constitutes failure of the course, and at that point, the student is placed on academic probation. Any subsequent examination is considered a remediat ion. In addition, students need to attain a cumulative average of 80% or better overall in the written examinations within General Medical Conditions (DPT 755), Musculoskeletal Rehabilitation (DPT 800), Pediatric Rehabilitation (DPT 815) and Adult Neuroreh abilitation (DPT 810). 4. Students may continue in a course if a single written examination score falls below the minimal score of 80%, but the average examination score for the entire course must be at or above the minimal score to pass the course. A st udent who scores less than 80% on any examination must contact the course director to discuss areas of deficiency. Failure to do so will negatively affect any potential 123 decision for future remediation opportunities. 5. Successful completion of each clini cal rotation as defined in course materials. 6. Progression through the curriculum is dependent upon successful completion of all courses in sequence and upon recommendation by the Faculty each semester. Any changes in sequence must be approved by the Fa culty. All grades are determined by the following criterion -based system: 90-100% A 80-89% B 70-79% C 60-69% D 59% or below F Academic Regulation regarding remediation: The student who achieves a final course grade below the minimal passing scor e of 80% may qualify for remediation. Should a decision be made to provide an additional opportunity, the student will be placed on academic probation. The course instructor then completes a Record of Academic Probation Recommendation Form. (see section on Academic Deficiency and Probation). In regards to remediation opportunities, the following policies are observed: 1. Remediation opportunities are offered at the discretion of the course director. 2. To qualify for remediation, the student MUST show evidenc e of having contacted the course director during the course to discuss any performance that failed to meet minimal standards. The course instructor completes a Record of Academic Deficiency Counseling Form whenever the student is counseled regarding defic iencies in academic work. (see section on Academic Deficiency and Probation). 3. This policy for remediation will also apply to students who fail to pass a practical examination in any course that includes practical examinations. 4. Remediation of a course may involve re -taking a written examination, an oral or practical examination, or the completion of a remediation project. 5. All remediation activities must be completed within the timeframe defined by the course director, and befor e the end of the following semester. 6. Students will receive a course grade of \"IP,\" \"In Progress,\" until successful remediation is completed. 124 7. For remediation to be considered successful, the student must attain the minimal passing score of 80% on the remed iation activity (see #4 above). As a consequence of having to remediate, the highest grade attainable for the course will be a \"B.\" All questions regarding examination and grading should be addressed directly through a meeting with the student and the course director. 8. A student is allowed only one opportunity beyond the initial attempt to satisfactorily complete the requirements for a given course. Students who fail a remediation examination will fail that course. 9. Students must pass all courses to progre ss in the program. Students who fail a course must repeat and pass the course before progressing in the program. a. Permission to repeat a course is contingent upon approval of the faculty. b. Repeating a course will require the student to take a leave of absen ce for one year, as the sequence of the program is inflexible and progression is contingent upon passing all subsequent coursework. c. A student who is offered the opportunity to repeat a course will be required to attend all concurrent coursework and complet e all examinations and assignments, even though these courses were already successfully passed. This is done in the best interest of the student, as course information is updated each year. 10. There are concurrent and cumulative limits to the number of oppor tunities offered to a student for re -examination to meet criteria. There is a limit, per semester, to the number of courses in which a student is allowed to be re - examined. There is also a limit to the cumulative total of course re - examinations that are al lowed during the program. a. No more than TWO course re -examinations are allowed per semester. b. No more than a cumulative total of FOUR course re -examinations are allowed throughout the entire program. c. Cumulative totals to the number of remediation opportunities continue to apply to students who must repeat coursework. 125 Consequences for Violation of an Academic Regulation A student may be placed on academic probation or dismissed from the program at any time in the curriculum when academ ic or other performance requirements are not met. If any one of the above conditions are not met or exceeded, the student situation will be first brought before the Academic Affairs Committee for consideration of dismissal from the program. The student w ill be invited to make a statement at that time. Dismissal from the program may result if a student: 1. Fails a repeated course. 2. Exceeds the total number of remediation opportunities per semester or per program. 3. Violates the Honor Code. The recommendation of the Academic Affairs Committee is based on the overall performance of the student within a specific course, as well as throughout the overall program of study. The recommendation of the Academic Affairs Committee is brought to the Divisi on of Physical Therapy Faculty for the final decision. The full-time faculty will meet in session to consider the recommendations of the Academic Affairs Committee. If a majority of the full -time Physical Therapy Faculty votes to dismiss the student, the Director of the Division of Physical Therapy will make a recommendation to the Dean of the School of Medicine that the student be dismissed. The recommendation will specify the reasons for dismissal, including the regulation or standard violated. Should t he student wish to appeal this decision, a formal appeal in writing must be first sent to the Director of the Division of Physical Therapy within 48 hours of notification of dismissal. Appeals will be reviewed and voted on by the Faculty. Subsequent app eals will be directed directly to the Dean of the School of Medicine. The Dean will make any final decisions regarding dismissal of the student. COURSE EVALUATIONS Students are required to fill out course and instruction evaluations for every course (including clinical science and clinical research). The evaluation forms are opened on Blackboard two weeks prior to the end of the semester and remain open for two weeks after the end of the semester. Obtaining feedback from students is extremely important t o the development and continued excellence of the program and of the faculty.

Jury Service In most states, including Georgia, enrollment as a full -time stude nt in an accredited educational program is a valid reason to be excused from jury duty. In the event that a student will not be excused from a jury summons or jury duty, then the student must request to be absent as soon as jury service notification is rec eived. A copy of the communication from the jurisdiction issuing the jury summons must accompany the request to be absent. There will be no grade penalties for a jury duty absence. However, clinical rotation assignments and the 2500 -clinical -hour minimum m ust still be met in order to be eligible for graduation. Bereavement Bereavement leave may be granted for attendance at a funeral or comparable service; related travel time; and time necessary to conduct arrangements or other related, necessary business. Absence may be approved for up to five days per occurrence for an immediate family member identified as parent, grandparent, step-parent, legal guardian, parent -in-law, spouse, same -sex domestic partner, child, step -child, grandchild, legal ward, or siblin g. A request to be absent must be submitted as soon as dates for the leave are known. Approval for this leave, including length of time for the absence, is solely at the discretion of Program Directors. The amount of time granted depends on the relations hip the individual has with the deceased, the individual's level of responsibility for arrangements, travel time needed, and other relevant circumstances. Should additional time be required in excess of bereavement leave, the student may request personal days. Mission Trips, Service Projects, and Associated Travel The Anesthesiology Program encourages students to participate in service activities at home and abroad. However, the Program does not currently have any elective rotations in mission or service or any rotations outside the United States. The Program will support - within the guidelines below - senior students who wish to personally participate in mission trips or service projects while they are enrolled in the Anesthesiology Program at Emory University. No later than 90 days prior to a mission trip or service project, the student must apply for leave for the project by submitting complete information on that project: Sponsoring organization Sponsoring physician Complete name, contact information, and specialty of the physician who will be present during the service or mission project 159 Location of the project Dates of the project, including travel dates The student's role in the project A student who is personally participating in a mission trip or service project must be aware of the following limitations: Students are NOT covered by Emory's malpractice/liability insurance. Students are NOT covered by Emory's travel insurance. Emory's needle stick policy will NOT apply. The needle stick hotline may respond to a student regardless of where they are, but Emory will not provide service to students who are serving at a facility with which Emory University does not have a clinical rotation contract. The student should c onfirm that his/her student health insurance or personal health insurance is in effect and will cover injuries/illness sustained during the project and will cover medevac from the location of the mission trip or service project back to an appropriate medic al facility in the United States. The student will be responsible for making claims through the student health policy or his/her private insurance policy for injury or illness sustained during the mission trip or service project and for medevac. Any stude nt undertaking a project abroad is encouraged to contact EHC TravelWell to be certain that all vaccinations and other medical preparations are complete well before time for out -of-country travel. Clinical hours credit for time and service on the project m ay be awarded if the following requirements are met: The physician on the project is an Emory faculty member or the physician has been pre -approved by Emory University, which will require the physician submitting a CV. Learning objectives are in place pri or to the project. The physician confirms that the learning objectives were met during the project. Violations of Policy Any violation of policies governing absences or requests to be absent will result in a grade penalty. For each violation of policy, tw o points will be deducted from that semester's clinical grade. Deducted points are cumulative for the duration of the degree program; ie, deducted points carry over from semester to semester. Example In fall semester, one violation results in two penalty points. The student, who otherwise would have had a clinical grade of 89 (B) now has a clinical grade of 87 (still a B). In spring semester there are no violations, but in summer semester this student has two violations and receives four penalty po ints. Her summer clinical grade would have been 84 (B) but now is 78 (C); ie, 84 - 4 [new penalty points] - 2 [existing penalty points]. Serious violations or repeat violations represent misconduct and may result in probation or dismissal from the Anesth esiology Program. 160 Timekeeping System The Program uses a timekeeping system to monitor attendance at clinical sites. All students are required to clock in and clock out each day that they have a clinical assignment scheduled. The student must clock in and out from the designated telephone at their assigned clinical site. Allowing another person to clock in or out of the system for a student or clocking in or out for another student represents misconduct and is grounds for immediate suspension from clin ical activity. If a student neglects to clock in or clock out or uses a phone other than the designated phone at their assigned clinical site, then he/she must submit an Attendance Exception Report within 48 hours. Failure to submit an Attendance Exceptio n Report will result in loss of clinical hours for the day for which the report is missing. STANDARDS OF PROGRESS GRADING AND REPORTING Lecture Course Grades Each course instructor is responsible for calculating, assigning, and reporting grades for his/her course. If a student has a question about the grade assigned for a course, the student should email his/her question to that course's instructor. Laboratory and Simulation Course Grades The laboratory faculty and HPS faculty are responsible for as sessing student performance and for calculating, assigning, and reporting grades for labs and for HPS. Student performance in labs and HPS is based on attendance, including tardiness and continued presence preparation for the scheduled exercise understand ing and applying procedures understanding and operating equipment understanding and applying principles of physiology, pharmacology, monitoring, and clinical methods desire to learn participation conduct Conference Course Grades The conference director is responsible for assessing student performance and for calculating, assigning, and reporting grades for conferences. Student performance in conferences is based on attendance, including tardiness and continued presence understanding topics desire to learn 161 participation conduct Seminar Course Grades The seminar director is responsible for assessing student performance and for calculating, assigning, and reporting grades for seminars, including small discussion groups. Student performance in semi nars is based on attendance, including tardiness and continued presence preparation quality of presentations understanding topics desire to learn participation conduct Clinical Course Grades Clinical anesthesia training begins during the first week and continues through the last week of the degree program. Clinical anesthesia training is a continuum during which evaluations occur daily, weekly, and monthly - depending upon the evaluation tools . Clinical Evaluations Evaluation of student performance in clinical includes but is not limited to attendance, including tardiness and continued presence knowledge skills multitasking problem solving completion of tasks desire to learn participation conduct overall performance A clinical evaluation is mandatory for every day that a student has a clinical assignment - with certain exceptions (eg, Pain Service). The clinical evaluation system utilizes an electronic evaluation instrument w hich transmits evaluation data to the Program. Failure to submit clinical evaluation data within seven (7) calendar days of a clinical assignment will result in no clinical hours being awarded for each clinical day for which the clinical evaluation data ar e missing. Clinical Attendance The Program uses Chronotek to monitor each student's attendance on every clinical assignment and clinical hours reported on all clinical assignments. Each student must use the designated phone at the clinical site to sign i n and sign out of the Chronotek system. 162 Failure to use the designated clinical site phone will result in no clinical hours being posted for the clinical day for which the designated phone was not used. Within a semester, every three days of failure to use the designated clinical site phone will result in reduction of that semester's clinical grade (Anes 561 or Anes 660) by one letter grade. Reconciliation of Assignments, Attendance, and Evaluation Data Each student's attendance and clinical evaluations mu st match the clinical assignment made by the Program. Assignments, attendance, and evaluation data are reviewed during each semester. Repeat submission problems or inconsistencies or irregularities in clinical time and/or evaluation data represents miscond uct and may be grounds for probation or dismissal. Key Clinical Evaluations Students may be assessed by key clinical evaluators at each clinical rotation site. Input from these practitioners will be incorporated into clinical grades and into the informati on provided to the Clinical Review Committee to assist in determining the student's readiness to progress to the next clinical level. Comprehensive Examinations Comprehensive examinations are an integral part of clinical grading. Clinical Grades in the First Year Clinical course grades in the first year (ANES 561A,B,C) are derived from daily evaluations of clinical performance; performance on comprehensive examinations; participation and performance in Small Discussion Groups; and performance in Clinica l Concepts Conferences, including quizzes. Weighting for each grade component varies by semester (table below). Small discussion groups may not occur every semester, and weighting will be adjusted accordingly. Semester Clinical Evaluation Comprehensive Examinations Sm Group Discussions Clinical Concepts Conference Fall 22 68 7 3 Spring 32 58 7 3 Summer 40 50 7 3 Clinical Grades in the Senior Year Clinical course grades in the senior year (ANES 660A,B ,C) are derived from two components of daily evaluations. A grid score (50%) comes from preceptors' scoring evaluation questions in the electronic evaluation instrument. A comments score (50%) is derived from additional feedback provided by preceptors. Com ments are scored by a Program faculty committee based on each student's aggregation of feedback during the semester; comment scoring is blinded to the students' names. A rubric is used to assign a score for the comments; eg, an 88 is assigned to comments t hat reflect a student is performing satisfactorily and meeting expectations. 163 Assignment of Clinical Grades The Anesthesiology Program reserves the right to have clinical grades assigned by the Program Directors and Program faculty base d upon their review of a student's clinical evaluations, clinical comments, and communications from clinical sites and preceptors. Conduct issues may override the grade assignment that would otherwise have been made based solely on calculation of daily clinical evaluation data. The Program makes clinical assignments based on each clinical site's requirements pertaining to day, evening, night, and weekend rotations and call. Variance from the assignment must be submitted to the Program on an Alternate Clinical Attendance Form . If a student changes the format of a rotation without approved alternate attendance, the student's letter grade in clinical anesthesia for that semester will be decreased by one letter grade. GRADING Grade Scale The following letter grades, their indication of performance, and assigned quality points are used by the Anesthesiology Program: A excellent 4 B above average 3 C average 2 D below average 1 F failing 0 - no course credit or residence credit W withdrawal without penalty 0 - no course credit or residence credit WF withdrawal while failing 0 - no course credit or residence credit S satisfactory U unsatisfactory 0 - use restricted to certain courses IP in progress I incomplete The notation IP for in progress will be submitted to the Registrar's Office when work in a course extends beyond one semester. The notation I for incomplete will be submitted when course work, examinations, or clinical assignments have not been satisfactorily completed within a semeste r. If the course work and/or examinations have not been completed within 10 days of the beginning of the next semester, a final grade of F will be assigned. An incomplete will continue for any ANES 660 course until the clinical hours target has been met fo r the semester in which the incomplete was assigned. Grade Reporting Grades for basic science courses are reported to the Registrar by each basic science department. Grades for Anesthesiology Program courses are reported to the University Registrar from the Program Office. Course grades usually are available to each student within a week following the close of each semester. Students may log into the University OPUS system and view their grades reported to the Registrar's office at any time . 164 Transcripts Official transcripts are available from the Office of the Registrar. The Anesthesiology Program does not provide transcripts to students or to third parties. Academic Counseling If at any time during a semester, a student receives a grade of D or lower on an examination or has a projected grade of D or lower in any course, then that student is expected to meet with the course director to review course work and overall performance in the educational program. University Counseling Services Complete information about Emory's counseling services can be found at www.emory.edu. Continuation, Interruption, Termination of the MMSc Degree Program Continuation The faculty's judgement of a student's suitability and fitness for continuation in the Program is based upon academic performance, clinical competence, and standards of conduct appropriate for a health professional, including trustworthiness; responsibility to duty; appropriate interaction with patients, patients' families, and other healthcare professionals; and professional demeanor. Advancement The Progress, Promotions, and Review Committee reviews the grades and academic conduct of each st udent during each semester. The Clinical Review Committee reviews the clinical performance and clinical conduct of each student during each semester. Throughout the degree program, each student's advancement to the next semester must be approved by the Pr ogress, Promotions, and Review Committee and the Clinical Review Committee. Continuation Requirements In order to continue in the Master of Medical Science Program to the next semester or to graduate from the Master of Medical Science Program at the end o f the degree program, a student must Receive a letter grade of C or above in every course; AND Exhibit satisfactory clinical performance as judged by the faculty of the MMSc Program; AND Have conduct and ethical behavior that in the judgement of the MMSc Program faculty meet those standards essential for an anesthesiologist assistant practitioner. 165 Dismissal If a student meets any of the following criteria within a semester, then that student shall be dismissed from the Master of Medical Science Prog ram: Receipt of two or more grades below C; OR Receipt of one D or one F following return from a leave of absence for academic reasons; OR Clinical performance judged to be unsatisfactory by the Clinical Review Committee and endorsed by the faculty of the MMSc Program; OR Conduct or ethical behavior that, in the judgement of the MMSc Program faculty, does not meet the standards essential fo r an anesthesiologist assistant practitioner. OR Failure to complete course work or clinical assignments. First Year: Leave of Absence for Academic Reasons The didactic curriculum of the Master of Medical Science Program is tightly integrated and scheduled for the four continuous semesters of the first year. The senior clinical year of the educational program is comprised of clinical rotations throughout the United States. Anesthesiology didactic courses and basic science didactic courses are scheduled on an annual basis. All first -year didactic courses must be successfully completed before a student may advance to the senior year. If a first -year student rec eives a D in any course, then that student may be eligible for a leave of absence for academic reasons. In order for the student meeting the above criteria to be offered a leave of absence for academic reasons, then that student must complete all course w ork in the semester in which he/she meets the criteria for the leave of absence for academic reasons, and the leave of absence for academic reasons must be approved by the Progress, Promotion, and Review Committee. If approved, the leave of absence will b egin effective at the end of the semester in which the student receives the D. The student may then return to the Master of Medical Science Program at the beginning of the following academic year to restart the educational program. 166 If the student elects t o return to the Master of Medical Science Program, then he/she must meet the Program's requirements for continuation. The alternative to leave of absence for academic reasons is dismissal from the Program. Financial Aid Implications Within three days of taking a leave of absence as described above, the student must contact the Financial Aid Office of Emory University and make all necessary arrangements concerning financial aid and repayment of same. Applicable rules and regulations are available from the Financial Aid Office. The student should contact Emory's Office of Financial Aid for complete information and to obtain specific answers to questions regarding financial aid and leave of absence. Senior Year: Probation and Extension of the Educational Pro gram For senior students, receipt of a D in any clinical series (ANES 660A,B,C; ANES 680A,B,C) will result in probation and automatic extension of the educational program by one semester. In order to continue in the MMSc Program beyond the semester in whic h the D was received or in order to graduate from the MMSc Program, then that student must meet the following requirements: Receive a letter grade of C or above in all subsequent clinical courses (ANES 660A,B,C; ANES 680A,B,C); AND Maintain a semester G PA of 2.0 or higher in all subsequent semesters; AND Have an overall GPA or 2.0 or higher at the end of all subsequent semesters; AND Meet all other Program requirements for continuation. Academic Appeals A student may appeal a course grade within 10 days of the University's posting of the grade. The appeal must be in writing to the Progress, Promotions, and Review Committee and must include the basis for appeal. The decision of the Progress, Promotions, a nd Review Committee is final in the matter unless the grade will result in the dismissal of the student. If the Progress, Promotions, and Review Committee's decision is to the uphold a grade will result in dismissal, then the student may appeal that the C ommittee's decision within 10 days to the Executive Associate Dean for Medical Education and Student Affairs of the Emory University School of Medicine.

The GC Admissions Match has been established to place applicants into positions in masters -level genetic counseling programs that are acc redited by the Accreditation Council for Genetic Counseling (ACGC). The Match uses a process that takes into account both applicants ' and programs ' preferences. 181 All applicants must first register for the Match with NMS before applying to participating genetic counseling graduate programs. How Does the Match Work? At the conclusion of all program interviews, both applicants and programs will submit ranked lists of preferred placements to NMS according to deadlines posted on the NMS website. The binding results of the Match will be released to both applicants and programs simultaneously in late April. Please visit the NMS website to register for the match, review detailed information about the matching process, and to view a demonstra tion of how the matching algorithm works. IMPORTANT DATES Application Open Dates: September 1, 2022 Application Deadline : December 16, 2022, to be considered eligible for Fall 2023 admission Application Fee : $75 - The fee must be paid by credit card when yo u submit your application by the deadline of December 16, 2022, to be considered for an interview. Transcripts : Official transcripts (electronic preferred) for past semesters/degrees must be received by the application deadline. For the current semester, at minimum, unofficial transcripts must be received by 1/6/23. Official transcripts are required by 1/24/23 to be eligible for an interview offer. CREDIT POLICY FOR PRIOR EDUCATION AND TRAINING The GC Training program does not award academic cre dit towards the degree for courses taken on a non -credit basis. The GC Training program will consider academic course credit for transfer on a case -by-case basis if: o The course was completed within the last 3 years o The course was obtained at the graduate l evel in an accredited institution o The student received a grade of \"B\" or better o The syllabus is available for review and approval by the Program Directors and instructor of the equivalent Emory program course Credit will not be granted for clinical geneti c counseling experiences occurring outside of the Emory GC Training Program. The GC Training Program utilizes the Carnegie system in determining course, clinical, and focus internship credit allocation. 182 ENROLLMENT POLICY A new class of 10 students is admitted each year. To be enrolled in the program, students must have submitted an application, completed an interview and been selected for admission to the program by the Admissions Committee. Students must also have completed all prerequisit es and obtained an undergraduate degree prior to enrollment in the program. ATTENDANCE Attendance at all scheduled classes is required, unless the course instructor and Program Directors have approved alternative arrangements. Attendance is mandatory f or all small group sessions, scheduled department case conferences and grand rounds. Attendance is mandatory for all examinations, both written and oral. Students are responsible for being present prior to the beginning of all examinations. Exams will begi n ON TIME; students who arrive after an examination has begun may be refused admission to the examining room, thus jeopardizing their course grade. Attendance on clinical rotation on the scheduled dates and time is mandatory and monitored carefully. Trans portation and alternate childcare arrangements are the responsibility of the student. Under no circumstances may a student leave a clinical rotation without prior approval from the program director and designated clinical supervisor. Unless there is physic al danger such a departure will be treated as abandonment of the rotation and subject to sanctions by the Program Directors, which may include dismissal from the program. All students are required to complete eight (8) clinical rotations. At least seven ( 7) of these must be Emory arranged and take place in the greater Atlanta area. Students are allowed to make arrangements for one out of town/non -Emory arranged clinical rotation during Summer II with the approval of the Program Directors. Students are exp ected to adhere to the Focus Internship scheduled participation as pre-arranged with their focus mentor and approved by the Program Director. It is the responsibility of the student to communicate directly with their focus mentor regarding any absences or scheduling concerns, and to make arrangements to make -up the time missed. Students are provided the opportunity for three (3) planned personal days during the clinical year, which must be approved no later than 2 weeks before the absence. No more than on e personal day make be taken in any single rotation. Absences other than that for illness, emergency or a pre - approved personal day will not be tolerated and, in addition to requiring the time to be made up, will result in one course grade being deducted f rom the final grade for each day missed. Reporting of Absences Student absences from scheduled clinical rotation days for illness or emergency must be reported within 8 hours to the Program Assistant Director. The student must provide the program with th e name of his/her rotation and supervising genetic counselor, the reason for the absence, when he/she expects to return and a 183 telephone number where the student can be reached. When absence due to illness extends beyond 48 hours, a signed physician's repor t may be required (from the University Student Health Service or from the student's personal physician). This is done primarily for the student's protection against any accusation of neglect or indifference, as well as to ensure that students have sought p roper health care when appropriate. Written notification of personal day absences will be sent from the program to the individual genetic counseling supervisor when appropriate. Arriving late, leaving early or missing a clinic day will impact the student's rotation evaluation. Policy Statement on Religious Observances The School of Medicine recognizes that excellence in medical education cannot be dependent solely upon any calendar, since patient illness respects no calendar, be it secular or religious. Faculty members recognize, however, that some student may have spec ial needs in the scheduling of tests, final examinations, and clinical rotation or focus internships responsibilities because of religious beliefs and practices. To this end, students who anticipate conflicts with regularly scheduled classes, tests, examin ations and/or clinical or focus activities should notify the Program Director, at least 15 days in advance of any conflicts. STANDARDS OF PROGRESS Requirement for the Master of Medical Science Degree in Human Genetics and Genetic Counseling To be eligi ble to receive the degree of Master of Medical Science in Human Genetics and Genetic Counseling from Emory University School of Medicine, students must: Students will be required to complete a minimum residency of 6 semesters of academic study (22.5 months). Students must receive approval for continuation each semester by the Program Directors based on satisfactory academic performance and professional conduct.* Students must successfully complete all courses, clinical rotations, and focus internship experiences in the sequence outlined in Curriculum Overview within no more than three (3) years. Students must obtain a minimum of 75 credit hours with a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or greater. Students must successfully complete their Capstone Project as approv ed by a committee that includes their advisor, focus mentor and two additional faculty/staff members. *The judgment of the faculty as to the fitness of an applicant for continuation is based not only upon scholastic achievement alone but also upon knowled ge of the applicant's character, professionalism, general attitude, and ability to master the genetic counseling core competencies. Grading and Evaluation System 184 Grades A, B, C, and S are passing grades for which credit is awarded. The grades of D and U indicate inadequate performance and credit will only be granted based on successful remediation and/or course repetition. F indicates failure for which no credit is grant ed; I indicates that the student has not completed all the work for a course; P indicates work in progress; W indicates withdrawal without penalty; WF indicates withdrawal failing; and WU indicates unsatisfactory withdrawal. The letter grades A through F have no exact numerical equivalent; they indicate the quality of performance as described below. These grades represent the faculty's total estimate of the individual's achievement both academically and professionally, and they are not simply summaries of formal arithmetic grades. A is the highest grade given. A grade of \"A\" indicates achievement of superior quality. B indicates performance that is above the merely acceptable range. C indicates performance has met minimum standards of acceptability, but does not imply competency. D and U indicate inadequate performance. F indicates failure. . I indicates incomplete course work. Final transcripts cannot carry grades of \"I.\" Faculty may choose to require demonstration of the students' mastery of skills or concepts whenever an evaluation score falls below 80%. In addition to achieving an appropriate grade, students must exhibit the appropriate professional, ethical and moral attitudes and behaviors to successfully pass a block, clerkship or phase o f the curriculum. Each course syllabus contains the criteria for achieving a satisfactory grade. Appeal Process for Grades Students are encouraged to discuss evaluations and final grades with the course director or clinical supervisor as appropriate. If a student wishes to appeal a final course grade or summative evaluation, this should be presented in writing to the Program Directors (PDs) Within 30 days of receiving the grade. The appeal may be based on the process that leads to the final grade/evaluatio n and/or questions of factual content of the evaluation process. The PD will then review the basis for the appeal of the final evaluation and/or grade. The PDs may review the final grade or evaluation in terms of 1) the process that led to the final grade/ evaluation, and/or 2) questions of factual content that led to the final grade/evaluation. Upon review, the PDs may find that there is no basis, based on process or factual content, for a change of final grade or evaluation. Alternatively, the PDs may reco mmend that the course director or clinical supervisor consider a change of grade/evaluation or additional assessment of student performance and subsequent reconsideration of the evaluation/grade. 185 After review by the PDs and submission of the reconsidered grade/evaluation, the student may appeal any decision to the Executive Associate Dean whose decision shall be final. Evaluation of Student Academic Performance Student academic performance will be evaluated by the Program Directors each semester based on course grades, clinical rotation evaluations, and focus mentor reports. If, based on this evaluation it is determined that the student is not meeting program academic standards, consideration for academic warning, probation or dismissal will be made. Final decisions regarding dismissal and reinstatement will require a review and vote of the Genetic Counseling Training Program Advisory Board, which is made up of faculty, clinical supervisors, and external genetics professionals. Students may appeal the decis ion of the Advisory Board to the Executive Associate Dean for Medical Education and Student Affairs. Evaluation of Professional Conduct The medical school faculty of Emory University has established standards for determining the ethical and professional fitness of genetic counseling students to participate in the medical profession. The evaluation of ethical behavior and professionalism is an ongoing process during school and the successful completion of each semester, rotation and phase of the curriculu m requires that a student meet the appropriate ethical and professional standards as determined by the faculty. Some specific examples of professional conduct include: Concern for the welfare of patients as evidenced by thoughtful and professional attitud e in obtaining history and physical examinations; avoidance of foul language, offensive gestures or inappropriate remarks with sexual overtones; treatment of patients with respect and dignity both in their presence and in discussions with peers; manifestat ion of concern for the total patient. Concern for the rights of others, as shown by dealing with faculty, professional and staff personnel and with peers in a considerate manner and with a spirit of cooperation; acting with an egalitarian spirit towards al l persons regardless of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, veteran's status, disability, or age; assuming an appropriate and equitable share of duties among peers. Responsibility to duty, which involves: effectively undertakin g duties with alacrity [eagerness, enthusiasm and promptness are synonyms] and persevering until complete, or notifying a responsible more senior person of a problem; punctual attendance for class, small groups, rounds, conferences and other clinical dutie s, or offering appropriate explanation when unable to be present; notifying the Program Director's Office, course directors, and/or supervising house officers of absence or inability to carry out duties; seeing patients regularly and assuming responsibilit y for their care with appropriate supervision; identifying emergencies and responding appropriately; and being available to faculty or staff personnel when on duty. Trustworthiness, exhibited by being truthful and intellectually honest in communications wi th others; accepting responsibility for meeting multiple demands by establishing proper priorities and by completing work necessary 186 for the optimal care of patients; discerning accurately when supervision or advice is needed before acting; maintaining conf identiality of information concerning patients. Professional communication and demeanor, which means a neat and clean appearance in attire, that is reasonably acceptable as appearing professional to the patient population; maintaining equilibrium under pre ssures of fatigue, professional stress, or personal problems; avoiding the effects of alcohol or drugs while on duty. Procedure for the Reporting of Unprofessional Behavior Unprofessional behavior by a student should be reported to the course director, clinical supervisor, or the Program Director(s), as appropriate. Unprofessional behavior may be addressed in one or more of the following ways, depending upon the nature of the behavior, and the setting and circumstances in which it occurred: Review by Prog ram Directors Conduct Code Honor Code. If a student receives an unsatisfactory evaluation for professionalism during a course, clinical rotation, or focus internship, this should be reported to the Program Director, Assistant Program Director, or Medical Director respectively. Students are routinely informed about their evaluations during and upon completion of the course or rotation. Unprofessional conduct is discussed as part of routine meetings of the Program Directors. When considering allegati ons of a student's unprofessional behavior the Program Directors may interview the involved student(s) and any other faculty, staff, or students, as appropriate. If the Program Directors deem the unprofessional conduct to be of an egregious nature warranti ng consideration of dismissal, the situation will be brought to the attention of the DOHG Education Committee and/or the program Advisory Board to consider the alleged behavior and recommend a course of action. Program Continuation At the end of each aca demic period, the Program Directors meet to review the performance of each student. In the case of students experiencing difficulties in achieving satisfactory progress either academically or professionally, the Program Directors will make a determination of whether the student should continue in the program or if there are grounds for consideration of Academic Warning, Academic Probation or Dismissal. Personal illness and/or family tragedy directly affecting a student's performance are given full considera tion by the Program Directors. The Program Directors may choose to interview the involved student, and any other faculty, staff or students as appropriate. The Program Directors will consider the totality of the student's record and behavior since enrollme nt and may recommend: Deceleration of the academic program; Repetition of the academic program; Suspension; Dismissal; Other appropriate actions. 187 The Program Directors' final decision is conveyed to the student in writing, and a copy is placed in the stu dent file. The student may appeal the decision to the Executive Associate Dean of the Medical School by submitting such a request in writing to the Dean within ten (10) days of being notified of the decision by the Program Directors. Academic Warning Academic Warning is an official warning given by the Progress and Promotions Committee to a student whose performance is of concern. A student on Academic Warning is Not in Good Academic Standing. Students given an Academic Warning receive written notice of th eir status from the Program Director, noting the specific concern(s). A copy of the letter is placed in the student's file and made available as needed during the student's course of study. The designation of Academic Warning may result in the loss of fina ncial aid. Academic Probation Academic Probation is a conditional status that may be designated by the Program Directors when a student's performance is unsatisfactory. The period of Academic Probation and the reasons for probation are given to the stude nt in the form of a letter, which is placed in the student's file. Academic Probation is a serious reprobation and requires that a student maintain adequate performance for the period designated as the probationary period. The designation of academic probation may result in the loss of federal financial aid. Academic Guidance & Support Each student upon entering the GC Training Program will be assigned either the Program Director or a Program Assistant Director as his or her Academic Advisor. The advisor will also serve as a resource to address student issues or concerns regarding the program or their performance, or personal issues that are impacting their ability to succeed. In addition to meeting with the student formally twice per semester, the academi c advisor will be the point of contact for instructional faculty, focus mentors, or clinical supervisors who have concerns regarding the student's abilities or performance. In general, students are expected to maintain grades of \"B\" or better or \"satisfact ory\" in all courses including rotations. If a student is having academic difficulty, academic counseling or tutoring may be recommended. It is always advisable for students to seek academic assistance from instructors/course directors as a given course pro ceeds rather than to wait until examination time. In spite of the expected degree of self -discipline and good study habits that students developed before entering into the GC Training Program, there are instances in which students may need assistance. In a ddition, some degree of guidance is necessary when making up work lost because of illness (or any other unforeseen event). Students are requested to make an appointment with their advisor for counsel and advice concerning academic problems unresolved by discussions with instructors/course directors. Program Standards for Continuation During every semester of the program, a student must have demonstrated both the requisite levels of professionalism and academic success, as judged by the Program Directors. Professionalism may be part of any course's evaluation and grade. Independent of the final grade, unprofessional behavior may be the sole criterion 188 for which a student may be recommended for a period of academic probation, suspension, dismissal, or other a ppropriate sanctions. The designation of Academic Probation or suspension may result in the loss of federal financial aid. Assuming the required level of professionalism has been met: A student qualifies for program continuation without restrictions with a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or better, and no course or clinical rotation grade below a \"B.\" A student who receives a \"C\" in any course or clinical practicum will be given an Academic Warning. The student must remediate to the satisfaction of the course director/instructor. Failure to complete remediation successfully by the middle of the next semester will result in the student being placed on academic probation. A student who makes a total of 3 \"C's\" at any point in the program will be placed on academic probation. In a single semester: o A student whose cumulative GPA falls below 3.0 will be placed on Academic Probation. o A student who receives less than a \"B\" in more than one course/rotation in a single semester will be placed on Academic P robation. o A student receiving a grade of \"D\" in a course or clinical rotation, or a U in focus internship/research will be placed on Academic Probation. At minimum the student will be required to remediate to the satisfaction of the course director/clinica l supervisor and program directors. Repetition of the course/rotation may be required. o A student receiving a final grade of \"F\" in any course or clinical rotation will be dismissed from the program. Extenuating circumstances will be considered on a case -by-case basis. o A student receiving 2 or more \"D's\" in a single semester will be dismissed from the program. Extenuating circumstances will be considered on a case-by-case basis. In a subsequent semester: o A student currently on Academic Probation who recei ves a final grade of \"D\" or \"F\" in any course or clinical rotation, or a \"U\" in focus internship or research will be dismissed from the program o A student on Academic Probation who receives 2 or more \"C's\" will be dismissed from the program o A student must obtain a \"B\" or better in all courses/rotations for two consecutive semesters to be removed from Academic Probation o A student removed from Academic Probation who, in any single semester again meets criteria to be placed on academic probation, will be dismissed. As stated above, independent of the final grades, unprofessional behavior may be the sole criterion for which a student may be recommended for a period of academic warning, probation, suspension, dismissal, or other appropriate sanctions 189 Policies Regarding Academic Credits The GC Training program does not award academic credit towards the degree for courses taken on a non -credit basis. The GC Training program will consider academic course credit for transfer on a case -by-case basis if: o The course was complete d within the last 5 years o The course was obtained at the graduate level in an accredited institution o The student received a grade of \"B\" or better o The syllabus is available for review and approval by the Program Directors and instru ctor of the equivalent Emory program course Credit will not be granted for clinical genetic counseling experiences occurring outside of the Emory GC Training Program. The GC Training Program utilizes the Carnegie system in determining course, clinical, an d focus internship credit allocation.

THE DUAL DEGREE PROGRAM - PA/MPH (Maste r of Medical Science/Master of Public Health) Emory is one of a few universities offering a dual MMSc -PA and MPH option for interested applicants. The dual degree program offers students the opportunity to earn an MPH degree in conjunction with training i n the respected and top ranked Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University. Students may apply their combined PA/PH skills in such areas as population health, clinical research, health administration leadership, global healthcare, and community health promotion. Students must apply to and be accepted to both the PA and MPH programs during the same admission year. Students apply to a specific department in the School of Public Health through SOPHAS and to the Physician Assistant Program through CASPA. If you are accepted to the PA program but not accepted into the RSPH, you enter the PA program the equivalent of year two. For example, if you a pply to the dual degree program for the coming year, and are not accepted into the School of Public Health, you enter the PA program in August of the following year. If you are accepted by the School of Public Health but not the PA program, you may enter Public Health but are no longer eligible to enter the dual degree program. You may apply to the PA program as a regular student. Accepted dual -degree students initially enroll in the School of Public Health for one year and complete 32 semester hours of cou rses. These include the required MPH core courses, required departmental courses and, in most instances, a thesis. Students must also complete a practicum, a structured field experience of relevance to public health. After completion of the fall and spring semesters of the MPH curriculum, dual degree students enter the PA program the following fall semester. The PA Program requires twenty -nine months (seven semesters) of training, including courses and clinical rotations.

Two Semesters o f Anatomy and Physiology (I and II 8 semester/12 quarter hours) will be required and all p rerequisite courses must be completed within 10 years of submitting the application for the 2022-2023 cycle We require a minimum of 15 semester credits (22 quarter hours) of natural sciences: o Biology with lab (4 semesters/6 quarter hours) o General Chemistry with lab(s) (8 semester/12 quarter hours) o Organic or biochemistry* (3 semester/5 quarter hours) *survey courses not acceptable All courses taken to satisfy the requirements must be taken from a regionally (North American) accredited institution. Each course must be completed at a grade level of \"C\" or better and must be completed prior to matriculation. All courses are subject to approval by the Admissions Committee and cannot be taken on a Pass/Fail basis, as CLEP credit, or audite d. ATTENDANCE DIDACTIC PHASE ATTENDANCE, ABSENCES AND TIMELINESS Attendance, on time arrival, and participation is the expectation for every student. This includes all classes, examinations, labs, small group sessions, society meetings, preceptorships, and patient presentations. Classes and exams will begin on time. Students who arrive after an examination has begun may be refused admission to the exam, thus jeopardizing their course grade. Additional time will 205 not be given for late arrivals. Students wh o arrive more than 15 minutes late to an exam will not be allowed to take the exam and will receive a zero for this exam grade. Each student is allowed three (3) absences per semester to use at their discretion. Any absence on a particular day, independent of the length of that absence, counts as one of the three allowable absences. These absences may not be on consecutive days. These absences do not require approval, but do require notification to the student's faculty advisor via email. Any additional abs ences must be approved by the student's advisor and will require documentation of reason of absence. Absences that require more than five (5) consecutive class days are addressed under Leave of Absence policy. CLINICAL PHASE ATTENDANCE, ABSENCES AND TIME LINESS Attendance at clinical rotation on the scheduled dates and time is mandatory and monitored carefully. Transportation and alternate childcare arrangements must be made prior to beginning the clinical year. The rotation hours, including weekends, holidays, call schedule, etc. are determined by the clinical service. Students on a clinical rotation will be on call and work weekends as scheduled by the supervising physician. Under no circumstances may a student leave a clinical rotation without prior app roval from the program director or a clinical educator unless there is physical danger. Any other departure will be treated as abandonment of the Emory PA Student Handbook 2022-2023 23 rotation and is subject to sanctions by the Progress and Promotions committee, including possible dismissal from the program. All students are required to do three (3) Emory arranged and approved out -of-town rotations. Please be prepared for these rotations by ensuring adequate child and pet care. Students may t ake three (3) planned personal days during the clinical year. These must be approved no later than 2 weeks before the absence. No more than one personal day may be taken in any single rotation. A personal day may not be taken on an End -of-Rotation day. Abs ences other than those for illness, emergency, or a pre -approved personal day are not permitted and will result in reduction of the final rotation grade by one grade for each missed day. Clinical year student absences for illness or emergency must be repor ted within 8 hours to the one of the Clinical Educators and to the individual preceptor. The student must provide the program with the name of rotation and preceptor, reason for absence, expected return date, and a telephone number where the student can be reached. When absence due to illness extends beyond 48 hours, a signed physician's report may be required (from the University Student Health Service or from the student's personal physician). This is done primarily for the student's protection against an y accusation of neglect or indifference, as well as to ensure that students have sought proper health care when appropriate. The program will provide written notification of approved personal day absences to the individual preceptor. Arriving late or leaving early from a rotation without approval is considered an unexcused absence for the entire day. 206 STANDARDS OF PROGRESS Student Assessment and Grading For all classes and rotations, the following guidelines for grading will be used: A 90.0 - 100% D 65.0 to 69.99% F 64.99% and below Academic Warning is defined as an official warning given by the Progress and Promotion Committee to a student whose performance is of concern. A student on Academic Warning is Not in Good A cademic Standing. Students given an Academic Warning receive written notice of their status from the Program Director, noting the specific concern(s). A copy of the letter is placed in the student's file and made available to subsequent Progress and Promot ion Committees during the student's course of study. The designation of Academic Warning may result in the loss of financial aid. Academic Probation is defined as a conditional status that may be designated by the Progress and Promotion Committee when a student's performance is unsatisfactory. A student on Academic Probation is Not in Good Academic Standing. Students placed on Academic Probation receive written notice of their status from the Program Director, noting the specific concern(s). The letter is placed in the student's file and made available to subsequent Progress and Promotion Committee Meetings. Academic Probation is a serious reprobation and requires that a student maintain adequate performance for the period designated as the probationary p eriod. The designation of Academic Probation may result in the loss of financial aid. Promotional Guidelines for Didactic Phase For every semester of the program, a student must demonstrate professionalism and academic success, as defined below and evaluated by the Progress and Promotion Committee. Guidelines for Didactic Phase Professionalism: Professionalism may be part of any course's evaluation and grade. Independent of the final grade, unprofessional behavior may be the sole criterion for which a student may be recommended for Academic Warning, Academic Probation, dismissal, or other appropriate sanctions. The designation of Academic Probation may result in the loss of financial aid. Guidelines for Didactic Phase Academic Performance: Students who score less than 65% on all exams (oral or written) in a course/module (regardless of the overall grade) will need to repeat the entire course (offered only once per year) assuming they meet GPA requirements to remain in the PA Program. In a single semester: 207 A student with a semester GPA >2.80 will be considered in good academic standing. A student with a semester GPA between 2.51-2.80 is not in good academic standing and will be placed on Academic Warning. Remediation or repetition of courses may be required. A student with a semester GPA between 2.20 -2.50 is not in good academic standing and will be placed on Academic Probat ion. Remediation or repetition of courses may be required. A student with a semester GPA <2.20 is not in good academic standing and may be considered for dismissal from the program by the Progress and Promotion s Committee Students Not in Good Academic St anding for multiple semesters: A student with a GPA below 2.80 for two semesters will be placed on Academic Probation. Remediation or repetition of courses may be required. A student with a GPA of 2.50 or below for two semesters may be considered for dismissal from the program by the Progress and Promotion Committee. A student with a GPA of 2.80 or below for three semesters may be considered for dismissal from the program by the Progress and Promotion Committee. Guidelines for Evaluation of the Pre -Clinical Summative Examination All PA students are required to successfully complete all aspects of the pre -clinical summative evaluation scheduled at the end of the didactic phase in order to progress to the clinical phase. This evaluation process is design ed to ensure that every student has the requisite knowledge and skills to progress to the clinical year. The evaluation is comprised of three components. A. Preceptor assessment: Preceptors assess students' performance in the final encounter in the Didactic Experiential Learning Program (DELP) using a standardized assessment form. This comprehensive examination is worth 25% of the pre -clinical summative exam. B. Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE): Students will complete a multi-station objective e xamination covering basic clinical skills. This skills examination is worth 25% of the pre -clinical summative exam. C. Multiple Choice Examination: This is a 225 question examination, administered via computer over approximately 2.5 hours. Exam questions are based on the NCCPA blueprint and follow in topic weight the PANCE exam. A satisfactory score is defined as > 1 standard deviation above the national mean. For purposes of the pre -clinical summative examination, this examination counts for 50% of the grade. An unsatisfactory outcome requires remediation and retesting and is defined as a: score of less than 70% in the preceptor assessment score of less than 70% on the OSCE score of less than one standard deviation below the national mean for the multiple -choice examination 208 Any student earning unsatisfactory scores in two or more components of the pre - clinical summative examination will not be allowed to progress to clinical rotations and will be required to complete faculty directed remediation for a minimum of 5 weeks prior to retesting. A failing grade on a retest will result in inability to progress to the clinical year until evaluated by the Progress and Promotion committee for decisions on further procedure. Guidelines for Performance in the Clin ical Phase Performance during the clinical year requires assessment of knowledge, attitudes, skills and behavior. The following guidelines do not preclude the Progress and Promotions Committee from recommending repetition of courses, assignment of academi c warning or academic probation, or dismissal based on the Committee's overall assessment of student performance, regardless of the specific grades. Independent of the final grade, unprofessional behavior may be the sole criterion for which a student may b e recommended for a period of academic warning, academic probation, dismissal, or other appropriate sanctions. Students in Good Academic Standing at Start of Clinical Year : 1. Students entering the clinical year in good academic standing will be placed on Academic Warning based on any of the following criteria: One (1) final rotation grade of 'C' Two (2) End of Rotation examinations with a score less than 70% 2. Students entering the clinical year in good academic standing will be placed on Academic Probation based on any of the following criteria: Two (2) final rotation grades of 'C' One (1) final rotation grade of 'D' One (1) final rotation grade of 'C' plus two (2) End of Rotation examinations with a score less than 70% Three (3) End of Rotation examination s with a score less than 70% 3.

Students who fail to make a 70% or greater on any written exam in the Emory PA Program are required to remediate deficient content areas for each test. The remediation process does not change the exam grade. Remediation must t ake place within two (2) weeks of receiving the deficient grade. Failure to do so will result in the additional loss of five (5) points from the exam. Remediation of Written Exams Process Initiation of the remediation process is the student's responsibil ity. Written Exam Remediation Process: 1. Make appointment for remediation session in the PA Program office under supervision of the Academic Support Administrator 2. Bring lecture handouts, files, and assigned reading to the remediation with blank paper 3. Obtain exam for remediation from the Academic Support Administrator 4. For each missed question, the following should be done: Identify the correct answer Explain the correct answer in one paragraph or less Site all sources used to determine correct answer including page number of textbook or eBook and slide number for PowerPoint slides. Only assigned readings or lecture notes are accepted as references. 5. Return the exam and remediation packet to the Academic Support Administrator 6. Copying of exams or question s is not allowed (no photos, no photo copies and no written reproduction) 7. No information from the exams is to be shared in any fashion Students are expected to earn 100% on remediated questions. Students who earn <100% will be required to meet with the Co urse Director to review deficient content and demonstrate proficiency of the subject material. Remediation of OSCE Exams Students who earn less than 70% on an OSCE exam (including SP session and SOAP note) are required to remediate the failed content of the exam. Remediation must take place within two (2) weeks of the exam. Remediation of OSCE Exams Process Initiation of the remediation process is the student's responsibility. 210 OSCE Exam Remediation Process: 1. Review videotaped SP session and the proctor comments 2. Review pertinent assigned readings, lectures and labs 3. Review critiqued SOAP note 4. Write a brief yet thorough report on what you would do or ask differently in future SP sessions to improve history, physical exam, communication skills and/or profes sional skills 5. Write a brief report on how you would improve recording subjective and objective information and better develop the assessment and plan in your SOAP note 6. Send these reports electronically to the module director RIGHT OF APPEAL Students are encouraged to discuss evaluations and final grades with the course director, preceptor, academic and clinical coordinators as appropriate. If a student wishes to appeal a final course grade or summative evaluation, this should be presented in writing to the Program Director (PD) within 30 days of receiving the grade. The appeal may be based on the process that leads to the final grade/evaluation and/or questions of factual content of the evaluation process. The PD will then review the basis for the appeal of the final evaluation and/or grade. The PD may review the final grade or evaluation in terms of 1) the process that led to the final grade/evaluation, and/or 2) questions of factual content that led to the final grade/evaluation. Upon review, the PD may find that there is no basis, based o n process or factual content, for a change of final grade or evaluation. Alternatively, the PD may recommend that the course/module director or clinical coordinator consider any of the following: 1) recommend that the course/module director or clinical coo rdinator submit the questions and answers to a group of faculty in the field for review; 2) suggest additional assessment of student performance and subsequent reconsideration of the grade/evaluation; or 3) suggest a change of grade/evaluation. The cours e/module director will then consider the recommendation made by the PD and submit a written response to the PD and a re -considered final grade/evaluation.

The application deadline for enrollment is June 1st for the BMSc program and February 1st for the RT-BMSc program. All applicants who meet the minimum admission criteria will be considered for admission into the program. However, preference is given to applicants who exceed the minimum criteria. The actual determination of applicant admission to the Medical Imaging Program is a function of the Medical Imaging Program Admissions Committee. Admissions are competitive and are based on scholastic history, personal interview, and references. Applicants who only met the minimum requirements are not guaranteed ad mission. Selection of students will be made without discrimination to age, sex, race, creed, national origin, or handicap. All students in the BMSc program will be enrolled full -time and will be enrolled for a minimum of 12 credit hours each semester. S tudents in the RT -BMSc program may be enrolled as a full -time (minimum of 12 credit hours) or part -time student (< 12 credit hours). TRANSFER OF CREDIT POLICY Students enrolling in the Medical Imaging Program must transfer a minimum of 30 semester (45 quarter) hours of core curriculum coursework into the university system. Core curriculum courses taken to satisfy admission and graduation requirements must be tak en at a regionally accredited institution (COC: SACS equivalent). Graduates of foreign institutions must present transcripts of at least one full academic year (preferably in the sciences and in English) from an accredited college or university in the Unit ed States or Canada. Only courses with a grade of \"C\" or higher are eligible for transfer. Students already enrolled in a medical imaging program who wish to transfer into the Emory University Program will be evaluated on an individual basis. Only students who are currently enrolled in a degree granting, JRCERT accredited program are able to transfer. Only courses with a grade of \"C\" or higher are eligible for transfer. Transfer students may require a longer time to complete the course of study. ATTEN DANCE Class and Examination Attendance Attendance at all scheduled classes is expected, but specific requirements are at the discretion of individual course directors. Daily attendance on clinical clerkships is mandatory. Attendance is also mandatory fo r all tests, final examinations, and certification examinations. Students are responsible for being present at the beginning of all examinations. Exams will begin ON TIME ; 236 students who arrive after an examination has begun may be refused admission to the examining room, thus jeopardizing their course grade. Requests for rescheduling or delaying examinations will not be considered except in cases of documented medical or family emergency. Deferred examinations must be taken at the time specified by the major professor of the course. Failure to take a deferred examination will result automatically in the grade of \"F\". Reporting of Absences Students must report absence from examinations or from daily clinical clerkship duties and reasons thereof, as soon as possible to the Program Office and to the faculty member responsible for the course or clerkship. When it is known in advance that attend ance will not be possible, notification should be made before the day of absence. If the faculty member cannot be reached, the Program office should be asked to notify them. When absence due to illness extends beyond 48 hours, a signed physician's report will be required (from the Student Health Service or from the student's personal attending physician). This is done primarily for the student's protection against any accusation of neglect or indifference, as well as to ensure students, in the case of illness, seek proper health care. STANDARDS OF PROGRESS GRADING SYSTEM A student's continued enrollment in the Medical Imaging Program is dependent upon satisfactory scholastic achievement. The criteria used in determining whether a student's scholastic stand ing is satisfactory are described in this section. Grading Scale The following system of grading is used except for courses where special permission has been granted to use Satisfactory (S) and Unsatisfactory (U): Quality Points Letter Grade Numerical Grade 4.0 A 90-100 3.0 B 80-89 2.0 C 75-79 1.0 E 70-74 0.0 F <70 0.0 I Incomplete 0.0 IF Incomplete Fail (work not completed within allotted time) 0.0 W Withdrawal 237 0.0 WF Withdrawal Fail (average <70 at time of withdrawal) To compute a grade -point average (GPA), first identify the classes or semester to include in the calculation. Then, for each course, multiply the quality points earned times the number of credit hours attempted on a letter grade basis. Lastly, divide that total by sum of the credit hours attempted. Courses with a grade of S, U, W, or WU are not used in calculating the grade point average. Courses with a grade of IF or WF are counted as F when calculating the grade point average. Tentative Grades When ass igned work is not satisfactorily completed during a prescribed period, a grade of \"I\" (Incomplete) may be given if the instructor so desires. If the work is not subsequently completed within one year or a time period prescribed by the course instructor, a final grade of \"F\" or \"U\" will be entered on the record. The grade of \"I\" may be changed to a \"W\" in special circumstances of extended illness or injury. Grade Appeals Students are encouraged to discuss evaluations and final grades with the course director. If a student wishes to appeal a final grade or evaluation, this should be presented in writing to the Program Director, within 30 days of receiving the grade. The appeal may be based on the process that leads to the final grade/evaluation and/or quest ions of factual content of the evaluation process. The Program Director will then review the basis for the appeal of the final evaluation and/or grade. The Program Director may review the final grade or evaluation in terms of 1) the process that led to the final grade/evaluation, and/or 2) questions of factual content that led to the final grade/evaluation. Upon review, the Program Director may find that there is no basis, based on process or factual content, for a change of final grade or evaluation. Alt ernatively, the Program Director may recommend that the course director consider any of the following: 1) for questions regarding factual content, the Program Director may recommend that the course director submit the questions and answers to a group of faculty in the field for review; 2) for questions regarding process or factual content, the Program Director may suggest additional assessment of student performance and subsequent reconsideration of the evaluation/grade; or 3) The Program Director may sugge st a change of grade/evaluation. The course director will then consider the recommendation made by the Program Director and submit a written response to the Program Director and a re -considered final grade/evaluation. After review by the Program Director a nd submission of the re - considered grade/evaluation, the student may appeal any decision to the Program Grade Appeal Committee. The student may further appeal the Program Grade Appeal Committee decision to the Executive Associate Dean of the Medical School. The decision by the Executive Associate Dean of the Medical School shall be final. 238 Requirements for Continued Enrollment A student's continued enrollment at Emory University is subject to the decision of the program's Progress and Promotions Committee that satisfactory academic progress is being made, that rules of the program and University are being complied with, and that the best interests of the school and other students are being served. The Progress and Promotions Committee may, at their discretion and irrespective of grades, declare probationary status for any student who, in their opinion, is not properly utilizing t ime and talents or not adhering to program and university policies. Academic Standing and Academic Dismissal Students earning a grade of \"D\" in any medical imaging course will be required to retake the course in which the \"D\" was earned. Achievement of a grade of \"C\" will be required when the course is repeated; however, the initial grade of \"D\" will remain on the student's official transcript. Repeating a course means the student will have to interrupt the program of full -time study and graduation will be delayed for one year. During the intervening year, individualized plans of study will be developed jointly by the student and the Program Director. Achievement of two or more grades of \"D\" in medical imaging courses will automatically result in exclus ion from the program. Achievement of one grade of \"F\" or \"IF\" in any medical imaging course will automatically result in exclusion from the program. Students experiencing academic, clinical or personal difficulty may withdraw from a course. Withdrawals will only be granted prior to mid -term and a grade of W (withdrawal without penalty) or WF (withdrawal failing) will be assigned as appropriate. Withdrawing from a course means the student will have to interrupt the program of full -time study and graduati on will be delayed for one year. During the intervening year, individualized plans of study will be developed jointly by the student and the Program Director. Grade Point Average Requirement A 2.0 average must be maintained in each semester to remain in good academic standing and to continue in the program. A cumulative GPA of at least 2.0 (didactic and clinical) is required for graduation. Readmission Policy Students requesting to return to the program after a leave of absence must request readmissi on, in writing, to the Program Director. A student returning to the program after a leave of absence of one year or less must follow the following policies and procedures: 1) The student must enroll as a part -time student in the semester prior to their re - enrollment as a full -time student. In this semester the student will enroll in Independent Study. This will allow the student the opportunity to become reacquainted with the clinical and classroom environments. 2) The student must take written exams cove ring major content areas (both general radiography and minor track) taught in previously taken courses. The 239 student must make a grade of 75 or better on each exam. 3) The student must take skills tests covering all competency procedures learned in previou s semesters. This includes: a) Simulation on all previous procedures. (Minimum score of 80) b) Completion of performance objectives. (Minimum score of 75) c) Completion of clinical quizzes.

Exclusion Achievement of two or more grades of \"D\" in medical imaging courses will automatically result in exclusion from the progr am. Achievement of one grade of \"F\" or \"IF\" in any medical imaging course will automatically result in exclusion from the program. 240 A student who is excluded under these rules will not be eligible to attend for the next regular semester. The Program's Progress and Promotion Committee and Admission Committee will act upon a petition for readmission for any subsequent semester. Satisfa ctory Academic Progress A student is considered to be making satisfactory academic progress as long as a G.P.A. of 2.0 or better for completed courses is earned. All students will be able to review grades via Canvas throughout each semester. Students who are at risk of failing will receive counseling at the mid -point and end of each semester to review their status in each course. Registration All students must register on the dates indicated in the Academic Calendar. Registration information may be obta ined from the program office . Students who do not complete registration on registration day are charged a late fee of $150.00. After the last date in the Academic Calendar for changing courses, registration may be allowed only by joint consent of the direc tor, the registrar and instructors concerned. After 10 calendar days have lapsed from the date classes begin, registration is not permitted. Tuition is due and payable at registration for each semester. Payment plans are available during the fall and spring semesters. For information contact Student Accounts. Cancellation and Withdrawal Registration may be canceled during the first week of c lasses. See the Academic Calendar for the precise date each semester. Cancellation of registration means that no deficiencies will be noted on the student's transcript. After the first week of classes, a student who wishes to leave the University must go through a withdrawal procedure. Honorable dismissal requires that this procedure be followed. Withdrawal forms may be secured at the Office of Medical Education and Student Affairs. Refunds of tuition are only partial. A student may cancel registration within the first week of the semester (first five class days), in which case only the deposit will be forfeited (or $25.00 if no deposit was required). After the first week of classes, a student may voluntarily withdraw; the forfeit in withdrawal increases progressively but is not less than for cancellation as a minimum. There is no refund of tuition after approximately five weeks. No refund is given if a student drops only a part of the course work for which he registered after the last day for approved sc hedule changes as specified in the Academic Calendar. There is no refund for a student who is dismissed from the program. Readmission of students following withdrawal for medical reasons requires medical clearance by designated University health official . 241 A student who withdraws may not continue living in University housing or participate in student activities and is ineligible for University health services. A student's continued enrollment at Emory University is a privilege based not only on a satis factory scholastic status, but also upon good emotional health. If, in the opinion of the Dean of a student's school, the student demonstrates evidence of an emotional disorder, the student may be referred by the Dean to the University Student Health Servi ce for psychiatric evaluation. Refusal to obtain a psychiatric evaluation, when properly requested to do so, or determination by the University Health Service that withdrawal would be in the best interest of the student and the University shall be cause fo r involuntary withdrawal of the student from the University by the Dean. Withdrawal in such cases shall normally incur no academic penalty for the term in which the student is enrolled; and tuition refund, if any, shall be based on the schedule establish ed for voluntary withdrawal. The Dean shall inform the student in writing of the effective date of the involuntary withdrawal and shall explain in writing the procedure for application for readmission to Emory University. Application for readmission afte r withdrawal for psychiatric reasons will require evaluation by the University psychiatrist. A person seeking readmission may choose to submit a written report from his/her own psychiatrist at the individual's own expense. In no case shall readmission be g ranted after psychiatric withdrawal without the approval of the University Health Service.
