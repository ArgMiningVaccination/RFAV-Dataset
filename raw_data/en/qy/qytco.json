Sincerely, Richard H. Hart, M.D., Dr.P.H. President 4 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY Vice President for Enrollment Management and Student Services' Welcome On behalf of all student services personnel, I want you to know that we are glad that you are here. Welcome to L oma Linda University. You have come to Loma Linda University with high expectations for superb training in a professional discipline, and you will not be disappointed. It is the primary goal of the Office of Enrollment Management and Student Services to i ntentionally promote student learning and development through diverse, high -quality programming that will enable you to properly balance the components of intellectual, physical, emotional, social, and spiritual growth. Many students find that while in pro fessional school, the intellectual component can easily take on a special significance that overshadows all others. If one component is consistently favored over the rest, wholeness and wellness will be compromised. The mission of making persons whole must start with the caregiver striving to find an optimal personal balance of all components. Please avail yourself of the student affairs staff and services. We are here to help you achieve that delicate balance. Sincerely, Rick Williams, Ph.D. Vice Pres ident for Enrollment Management and Student Services Student Handbook 5 SECTION I INTRODUCTION6 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY History of Loma Linda University Loma Linda University is part of the Seventh -day Adventist system of higher education. In 1905, the University (formerly College of Medical Evange lists) was founded \u2014through a series of divine providences \u2014at Loma Linda, California, by the Seventh -day Adventist Church. The School of Nursing began in 1905. In 1909, the College of Medical Evangelists received its charter as a medical school with the exp ress purpose of preparing physicians who could meet the needs of the whole person. Both schools emphasized the need for healthful living as a part of medical care, a revolutionary concept in 1905. The University was designated by the Seventh -day Adventist Church as a center for educating health professionals. The original schools \u2014Nursing and Medicine \u2014have been joined by Allied Health Professions, Behavioral Health (formerly Science and Technology), Dentistry, Pharmacy, Public Health, Religion, and the Facu lty of Graduate Studies. The curricula of the University are approved by their respective professional organizations. From its small beginnings, the University has achieved widespread recognition \u2014having sent more of its graduates into international service than has any other university. It remains committed to the vision of its founders and is sustained by its close association with the church. From 1918 to 1962, the University operated within health facilities in two cities: Loma Linda and Los Angeles. In September 1962, all health professional education was consolidated at Loma Linda. In 1967, Loma Linda University Medical Center opened in its new three -tower facility, a landmark cloverleaf structure. The Medical Center continues on the cutting edge of health care, providing excellent service for patients and expanding educational opportunities for students. In 1990, the Board of Trustees designated Loma Linda University a health sciences university \u2014part of a complex comprised of Loma Linda University Med ical Center, faculty practice plans, and affiliated institutions. The University is a leader in the field of health sciences education, research, and service.

The motto of the University, \"to make man whole,\" illustrates the sense of destiny felt in the University community to act its part in God's ongoing plan for healing and restoring human beings to live with Him in wholeness, both now and in eternity. While Loma Linda University has changed in many ways since its beginning in 1905, the biblical principles that provide its f oundation have remained unchanged. SEVENTH -DAY ADVENTIST HERITAGE Loma Linda University is owned and operated by the Seventh -day Adventist Church and has a deep commitment to respecting the rich diversity of its student body. It views respect and sensiti vity for all people, regardless of their culture and ethnicity, as a part of true Christianity. We recognize that students come from many different faiths. This University has a tradition of religious liberty, and it highly respects students' religious val ues that differ from ours. We look upon the various perspectives of each spiritually committed student as enriching to our campus and educational environment. OUR UNIQUE FEATURES Two distinctive features of the Seventh -day Adventist Church, which are par t of the Loma Linda experience, become evident to first -time students. The first is the concept of Sabbath rest that reminds us of God as Creator. Adventists realize this in part by celebrating Saturday as the Sabbath from sundown Friday to sundown Saturda y. During these hours, you will find that University offices, laboratories, libraries, study halls, and recreation facilities are closed to give time for physical and spiritual renewal and worship. A second distinctive feature worth noting is an emphasis on health and wholeness. Students will be able to exercise in our recreation and wellness center, a health and fitness complex that received a national award for excellence in utility and design. The cafeterias on campus feature well -prepared vegetarian me als. Note that the University holds that a drug -, alcohol -, and tobacco -free lifestyle is essential for achieving the goal of \"wholeness.\" This means that all students agree to refrain from the use of tobacco, alcohol, and other \"recreational\" drugs while enrolled at the University. All students who choose Loma Linda as their university make a commitment to conduct their lives in a manner that reflects their sense of responsibility for the honor and integrity of the University and for themselves as members of its community. VISION A ND FAITH OF THE UNIVERSITY Faith, hope, and love \u2014these three express the essence of the understanding and experience of Loma Linda University, a Seventh -day Adventist institution. The greatest of these is love, which supports a nd guides faith and hope. While faith and hope are the divinely inspired attitudes of people who serve God, love is a special attribute that humanity shares with God, for \"God is love.\" Student Handbook 9 Love The center and circumference of Adventist Christian thought is th at self -giving love, flowing from God and embodied in Jesus, is the law of life for the universe. This love has been contested by the forces of evil and, thus, a great controversy has raged in human history. The character of God has been misunderstood and misinterpreted. It is the function of those who believe in God to represent in thought, life, and mission the true character of God \u2014most clearly seen in Jesus Christ \u2014and His saving purpose for this world. The love of God in Christ Jesus, experienced and e xpressed in God's people everywhere, will answer all the charges of the evil one and bring closure to the great controversy. When the saving activity of God has run its full course and restored the image of God in humankind, then not only the inhabitants of this world, but also those of the universe for whom the redemption of this world has been a lesson book, will confess that \"God is love.\" Faith and hope The community of Loma Linda University affirms the following statements of faith. In harmony with s criptural teaching, we believe that: 1. The Bible reveals God's way and will. Jesus Christ is the center point of this revelation. All are called to trust in Him. 2. God created the world and sustains it by His power. As part of this creation, people are made in the image of God and can freely reflect upon and communicate with God and represent Him in dominion over the earth. Human beings are thus the stewards of the created world. 3. Salvation is the gift of God's grace to people of faith. The life, death, resur rection, and continuing ministry of Jesus and the work of the Holy Spirit bring freedom from guilt before God, transformation of character expressed in joyful obedience to God, and the sure hope of one day sharing the glory of God. 4. God created the seventh -day Sabbath as a time for personal rest and worship and for ministry and care to others. The Sabbath points back to God's creative activity at the beginning of time and forward to God's re -creative activity at the end of time when the promise of the weekly Sabbath will be fulfilled in the eternal rest of the Kingdom of God. That which is vital is not merely keeping the law of the Sabbath but a personal relationship with the Lord of the Sabbath. Seeing Christ in the Sabbath, His people delight themselves in Him. The Loma Linda University community reverences the sacred hours of the Sabbath from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday and seeks to bring others within the purview of God's interest in human wholeness and healing. 5. A person is a unity in which mind an d body\u2014encompassing the spiritual, physical, emotional, and relational \u2014profoundly affect each other. One implication of this unity is that spirituality and healing go hand in hand. Another is that when death occurs, the entire person dies and, at the resur rection, the entire person is raised. Thus death is swallowed up in victory. 6. The health sciences are an arm of God's saving activity in this world. Thus the health professional is a co -worker with God and an envoy of Jesus Christ who was not only a 10 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY teacher of truth and a mediator of forgiveness, but also a healer of persons and a restorer of community. This personal and corporate work in the present is an integral part of, and prelude to, the ultimate renewal of all things by the power of God. 7. The coming of Christ and the restoration of the world to peace, justice, and the universal knowledge of God is the great hope of humanity. Until then, we are called to live in healing love in the service of the God of love. SPIRITUAL LIFE Worship experiences represent a critical dimension of the educational experience at Loma Linda University and are available to the student many times throughout the week. In addition to regular Friday evening and Saturday services, many class, school, club, and University activities include a component of worship and praise to God. UNIVERSITY A T WORSHIP SERVICES In keeping with the commitment of our mission, Loma Linda University (LLU) students have special requirements \u2014such as University at Worship attendance each Wednesday morning, except during Week of Renewal when these chapel services are held daily. University at Worship, which is held in the University Church, provides a variety of opportunities to integrate faith and learning. RELIGION COURSES Courses in religion are part of th e core curriculum in each of the University's schools and programs. These courses focus on study of the Bible, ethics, clinical ministry (which concentrates on ways to understand and meet the spiritual needs of patients and clients in a manner that is noni nvasive and individually appropriate), and a variety of other issues related to the student's field of study and personal spiritual journey. Student Handbook 11 Fundamental Values of Loma Linda University Loma Linda University has identified the following values as central to its educational ideals. COMPASSION \u2014The sympathetic willingness to be engaged with the needs and suffering of others. Among the most memorable depictions of compassion in Scripture is the story of the Good Samaritan, which LLU has taken as a central symb ol for our work. INTEGRITY \u2014The quality of living a unified life in which one's convictions are well considered and match one's actions. Integrity encompasses honesty, authenticity, and trustworthiness. EXCELLENCE \u2014The commitment to exceed minimum standard s and expectations. FREEDOM \u2014The competency and privilege to make informed and accountable choices and to respect the freedom of others. God has called us not to slavery, but to freedom. JUSTICE \u2014The commitment to equality and to treat others fairly, renou ncing all forms of unfair discrimination. The God of the Bible is One who calls people continually to justice. According to the prophets, religious faith could be genuine only when it led the believers to \"seek justice, rescue the oppressed, defend the orp hans, [and] plead for the widow.\" PURITY/SELF -CONTROL \u2014Morally upright and moderate in all things, with complete control over one's emotions, desires, and actions. HUMILITY \u2014The willingness to serve others in a sacrificial manner; the self -respect that renounces haughtiness or arrogance. 12 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY SECTION II STUDENT LIFE Student Handbook 13 Student Life Loma Linda University is committed to whole person student development. The co -curricular aspects of student life on campus are planned to assist students in achieving a healthy balance in every dimension of their lives by: fostering a caring Christian environment; encouraging a personal Christian faith; inspiring respect for and inclusion of diverse ethnic and cultural perspectives; providing opportunities for personal growth and d evelopment; nurturing the development of healthy relationships; assisting in the management of personal conflicts and crises; cultivating a lifelong commitment to altruism and service; promoting an active and healthy lifestyle; and establishing an env ironment that supports the pursuit of personal and professional excellence. SPIRITUAL LIFE Loma Linda University, as a Seventh -day Adventist Christian university, is interested in and committed to the spiritual growth of its students. While the University does not legislate or force personal spiritual development in its students, it does provide programs that promote spiritual growth. Personal spiritual life All members of the University community are encouraged to set apart time daily to seek God for guid ance and renewal. In a Christian university, with the pressures and demands of academics, there is the ongoing danger of studying about but not really knowing God. The challenge found in Psalm 46:10, \"Be still and know that I am God,\" is a reminder of the importance of regularly taking time to reflect personally upon Him. Community spiritual life University at Worship meets each Wednesday at 11:00 a.m. and represents a critical dimension of the educational experience at Loma Linda University. It is require d as part of the curriculum. By devoting one hour each week to a chapel program, the University is emphasizing the value it places on spiritual development, corporate worship, and community. In addition, the chapel programs provide a variety of opportuniti es for the entire University community to benefit from teaching that integrates faith and learning, and to confront current issues that require the implementation of faith in secular life. Weeks of spiritual emphasis are held in the fall, winter, and spri ng of each school year. Central to the mission of Loma Linda University, these weeks are set aside to corporately focus on our relationship with God and the potential impact Christians have on the world because of His Lordship in our lives. These meetings are scheduled each morning at the regular weekly chapel time, and attendance is required. 14 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY The School of Religion offers courses in spiritual growth. Each course emphasizes an area of focus: ethical, theological, or relational. The University CATALOG provi des further information. Student -organized spiritual activities, Loma Linda University Student Association (LLUSA), school student associations, and other student organizations foster opportunities for community and the promotion of spiritual growth. Cam pus c haplains The Campus Chaplains' office, in conjunction with University administration, provides spiritual leadership related to the threefold campus m inistry that is particularly concerned with creating an environment where university students, faculty , and staff can: Know\u2014Be acquainted with God through personal observation and inquiry Grow\u2014Develop and maintain a vibrant, growing faith Go\u2014Serve others The goals of the campus chaplains are to help students become acquainted with Jesus and His gospel invitation; to help students grow in their experience of Christ's love and their knowledge of His plan for their lives; to nurture students' relationship with Christ; to help students discover their spiritual gifts and talents; and to help students exerci se their spiritual gifts and talents in mission -focused service for the campus, the community , and the world. These goals are accomplished through: University@Worship : a weekly Wednesday worship service that centers on the ministry and teachings of Jesus C hrist , with applications of biblical principles for living in and growing His Kingdom. Also featured each quarter are our Weeks of Renewal \u2014each a week -long focus on a timely topic related to the theme of that quarter. SOMA : a weekly Friday night worship se rvice that provides a more intimate environment for exploring the sub jects and teachings presented during the University@Worship worship service. Grow Groups : small groups of four-to-seven people who meet weekly to grow in their love for God and for others . These groups \u2014which are o pen to students, faculty , and staff \u2014provide a space in which students can develop deep friendships; grow in their relationship with Christ; and listen to, be encouraged by, and pray with/for others.

Vehicles/motorcycles The Department of Parking and Traffic is responsible for enforcing the Loma Linda University traffic and parking regulations and the State of California Vehicle Code, as they apply to moving and stationary vehicles, pedestrians, and animals on the campus. The Loma Linda University traffic and parking regulations are enforced under Section 21113 of the California Vehicle Code. Parking regulations All enrolled students are required to register their vehicles with the Department of Parking and Traffic at the de partment's online website. Students must park in approved areas to avoid being ticketed, booted, and/or towed. A complete copy of the Loma Linda University traffic and parking regulations is available at <parking.llu.edu>. California state vehicle licensin g law California state vehicle law requires that all residents who operate a vehicle have a California state driver's license, and any vehicle they own within the state of California must be registered with the California DMV. A car that is owned by an ind ividual who resides out of state may not require California registration. Resident \"Resident\" means any person who manifests an intent to live or be located in this state on more than a temporary or transient basis. Presence in the state for six months o r more in any twelve - month period gives rise to a refutable presumption of residency. The following are evidence of residency for purposes of vehicle registration: address where registered to vote location of employment or place of business payment of resident tuition at a public institution of higher education. attendance of dependents at a primary or secondary school filing a homeowner's property tax exemption renting or leasing home for use as a residence declaration of residency to obtain a lice nse or any other privilege or benefit not ordinarily extended to a nonresident. possession of a California driver's license 34 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY other acts, occurrences, or events that indicate presence in the state is more than temporary or transient STUDENT IDENTIFICATI ON (ID) BADGE Identification number and badge All accepted students are assigned a unique University identification number. This seven -digit number will be used on all correspondence and noted on all payments to the University. A University identification badge using this identification number and a bar code will be issued to each student after completion of his/her initial registration. The identification badge allows access to various student services, including the libraries, Student Health, recreation facilities (that is, the Drayson Center), parking, etc. Also, the bar code on the badge allows currently enrolled and financially cleared students to charge against their accounts at the Campus Bookstore and campus cafeterias, and for ticket sales availabl e through the Student Affairs office. In subsequent quarters, the badge's bar code is automatically reactivated at each registration upon financial clearance. Students must carry their ID badges while on campus, preferably displayed in an easily visible l ocation. An ID badge must be presented upon request. While in any hospital or clinical facility , ID badges must be displayed prominently above the waist. For further information regarding these identification badges, please contact Student Services, Office of Student Affairs at 909/558 -4510. STUDENT ACCESS POLIC Y Student access to University facilities, systems, and services by badge, key, or password is authorized only to currently enrolled students and terminates immediately upon the last day of enrollm ent, even if reenrollment is anticipated in the future. The University has the discretion to revoke access authority at any time. Student Handbook 35 SECTION IV ACADEMIC INFORMATION36 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY Academic Information NAME ON STUDENT RECO RDS It is the student's responsibility to provide t he University with his/her full legal name. This name will be used on all University documents and correspondence and is essential for the following offices, organizations, and processes: University Records, Office of Financial Aid, International Student a nd Scholar Services, Social Security Administration, Veterans' Affairs, preparation of diploma or degree, and other legal processes. The student submits his/her legal name on the original application to the University. A maiden name (where applicable) may be listed as an alternate name. Students should make certain that the spelling, capitalization, spacing, and order are accurate in University Records. The name spelling and format as it appears on the Registration Portal is the way it will appear on the d iploma. For this reason, it is imperative to make sure it is correct on the Registration Portal. The student's name as recorded in the student's record will be used for all University records, such as course rosters, transcripts, graduation program, and d iploma or certification of completion of graduation requirements. Change of name A student may change his/her name at Loma Linda University by submitting a name change request form to University Records. This form must be accompanied by at least two item s: (1) a certified copy of a marriage certificate, a court order, or a divorce decree and (2) an updated SSN card. All changes in vital records must be made through the office of University Records. The student should also notify the dean's office in the s chool in which s/he is enrolled. Name changes received after the second week of a term will be processed after grades have been received for that term. Name changes for expected spring graduates must be received by the office of University Records no late r than the first week in January preceding graduation. GRADE REPORTS Course grades are determined by the faculty member(s) who taught the course. University Records posts all grades at the end of each academic term. Grades can be viewed online the mornin g after the official grade submission date for the term by logging into the Student Services website at <llu.edu/students/>. Notices concerning academic probation and academic dismissal are issued from the dean's office of each school. Grade reports are n ot sent to parents. Students dependent on the support of parents should inform them of their academic progress. If a student believes a grade was given in error, the instructor should be contacted. Grades are changed only when an error has been made in ar riving at or recording a grade and must be submitted during the subsequent term. Students should feel free to discuss grades with their instructors. For specific grading policies of each school, see the school sections of this handbook. Student Handbook 37 Incomplete (I) notation for emergencies affecting course work The University recognizes there are times when events occur over which we have little or no control. Serious illness, accidents, and deaths of loved ones are among the reasons students may not complete their course work on schedule. A provision is made for these kinds of emergencies by permitting an instructor to submit an I (Incomplete) instead of a grade at the end of the course, if circumstances match the allowances outlined in policy. It is the student's responsibility to request an I (Incomplete) notation from the instructor by initiating a petition to receive an incomplete grade workflow on which the reason for the request must be stated (a reason of illness must be accompanied by a doctor's note). The workflow process will obtain the approval of the instructor, the department chair, and the academic dean of the student's school. When approved, the instructor will report the I notation through the grading portal. Incompletes must be made up during the fol lowing quarter. An Incomplete will always remain on a student's transcript. When the final grade is received, it will be posted alongside the I notation. It is in the student's best interest not to accumulate too many I's on his/her permanent record. In progress (IP) grade notation An IP (In Progress) notation indicates that the course has a duration of more than a single term and will be completed by the student no later than the final term of the course, not to exceed five quarters for independent stud y and research courses (original quarter of registration plus four additional quarters). The student's final grade will be reported at the end of the term in which the course is completed. If the course work in not completed within the five -quarter time limit, a grade of UW (Unofficial Withdrawal) will be given. Students with an IP in one or more courses will automatically be registered for either CREG 900 Continuing Registration/Load Validation Eligible or CREG 901 Continuing Registration (based on the t ype of course that is In Progress) for the following term, and the enrollment fee will be charged. If registration is not completed by obtaining financial clearance each term, the registration will be dropped and the IP notation will be changed to a UW (Un official Withdrawal) on the student's permanent transcript. To obtain academic credit for courses with a UW, the student will be required to reregister for the course the next time it is taught. COMMENCEMENT Commencement events occur at the close of the spring Quarter (May/June) and include the formal presentation of candidates and the conferring -of-degrees ceremony by the president. Candidates presented at this event include (1) students who have completed the requirements for degrees since the preceding conferring -of-degrees ceremonies, and (2) students who meet the requirements for participation in the commencement ceremony that have been established by the school in which they are enrolled. A student who completes the requirements for a degree at the end of the Summer, Fall, or Winter quarter is invited to participate in subsequent commencement events. The official date of graduation on the diploma is the last day of the quarter in which the requirements for a degree are completed. 38 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY Superior academic p erformance is recognized for persons who complete their baccalaureate degree and who at the end of the quarter preceding their final quarter have acquired a cumulative grade point average for all college work \u2014including undergraduate course work taken at ot her colleges/universities, but excluding remedial courses \u2014as follows: Graduation cum laude: Graduation magna cum laude: 3.8 Graduation summa cum laude: 3.9 Although the official commencement program indicates names of graduates who qualify for honors on the basis of their grade point average as of the end of the quarter preceding their final quarter, the subsequently issued diploma and transcript may indicate graduation with honors if the student's final quarter record has increased the grade point av erage sufficiently to qualify for honors at that time. UNIVERSITY RECORDS University Records maintains the official academic records of all students at LLU. Requests for inspecting records should be made in writing to University Records. The director of the office has forty -five days to fulfill this request; however, requests are usually granted within two weeks. Any questions students may have concerning academic standing within the University should be directed to their academic advisor or the dean of t heir school. University Records is responsible for the registration process, verification of student enrollment (including veteran's benefits and loan deferments), \"good student\" insurance discounts, and the evaluation of undergraduate transfer credit. For information regarding registration, adding or dropping courses, deadlines, etc., the registration dates and deadlines posted on the Web and student registration portals should be consulted. University Records office hours Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday: 8:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Wednesday: 12:10 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. Friday: 8:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Custodians of education records The following is a list of the types of records that the University maintains, their locations, and their custodians. Types Locat ion Custodian Admissions records Admissions office of the school to which application was made Admissions officer Cumulative academic record University Records Student Services Center Director of University Records Student Handbook 39 11139 Anderson Street School -based academic records Office of the school dean School dean Financial records Office of Student Finance Student Services Center 11139 Anderson Street Director of Student Finance Disciplinary records Office of the school dean School dean REGIS TRATION It is the student's responsibility to know registration dates and to register on time. E -mails are sent to active student's LLU e -mail account to notify them of the opening of registration each term. Registration dates are published o n the Web and in the student's Registration P ortal. Posted deadlines for registration and change of registration are in effect and binding. The school will not intercede to obtain a variance. Registration for the standard fall term begins one week before Labor Day wee kend. Registrations for the standard Winter, Spring, and Summer quarters begin one week before finals week of the preceding quarter. Students are expected to complete registration online. Students should plan to register early during the registration perio d for those registration activities, such as independent study title request forms, that require processing time. Students are directed to the Registration Portal, which provides important registration dates and a list of items that must be completed prio r to enrolling in courses. After signing up for courses, registration is completed by obtaining financial clearance, which can also be done through the Registration Portal. A late registration period exists \u2014beginning at least a week prior to the beginning of the quarter and extending until 10 percent of the quarter has passed \u2014during which a late registration fee will be charged. (Always check the Web for specific dates of registration since they vary during some terms due to program and holiday schedules.) Students may not attend class without being registered. No credit is granted for academic work done during any quarter without registration. Change in registration A registration change during regular and late registration can be accomplished by \"unclea ring\" finances in the Registration Portal, making the desired change in courses, and then clearing finance again. A change in registration after the close of late registration, dealing with either dropping courses or adding condensed courses that have not yet started, requires obtaining signatures on and submitting an add/drop registration form to University Records. Changes in registration after the second week affect the student's grade record. Course changes A student may add courses with standard quar ter dates during the first seven calendar days of the quarter. Students may drop courses with standard quarter dates during the first fourteen days of the quarter without academic or financial penalty. Course changes after the fourteenth day of the quarter affect the permanent grade record. Prior to the fourteen calendar days before 40 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY the final examination week for a course with standard quarter dates, students may withdraw with a \"W\" notation on their transcript; after that time, withdrawals are no longer pe rmitted. The schedule for withdrawing from courses will be altered for courses that meet less than the full quarter (e.g., summer courses). The specific dates for adding or dropping courses are listed each quarter in the online LLU course schedule found a t <llu.edu/students > in the Academic Life section. A student ID badge is required when conducting business in the Student Services Center. Financial clearance All students must clear with the Office of Student Finance to finalize registration each term. Courses will be dropped automatically for students who have not obtained financial clearance by the last day of late registration. Financial clearance may be obtained by requesting clearance each quarter via the Registration Portal. In order to receive cred it for a specific class, a student must be enrolled in courses and financially cleared by the final date to add courses. Re-entrance A student who discontinues studies at the University for more than two quarters and who wishes to return must reapply, un less on an approved leave of absence. Students reapplying may be required to meet the entrance requirements effective at the time of re -entrance. An application fee is part of the process. If additional course work has been taken or degrees earned since la st enrollment at Loma Linda University, then official transcripts are required. Other supplementary documents may be needed. Specif ic information regarding the re -entrance process can be obtained from school admissions office in conjunction with the Office of University Admissions. Personal leave of absence A leave of absence is defined as an approved interruption of course work or academic responsibilities. It may be as long as one year. The appropriate leave of absence form must be initiated through the workflow process found online at <llu.edu/students > under the Academic Life tab in the Academic Forms section. This workflow is to be approved by the dean or his/her designee prior to the student's departure. Stipulations for re -entry are given to the stu dent in writing. A leave of absence will interrupt health -care coverage provided by the Student Health Plan. Before taking the leave, the student should consult the Department of Risk Management Student Health Plan Office regarding the process for maintain ing health coverage during the leave period. Students who have financial aid must contact the Office of Financial Aid to determine any ramifications of the absence. Administrative withdrawal Students who fail to make arrangements for a leave of absence an d continuing registration may be administratively withdrawn from school. Information regarding the period of inactivity allowed prior to administrative withdrawal can be obtained from the Office of the Dean. Student Handbook 41 CATALOG in effect for degree requirements Subj ect to department approval, students may complete degree requirements outlined in any CATALOG in effect during the time they are enrolled as accepted students in a school. However, students who have been on leave of absence for more than one year, or who f ailed to register without leave of absence (consult Office of the Dean regarding number of terms), may be required to re -enter the program under the CATALOG in effect at the time of re -entry\u2014with the exception of students who are on leave from a school to pursue a medical or dental degree at this University. Such students may complete their program under their original CATALOG. Leave of absence A student who wishes to withdraw for a term or longer initiates a workflow request for leave of absence, indicat ing the reason and the length of time needed to be out of the program. One year is the maximum leave time granted. This request requires the approval of the student's department and the dean. Stipulations for re -entry are given the student in writing. Students who fail to make arrangements for a leave of absence and continuing registration may be administratively withdrawn after two terms of inactivity. Academic advisement Upon admission into a degree program, each student is assigned an academic advisor , a faculty member in the student's major department who serves as the student's first line of communication in addressing professional and personal successes and potential challenges. Faculty advisors are prepared to discuss career opportunities, academic policies, academic problems, curriculum, and personal circumstances. It is the student's responsibility to consult with his/her advisor in planning the program of study. Thereafter, advisees should schedule counseling sessions with their advisors to moni tor progress and assure completion of degree requirements. When questions arise relating to curriculum or policy requirements, students should always refer first to the CATALOG and their own degree compliance report (DCR). Next, they may seek counsel from their academic advisor. Questions arising after discussion with the advisor should be referred to the department chair or the academic dean. Orientation and advisement sessions are scheduled for all new students. These sessions provide general guidance re garding student services, health care, library resources, safety and security, registration procedures, and academic policy. Loma Linda University is a health sciences university; and most students are required to participate in clinical facilities, many of which require criminal background checks. Because of this, all programs at the University require accepted students to complete and pass a background check prior to matriculation. Should students fail a background check, it may compromise their ability to proceed in the program. Transcripts Loma Linda University transcripts may be issued to students or designated receivers upon the student's request. Transcripts given to a student will be marked as Issued to Student . All requests 42 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY for transcripts are to be submitted electronically. Details are available at <llu.edu/students/university -records/transcript -request.php >. Transcripts contain only courses taken at Loma Linda University. Diplomas, transcripts, and statements of completion will be issued only fo r students whose financial obligations to the University have been met. Students taking courses concurrently at other institutions of higher learning must plan to have an up -to-date official transcript received by LLU to clear registration holds. Final of ficial transcripts must be received prior to the last quarter of registration at LLU to facilitate the timely posting of degrees. Official transcripts are received at <admissions.app@llu.edu > or sent to Admissions Processing, Loma Linda University, 11139 A nderson Street, Loma Linda, CA 92350. Transcripts from other institutions are considered official only when sent directly to the University from the issuing institution. Transcripts received from students are used for unofficial evaluations only. FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS A ND PRIVACY ACT As of January 3, 2012, the U.S. Department of Education's FERPA regulations expand the circumstances under which a student's education records and the personally identifiable information (PII) contained in such records \u2014including Social Security number, grades, or other private information \u2014may be accessed without the student's consent. First, the U.S. Comptroller General, the U.S. Attorney General, the U.S. Secretary of Education, or state and local education authorities ( \"federal and state authorities\") may authorize access to a student's records and PII by any third party designated by a federal or state authority to evaluate a federal - or state - supported education program. The evaluation may relate to any program that is \"principally engaged in the provision of education,\" such as early childhood education or job training; as well as any program that is administered by an education agency or institution. Second, federal and state authorities may, without a student's conse nt, authorize access to the student's education records and PII by researchers performing certain types of studies \u2014in certain cases even when the University objects to or did not request such research. Federal and state authorities must obtain certain use -restriction and data -security promises from the entities that they authorize to receive a student's PII, but the authorities need not maintain direct control over such entities. In addition, in connection with statewide longitudinal data systems, state authorities may collect, compile, permanently retain, and share without the student's consent PII from the student's education records; and these authorities may track the student's participation in education and other programs by linking such PII to other pe rsonal information about the student that they obtain from other federal or state data sources \u2014including workforce development, unemployment insurance, child welfare, juvenile justice, military service, and migrant student records systems. Copies of the Fa mily Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) of 1974, amendments subsequent to this act, and the Department of Health and Human Services guidelines are available in the Office of the Dean of each school and in the Office of the Dean of Student Affairs. The remainder of this section describes Loma Linda University's policy for meeting the requirements of FERPA. Student Handbook 43 Definitions Student: any per son who attends or has attended.

Access m ust be given in forty -five days or less from the receipt of the request. When a record contains information about more than one student, the student may inspect and review only the records that relate to him/her. Right of University to refuse access Lom a Linda University reserves the right to refuse to permit a student to inspect the following records: financial statement of the student's parents; 44 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY letters and statements of recommendation for which the student has waived his/her right of access, or tha t were placed on file before January 1, 1975; records connected with an application to attend Loma Linda University or a component unit of Loma Linda University if that application is denied; and those records that are excluded from the FERPA definition of education records. Refusal to provide copies Loma Linda University reserves the right to deny transcripts or copies of records not required to be made available by the FERPA in any of the following situations: 1. The student has an unpaid financial obl igation to the University. 2. There is an unresolved disciplinary action against the student. Fees for copies of records If a student desires copies of material in his/her file, these will be provided at a charge of $1 per page. Disclosure of education rec ords Loma Linda University will disclose information from a student's education records only with the written consent of the student, except: 1.

To the U.S. Armed Forces as required by federal law so that representatives of the service branches may contact students about military service opportunities upon graduation. Record of requests for disclosure The University will maintain a record of all requests for and/or disclosure of information from a student's education records. The record will indicate the name of the party making the request, any additional party to whom it may be redisclosed, and the legitimate interest the party had in requesting or obtaining the information. The record may be reviewed by the eligible student. Directory information The University has classified the following as student directory information that may be released: name, address (permanent and local), picture, marital status, birth date, school, program, class, previous college, and telephone number \u2014unless the student specifically requests in writing that the information not be released. Directory information will be released only by the academic dean' s office of the school in which the student is enrolled. All requests for directory information received by all other offices of the University will be transferred to the appropriate school office. Correction of education record The University provides a n opportunity for students to challenge records that may be thought to be inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise inappropriate. The procedure for challenge is as follows: 1. The first action will be informal discussion. 2. If this does not prove satisfactory, th e student may submit a written statement to be attached to the file copy, making his/her position clear. 46 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY 3. If further action is needed, the student may make a request in writing to the administrative officer responsible for the records, requesting that the p ortion of the records in question be expunged or altered, together with the reason for the request. This administrative officer will process the request through the dean of the school. 4. The final procedure is an appeal to the executive committee of the stud ent's school. This must be accomplished within a reasonable period of time. Except during vacation periods when appropriate officers may not be available, a reasonable period is construed as being no longer than fifteen working days. The decision of the ap peal will be rendered in writing. Student Handbook 47 SECTION V UNIVERSITY POLICIES48 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY University Policies PROFESSIONAL STANDAR DS The health - and science -related professions are proud of their traditional reputation for honesty and integrity. These virtues are essential for ea ch member if these professions are to continue to maintain their position of trust within society. The establishment of codes of ethics, peer review committees, ethics committees, and other regulatory and/or advisory groups within the professions indicate a vital and continuing concern with maintaining high standards of integrity. Professional standards provide a means of educating and training future professionals in areas of ethical activity and are intended to aid in developing an ethical and moral awar eness that will help the individual serve in an enlightened manner. In addition, the University seeks to broaden students' ethical perspectives by including a religious perspective not always found in ethical codes. By adding a spiritual foundation to the profession's ethical framework, it is anticipated that the professional's ethic will be a more completely informed ethic \u2014one that not only reflects a proper concern for one's fellow human beings, but one that also reflects an intimate relationship with God , our Creator. Students must conduct themselves at all times in a manner representative of their profession and school. Students share responsibility for maintaining an environment conducive to learning. Any activity that interferes with the learning proce sses vital to the practice of the chosen profession or that violates the integrity of the profession as a whole is not acceptable. The following list is illustrative of the type of conduct that violates the University's expectation for student conduct and is cause for discipline up to and including dismissal. It is not an exhaustive or all -inclusive list but is stated here for purposes of illustration. Failure to respect individual rights. This includes (a) physically or verbally abusing any person or en gaging in conduct that threatens or endangers the health or safety of others; (b) obstructing or disrupting the study of others; the performance of official duties by University personnel; teaching, research, disciplinary, administrative, or other function s of the University, or other authorized activities on University premises; and (c) slander and libel. Disrespect for individual and University property, including theft and vandalism. Refusal or failure to remediate documented unsatisfactory performance. Personal conduct that is incompatible with the standards of morality and propriety of the Seventh -day Adventist Church. Overt disharmony, subversion, or violation of the philosophy, objectives, and policies of the University \u2014including those delineated i n this handbook. Gambling or betting. Failure to obey, honor, and sustain civil law. Arrogance and insubordination. Patient abuse. Student Handbook 49 Professional ethics consistent with the Christian understanding of the value and importance of all persons should be ref lected in the relationships students develop with each of their patients. While clinical activities will rightfully be focused on learning, the patient's needs should always be the primary concern. Altruism must be learned and practiced from the earliest moment of the student's program and reinforced in all aspects of the professional training. Patient abuse will not be tolerated. Patient abuse includes any behavior or act that might jeopardize the health or well -being of a patient. Examples of patient mis treatment or abuse include but are not limited to: unsupervised and/or unauthorized treatment of a patient; treating a patient while the student is under the influence of alcohol or drugs; failure to comply with clinic policies regarding patient treatme nt and documentation; failure to comply with established protocols for infection control; refusal to properly treat any patient for reasons of gender, race, color, religion, sexual orientation, national origin, financial status, handicap, or disability; patient abandonment; any breach of confidentiality, except as required by law or University policy; failure to report an observed incidence of patient mistreatment or abuse. ALCOHOL, CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES, AND TOBA CCO Drug -free environment As stated i n its motto, \"to make man whole,\" Loma Linda University is committed to providing a learning environment conducive to the fullest possible human development. The University holds that a lifestyle that is free of alcohol, tobacco, and recreational/illegal d rugs is essential for achieving this goal. University policy is that all students are expected to refrain from the use of tobacco, alcohol, and other recreational or unlawful drugs during the period of their enrollment at the University. Reasons for this p olicy include evidence that even small amounts of alcohol retard response times and can cloud judgment, and the fact that a high percentage of accidents and crimes (including crimes of victimization and abuse) occur while the perpetrators are under the inf luence of alcohol or drugs. In addition, available data indicate that 14 percent of individuals who choose to use alcohol will, at some point, become problem drinkers. This policy is consistent with the beliefs and teachings of the Seventh -day Adventist Ch urch that promote a healthy lifestyle. Students are notified of the University's abstinence policy during the application process and are responsible for complying with this policy while they are enrolled in the University. Failure to comply with this poli cy will result in discipline up to and including dismissal. DRUG - AND ALCOHOL -TESTING POLICY Loma Linda University may require drug testing of students for clinical requirements and/or reasonable suspicion of impairment, which may occur at any time while the student is enrolled. Students must sign an acknowledgment that they are aware of this requirement; as well as consent to comply with this requirement of testing for alcohol, drugs, and controlled 50 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY substances. Throughout the testing process, students' pr ivacy and confidentiality shall be maintained. Nonnegative drug test outcomes will result in additional testing of the original sample to assure accuracy. In the event of confirmed positive test results, the student must be seen by a qualified medical exam iner/certified substance abuse professional to determine if there is a valid explanation. These results will then be reported to the Office of Student Affairs in the requesting school. The Office of Student Affairs may follow up with referral for assessmen t and recommend treatment for students who test positive. A student enrolled in a mandated treatment program will be subject to the requirements of that program. A positive drug test may result in disciplinary action up to and including suspension or dismi ssal. Prevention The University provides an educational program to help students develop an awareness of the risks involved in alcohol, tobacco, and drug use; and to promote the benefits of a lifestyle free of these substances. Schools within the Univers ity may, at their discretion, provide therapeutic assistance for students who have demonstrated impaired function because of abuse of these substances. Detection The University reserves the right to investigate any student where reasonable suspicion exis ts of drug or alcohol involvement. This includes the right to search a personal office, locker, on - campus vehicle or residence hall room, or personal property; and the right to require an appropriate drug test and confirmation by a retest. If a search is t o be made, it must be authorized by the residence hall director, the dean or associate dean of a school, or the Loma Linda University vice president for student services. If unlawful possession of a controlled substance or drug paraphernalia is discovered , the University will confiscate the item(s), investigate the circumstances, and institute disciplinary actions. Initial identification of substance use or abuse may be made by a supervisor, faculty member, student colleague, or by self -referral from the u ser. Confidentiality All drug and alcohol investigation and drug testing information is confidential and should be treated as such by anyone who is authorized to have access to such records. Assessment All assessments of substance use or abuse will be p erformed by a qualified professional. If there is reasonable suspicion of impairment or substance abuse, a suspension may be mandated until assessment is completed. Treatment and relapse prevention Students who suspect that they may have a problem with s ubstance abuse or dependence are encouraged to seek professional help through one of the confidential assessment and counseling programs available to students. Students who choose to self -refer because of substance abuse or dependency problems can call the University Student Assistance Plan (SAP) directly for an Student Handbook 51 assessment and intervention. The assessment and any subsequent treatment will be kept confidential by the counseling center or SAP. When students self -refer, the school within which the student is e nrolled will not be notified. If the student does not self -refer but is assessed to have a chemical dependency where treatment is an appropriate option, s/he may be required to enroll in an outpatient or inpatient treatment program as a condition of furth er enrollment. The individual will be required to furnish evidence of compliance with the formulated plan of treatment. The treatment recommendations range from required attendance at community 12 -step meetings and/or other treatment groups, individual out patient counseling, or an inpatient treatment program. Random drug screening is a normal part of the treatment and follow -up process. A \"positive\" drug screen may require more intensive treatment for that student and/or result in further disciplinary actio n up to and including dismissal. If the student does not comply with the formulated plan of treatment, s/he will be subject to discipline up to and including dismissal. A program of monitoring or testing for substance use may be required to prevent relaps e for students who have a chemical dependency or a record of substance abuse. A recovery contract, including ongoing monitoring and relapse -prevention elements, will be formulated for each student. Each professional school may address relapse prevention in a manner consistent with the way that profession handles impaired professionals. If there is a diversion program already available for members of the profession for which the student is in training, and the program accepts students, the school may refer t he student to that program. If a diversion program is not available, the student will be required to be under the supervision of the Student Assistance Program (SAP) or suitable professionals, as determined by the school. Discipline If a student is invol ved in the use or distribution of drugs, alcohol, or tobacco at an on - or off - campus public or private social event, s/he will be subject to discipline, up to and including dismissal. In situations where there is a reasonable belief that a violation of law has occurred, cases may be reported to the appropriate law enforcement agency for investigation and prosecution. ATTENDANCE AND PRESE NTATION AT PROFESSIO NAL MEETINGS DURING SABBATH HOURS Loma Linda University is owned and operated by the Seventh -day Adv entist Church, which holds as a fundamental belief the observance of the Sabbath from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday as a special day for worship, other spiritual activities, and rest from routine secular work (with the exception of essential activitie s such as provision of necessary health care). In recognition of this relationship and irrespective of the nature of their own religious commitment, all faculty members, staff, and students of LLU are requested to refrain from attendance or presentation at secular professional meetings in the name of Loma Linda University on the Sabbath (as defined previously). Faculty members, staff, and students of the University who are not members of the Seventh -day Adventist Church and who choose to attend or present a t secular professional meetings on the Sabbath (as defined previously) may 52 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY do so at their own personal expense and at their own discretion, but they are requested not to identify themselves publicly with Loma Linda University. These guidelines apply only to secular professional meetings and do not preclude faculty members, staff, and students of Loma Linda University from attending or participating in meetings arranged by any official Seventh -day Adventist organization in which their professional expertise may be desired and is appropriate or helpful on the Sabbath day. Funding for such attendance may be from University sources, from the official Seventh -day Adventist organization sponsoring the meeting, or at personal expense. Attendance or participation of Seventh -day Adventist faculty members, staff, or students as representatives of Loma Linda University at meetings on the Sabbath that have a spiritual focus and are arranged by organizations other than official Seventh -day Adventist organizations, is at the discretion of the individual with consideration of the focus of the meeting and his/her own spiritual ministry, and the spiritual setting of the meetings. Such attendance should have prior approval of the department head and dean or other appropriate senior University administrator. Funding for such attendance may be from University sources (through normal approval channels), from the organization sponsoring the meeting, or at personal expense. Faculty, staff, or students who are not members of the Sev enth -day Adventist Church are, of course, free to attend or participate in meetings with a spiritual or other focus on the Sabbath at their own discretion, unless officially representing the University (in which case, such participation should be reviewed by the dean of the school). COMMUNICABLE DISEASE TRANSMISSION PREVENT ION Loma Linda University is committed to providing a healthy environment for learning through a comprehensive program to prevent communicable disease using the latest scientific informa tion and procedures. This includes educating individuals regarding the reduction of communicable disease transmission, and the need for immunizations. The University will comply with state and federal regulations on communicable disease -transmission preven tion and will maintain high legal and ethical standards to protect the confidentiality of individuals with communicable diseases, as well as their right for compassionate care \u2014regardless of disease condition. Premises The transmission of communicable infe ctions can occur from patient to provider, provider to patient, and patient to patient. Preventive measures must, therefore, include providers and patients. A comprehensive communicable disease transmission -prevention policy must address the following inf ectious agents: 1. Blood -borne viruses \u2014such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and human immunodeficiency virus 2. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, including drug -resistant infections 3. -preventable diseases \u2014such as chickenpox, measles, rubella, and mumps 4. Acute, in termittent, and chronic bacterial or viral infections that are transmitted from person to person Student Handbook 53 Certain core infection control measures \u2014such as hand washing and universal standard precautions \u2014must be practiced appropriately in every patient care situation . Specific techniques to prevent inadvertent exposure of high -risk patients to infectious agents are often mandated by state and federal regulations. Education of all health -care providers on the risks of communicable disease transmission and effective in fection control techniques is critical to achieve a safe environment for health -care provider and patient alike. Policies regarding the admission, appointment, curriculum choices, or completion of matriculation for students or faculty who have communicable diseases will follow the most current scientific evidence and recommendations. Counselors guiding these individuals will make every effort to provide reasonable accommodation for the safe care of patients, students, faculty, and staff. Procedures The Univ ersity shall maintain a standing communicable disease committee, including representatives from the Loma Linda University Medical Center and the Student Health Service, whose members will develop regulatory guidelines, procedures, and educational modules t hat apply throughout the University and affect every student, faculty, and staff. This includes required immunizations, confidentiality, state and federal regulations, civil rights, and provisions for testing, treating, and counseling. Each school will imp lement these elements. The University's communicable disease committee is responsible for keeping abreast of the most current and reliable information and shall provide direction to the deans and committees of the various schools. Care providers \u2014whether students, faculty, or staff \u2014who do not follow recommended infection control policies and practices and are deemed to be a potential and serious hazard to patients and others will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action. These may include, but are not limited to, dismissal or restriction of clinical practice, which will be determined on a case -by-case basis by the responsible school or department. Each school is responsible for applying the guidelines of the communicable disease committee. Each school shall designate an individual from the school to serve as a liaison between the communicable disease committee and the Student Health Service. Each school shall cooperate with the clinical facilities or practice sites by encouraging students, faculty, and staff to attend training courses on infection control offered by the clinical facilities or practice sites. The clinical facilities or practice sites used by the schools shall have similar communicable disease policies and procedures and provisions for imp lementation. The University shall publish its communicable disease policy on its website. The following resources are available to students, faculty, and staff: 54 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY LOMA LINDA UNIVERSIT Y AND MEDICAL CENTER RESOURCES Student Health Service 909/558 -8700 Department of Epidemiology 909/558 -6115 Procedure following occupational exposure to blood/body fluids If a student is exposed to another person's blood or body flui d (e.g., through a needle -stick injury or mucous membrane splash), s/he should take the following steps: 1. Remove the soiled clothing and wash the exposed area with soap and water. 2. Notify attending physician, resident, charge nurse, or site coordinator. 3. Obtain the name and medical record number of the source patient. 4. At LLUMC, report to LLUMC Emergency Department for evaluation and treatment. (If the exposure occurs at an off -campus site, present to the designated department at that site). It is vital that t his be done in a timely manner. The Center s for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that treatment be obtained within two hours. If it is not possible to meet this timeline, treatment and evaluation should still be obtained as soon as possible. Durin g this visit to the designated department for immediate intervention, the following will occur: a. A risk assessment will be performed. This assessment will evaluate the type of exposure the student received and the benefits of treatment. Baseline blood test ing will be performed. b. The student will be given instruction regarding the procedures to be followed for discovering the source patient's infectious status. If the patient's status is not known, hospital personnel will ask the patient for consent for HIV b lood testing; and specimens will be obtained to screen for HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. The student should not ask the patient for this consent or for information. The source patient should be consented and drawn by hospital personnel other than the student. This should be managed by the person originally notified by the student about the exposure. c. Information will be provided to assist the student in making an informed decision regarding postexposure prophylaxis. d. Vaccinations will be updated as nec essary. 5. If the exposure occurs while the student is at an off -campus site (including the VA, Riverside County, etc.), steps 1 -3 above should be followed, and the student should report to the location designated by that site for postexposure assessment an d treatment.

DISABILITY ACCOMMODA TION POLICY Introduction Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 states that: \"No o therwise qualified person with a disability in the United States ... shall, solely by reason of ... disability, be denied the benefits of, or be excluded from participation in, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal f inancial assistance.\" Loma Linda University supports the integration of all qualified individuals into the programs of the University and is committed to full compliance with all laws regarding equal opportunity for all students with a disability. At LLU, students, faculty, deans or dean's designee, department chairs, and the Grievance Committee on Students with Disabilities all play a joint role in ensuring equal access to campus facilities and programs. Student Handbook 61 Definitions An \"individual with a disability\" is som eone with a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more \"major life activities.\" Physical or mental impairments include, for example, specific learning disabilities, emotional or mental illness, visual impairments, deafness and hear ing impairments, mobility impairments, and some chronic illnesses. \"Major life activity\" means functions such as caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, working, and learning. A person is considered to be an individual with a disability and protected by the law if s/he has the disability, has a record of having the disability, or is regarded as having the disability. A \"qualified person with a disability\" means an individual who, with reasonable modificati ons or \"accommodations\" (if necessary) to rules, policies or practices, the removal of barriers, or the provision of auxiliary aids and services meets the eligibility requirements for receipt of services and participation in programs or activities. \"Accomm odation\" refers to a change in the status quo. A \"reasonable accommodation\" in the student setting is a modification or adjustment to a course, program, activity, or building that allows the person with a disability to participate as fully as possible in t he programs and activities offered by the University. Overview Students with disabilities are required to meet the same academic standards as other students at the University. Services that may be provided students with disabilities include, but are not limited to, advocacy and disability advising, classroom and testing accommodations, sign language interpreting, housing accommodations, taped/scanned books, assistive technology training, referral for testing or additional services, and an orientation worksh op on services for incoming students. At LLU, the dean's office of the school in which the student is enrolled is responsible for evaluating and maintaining all disability records for students with disabilities. The dean's office arranges for determining e ligibility for services and provides verification of the disability based on the evaluation that the student may use to acquire a needed accommodation for specific courses. Students identify themselves to the dean's office at the individual school to reque st services or accommodations. Documentation of a disability is required. All information regarding a disability is considered confidential. A student is responsible for making arrangements for accommodations by providing his or her instructors with a let ter from the dean's office requesting the approved accommodations. Faculties are responsible for implementing accommodations as outlined in the dean's letter. (See \"Accommodation Requests\" below.) School deans and department chairs ensure that faculty and students are informed about Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which states: \"No otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States... shall, solely by reason of his or her disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance and that faculty fulfill their roles in assisting with approved accommodations.\" 62 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY Only deans or their designees have the right to waive, substitute, or adjust course or degree requirements. The vice president for enrollment management and student services resolves conflicts in the provision of reasonable accommodations or denial of accommodations by the dean's office. Each school s hall have a grievance committee appointed and charged with reviewing the student's complaints regarding disability policies and procedures. The members of the grievance committee shall be appointed by the vice president for enrollment management and studen t services. Members of the grievance committee shall be comprised of faculty, staff, and administrators in a variety of specialized areas \u2014including but not limited to health care, counseling and educational psychology, educational assessment and measuremen t, disability issues, and student advisement from the school in which the student is enrolled. The committee shall primarily comprise faculty and staff from the school in which the student is enrolled. Accommodation requests It is only through a student's voluntary disclosure of disability and request for accommodation that LLU can support disability -related needs. At LLU, disabled students who wish to request services or accommodations for their disabilities must identify themselves to the dean's office of the school where the specific course is taught. Students must submit a request in writing to the dean's office of the school in which they are enrolled. A disclosure of disability or request for accommodations made to a faculty or staff member will not be treated as a request for accommodations. Requests for services or accommodations should be made as early as possible to allow time to review requests and documentation. The dean's office will evaluate the medical documentation and determine a student's el igibility for services. If further physician, psychologist, or other qualified specialist documentation is needed, the dean's office will notify the student of such and the time frames by which the necessary supporting documentation must be provided. If a student is approved by the dean's office to receive certain services or accommodations, the dean's office will prepare a letter setting out the approved services or accommodations to be provided to the student for specific courses. It is the student's responsibility to present a copy of the deans' letter of approved accommodations to his or her instructors and make the necessary arrangements to receive the approved accommodations. The faculty will provide students with the approved accommodations. Only scho ol deans or their designees have the right to waive, substitute, or adjust course or degree requirements. If the dean's office denies a disabled student's request for accommodations, the dean's office will notify the student in writing of the denial and th e reason for the denial. The student may informally resolve the denial by meeting with the dean within fourteen calendar days of the denial of the requested accommodations, or the student may file a formal grievance with the vice president for enrollment m anagement and student services within sixty calendar days from the date the student knew or could reasonably be expected to know of the action that is the subject of the complaint. Within fourteen calendar days of receiving the student's written complaint or grievance, the vice president for enrollment management and student services, Student Handbook 63 will initiate the resolution process by assigning someone to investigate the complaint or appoint a grievance committee to resolve the matter. Documentation requirements Stude nts requesting accommodations are required under ADA and Section 504 to submit to the dean's office documentation to verify eligibility. Disability documentation must include a written evaluation from a physician, psychologist, or other qualified specialis t that establishes the nature and extent of the disability and includes the basis for the diagnosis and the dates of testing. The documentation must establish the current need for an accommodation. The type of documentation will vary according to the disa bility. Documentation may need to be updated or augmented in order to be reviewed more fully. Students who submit documentation that does not meet the guidelines will be required to send an updated evaluation before being considered for services. The afore mentioned guidelines are provided so that the University can respond appropriately to the individual needs of the student. The dean's office reserves the right to determine eligibility for services based on the quality of the submitted documentation. Docum entation confidentiality will be observed, as described in \"Confidentiality\" below. Determining accommodations Appropriate documentation of the disability must be provided so that the dean's office can determine the student's eligibility and the appropria te accommodations. Accommodations are determined on a case -by-case basis, taking into account the learning needs of the student, the requirements of the learning task, the course standards and essential requirements, and the educational environment. At LLU , the determination of appropriate and reasonable accommodations is based on approved documentation and through interaction with the student. Specifically, accommodations are determined by the dean's office in consultation with the student and may involve input from the faculty and staff, as needed. Determining how students are to be evaluated in a course is an example of an area where faculty input would be solicited. In reviewing the specific accommodations requested by the student or recommended by the p hysician/evaluator, the dean's office may find that while a recommendation is clinically supported, the requested/recommended accommodations may not be the most appropriate \u2014given the requirements of a particular student's academic program and the program's technical standards. Confidentiality The University recognizes that student disability records contain confidential information and are to be treated as such. Therefore, documentation of a student's disability is maintained in a confidential file in the dean's office and is considered part of the student's education record. Information related to a disability may be disclosed only with the permission of the student or as permitted by the University's student records policy and federal law. At the same tim e, however, a student's right to privacy must still be balanced against the University's need to know the information in order to provide requested and recommended services and accommodations. Therefore, in the interest of serving the needs of the student, the provision of 64 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY services may involve the vice president for enrollment management and student services' staff disclosing disability information provided by the student to appropriate University personnel participating in the accommodation process. The am ount of information that may be released is determined on a case -by-case basis and will be made in accordance with the University's policy on student records. Implementing accommodations STUDENT GUIDELINES A student who wishes an accommodation is responsib le for obtaining a letter from the dean's office stating that s/he is a qualified individual with a disability. The letter also advises the faculty or staff member of the action required to provide an accommodation for the student. Students are not require d to divulge the nature of their disabilities or provide copies of their disability documentation to faculty or staff. Students are responsible for working directly with the faculty or staff member involved in the provision of an accommodation well in adva nce of the start of the term. Contact should be maintained throughout the term. Questions about the provision of reasonable accommodations should be directed to the dean's office. FACULTY AND STAFF GU IDELINES A faculty or staff member is responsible for th e implementation of the accommodation identified in a request letter from the dean's office. Faculty and staff must support approved accommodations. Individually, faculties have a legal responsibility to make sure that each course, when viewed in its entir ety, is accessible according to the approved accommodations. Accessibility, the primary consideration of disability law, should be in the forefront of course and technological planning. Further information on this legal obligation may be obtained from the Office of General Counsel. Faculty are expected to include a notice in the course syllabus referring students to contact the dean's office if they need accommodation related to a disability. Questions regarding the provision of an accommodation or related to offering a course in such a manner that disabilities are accommodated should be addressed to the dean's office. Faculty questions regarding alterations to a course or program should be addressed to the appropriate dean. Denial of accommodation If it is determined that the documentation provided by a student does not support the existence of a disability or the need for an accommodation, the student will be so advised. Students will be given the opportunity to supplement the initial documentation with fu rther information from a physician, psychologist, or other specialist. (See \"Documentation Requirements\" above for required documentation.) The University is not required to provide an accommodation that compromises the essential requirements of a course o r program, imposes an undue financial burden based on the University's overall institutional budget, or poses a threat to the health or safety of the student or others. Student Handbook 65 Student grievance INFORMAL RESOLUTION PROCEDURE Students who disagree with the school' s determination of eligibility, approved academic accommodations, denial of accommodations \u2014or who feel they have been discriminated against, treated differently, harassed, or are operating in a hostile environment based on their disability \u2014are encouraged t o meet with the dean of their school informally to resolve the matter or concern. If a satisfactory solution cannot be reached or if the student wishes to initiate a formal grievance, the student may do so by submitting a written complaint to the vice pres ident for enrollment management and student services. FORMAL RESOLUTION PR OCEDURES A written complaint must be received by the vice president for enrollment management and student services within sixty calendar days from the date the student knew or could reasonably be expected to know of the action that is the subject of the written complaint. Within fourteen calendar days of receiving the student's written complaint or grievance, the vice president for enrollment management and student services will initi ate the resolution process by assigning someone to investigate the complaint or will appoint a grievance committee to resolve the matter. At a minimum, the investigation should include an interview with the complainant, a review of any relevant written mat erials, and an effort to obtain information from relevant individuals (i.e., interviews or written statements or documents). The investigator or grievance committee will report its findings and recommendations to the vice president for enrollment managemen t and student services within sixty days from the day of assignment or appointment. The vice president shall notify the student in writing of the outcome. The decision of the vice president for enrollment management and student services shall be final. OTH ER AVA ILABLE RESOURCE FOR RESOLUTION Students who believe they have been discriminated against by the University based on their disability, or denied their right to reasonable accommodations, may also contact: Office for Civil Rights United States Depart ment of Education 50 Beale Street, Suite 7200 San Francisco, CA 94105 415/486 -5555 <ed.gov> Discipline and appeals In most circumstances, student discipline is governed by the policy of the school in which the student is enrolled. Students should refer to the disciplinary and appeals procedures of their school as set forth in the schools section of this handbook. Where applicable, the school -specific disciplinary and appeals policy will govern such procedures; where school policies seem not to be applicabl e or where none exists, the following policies prevail. 66 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY Disciplinary actions by the administration and faculty normally fall into, but are not limited to, the following categories \u2014based on the seriousness of the infraction of University policies, rules, a nd regulations by students: 1. Warning: cautionary admonition, usually given verbally; 2. Censure: reproof for an infraction; 3. Probation: disciplinary status indicating that a student may be dismissed for continued or repeated misconduct without further commi ttee action; 4. Suspension: exclusion from the University or from a school or a segment of a school's program, for a specific period; 5. Termination at the end of the quarter: actual dismissal but with permission to complete the courses in progress, provided t he student's conduct is acceptable during the interim period; or 6. Dismissal: immediate expulsion from the University for an indefinite period. Disciplinary proceedings are reviewed by the appropriate committee of the school in which the student is enrolle d to determine a student's eligibility for continuance with the University. Students involved in discipline who are enrolled in dual programs must meet the standards of both schools and will have representatives from both schools in the disciplinary procee dings although the procedures of the primary school will be followed. The office of the dean of the school is responsible for the discipline of the students of that school. Disciplinary measures include but are not limited to warning, censure, probation, suspension, termination, and dismissal. It is expected that students will be familiar with the policies and procedures of the school in which they are enrolled relating to discipline and appeal. The dean of the school or his/her designee shall not take di sciplinary action without first notifying the student of the cause and the disciplinary action, as well as the right of appeal. In the case of immediate or continuing danger to the health or safety of other members of the University community or disruption to the functions of the University or the study and work activities of others, the student may be immediately disciplined \u2014in which case, the student will be notified in writing within three working days of the disciplinary action and the right of appeal. Nonacademic discipline Students who demonstrate inappropriate behavior or violate the policies of nonacademic departments on campus, i.e., Drayson Center, residence halls, parking, etc., will be reported to the vice president for enrollment management an d student services with a recommendation for discipline. Appeal process The student who is under discipline and does not believe the discipline is appropriate has the right to request the dean of the school in writing for the disciplinary action to be re viewed by Student Handbook 67 the executive committee or its equivalent in the school in which the student is enrolled. A student who is suspended always has a right to appeal. If a student wishes to request reinstatement or to appeal a disciplinary decision, s/he may reques t a hearing before the appropriate disciplinary committee of the school. The request shall be made in writing to the dean of the school within five school days of the date the decision is communicated to the student. The request shall state the reason why the student is appealing the decision and the facts that support the appeal. The student may appear at the hearing of the appeal to state his/her case and may invite a University faculty member of the school in which the student is enrolled to accompany h im/her to the meeting. The use of legal counsel at the hearing shall not be permitted of either the student or the University. Within five days of the date that the decision of the school's discipline committee is communicated to the student, the student may present a written request to the dean of the school to review the situation. After review, the decision of the dean of the school is final. A student who questions whether the process provided by the school has followed the policy of the school in rega rd to the student's grievance may request the president's office to conduct a review of the process used by the school in responding to the student's academic grievance. A student who has been suspended or dismissed may not return to the University campus during the time the case is being considered without the express permission of the dean of the school or the dean's designee. The student may be given permission to return to talk to members of the faculty or administration during the time the appeal is b eing processed. Students should also refer to their school's specific policies for further information. FREEDOM OF EXPRESSIO N POLICY The policy on freedom of expression is designed to provide information and direction for students and for student organiz ations as they plan and conduct non -classroom -related learning experiences for the academic community. It is designed for the further purpose of maintaining the philosophy and objectives, both educational and spiritual, of this University. The University encourages students as responsible citizens to study contemporary issues and to state their convictions through acceptable modes of expression, such as public discussion, debate, and petition. Those who avail themselves of this privilege are under obligati on to examine controversial issues thoughtfully and to learn the art of reasoned dissent. As individuals or as organized groups, they are expected to conduct themselves responsibly and to respect the basic educational and spiritual goals of the University. Freedom to engage in the exchange of ideas does not, however, include the right to interfere with the regular activities of the University. The University recognizes a concurrent obligation to maintain an atmosphere conducive to academic work, to preserv e the dignity and seriousness of University ceremonies and public exercises, and to respect the private rights of all individuals. Individuals and groups who have an enlightened sense of responsibility are willing to engage in the free examination of viewp oints without hindering others from making progress toward the educational goals to which they were committed when they chose this University. 68 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY Students or student organizations wishing to engage in any public effort using the name of the University or the name of any organization within the University must obtain the permission of the office of the president. GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE Grievances related to sexual harassment, racial harassment, or discrimination against the disabled shall be pursued in accordanc e with University policies specifically relating to these issues. Grievances related to academic matters or other issues covered by specific school policies shall be made pursuant to the policies of the school in which the student is enrolled. A student wh o questions whether the process provided by the school has followed the policy of the school in regard to the student's grievance may request the office of the president to conduct a review of the process used by the school in responding to the academic gr ievance. A student who believes that an error has been made or that s/he has been dealt with in an inappropriate manner by an office or nonacademic department of the University \u2014such as records, student finance, student affairs, health services, Drayson Ce nter, etc. \u2014may seek correction by the following steps: 1. The student may request an appointment and discuss this matter with the department head. The student may put his/her complaint in writing and provide it to the head of the office or department involv ed. The department head may ask the student to put the complaint in writing. The department head will make a decision and provide a written response to the student within fourteen days of receiving the student's written complaint or meeting with the studen t, whichever is later. 2. If the response is not satisfactory to the student, the student may submit the written complaint to the vice president for enrollment management and student services for review. The matter will be considered at the next meeting of t he associate deans' council; and within seven days of the council's consideration of the complaint, the student will be informed in writing of the council's response. INTELLECTUAL PROPERT IES AND DERIVED ROYA LTIES POLICY Students involved in research shou ld consult this policy in the Faculty Handbook . LETTERHEAD, BUSINESS CARDS, AND OFFICIAL STATIONERY POLICY The use of official stationery is limited to those who are employed in the University or are an integral part of the University administrative stru cture. It cannot be used for personal business or to express personal opinions that are not shared by administration in general. University business cards are not available to students, except with the express written approval of their dean. NONDISCRIMINAT ION AND AFFIRMATIVE ACTION POLICY Loma Linda University affirms that Christian principles are not compatible with various forms of discrimination that have divided societies. Loma Linda University further affirms that all persons are of equal worth in the sight of God and that they should be so regarded by all of His Student Handbook 69 people. Moreover, this nation was founded upon the ideals of equal worth of all persons and equal opportunity for each individual to realize his or her fullest potential. Therefore, the Univer sity is committed to teaching and observing the biblical principles of equality. The law does not require Loma Linda University to have a written program of affirmative action; but, in the spirit of the law, the University has issued this program as a gui de to its employees, supporters, and students to enlighten and assist in implementing a policy of affirmative action throughout the University. The University reserves the right to express disagreement from time to time with reference to specific remedies and regulations that may be proposed to eradicate discrimination. A delicate balance must be found between affirmatively seeking to assist those in a discriminated class and providing equal opportunity for all individuals, whether or not in such discrimin ated class. The University is committed to going the second mile and beyond to try to strike this delicate balance. The task is impossible if the only resources are legislation and litigation, but it is possible in an atmosphere of cooperation and understa nding among all concerned. The free exercise of religion guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States includes the right to establish and maintain religious educational institutions. Loma Linda University is incorporated as a California religious n onprofit corporation, owned and operated by the Seventh -day Adventist Church as an integral part of the church's teaching and healing ministries. Federal and state guidelines clearly recognize the right of religious institutions to seek personnel and stude nts who support the goals of the institution, including the right to give preference in employment of faculty and staff and admission of students to members of the church that sponsors the institution. The University is committed to equal education and em ployment opportunities for men and women of all races; and does not discriminate on the basis of disability, sex, race, color or national origin in its education and admissions policies, financial affairs, employment programs, student life and services, or any University -administered program. To this end, the University is in compliance with Titles VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as amended, and substantial compliance with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (45 CFR 106.1et seq.) and Se ctions 503 and 504 of the Rehabilitation Discrimination in Employment Act of l967 and Section 402 of the Vietnam Era Veterans Adjustment Act of 1974; and does not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment on the basis of age or because they are disabled veterans or veterans of the Vietnam era. In addition, the University administers student programs without discrimination on the basis of age, except in those programs where age is a bona fide academic qualification for admission, in accor dance with the provisions of the Age Discrimination Act of 1975. The University reserves constitutional and statutory rights as a religious institution and employer to give preference to Seventh -day Adventists in admissions and employment, including but n ot limited to, 42 USC Secs 2000e -(a); 2000e California Government Code Secs 12926(d)(1); Title 2, Section 7286.5(5) of the Ca lifornia Code of Regulations; the First Amendment to the United States Constitution; and Article I, Sec 4 of the California Constitution. The University believes that Title IX regulations are subject to 70 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY constitutional guarantees against unreasonable entang lement, which are infringements on the religious teachings and practices of the Seventh -day Adventist Church. The University expects students and employees to uphold biblical principles of morality and deportment as interpreted by the Seventh -day Adventist Church. The University claims exemptions from the provisions of the Title IX set forth in 34 CFR Sections 86.21, 86.31, 86.40, and 86.57(b) insofar as they conflict with church teachings and practices of morality, deportment, and appearance. For the prog ram and procedures of affirmative action, please see a copy of the Administrative Handbook , which can be found in the offices of the dean of the school in which the student is enrolled and of the president. Cari M. Dominguez, Chief Talent and Diversity Off icer, is the Title IX coordinator for Loma Linda University. OFF -CAMPUS SPEAKERS POLI CY The University permits recognized student organizations to present speakers and programs representing diverse points of view to inform themselves on issues of contempo rary concern. In presenting issues, the organizations will be expected to have the privilege of questioning the speaker. At the recommendation of the student affairs committee, the meeting shall be chaired by the faculty advisor of the group or by another faculty member. Presentations by off -campus speakers must be in harmony with the mission and goals of this Seventh -day Adventist institution of higher learning. Speakers must neither engage in speech of an inflammatory nature, nor encourage any action tha t is incongruent with University policy or prohibited by federal, state, or local laws; and no speakers may advocate opposition to principles of faith and morals of the Seventh -day Adventist Church. While most speakers could be justified as \"educational,\" efforts should be made to avoid speakers being used solely for \"shock\" or \"spectacle\" purposes. It is important to remember that an institution cannot be wholly disassociated in the public mind from views expressed on its campus. Invitations should come in every instance from a recognized group on campus, a member of the faculty, or a member of the administration. Prior to inviting an off -campus speaker, student organizations must receive prior approval from their dean. An invitation in no way implies the University's approval of what will be said or done by the speaker. Because of the sensitive nature of some presentations, the dean will consult with the president prior to giving permission for an invitation. POLICY PROHIBITING S EXUAL MISCONDUCT AND DISCRI MINATION O N THE BASIS OF SEX (TITLE I X) Policy Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (\"Title IX\") prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in educational programs and activities at institutions receiving federal financial assistance. Loma Lind a University (LLU) is committed to providing a safe and supportive environment that is free from unlawful discrimination on the basis of sex in all of its employment and student activities, educational programs, and services. Any form of sex discrimination or sexual misconduct \u2014including harassment, coercion, in timidation, or sexual violence \u2014is Student Handbook 71 reprehensible; runs counter to LLU's teachings and guiding beliefs; and will not be tolerated. In keeping with this commitment, Loma Linda University maintains a stri ct policy prohibiting discrimination and harassment based on personal characteristics of gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, race, color, religion, national orig in, disability, age, or veteran status. Also prohibited is retaliation of any kind aga inst individuals who report alleged incidents of discrimination or sexual misconduct, or who assist in a University investigation of such allegations. Definition of sexual harassment Sexual harassment is defined as unwelcome sexual advances (including se xual violence), requests for sexual favors, and/or physical, verbal, or written conduct of a sexual nature when: 1. Submission to such conduct is made explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment, education, or participation in LLU's programs or activities; or 2. Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as a basis for decisions pertaining to an individual's employment, education, or participation in LLU's programs or activities; or 3. Such speech or conduct i s directed against another and is abusive or humiliating and persists after the objections of the person targeted by the speech or conduct; or 4. Such conduct would be regarded by a reasonable person as creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive environme nt that substantially interferes with an individual's work, education, or participation in LLU's programs or activities. Examples of sexual harassment Sexual harassment may include incidents between any member of the University community, including faculty and other academic appointees, staff, deans, students, and nonstudents or nonemployee participants in University programs \u2014such as vendors, contractors, visitors, and patients. Specific examples of the verbal or physical conduct prohibited by this policy i nclude, but are not limited to: 1. Physical assault; 2. Inappropriate or unwanted touching; 3. Direct or implied threats that submission to sexual advances will be a condition of educational evaluati on, opportunity, or advancement; 4. Direct or subtle propositions of a sexual nature; 5. Dating, requesting dates, or entering into a romantic relationship between a student and an employee or faculty wherein the employee or faculty is in a position of power or is able to exert influence over the s tudent's educational experie nce; 6. A pattern of conduct that would discomfort and/or humiliate another individual, including, but not limited to: a. Unnecessary touching, 72 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY b. Remarks of a sexual nature ab out a person's clothing or body, c. Remarks about sexual activity or speculations about pre vious sexual exper iences, d. Visual conduct \u2014including leering, sexual gestures, or the display of sexually suggestive objects, pictures, language, cartoons, or jokes. 7. Use of electronic means, including the Internet and e -mail system, to transmit, communicate , or receive sexually suggestive, pornographic, or sexually explicit pictures, messages, or materials. Sexual v iolence Sexual violence involves conduct relating to an actual, attempted, or threatened sexual act with another person without that person's con sent. This definition also includes the coercing, forcing, or attempting to coerce or force a sexual act on another. Examples include \"date rape\" or \"acquaintance rape\", sexual battery, and sexual assault. Acts of sexual violence may also constitute violat ions of criminal or civil law subject to prosecution. Dissemination of policy This policy shall be disseminated to the University community through publications, websites, student orientations, and other appropriate channels of communication. It is the re sponsibility of the Office of the Vice President for Student Services to work with the schools to ensure that the policy is disseminated and implemented. The Office of the Provost is charged with sending an annual letter to all faculty and staff to remind them of the contents of the sexual harassment policy, including the provisions added to it by this policy. LLU also provides a series of resources to students, faculty, and staff to ensure that concerns pertaining to discrimination on the basis of sex, inc luding sexual misconduct, are fully, fairly, and promptly addressed. Cari M. Dominguez, Ph .D., senior vice president for human resources and chief talent and diversity officer, provides oversight and leadership for activities involving Title IX compliance, coordination, and complaint resolution. She can be reached as follows: Cari M. Dominguez, Chief Talent and Diversity Officer Loma Linda University Magan Hall, Room Phone: 909/558 -4787 E-mail: <cadominguez@llu.edu > The director o f employee relations and Title IX coordinator may be reached as follows: Director of Employee Relations and Title IX Coordinator Loma Linda University Human Resources 101 East Redlands Boulevard San ey@llu.edu > The director of employee relations and Title IX coordinator responsibilities include: Coordinating LLU's efforts to ensure compliance with Title IX and governing regulations; Responding promptly and effectively to inquiries, concerns, and com plaints regarding prohibitive behavior under Title IX; Tracking and monitoring incidents relating to allegations of sex discrimination and sexual misconduct; Conducting or overseeing investigations, as appropriate; Providing guidance and training to studen ts and employees about their rights and responsibilities under Title IX; Ensuring that employees and students are fully informed of the grievance process and all other options for resolving complaints and concerns; Coordinating with Campus Security, as a ppropriate, on reported incidents alleging sexual violence; and Identifying and addressing potentially systemic harassment issues or patterns. PROCEDURES FOR REPORTING AND RESPONDING TO COMPLAINTS OF SEX DISCRIMINATION AND/OR SEXUAL MISCONDUCT Loma Lin da University encourages those who believe they have experienced any form of sex discrimination or sexual misconduct of any nature to report such conduct promptly, to seek all available assistance, and to pursue an equitable resolution of the incident(s). Procedures have been established to provide a supportive process for individuals who report discrimination and to ensure an equitable process for individuals accused of discriminatory conduct. These procedures reflect LLU's efforts to conduct timely, thor ough, and equitable investigations, as required by law. Prior to filing a written complaint, a student, employee, or third party may choose to meet with the Title IX coordinator or may choose to bring the matter to the attention of a dean, faculty member, department chair, administrator, manager, clinical instructor, chief resident, or any other individual in a position of direct authority to resolve the issue. These individuals have a duty to take appropriate disciplinary action if they find that universi ty policy has been violated. Mediation or any other form of informal resolution may be appropriate and effective when dealing with certain forms of sexual misconduct. However, the complainant has the right to terminate mediation or any other informal resol ution process at any time, and may opt to proceed with a more formal complaint and investigation. Filing a written c omplaint Individuals are reminded that reporting sexual misconduct is a personal and professional responsibility. The procedure is as follo ws: 74 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY 1. Report the incident, in writing, to the Title IX coordinator or the chief talent and diversity officer. Written complaints should be filed as soon as possible from the date the incident occurred. 2. Written complaints can also be submitted to the dean o f the school in question, administrator, or any other individual in a position of direct authority to address the allegations. 3. To the extent possible, but not limited to, the complainant should provide the following information in the written complaint: a. Name, address, telephone or other contact information b. University affiliation (e.g., student, employee, faculty, third party) c. Date of alleged violation d. Location of alleged violation e. Person(s), name and title, whom the complainant believe s to have committed an act of harassment or to have engaged in sexual misconduct f. Description of complaint g. Other relevant information \u2014if this matter was previously reported , including name and departments of a ll other persons with whom the complainant has discussed this matte r h. Signature and date Duty to investigate and take corrective action Loma Linda University shall conduct a prompt, thorough, and impartial inquiry into any reports of sexual harassment and/or physical sexual misconduct. The University will take immediate a nd appropriate steps to investigate or otherwise take steps that are reasonably calculated to end any form of sexual misconduct, whether or not a formal complaint has been initiated. An investigation should generally be completed within 60 days from the da te a complaint is reported. The University will attempt to obtain consent from the individual filing the complaint before beginning an investigation. However, there may be instances when Loma Linda University may pursue an investigation regardless of the r equest of the complainant, if it deems it necessary to maintain a safe and nondiscriminatory campus environment. In the event a faculty member is accused of sexual misconduct, it will be the responsibility of the dean's office of the school in question, w orking closely with the Title IX coordinator, to investigate, document and take immediate appropriate corrective action. The parties will have the right to provide witnesses, documentation, or other evidence appropriate to substantiate their claims or defe nses. The parties will be provided with periodic status updates during the investigation. Within thirty days of its completion, the parties will receive concurrent notice of the outcome of the investigation, as appropriate. Confidentiality LLU shall protec t the privacy of individuals involved in a report of sexual misconduct to the extent required by law and University policy. Anyone requesting confidentiality shall be Student Handbook 75 informed that complete and total confidentiality may not be possible and that, depending on the nature of the alleged misconduct, some level of disclosure may be required, especially in situations alleging sexual violence. Disclosure may be made only on a need -to-know basis. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) permits the University to disclose the outcome of any student conduct proceedings to the person filing the complaint , without prior written consent , when the disclosure is to the victim of an alleged per petrator of a crime of violence \u2014including physical sexual mi sconduct. FERPA also permits the University to notify the student filing the complaint of any sanctions assigned to another student that may affect him or her. Retaliation prohibited All reasonable action will be taken to prevent retaliation against the c omplainant, witnesses or anyone cooperating with the investigation. Disciplinary action Any member of the University community who is found to have engaged in sexual misconduct is subject to disciplinary action up to and including dismissal. Any manager, supervisor, or designated employee responsible for reporting or responding to incidents of sexual misconduct who knew about such conduct and took no action to stop it or failed to report it shall also be subject to appropriate disciplinary action. Violati ons of this policy by faculty members will be referred to the dean of the school in which the faculty is employed and will be governed by the procedures set forth in the Faculty Handbook. Violations of this policy by staff members in academic units of the University will be taken to the dean of the school employing the staff member and will be governed by the procedures for discipline set forth in the Staff Handbook . Violations of this policy by an employee of a nonacademic unit of the University will be taken to the administrator who makes decisions about the employment status of the accused and will be governed by the procedures for discipline set forth in the Staff Handbook. Violations of this policy by students, including graduate assistants, will be gov erned by the disciplinary procedures in the Student Handbook. Intentionally filing false reports Individuals who make reports that are later found to have been intentionally false or made maliciously without regard for truth may be subject to disciplinary action, including termination. This provision does not apply to reports made in good faith. SEXUAL STANDARDS POLICY Faculty, staff, administrators, trustees, and students of the University are expected in their teaching, influence, and example to uphold Ch ristian sexual standards as held by the Seventh - day Adventist Church. We believe that God's ideal for sexuality is achieved when sexual expression is limited to a man and a woman, who are husband and wife committed in lifelong marriage. All expressions of premarital and extramarital friendship are to be chaste, and behaviors that suggest otherwise are to be avoided. All forms of sexual expression and conduct 76 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY between heterosexuals outside of marriage, or between homosexuals, are contrary to the ideals of the University and will result in disciplinary action. Further, all forms of promiscuity, sexual abuse, and exploitation are contrary to the ideals of the University and will result in disciplinary action. Loma Linda University honors an ideal of sexual puri ty that transcends mere legal enforcements. Romantic relationships and dating The University wishes to promote the ethical and efficient operation of its academic programs and business. In this setting, the University wishes to avoid misunderstandings, com plaints of favoritism, romantic relationship issues pertaining to supervision, security, and morale, as well as possible claims of sex discrimination and sexual misconduct among its students, staff, and faculty. For these reasons: A faculty member is proh ibited from pursuing a romantic relationship with or dating a student who is registered in any course or program or who is involved in any other academic activity in which the faculty member is responsible as an instructor, coordinator, mentor, or committe e member for the duration of such course, program, or other academic activity. A staff member is prohibited from pursuing a romantic relationship with or dating a student who is registered in any course or program or who is involved in any other academic a ctivity in which the staff member participates in any direct supporting role for the duration of such course, program, or other academic activity. A University administrator or supervisor is prohibited from pursuing a romantic relationship with or dating any employee of the University whom s/he supervises for the duration of the supervision.

ACADEMIC INTEGRITY P OLICY Loma Linda Un iversity seeks to educate ethical and competent professionals and scholars who are committed to the practice of honesty and the pursuit of truth. This University is committed to the following fundamental core values: compassion, integrity, excellence, free dom, justice, purity/self -control, and humility. It is expected and understood that students who apply and Student Handbook 77 are admitted to Loma Linda University will be committed to these values and will choose to support them. Personal and professional integrity are ess ential qualities for students and all members of the University community. Upholding the standards of professional and personal conduct includes acquiring behaviors and attitudes consistent with University values. It includes being accountable for one's ow n conduct, as well as assuming responsibility for the professional behavior of one's colleagues. Examples of serious breaches of integrity include, but are not limited to, lying; cheating (including plagiarism); falsifying reports, records, and the result s of research. Other examples that may appear to be minor, but which constitute misrepresentations of truth \u2014and are thus also of concern \u2014include such things as signing someone else's name on an attendance sheet (for a required class or meeting) or signing oneself in as present and then leaving. Assuming responsibility for the professional behavior of one's colleagues means exemplifying integrity oneself, encouraging colleagues to be honest and responsible, and refusing to ignore or cover up serious breaches of integrity such as cheating, stealing, or falsifying records. Society rightfully expects the health -care professions and scientific communities to be self -governing and trustworthy. The process of becoming a member of one of these trusted professions b egins when a student enters the University. Definitions Loma Linda University defines academic integrity as the commitment of all members of the educational community (administration, faculty, students, and staff involved in learning, teaching, research, patient care, or service) to engage in conduct that reflects honesty, trust, fairness, mutual respect, and responsibility (The Center for Academic Integrity, October 1999). Academic dishonesty Academic dishonesty is an act of deliberate deceit in the fulfi llment of a student's obligations to the academic community. It includes, but is not limited to, the failure to observe rules of fairness in taking examinations or writing papers, plagiarism, fabrication, and cheating. Plagiarism is the act of presenting the work of another as if it were one's own. It includes quoting, paraphrasing, summarizing, or utilizing material from the Internet or from books, articles in periodicals, magazines, or newspapers without appropriate citation. However, any unacknowledged use of another's ideas constitutes plagiarism, including the use of papers written by other students, interviews, radio or TV broadcasts, and any published or unpublished materials (e.g., letters, pamphlets, leaflets, notes, or documents). Fabrication is the act of contriving or making up material, data, or other information (e.g., research data, patient test results) and submitting this as fact. Cheating is the act of deceiving, which includes such acts as looking at another's examination during the exam ination, using unauthorized aids (e.g., notes, electronic equipment) to retrieve or communicate information during examinations, or whatever 78 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY else is deemed contrary to the rules of fairness \u2014including violation of specific rules designated by the instructor of the course. Facilitation of academic dishonesty is the act of attempting to help someone engage in plagiarism, fabrication, cheating, or any other type of academic dishonesty. Procedures 1. If any faculty member, employee or student of the University has reason to believe that academic dishonesty or unethical conduct may have occurred, s/he shall report the incident to the appropriate instructor, course director, student affairs or academic administrator of the school. Failure to report breaches of integr ity is considered a failure of academic and/or professional responsibility \u2014and, thus, may be subject to disciplinary action by the University. 2. When allegations of misconduct are made, the faculty member or school administrator is responsible to ensure that a preliminary inquiry is made to determine if the concerns/allegations are substantive. If there appears to be substantive evidence of misconduct, the matter must be reported to the dean or the dean's designee. This central reporting system allows pattern s of behavior to be considered in determining the course of action. A discussion with the accused student will take place before formal action is taken. The student will be informed if records of alleged incidents are to be filed and will have the opportun ity to submit a written response. 3. If the dean or dean's designee determines that formal action should be taken and/or that the matter should be referred to the school's designated academic committee, the student shall be informed in writing. Some schools may have additional procedures/processes for arriving at formal action. In such cases, the school policy will apply. 4. The formal action will be reported to the student by the dean or dean's designee. Where schools do not have other specific policies gover ning these issues, the following process will be used for an appeal: APPEAL OF DISMISSAL The student, after the actions and recommendations of the designated academic committee, may appeal to the dean of the school \u2014who may uphold or modify the sanction(s) recommended by the hearing committee. In all cases, the action of the dean is final. The dean, in sole discretion, shall determine whether the student is suspended pending the final decision of the appeal, or if the student may continue to attend courses and/or conduct clinical activities. PROCEDURAL APPEAL If the student contends that the appropriate procedure was not followed, or if there is new evidence relevant to the decision that was not available to the student during the procedure, the student may make an appeal in writing to the vice president for academic affairs or designee regarding these two issues. If the vice president finds, after consideration of the appeal, that the Student Handbook 79 record of either of these points has merit, the vice president will return the issue to the school for the appropriate procedure or for a hearing on the new evidence. CHAPEL ATTENDANCE AN D DECORUM In keeping with the commitment of the University's mission, students must meet special expectations, such as attendance at required chapel services in the University Church. Students are asked to be respectful and to maintain the decorum fitting of a religious service. Students must refrain from opening or using any electronic equipment, including earphones, during chapel. Studying, i n general, but especially the use of these devices creates a distraction for those who are trying to worship and fosters a culture that is at cross purposes with the reasons for which most students choose to come to a Christian university. PROFESSIONAL ST ANDARDS OF APPEARANC E When a student chooses a career in a professional field, it is important that s/he portray a professional image to those with whom s/he will come in contact. Inappropriate attire, grooming, or conduct may put into question the qualit y of what the student has achieved and place in jeopardy his/her good standing with Loma Linda University. The following standards have been provided, to which students are required to adhere while enrolled in their Loma Linda University program: Grooming Haircuts, hairstyling, and personal grooming must be neat, clean, and conservative. Careful attention must be given to personal hygiene. Hair color must be natural in appearance. The wearing of hats and \"hoodies\" indoors is not permitted. Excessive makeu p and fragrances are not appropriate. Visible tattoos and body piercing, such as facial and tongue studs, are not permitted. Rings should be low profile and limited to one finger per hand. Earrings are limited to small, simple studs, one stud per ear. Attire University ID must be worn in a visible location above the waist at all times while student is on campus. When on campus or in classes, casual wear is appropriate. All attire must be modest, clean, and pressed. Shorts must be neat and at least mid -thigh high in length. Bare feet, bare midriffs, low-cut or deep necklines, and skin -tight clothing are not acceptable. Words, pictures, and/or symbols displayed on clothing should be consistent with a Christian institution and sensitive to a diverse student p opulation. Underwear/undergarments of any kind must not be visible either under, around, or through clothing. In selected settings, professional attire, as defined by the setting, may be required. Professional attire includes: skirts or dresses of modest length or long pants (dress pants are recommended), or as specified. 80 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY Behavior Students are expected to conduct themselves in a professional manner during didactic and classroom laboratory sessions. Professional behavior includes, but is not limited to, pun ctuality; respect for other people's integrity and their property; respect for others who want to learn; and respect for those in authority. Students of Loma Linda University are expected to behave in a manner that will not bring criticism to themselves, t heir program, or the University. In any public place, the student may be in close proximity to people familiar with Loma Linda University. Thus, conversation, attitudes, and behavior displayed have an effect on those individuals. STUDENT MISTREATMENT Lom a Linda University seeks to educate ethical and proficient Christian health professionals and scholars through instruction, example, and the pursuit of truth. In order to do this, Loma Linda University and its faculty are committed to the following fundame ntal values: compassion, integrity, excellence, freedom, justice, purity/self -control, and humility. These values may occasionally be formally taught by faculty; but more often they are learned informally by students through observation of models of profes sional behavior toward students, colleagues, and patients. The development and nurturing of these values is enhanced by and based upon the presence of mutual respect between teacher and learner. The diversity of students, faculty, clinical instructors, re sidents, and staff combined with the intensity of their interactions may, however, lead to alleged, perceived, or real incidents of inappropriate behavior or mistreatment of students. Examples of such mistreatment include: (1) verbal mistreatment, physical mistreatment, (2) discrimination, (3) excessive or unreasonable time demands, (4) sexual harassment, (5) and the use of grading or other forms of assessment in a punitive manner. Such behavior by faculty or staff, or other behavior that degrades or humili ates students or that is inimical to the development of mutual respect, is unacceptable at Loma Linda University. While teachers do have the responsibility to motivate and correct students, when correction of an individual is needed, this is usually best d one in private but always in a way that shows respect for the student as a person. An important part of the teaching of mutual respect among professionals is the perception of students as they observe faculty in their interactions with each other. Therefo re, faculty should be models of professionalism in all of their interactions and should avoid inappropriate behavior or mistreatment of other professionals and staff. This includes the avoidance of derogatory remarks about or attitudes towards individual c olleagues, services, or departments. Students also learn professional behavior and demeanor by observing their teachers as they interact with patients, clients, and all others. Such professional interactions should be courteous and respectful. Respect for individuals includes, but is not limited to, such things as punctuality, thoughtfulness, mindfulness of personal space; as well as manner and mode of address, appropriate and modest draping of patients, tone and content of verbal interchanges, and body la nguage. In addition, discussion of patients out of their hearing should continue to show the same degree of respect and should not include contemptuous, derogatory, judgmental, or demeaning remarks. Student Handbook 81 Verbal or nonverbal mistreatment includes: 1. Demeaning l anguage and communication, shouting, hostility, profanity, offensive gestures. 2. Repeated or blatant conduct directed towards any person that is intended to insult or stigmatize that person. Physical mistreatment includes: 1. Physical punishment, such as h itting, slapping, pushing, kicking, or spitting. 2. The threat of physical punishment. 3. Intentionally or negligently placing another at risk of physical harm. Discrimination includes: Disparate treatment based on gender, age, ethnicity, race, disability, or sexual orientation that stigmatizes or degrades that person. Unreasonable or unprofessional demands include: 1. Requiring a student to perform personal services, such as shopping or babysitting. 2. Requiring a student to perform menial tasks with the inten t to humiliate the student. Sexual harassment: see LLU sexual harassment policy in Student Handbook and/or Faculty Handbook . Procedures Students who believe they have been mistreated have the right, and are encouraged, to initiate one or more of the foll owing procedural options. If, however, the mistreatment involves sexual harassment, the procedure of the sexual harassment policy must be followed. Loma Linda University will ensure that this process occurs fairly and shall be free of retaliation. Students who believe that they have been mistreated should report such conduct to the University or to school administration. Students may meet directly with the individual involved in the mistreatment and come to a mutually agreeable resolution. Students may choo se to take someone with them, such as a faculty member, department chair, unit manager, clinical instructor, chief resident, or other individual. If the student is uncomfortable meeting with the individual involved, s/he is encouraged to follow the procedu re below. Students are reminded that reporting inappropriate behavior is a personal and professional responsibility. The procedure is to: 1. Report the incident(s) to the dean in the school in which the student has primary enrollment or to the Office of the University Vice President for Enrollment Management 82 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY and Student Services. A systematic method of reporting allows patterns of behavior to be considered in determining the course of action. 2. It is the responsibility of the dean to investigate, document, and coordinate immediate and appropriate corrective measures/protective actions that are reasonably calculated to end mistreatment, eliminate the hostile environment, and prevent reoccurrence. 3. In determining the actions to be taken, consideration will be given to frequency and/or severity of the conduct; as well as the position held by the accused. A primary objective will be to protect the student from adverse consequences for having reported the incident. Confidentiality The University shall protect the priva cy of individuals involved in a report of mistreatment to the extent possible. Some level of disclosure may be necessary to ensure a complete and fair resolution. Disclosure may be made only on a need -to-know basis. In keeping with ideals of professionalis m and courtesy, the student is advised to refrain from discussing the complaint with individuals not directly involved. Retaliation prohibited All reasonable action will be taken to assure no retaliation against the student, witnesses, or anyone cooperatin g with the investigation for their cooperation. WEAPONS POSSESSION P OLICY In order to provide a safe environment for patients, students, faculty, staff, and visitors, no patient, student, visitor, faculty, or staff member shall be allowed to have in his/h er possession while on the Loma Linda University premises any firearms or any illegal weapons as defined by the California penal code without specific University approval. All persons not in compliance with the above policy will be asked to leave the premi ses by campus security or be taken into custody by campus security, if a clear violation of the law can be established. \"Possession\" for this policy is defined as on one's person or in one's motor vehicle, residence hall, or work area. Any suspected or obs erved violation of this policy should be reported to Security immediately. Students found to be in violation of the weapons possession policy will be subject to discipline up to and including dismissal.

Craig R. Jackson, J.D., M.S. Dean Student Handbook 85 Scholastic Standing Scholastic standing is expressed as a grade point average and is computed as follows: A 4.0 Outstanding performance. A- 3.7 B+ 3.3 B 3.0 Very good performance for undergraduate credit; satisfactory performance for graduate credit. B- 2.7 C+ 2.3 C 2.0 Minimum level of satisfactory performance for undergraduate credit. D+ 1.3 D 1.0 F 0.0 Failure; given for not meeting minimum performance required for credit. S none Satisfactory performan ce (equivalent to a grade of C [2.0] or better in under graduate courses or a grade of B [3.0] or better in graduate courses). U none Unsatisfactory performance; given only when performance for an S -specified course falls below a grade of C (2.0) in undergraduate courses, or a grade of B (3.0) in graduate cour ses. The S/U option is limited to elective and religion courses and to those courses within the professional curriculum for which the department has determined that a letter grade is inappropriate for the course. Once this option is chosen and the grade is filed, it is not subject to change. W Withdraw , given in accordance with time frames published by University Records Department. I Incomplete, given for circumstances beyond a student's control. An incomplete (I) may be changed to a grade only by the instructor before the end of the following quarter (or summer session). The student must request an I notation from the instructor by completing the appropriate form, stating the reason for the request. This form is sent electronically for inst ructor approval. If approved, the instructor will then report the I notation on the instructor grade report, in addition to the grade the student will receive if the deficiency is not removed by the time limit. IP In Progress, indicating that the co urse has duration of more than a single quarter and will be completed by the student no later than the final quarter of the course. The student's final grade is reported on the instructor grade report at the end of the quarter in which the course is comple ted. 86 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY AU Audit, indicating registration for attendance only. A student must attend at least 80 percent of the class sessions. Excessive absences can affect your grade(s). Student Handbook 87 Repeating A student who receives an unsatisfactory grade in a required cours e and is required by the faculty to do additional work may pursue one of the following plans, on the recommendation of the chair of the department and the consent of the dean. In either plan, the student must reregister and pay the applicable tuition. 1. Review the course work/tutorial under supervision and makeup any pertinent and necessary course work as deemed by instructor (usually not given before a minimum of two weeks of study). A passing grade resulting from a repeat examination will be limited to a C (2.0). 2. Repeat the course , attend class and/or laboratory, and take the final course examination. Full tuition will be charged whether regular or occasional attendance is required. (See the schedule of charges for the School of Allied Health Professions in the Financial Information section of the CATALOG for the tuition rate.) A student who receives an unsatisfactory grade in a required clinical experience course and is required by the faculty to do additional work must reregister and pay the applicable fee. (See the schedule of charges for the School of Allied Health Professions in the Financial Information section of the CATALOG for the fee for repeat of clinical experience.) Both the original and repeat grades are entered in the student's permanent a cademic record, but only the last grade is computed in the grade point average. 88 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY Promotion and Probation Each student's record is reviewed quarterly by the faculty. Promotion is contingent on satisfactory academic and professional performance and on factor s related to aptitude, proficiency, and responsiveness to the established aims of the school and of the profession. As an indication of satisfactory academic performance, the student is expected to maintain the following grade point average: associate and baccalaureate degree programs \u20142.0; master's and doctoral degree programs \u20143.0. Specifically, a student whose grade point average falls below the minimum required for the degree in any term, or who receives in any professional or required course a grade les s than a C (2.0), or whose clinical performance is unsatisfactory is automatically placed on academic probation. Continued enrollment is subject to the recommendation of the department. If continued enrollment is not recommended, the department will notify the student in writing. If continued enrollment is recommended, the student will be required to institute a learning assistance program contract within the first two weeks of the following quarter and meet regularly scheduled appointments with the academ ic advisor. A student who is on academic probation and fails to make the minimum required grade point average the following quarter, or who fails to have an overall minimum grade point average after two quarters, will have disqualified him -/herself from th e program. Student Handbook 89 Student Responsibility Application to and enrollment in the University constitute the student's commitment to honor and abide by the academic and social practices and regulations stated in announcements, bulletins, handbooks, and other publishe d materials; and to maintain a manner that is mature and compatible with the University's function as an institution of higher learning. A student who neglects academic or other student duties, whose social conduct is unbecoming, or whose attitudes demonst rate deficiencies such as poor judgment, moral inadequacy, or other forms of immaturity inevitably will come under question. The faculty then reviews the case, appraises the student's fitness for a career in this chosen profession, and recommends to the de an appropriate action as to the student's continuance or discontinuance. 90 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY Academic Integrity The School of Allied Health Professions uses the Loma Linda University Academic Integrity Policy as outlined earlier in this LLU Student Handbook . Student Handbook 91 Discipline and Ap peal Process ACADEMIC AND CLINICA L DISCIPLINE When a student fails to observe the academic policies and regulations of the School of Allied Health Professions, the following procedures are followed: The course instructor or advisor will discuss the pro blem with the student. If the problem is not resolved, the matter will be taken to the department chair who will review the situation and present it for consideration by the department's faculty. In the case that the department chair is the instructor, th e dean will designate a faculty member to review and present. The department's faculty will make a recommendation to the dean, which may include such actions as no credit given for a report or examination, suspension from clinic or class, failure of a cou rse, or termination from the program. ACADEMIC APPEAL AND GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE A student who wishes to appeal the dean's decision regarding academic discipline may use the following procedures: If the student believes that s/he has not been dealt with f airly, the student may discuss the appeal with the dean and request in writing that an appeals committee be called to consider his/her situation. This request must be made within one academic quarter following the action giving rise to the appeal. The dea n or his/her designee will convene an ad hoc faculty review committee made up of at least three faculty members. A fourth member of the faculty from the department shall be a nonvoting member. The student may make a presentation to the faculty review commi ttee and may be accompanied by a faculty representative, but s/he may not be accompanied by family, friends, or legal counsel in the meeting room. The faculty review committee may approve or disapprove the original faculty decision or make additional or al ternative recommendations to the dean. The decision of the dean will be final and will be shared with the student in writing. The student must file for the appeal within one quarter following the alleged grievance. A grievance is ineligible for review if not filed within this time frame. The grievance process is not available to individuals over failure to achieve admission or readmission to the school, or over the terms and conditions of admission or readmission. Expanded policy and procedure available from the dean's office. NONACADEMIC DISCIPLI NE If a student neglects nonacademic obligations or other student duties, if his/her social conduct is unbecoming, if s/he demonstrates deficiencies of judgment or other forms of immaturity, or if s/he violates University policies, it is inevitable that the student's conduct will come under question. An illustrative list of the expectations regarding student conduct can be found in 92 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY Section VI of the Loma Linda University Student Handbook . Student alleged miscondu ct is subject to review by the School of Allied Health Professions to determine whether discipline (including dismissal) is appropriate. Upon receipt by the dean of a serious allegation of misconduct and pending an investigation, a student may be suspende d from school. Suspension shall mean that the student may not attend class, meet clinical appointments, attend campus events, or be present on campus without permission from the dean or designee. The process for evaluating alleged misconduct is as follows : 1. The individual alleging the misconduct files in writing the allegation with the dean. 2. The dean (or designee) then conducts an informal investigation. At the conclusion of this informal investigation, the dean (or designee) can: a. decide that the allega tions lack a substantive basis for further investigation; or b. refer the matter to the department faculty, appointed by the dean, if it is found that there is a substantive basis to justify continuing the investigation. 3. If the case is referred to the depa rtment faculty, the faculty can be guided by the following procedures: The dean will provide the faculty with the allegations of misconduct and any other information pertaining to the alleged misconduct. The faculty shall notify the student in writing of the allegations and of the supporting information provided to the committee. The faculty shall then interview the student and those bringing the allegations. The student may appear before the faculty with a faculty representative. The student may not be ac companied by family, friends, or legal counsel in the meeting room. In addition, the faculty may interview anyone else who it may judge can help determine the merits of the allegations. The student may request that specific witnesses be allowed to appear before the committee in support of the student. The student may present new information not previously submitted to the dean or the faculty if relevant to the allegations. It is the responsibility of the student to provide any new information or witnesses to the committee at the time the faculty meets; failure to do so will not be construed as a cause to prevent the committee from continuing its investigation. Neither the student nor his/her representative may be present during the deliberations of the fac ulty. 4. At the end of its deliberations, the faculty may: a. decide there is no substantive basis for the alleged misconduct and dismiss the allegations; or b. decide that the allegations are supported by substantial evidence and that the misconduct was \"nonac ademic misconduct\"; the committee further can recommend to the dean disciplinary measures up to and including dismissal. Student Handbook 93 NONACADEMIC APPEAL A ND GRIEVANCE PROCEDU RE A student may appeal a nonacademic disciplinary action according to the same process as an academic or clinical disciplinary action, in that s/he may initiate the appeal process by entering a formal written petition for appeal with the dean. The student must file the petition for appeal within one month of the imposed sanction. Following review by the faculty review committee, the action of the dean is final and binding. The dean or his/her designee will convene an ad hoc faculty review committee made up of three faculty representatives. A fourth nonvoting member may be a faculty member from th e department. The committee reviews the recommended disciplinary measure(s); it may then concur or recommend a stricter, but not a lesser, level of sanction. Such recommendation is to be written by the committee and transmitted to the dean. The dean then imposes the recommended sanction, giving due consideration to the recommendations but not being bound by them. The dean then notifies the student in writing of the sanction. 94 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY Professional Standards Because the student has chosen a professional field for hi s/her work, it is important that the student portray a professional image to those with whom s/he comes into contact. Inappropriate dress, grooming, or conduct detracts from patients' confidence in the quality of their care. In addition, Loma Linda Univers ity's affiliating hospitals have standards that are reflected in the guidelines below. For these reasons, LLU provides the following standards that are required of the student while enrolled in the program. PERSONAL GROOMING Good taste indicates that hair cuts, hairstyling, and personal grooming be neat and conservative rather than ostentatious. Grooming and style should also be practical so as to enable one's duties to be performed without embarrassment or inconvenience. Specifically: (1) Hair must be neat . If long, the student may be required to tie it back. (2) Mustaches and beards, if worn, must be neat and trimmed. (3) Words, pictures, and/or symbols displayed on clothing should be consistent with an Adventist institution and sensitive to a diverse stud ent population. (4) Excessive makeup and fragrances are not appropriate. (5) Rings, if worn, should be low profile and limited to one finger per hand. Earrings, if worn, should not drop below the bottom of the earlobes and should be limited to one per ear. (6) Fingernails should be maintained in a professional manner, be closely trimmed, and should not interfere with patient care or professional duties. Nail polish, if worn, should be subdued in color. GENERAL DRESS Modest casual wear is appropriate on camp us and in class. Shorts must be neat and at least mid-thigh in length. Bare feet are not acceptable. The wearing of hats indoors is not acceptable. Laboratory dress Each program will specify the dress that is appropriate for its lab. Laboratory dress is t o be worn only for labs and is not appropriate in classrooms or the main floor of Nichol Hall. Clinical dress Professional dress is required for all clinical assignments, chapel attendance, and any class that is held in a clinical facility. Professional d ress includes skirts/dresses of modest length or long pants (no jeans), closed -toed shoes, and name tags. Laboratory coats may be required in some clinical settings. CONDUCT As students in training for a professional field, it is expected that students wi ll conduct themselves in a professional manner during their didactic training, as well as during clinical training. Professional conduct includes, but is not limited to, punctuality and respect of other people, their property, and their right to learn. It also includes an appropriate respect for those in authority. Students of Loma Linda University are expected to conduct themselves in a manner that will not bring criticism to themselves, the school, or the University. Student Handbook 95 In any public place, students are pot entially exposed to patients' relatives and friends. Things said and the attitudes exhibited have impact on those around. Loma Linda University requests that students observe the following: (1) Because a patient's medical problems are a very personal matte r, it is imperative that any information given students by a patient be held in strict confidence. Therefore, the discussion of patients' diagnosis and treatments, as well as other clinically related topics, should be extremely guarded. Patients' families and community people may be listening and wrongly interpret the things discussed. Careless talk may lead to malpractice litigation. (2) A joking or high -spirited attitude toward illness and medical treatment should not be exhibited because it is usually ex tremely disturbing to the ill and suffering. (3) Student and staff behavior in the professional situation may be the deciding influence for or against Christian beliefs. Each department within the school may set more restrictive and/or additional standard s that must be adhered to by all students within the department. 96 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY Awards and Scholarships Alumni Federation Award President's Award Dean's Award DEPARTMENT OF CARDIO PULMONARY SCIENCES Alumni Scholarship Award AMR Scholarship Award Faculty Award Lou Jezerin ac Student Scholarship Award Rising Star Award Williams von Pohle Award DEPARTMENT OF CLINIC AL LABORATORY SCIENC E Chair's Award Clinical Affiliate Award CLS Endowment Faculty Award Rising Star Award Robert and Jacqueline Moncrieff Scholarship Award DEP ARTMENT OF COMMUNICA TION SCIENCES AND DI SORDERS Distinguished Alumna Evelyn Britt Promising Student Award Outstanding Senior Award Rising Star Award DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH INFORMATION MANAGEME NT Audrey Shaffer Endowment Faculty Award Elizabeth M.

This Student Handbook describes who we are and what we have to offer. It will familiarize you with the philosophy and structure of our programs, along with a listing of the participating faculty. Loma Linda is a religious, nonprofit institution that welcomes students and staff from a broad spectrum of religious persuasions while reserving the right to give preference to qualified members of its sponsoring denomination. As stated in its nondiscrimination policy, the institution \"affirms that all persons are of equal worth in the sight of God and they should so be regarded by all people.\" Since several of the professions \u2014for which programs within the School of Behavioral Health (SBH) prepare students \u2014have a tradition of advocacy for oppressed peoples, it is important that the institution, facu lty, and staff demonstrate their acceptance of, and willingness to assist those of our society who are less privileged. The University actively sponsors several programs that move the institutional health -care personnel resources and expertise into the loc al, national, and international communities to work with otherwise underserved populations. This component of service is an integral part of the statement of mission and is a message intended to be captured in the Good Samaritan sculpture that occupies a c entral position on the campus. The School of Behavioral Health, as part of the University, has expectations of students, faculty, and staff in the areas of conduct and behavior while they are on campus or involved in School or University activities. The s chool does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, gender, age, ethnic or national origin, or handicap. Enrollment of students in SBH programs is not conditioned on their political or sexual orientation; in these areas, the school's policy is directe d towards conduct or disruptive behavior, not orientation. In support of this position, we expect our students, faculty, and staff to demonstrate unwavering respect for the diversity of others and interact with integrity, never forgetting the standards tha t guide professional actions. Further, we expect our programs through their faculty to develop competent, compassionate, ethical professionals who possess the knowledge, skills, and values to equip them for a life dedicated to service to all those in need \u2014regardless of their lifestyles. You will find vigorous academic programs that will stretch your mind as you take time to make new discoveries, get to understand our world, and apply Christ -centered values to your life and profession. 100 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY Our administrators, faculty and staff are here to work with you and help you prepare for your future as a caring, Christian professional in the world of service to mankind.

Dean Student Handbook 101 Academic Policies ACADEMIC CREDIT Advanced standing Advanced standing is guided by professional accreditation requirements or other established professional standards. Students and advisors should refer to program guidelines for the advanced standin g requirements for specific programs. Academic credit accountability No credit can be granted for academic work or clinical hours done during any particular quarter when there is not valid registration for the work performed. All course work and clinical h ours must be registered for during the particular quarter for which credit is requested or expected. Academic variances Requests for transfer credit, substitution, waiver, or advanced standing of a particular course are not accepted for processing while th e student is classified as probationary. Only students officially accepted into a specific degree program are eligible to submit variance requests. The protocol for academic variance petition is as follows: 1. The petition is initiated by the student reques ting the variance. The petition must be accompanied by a copy of the syllabus for the course to be transferred. 2. The petition is submitted to the instructor of the LLU course for which the transfer applies. 3. Once the instructor approves the variance, the pe tition is submitted to the department chair for approval. 4. Following the approval by the department chair, the variance is submitted to the dean (or designee) for approval. 5. The dean's office sends the approved petition for academic variance to University Records for processing. The dean's office will also send a copy of the approved petition to the student's department. Repeating a course A student wishing to improve his/her grade once grades have been posted for a course must repeat the course. When repe ating a course, the student must attend class and laboratory sessions as ordinarily required and take all regularly scheduled examinations. Full tuition is charged for a repeated course. 102 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY Both the original and repeat grade performances are entered in the s tudent's permanent record, but only the second or repeated grade is computed in the G.P.A. and included in the total units earned. A student may repeat a course only once. No more than two courses may be repeated in a student's degree program. Transfer cre dit Transfer credit is credit completed at another accredited institution of higher learning and then approved by application to a School of Behavioral Health degree program. Transfer credit is initiated after having been formally requested by the studen t through an academic variance petition. The student initiates the academic variance; it is then evaluated and may be approved by the instructor, the academic department, and the dean. A minimum grade of B is required for all courses accepted for transfer credit. Some programs require a higher minimum grade for transfer credits. Transfer credit to a School of Behavioral Health program is applicable only if the course work was completed less than seven years prior to acceptance into the school's degree program. Transfer credit courses must be equivalent to courses appropriate to degree requirements, as specified by the programs in the school. A course syllabus must accompany the academic variance form to the dean's office. Transfer credits may reduce the u nits taken at Loma Linda University; however, they do not reduce the overall units required for the degree. Transfer credits that have been previously applied to another degree may not exceed 9 quarter units unless professional advanced standing policies a pply. The maximum number of transfer credits may not exceed 20 percent of the minimum units required for the degree. Transfer units must be graduate level or upper division undergraduate courses that qualify for graduate credit within the policies of the s chool from which the courses were offered. Advanced standing policies supersede this policy. Transfer credit may not reduce the total unit requirement below 40 units for a single - major master's degree program. Transfer credit units are not applied toward the G.P.A. calculations required for the School of Behavioral Health degree program. ACADEMIC HONESTY/INT EGRITY The School of Behavioral Health adheres to the University Standards of Academic Conduct and related definitions (see Standards of Academic Cond uct). As such, students in the school are expected to be committed to the practice of honesty and to uphold the standards of professional and personal conduct, including the acquisition of behaviors and attitudes that are consistent with University values. Students who do not adhere to these standards of academic conduct shall be subject to discipline for any form of academic dishonesty \u2014including, but not limited to the following Student Handbook 103 examples of serious breaches of integrity: falsifying reports, records, and t he results of research; cheating, including copying from another's examination or allowing another to copy from one's own; giving or receiving unpermitted aid on class work or take -home tests; and plagiarism \u2014 representing as one's own work the work of othe rs, without giving credit. Other examples that may appear to be minor but that constitute misrepresentations of truth, and thus indicate problems with academic integrity, include such actions as signing someone else's name on an attendance sheet (for a req uired class or meeting); or signing oneself in as present and then leaving. It is the responsibility of students to avoid both dishonest practices and the appearance of dishonesty. In addition, students are expected to be accountable for their own conduct as well as to assume responsibility for the professional behavior of their colleagues. Assuming responsibility for the professional behavior of one's colleagues means exemplifying integrity in oneself; encouraging colleagues to be honest and responsible; a nd refusing to ignore or cover up breaches of integrity, as previously listed. Acts of academic dishonesty, including but not limited to those previously listed, may be cause for dismissal from the school. In all incidents , both faculty and students are c harged with the responsibility of reporting instances of such behavior to the department chair for investigation. Subsequently, the department chair conducts a thorough investigation, while also paying close attention to confidentiality and limiting inform ation to those \"who need to know.\" (Under no circumstances are faculty to independently review and determine the consequences for academic dishonesty.) Evidence of substantiated violations is provided to the dean for determination of the disciplinary actio n. The minimum disciplinary actions to be taken include: (first offense) a failing grade on the assignment or the equivalent; (second offense) a failure in the course or equivalent, without possibility of withdrawal; (third offense) dismissal from the degr ee program and the University. ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE Continuation in a course of professional studies is contingent upon satisfactory scholastic performance and upon factors related to aptitude, proficiency, and responsiveness to the established aims of the school and its professions. Minimum academic performance for SBH degrees Students must maintain a grade point average of at least a B (3.0) in order to continue in regular standing. All courses transferred must be at a B, unless otherwise specified by th e program. Minimum academic performance for School of Behavioral Health courses is ultimately determined by each department and degree program. Students should check with their advisor regarding the academic standards for their program. Academic probation Each quarter, the Office of Academic Records in the School of Behavioral Health examines the grade reports of all students in the school and notifies departments of any student(s) whose cumulative G.P.A. has fallen below the minimum 3.0. Departments then work with each 104 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY identified student to develop an academic plan to assist that student in raising his/her overall G.P.A. to the minimum standard. Departments are to provide the dean's office a copy of each academic plan. The procedures that further support t he designation of academic probation are as follows: 1. The first quarter that a student's G.P.A. falls below the minimum 3.0 G.P.A., the Office of Academic Records in the School of Behavioral Health sends the student a warning letter informing him/her of th e drop below acceptable performance. A copy of the letter is sent to the student's department. The warning letter informs the student that s/he has one quarter to return (improve) his/her G.P.A. back to the minimum required 3.0; and if s/he fails to do so, then s/he will be placed on academic probation the subsequent quarter. 2. If a student fails to raise his/her G.P.A. at the end of the one -quarter warning period, s/he will be placed on academic probation by the school's Office of Academic Records. The stude nt then receives a letter notifying him/her that s/he has been placed on academic probation, and that continuation of academic probation for two quarters may result in dismissal from the program. The letter also states that a repeated (nonconsecutive) patt ern of below -standard performance may also result in program dismissal. A copy of the letter is sent to the student's department. 3. In the event that a student is placed on academic probation, the department is responsible for conducting an immediate academ ic review involving at least the department chair or program director and the student's advisor. A statement regarding the academic future of the student must be formulated by the department and signed by the student, with a copy given to the school's Offi ce of Academic Records. The statement must indicate clearly all requirements, conditions, and criteria needed to remove the probationary status. 4. When the school's Office of Academic Records officially designates a student's status as probationary, a hold is placed on his/her registration (i.e., the student may not register for any new courses) until grades from the previous quarter are posted and the student's academic history and satisfactory academic progress have been evaluated. Such registration holds are cleared only after the department verifies the following \u2014as appropriate to the phase in the probationary process: a) that an academic plan has been developed with the student to address the challenges that resulted in academic probation; b) that the ac ademic plan has been implemented; and c) that the student is making satisfactory progress to raise his/her G.P.A. to the minimum standard. Professional performance Enrollment and continuation in many degree programs in the School of Behavioral Health are contingent upon the student meeting the requirements for both academic and professional performance. Faculty have the right and responsibility to regularly assess each student's progress in both of these areas. When it is determined that a student demons trates serious unacceptable behaviors or a pattern of behaviors or attitudes not in keeping with the values and ethics of the professional area of study and/or the University, s/he may be placed on professional performance probation. Student Handbook 105 Professional performan ce issues include, but are not limited to, substantial and/or unresolved behaviors that affect the student's ability to complete course and/or clinical requirements; or behaviors that seriously impact the student's interactions with faculty, staff, other s tudents, representatives, and/or clients at clinical training sites. When any of these issues have been identified, the student will be placed on professional performance probation or will incur other sanctions as deemed appropriate, given the seriousness of the infraction and/or violation of University policies. A student placed on professional performance probation who is unable to resolve the identified challenges may be dismissed from his/her academic program. More in -depth information regarding profes sional performance can be found in the program guides. Discipline process for academic and professional issues When a student fails to observe the academic or professional performance requirements of the school and/or the requirements and standards of th e University, or requirements that are unique to his/her specific profession, the following procedures apply: 1. The course instructor, advisor, and/or director of clinical training will discuss the problem with the student. 2. If the problem is not resolved, the matter will be taken to the department chair and program director. The department chair and program director will review the situation and, where applicable, present it for consideration to the appropriate department committee. 3. The department committ ee will review the matter and propose a corrective action plan aimed at facilitating the student's resolution of the identified challenges. Such corrective action plans are implemented under the supervision of the department chair and/or program director, and may include but are not limited to: suspension from a class or classes; suspension from a clinical placement; or failure of clinical placement. 4. If the problem still remains unresolved or shows insufficient improvement to meet academic and/or profession al standards and requirements, then the department committee will make a recommendation to the department chair, who subsequently forwards this recommendation to the dean. The recommendation may include, but is not limited to: academic and/or professional performance probation; a leave of absence, or termination from the program. Academic and professional performance and grievance procedures A student who wishes to appeal a recommendation regarding academic and professional performance probation or dismiss al from a program follows the steps indicated below: 1. If the student believes that s/he has not been fairly dealt with, the student may discuss the appeal with the dean and request in writing that a review process be initiated. This request must be made w ithin one academic quarter following the action giving rise to the appeal. A grievance is ineligible for review if not filed within this time frame. (The grievance process does not apply to decisions regarding admissions and readmission.) 106 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY 2. The dean may cho ose to conduct the review or may convene an ad hoc faculty review committee. Ad hoc review committees are made up of at least three faculty members in the School of Behavioral Health or the University who have been identified as capable of impartiality reg arding the situation under review. The student may make a presentation to the faculty review committee and may be accompanied by a faculty representative; but s/he may not be accompanied by family, friends, or legal counsel in the meeting room. The faculty review committee then provides its findings to the dean, which may include agreement or disagreement with the original faculty decision(s); or the committee may make additional or alternative recommendations to the dean. A more detailed protocol that guid es the committee process is provided by the dean. 3. The decision of the dean will be final and will be shared with the student in writing. ADMISSION DEFERRALS Deferral prior to first registration A newly accepted student who has not yet registered for cour se work as a School of Behavioral Health student may request deferral of admission to a future quarter, not to exceed one year from application. The student must submit the request for a deferral of admission in writing to his/her department. Failure to re quest a deferral of admission may result in administrative withdrawal of the student from the program. The deferred enrollment places the student under requirements of the curriculum in effect at the time of first actual enrollment. The school's Office o f Admissions will notify the student of the approval or denial of the request to defer and the CATALOG requirement that the student will be under if s/he is allowed to begin his/her program of study at a later date. Accepted students failing to enroll Students accepted to begin in a certain quarter but who fail to register in that quarter are notified in writing by the department office and are inactivated in the school's Office of Academic Records if no response is received. In such cases, the student ma y subsequently request deferral for up to one year from the application term. The school's Office of Admissions will notify the student of the approval or denial of the request to defer and the CATALOG requirement that the student will be under if s/he is allowed to begin his/her program of study at a later date. Students who do not request deferral and are inactivated must reapply to the program and are subject to changes in the admission and degree requirements in place at the time of reapplication. Full reactivation process Because of the conditions of their inactivation by the school's Office of Academic Records, students may be required to complete the full reactivation process before being permitted to register for additional courses. 1. The student mu st supply a completed reactivation request form \u2014accompanied by the reactivation fee, official transcripts of any course work taken elsewhere during the Student Handbook 107 absence, current recommendations, and an interview with a representative of the student's major departme nt in the School of Behavioral Health. 2. Approval for reactivation is recommended or denied by the major department faculty and is officially recorded as reactivation in the minutes of the department admissions committee. 3. The reactivated student comes under the requirement of the curriculum in effect at the time of first enrollment after reactivation. 4. The school's Office of Admissions provides official acceptance and notification of the student's status to the student, the department office, and University Re cords. ATTENDANCE (COURSE, PRACTICUM, CHAPEL) Eligibility Only officially registered students are eligible to attend classes. Any exceptions to this policy should have the approval of the dean. Class attendance CREDIT Students are required to attend all c lass sessions unless otherwise indicated in the course syllabus. Absences may be sufficient cause for the recording of a failing or unsatisfactory grade. AUDIT Since audit registration indicates an attendance -only involvement of the student, attendance in at least 80 percent of the class sessions is required to receive an AU notation on the transcript. The notation AUW (Audit Withdrawal) is given to indicate that the 80 percent attendance requirement was not satisfied. PRACTICUM/INTERNSHIP Students require d to complete clinical hours through volunteerism, practicum, or internships must adhere to the time and attendance mandates of their academic requirements. Student behavior and attire at volunteer practicum or internship sites must comply with University and professional standards in all ways. CHAPEL Students are required to attend school - and University -sponsored chapels, including all Week of Prayer sessions, if they have a class or clinical assignment/practicum/internship on campus between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. on Wednesdays. Unexcused absences from these convocations are reported to the academic dean and, if absence irregularities persist, to the dean. Special circumstances may qualify students for chapel exemption. Requests for exemption s are reviewed by the Office of Academic Records of the School of Behavioral Health each quarter. Requests should be submitted by the end of the first week of the quarter for which the exemption is to apply. To file a request for exemption, students comple te and submit a course/clinical training schedule to their department chair or program director for signature. 108 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY The form is then submitted to the school's Office of Academic Records for review. Notifications of exemptions are typically provided to students within five business days, unless the form is incomplete or additional information is needed. CLINICAL INSTRUCTION Clinical instruction in School of Behavioral Health includes field practicum, field experience, clinical training, pre -internship, and inter nship. Individual programs in the school may require completion of clinical instruction as part of the degree program. If clinical instruction is required as part of a degree program, this requirement is clearly stated in the program's curriculum outline. Clinical instruction requirements stated in a program's curriculum outline are as binding as the course requirements. The number of clinical hours required for a particular degree program is determined by the department faculty and is published as part of the curriculum requirements stated for that program. Students enrolled in clinical instruction are covered by the University student health insurance plan during any quarter they are registered and pay the appropriate enrollment fees. EFFECTIVE CURRICU LUM If a student has been on a leave of absence for more than one year, or has failed to register for two or more quarters, s/he is required to re -enter the program under the CATALOG in effect at the time of re -entry. Students must submit to the school's O ffice of Academic Records a written request to change to a different effective curriculum CATALOG year. GRADING POLICIES Grading requirements for all School of Behavioral Health courses are to be stipulated in writing at the beginning of the course. Incom plete (I) grade University policy requires that students wishing to receive an Incomplete (I) grade submit an electronic petition form. The form is then sent electronically to the instructor, the department chair, and the dean (or designee) for approval. Acceptable reasons for granting an incomplete (I) grade include: Emergency situations beyond the student's control Student's illness Death in the student's immediate family Absence of the instructor Unacceptable reasons for granting in incomplete (I) gra de: Student Handbook 109 A remedy for overload Failure on final examination Absence from final examination for other than an emergency situation Low grade to be raised with extra work Failure to complete assignments on time Inability to access data or other information Remov al of an In -progress (IP) grade An In -progress (IP) indicates that the course work has a duration extending over more than a single quarter and will be completed by the student no later than the final quarter planned for the course, not to exceed five quar ters. If the course work is not completed within the five - quarter time limit, a grade of UW will be given. The removal of an IP grade must be initiated and processed by the instructor. IP grades are removed only at the end of the quarter in which the cours e requirements are completed. Calculation of cumulative G.P.A. The cumulative University G.P.A. is calculated based on all course work completed at LLU during the time period when the student is registered in the School of Behavioral Health. A student's c umulative school G.P.A. is calculated upon the minimum number of units required for the student's degree program. Transfer credit is not considered when calculating the student's LLU G.P.A. Change of grade Once a grade has been submitted by the instructor, it may be changed only when an error has occurred in determining or recording the grade. Changes of grade may be processed only if requested on a change -of-grade form and at the request of the faculty member teaching the course. Change of grade must be requested and submitted on a change -of-grade form within one quarter following submission of the original grade. Grade grievances A student who believes that the final grade received in a course does not accurately represent his/her performance in the cou rse may request a review of the grade assigned. A request for a grade review must occur within one quarter (i.e., the quarter immediately following) the assignment of the grade in question. (Note: The grade -grievance process is not applicable to the review of grades received on assignments prior to the assignment of a grade in the course.) The grade -review/ -grievance process is as follows: 1. The student submits in writing to the course instructor a request for grade review, including the specific reason(s) f or his/her belief that his/her grade in the specific course is not accurate. The instructor is to respond promptly to the student's request, including any necessary clarification of evaluation criteria and grade calculation. 110 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY 2. If the student is not satisfie d with the explanation(s) provided by the instructor, the student then submits in writing to the department chair a request for a grade review, including the specific reason(s) for his/her belief that his/her grade in the specific course is not accurate. T he department chair is to respond promptly to the student's request, which may mean that s/he investigates the claim(s). 3. If the student is not satisfied with the explanation(s) provided by the department chair, the student then submits in writing to the d ean a request for a grade review, including the specific reason(s) for his/her belief that his/her grade in the specific course is not accurate. The dean will respond by conducting an appropriate investigation, which may include appointing an ad hoc commit tee to assess the student's claim and make a determination. In the event that an ad hoc committee is used, the committee provides its findings to the dean, which may include agreement or disagreement with the grade provided, or other determinations as appr opriate. The decision of the dean will be final and will be shared with the student in writing. GRADUATION REQUIREME NTS General notation The following forms mark the mileposts of advancement toward completion of a degree. These forms were designed to help assist in ensuring the target goal of degree completion. Students may obtain these forms at the appropriate time through their department or the school's records office. If enrolled in more than one degree or program, a separate set of forms will be requi red for each degree program. Please note the timeline in which the forms are due and any required accompanying documents. Petition for admission to candidacy (Form A) TIMELINE Due three quarters prior to degree completion, and submitted after completion of 24 units; or successful completion of comprehensive/qualifying examination. (Due on October 1 for Spring or Summer quarter completion. Due on March 1 for Fall or Winter completion.) ACCOMPANYING DOCUMEN TS None applicable. CERTIFICATE PROGRAM Do not requ ire submission of Form A. Petition for graduation TIMELINE Submitted two quarters before the student's anticipated date of graduation. ACCOMPANYING DOCUMEN TS None applicable. Document may be found online at <myllu.llu.edu> under \"Student Forms.\" Student Handbook 111 Statemen t of completion (Form D) TIMELINE Due at the end of the student's planned graduation quarter, the last Friday before final examinations week. ACCOMPANYING DOCUMEN TS All students must submit a degree -completion check -out sheet. Diplomas All diplomas issued to School of Behavioral Health graduates list the degree only. No official diploma is awarded that identifies the major(s). The official transcript identifies the specific area of specialization. The official date indicated on the diploma will be the last day of the quarter in which all requirements have been completed, or the commencement date if requirements are completed in Spring Quarter. Diplomas are distributed by mail by University Records after it has been determined that all degree requirements ha ve been satisfactorily met and financial obligations to the University have been discharged. This could take up to three months to complete. The name of the candidate on the diploma and printed program is the legal name that has been registered with Univer sity Records. Participation in commencement events The University and school reserve the right to prohibit participation in commencement events by any potential candidate who has not satisfactorily completed all degree requirements. Master's degree candid ates Master's degree candidates may not participate in commencement events unless they have completed all degree requirements, including pre - and co -requisites. Limited exceptions may be authorized for degree candidates who have minimal course and clinical hours remaining (e.g., incompletes) and who can with certainty complete all such requirements by the end of summer term. In these cases, a contract outlining all requirements and affirming the student's full commitment to complete by the end of summer is signed and submitted by the department chair, program director, and student. Additional charges may apply if supplemental instruction and/or supervision are required. Doctoral degree candidates Doctoral degree candidates may participate in commencement eve nts and have their names listed in the commencement program providing that: 1. They successfully defend their dissertation by the dates designated by the Faculty of Graduate Studies (for Ph.D. degree candidates), and no later than two weeks before commencem ent (for professional degrees). 112 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY 2. They submit form IIB, which verifies that the dissertation has been successfully defended and that minor revisions can be completed by the end of summer term (also verified by the dissertation committee chair). A list of rev isions must be submitted along with form IIB. (Note: The list of revisions will be reviewed carefully. Revisions that may take longer than one quarter are not considered minor. If it is determined that revisions have been misrepresented, permission to part icipate in commencement events will be denied.) INDEPENDENT STUDY AN D DIRECTED STUDY/SPE CIAL PROJECT REQUIREMENTS Independent study in the School of Behavioral Health includes directed study/special project and research registrations. Independent study is offered to provide opportunity for the student to gain academic experience beyond that which is available in regular course work. It is not to be used to substitute for degree course requirements, or to accommodate meeting course requirements (courses) no t scheduled at that time. It is supervised by one faculty member with expertise in the area of study. It is limited to 8 -quarter units in the graduate degree program. It is evaluated according to specific objectives prescribed in an independent study titl e request form, which includes: a description of the work to be done the basis for grading the number of credit units to be earned a schedule for student/instructor contacts Registration for directed study/special project and research with any School of Behavioral Health prefix is limited to students majoring in that particular area. Special permission may be granted by the dean. Grading Grading for all independent study credit in the School of Behavioral Health may be S/U or a letter grade, as determined by the department. LEAVE OF ABSENCE Policy A graduate student must be registered or on an official leave of absence each regular academic quarter until a degree is awarded. Failure to register or file an official leave of absence with LLU will result in a lapse in the student's continued active student status. A lapse of active student status of two consecutive quarters may result in the administrative withdrawal of the student. An administrative withdrawal will require the student to reapply to his/her pr ogram of study. When a student who has been administratively withdrawn from a Student Handbook 113 program is readmitted, the CATALOG at the time of readmission is used to determine degree requirements. In some cases, this may mean that the student must complete different or additional requirements than those in place at the time of the initial admission to the degree program. Students will be administratively withdrawn from a program if they fail to return at the end of the leave of absence or fail to request an extension of the leave. A student on official leave of absence is restricted in his/her use of University facilities and faculty time. Request A student who wishes to request a leave of absence for one or more quarters (up to one year) must complete an electronic requ est for leave of absence. The reason for the request and the length of time requested must be clearly indicated. Approval Leave of absence requests require the electronic approvals of the student's advisor, department chair, and dean or designees. Approve d requests are processed by University Records. Continuation Students on leave of absence who return within one year may continue under the requirements of their original curriculum. Students who fail to return at the time specified in their leave of absen ce agreements are administratively withdrawn and must reapply to the degree program. REGISTRATION On-campus students must register on the dates designated in the University calendar. Registration dates are published on the Web at <llu.edu/ssweb/registratio n.html>. The registration process begins by accessing the Registration Portal through the Student Services login page at <ssweb.llu.edu>. Students should consult with their academic advisor about selecting the appropriate courses. Students' registration r equires the use of electronic forms that must be submitted early enough to allow time to obtain departmental, school, and University approvals. A minimum of at least ten business days prior to the close of registration should be planned for the processing of all forms. Forms are not complete until received and approved by the Office of University Records and cleared by Student Finance. Students who do not complete the entire registration process will have their registration terminated. Reinstatement of the registration process can result in the application of late fees. Students should work with their programs to assure that they thoroughly understand how to complete the registration process. School -level financial clearances, if needed, must be submitted b y e-mail to the School of Behavioral Health Finance Office at least ten business days prior to the close of registration in order to ensure sufficient time for processing. Delayed submission will result in any applicable late registration fees. Changes to registration require the filing of the registration change request (add/drop) form. The form is then taken to University Records for processing. Students adding courses must also have any additional charges cleared by Student Finance. Students dropping cou rses from their 114 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY registration need to be aware that the associated federal financial aid is returned. Students should consult with the Office of Financial Aid for more information. No one may attend class without being registered. Students are not allowed to register for courses that have conflicts in time, even if the conflict exists only for a part of the lectures or laboratory. Posted deadlines for registration and change of registration (see the University calendar) are in effect and binding; the School of Behavioral Health Office of Academic Records will not intercede to obtain a variance. Fees of up to $500 may be applied for missed deadlines. No credit is granted for academic work or clinical hours performed during any quarter without registration. RELIGION REQUIREMENTS Objectives To provide a spiritual dimension to the professional training of School of Behavioral Health students. To provide students with an opportunity to further develop their skills in dealing with life's challenges. Policies The Sc hool of Behavioral Health requires graduate -level courses for the completion of religion requirements in the various graduate degree options. Most degree programs in the school specify or recommend courses that support the program curriculum and profession al objectives. The University also publishes a list of available courses each quarter in an attempt to assist students in their choices. Students must complete 3 units of religion for master's -level degree programs and 9 units for doctoral -level programs. A letter grade is required for religion courses. Only courses with RELE, RELR, or RELT prefixes can be used to satisfy the religion requirements. Doctoral programs require three courses (one in each of the following areas \u2014RELE, RELR, and RELT \u2014unless an alt ernative list of areas has been approved through normal curricular development processes through the school and University). The religion requirement may not be waived by registering for a religion course at a university other than LLU. TIME LIMIT FOR COM PLETION OF DEGREE Master's degree The time lapse from first enrollment in a graduate curriculum to the conferring of the master's degree may not exceed five years. Students who are unable to complete the degree within five years may be granted two one -year extensions. Students make requests for program extension to the school. Student Handbook 115 Doctoral degree The time lapse from first enrollment in a doctoral curriculum to the conferring of the doctorate degree may not exceed seven years. Students who are unable to complete the degree within seven years may be granted two one -year extensions. Students make requests for program extension to the school. TUITION REFUND All or part of tuition paid for a quarter may be refunded, depending on the date of formal withdrawal from the program and/or courses. Some fees may not be refundable. Bookstore and other purchases charged by the student to his/her account are not refundable in most cases. WITHDRAWAL Student responsibility A student planning to withdraw from a degree program must notify the school's Office of Academic Records in writing via the electronic program withdrawal form. If a student is discontinuing the entire program, the date the program withdrawal form is received by University Records will be the official date of with drawal used to calculate tuition refunds.

Ronald Dailey, M .A., Ph.D. Dean 118 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY Matriculation Processes and Standards ADMISSION STANDARDS Loma Linda University School of Dentistry, a faith -based school, seeks students matching its unique culture. Successful candidates enter a school requiring the following: courses in religion and ethics service learning experiences chapel and dedication experiences In harmony with the school's objectives, successful candidates demonstrate attributes including: altruism as a focus a desire to grow spiritually, mentally, and ethically accommodation to a diverse campus population Successful candidates will embrace: an active involvement with church and community an active involvement in outreach and service activities extensive exposure to the dental profession TECHNICAL STANDARDS In harmony with its own didactic, clinical, research, and service objectives, and using the American Dental Educators Association suggested guidelines, the School of Dentistry has identified the following technical standards for entry into all its programs. Cognition Students must have the cognitive abilities that allow the accurate and effective ability to measure, verify, calculate, reason, analyze, synthesize, and critically problem solve. Effective dental education requires the capacity to gather, organize , and assess relevant information in order to arrive at integrated solutions. Students must be able to comprehend three -dimensional relationships and understand the spatial relationships of structures in order to fully solve clinical problems. Sensation an d perception For learning to occur, students must be able to visualize and comprehend physical demonstrations in the classroom, laboratory, and clinic. Such observation requires the functional use of vision, touch, hearing, smell, and somatic sensation. Specifically, students must be able to acquire information from written documents and to visualize information presented in images from papers, videos, and digital media, including Student Handbook 119 interpretation of radiographic and other graphic images, with or without the use of assistive devices. Sufficient visual acuity is required to read charts, records, small print, and handwritten notations. Adequate visual and tactile skills are also necessary to perform dental examinations and provide treatment. Visual acuity, accom modation, and color vision are necessary to discern variations in color, shape, and general appearance between normal and abnormal hard and soft tissues. Students must be able to observe and describe changes in mood, activity, and posture in their patients ; and must possess skills in effective perception and understanding of nonverbal communications. Accurately noting verbal and nonverbal communications of patients is essential when performing dental operations or administering medications. Communication sk ills Students must be fluent in the use of standard written and spoken English. Students must be able to communicate effectively and sensitively with patients, faculty, staff, and other students. Specifically, students must be able to observe, hear, and sp eak to patients in order to elicit and provide information. In addition, they must have the ability to read and understand written communications, and generate effective oral and written communications with all members of a health -care team. This includes the ability to discern when a matter is of a confidential nature in order to maintain confidentiality. Students may be required to remediate written and/or verbal language skills before admission or during their program. This remediation may include accent modification. Fine and gross motor skills Students need sufficient motor and sensory capability in both hands to provide general dental care to perform palpation, percussion, auscultation, and other diagnostic maneuvers \u2014including basic laboratory tests an d diagnostic procedures. These actions require gross and fine muscular movements, coordination, and equilibrium. Individuals must be able to operate foot controls utilizing fine movements, operating high - or low -speed dental instruments to achieve accurate movement of less than one -half millimeter. Students must be able to perform basic life support (i.e., CPR), transfer and position disabled patients, physically restrain patients who lack motor control, and position themselves around the patient and denta l chair. Behavioral and psycho -social attributes Students must possess the emotional stability and demonstrate the resilience required by a challenging educational program. Professional success requires the use of good judgment, insight, self -motivation, s elf-assessment, self -control, high -achievement striving, and the development of a mature, sensitive, and effective personal relationship style. Students must be able to tolerate physically taxing workloads and to function effectively under stress. Students must be able to adapt to changing environments, demonstrate flexibility, and learn to function in the face of uncertainties inherent in the clinical issues of many patients. Compassion, integrity, honesty, concern for others, and cultural sensitivity are required personal qualities. 120 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY CORE VALUES Successful students should demonstrate behaviors and attitudes in harmony with School of Dentistry's core values. The School of Dentistry seeks students who openly and enthusiastically align themselves with the foll owing core values. Belief in God Respect for self and others Spiritual maturity Ethical integrity Demonstrated compassion Principled care Service to others Pursuit of knowledge Commitment to excellence Conscientiousness and industry Critical thinking Effective communication FAITH -BASED FOUNDATIONS The School of Dentistry provides professional education in a distinctly spiritual environment, preparing well -qualified, dedicated dental professionals committed to serving humanity. No religious test is applied, but students are expected to uphold the standards and ideals of this faith -based school. Students must understand these values are overtly present in the curriculum and everyday activities of the school. The use of tobacco, alcohol, or ot her harmful substances is not consistent with attendance at this school, and may result in disciplinary action up to and including discontinuation. Further, students are expected to respect the school's observance of Saturday as Sabbath and are not to atte nd secular, professional, or business meetings during the hours of the Sabbath when representing or identifying as Loma Linda University students. TUITION University policy requires payment of tuition at registration for the quarter it is due. Any adjustme nt or exception to this policy is considered only under extraordinary circumstances, on a case -by-case basis, and on the recommendation of the School of Dentistry associate dean for student affairs. Student Handbook 121 Student Leadership STUDENT GOVERNANCE Loma Linda Universi ty American Student Dental Association ( LLU ASDA ) organizes, coordinates, facilitates, and supports student governance at Loma Linda University School of Dentistry ( LLUSD ). The membership includes a president, vice p resident, secretary, treasurer, and thre e members at large. The LLU ASDA Executive Council (EC) guides the development of policies and initiatives while the Section Coordinating Committee (SCC) operationalizes the activities of student life, support , and representation. Senior LLU ASDA officers are elected annually by the student body , while members at large a re elected by the SCC. All pre doctoral dental and dental hygiene students automatically become members of LLU ASDA at matriculation. To maintain a leadership position, a minimum 2.7 G .P.A. must be maintained by the president and vice presidents of LLU ASDA or the Sections. All other officers or team members must maintain a minimum 2.5 G.P.A. Students on academic probation may not serve in any leadership position. SECTIONS The chairs of the sp ecial interests groups (including, but not limited to, professional associations, class representatives, and other social, spiritual, and service inter est groups), together with the EC , make up the Section Coordinating Committee (SCC). This group implement s activities for LLUSD students. The sections act autonomously but are not independent of the mission and goals as determined by LLU ASDA. The sections serve the School of Dentistry student body as a whole in conjunction with the LLUSD Office of Student Affairs. CLASS LEADERSHIP Class leaders are elected by class colleagues. The leadership representing a class in the various programs consists of: D.D.S. \u2014president and four vice presidents; DH (BS) \u2014president and sp iritual VP; IDP \u2014two representatives. Responsibilities held by each vice president include any combination of the following: spiritual leadership, outreach and service, clinical, technology and communication , social, secretary, treasurer, historian. Other r epresentatives may be elected to serve the class in various capacities, as needed. The leaders work as a t eam to coordinate class events \u2014including educational, spiritual, and social experiences; as well as to facilitate communication between their class an d school administration. COMMITTEE REPRESENTA TION Students are invited to serve on school standing committees. The Office of Student Affairs consults with LLU ASDA to select students to serve on committees, including the following: Admissions, Academic Re view, Curriculum, and Professional Standards. 122 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY PROFESSIONAL REPRESE NTATION Students are invited to represent the School of Dentistry in professional organizations. The Office of Student Affairs assists LLU ASDA facilitate the election of representatives for the following organizations: American Dental Education Association (ADEA) American Dental Hygiene Association (ADHA) American Student Dental Association (ASDA) California Dental Association (CDA) National Association of Seventh -day Adventist Dentists (NA SDAD) Student Handbook 123 Professional Standards CORE ETHICAL PRINCIP LES AND APPLICATIONS Organized dentistry is proud of its reputation for honesty and integrity. These virtues are essential if dentistry is to continue to maintain its position of trust in society. The establ ishment of peer review committees, ethics committees, codes of ethics, and other regulatory and or advisory processes and standards within the profession indicate a vital and continuing concern for maintaining high standards of integrity. The School of Den tistry is a partner in the process where future professionals are selected and trained in the development of professional and ethical attitudes consistent with the highest goals of the profession. The school seeks to broaden students' ethical perceptions b y including a religious perspective not always found in ethical codes. By adding a spiritual foundation to the profession's ethical framework, it is anticipated that the dental professional's ethic will be more completely informed \u2014reflecting not only conce rn for his/her fellows, but also an intimate relationship with the Creator God. The school's emphasis contains specific admonitions that are limited in number but comprehensive in nature. It is anticipated that the values of honesty, integrity, and altruis m will be enhanced during professional training so that following graduation, these virtues will be second nature in the service provided to patients. The School of Dentistry's emphasis on ethics applies to all students \u2014baccalaureate, dental hygiene, pre -doctoral (including International Dentistry Program), graduate, certificate, residents, fellows, preceptors, research scholars, and exchange). INTEGRITY Relationships Mutual respect is critical in professional development. On one hand, the faculty is mentor to the student mentee with respect to conduct, learning, clinical practice, and professional relationships. Consequently, all teaching and evaluation must be done within the context of respect for the student as a person of value and moral worth, and with the preservation of the student's autonomy within the educative relationship. The faculty is also responsible for creating and maintaining an environment that is conducive to learning. This includes making optimum use of students' time; presenting informa tion in a clear, concise, and organized manner; and providing regular feedback to students on their progress. Similarly, students must respect the mentoring and supervisory role of faculty members. This respect includes, but is not limited to: following ap propriate direction in didactic, laboratory, and clinical settings; recognizing the limits of their training and experience; seeking direction when required; and supporting faculty reputation and responsibility through word and action. 124 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY Clinical practice Students are held to the highest professional standards in all laboratory and clinical experiences. The expected development transitions students from novice to professional during their education experience. Breaches of integrity are taken seriously and han dled as professional standards issues. Patient abuse includes any behavior or act that might jeopardize the health or well -being of a patient. Examples include, but are not limited to: unsupervised and/or unauthorized treatment of patients treating patien ts while under the influence of alcohol or other substances failure to comply with clinic policies regarding patient treatment and financial arrangements failure to comply with accepted protocols for infection control or transmission of disease refusal to properly treat patients for reasons of gender, race, color, creed, sexual orientation, national origin, financial status, handicap, or disability (including patients with infectious communicable diseases) failure to report observed incidences of patient ab use by other students offering or asking for financial inducements related to the use of patients during state or regional board examinations patient abandonment Computer, electronic, and social media use The use of computers for didactic and clinical expe rience is strongly encouraged. Use of these media selections is governed by school and University policy. Any misuse or abuse is considered a breach of professional standards. Students are required to read the computer and social media policies. Admission to and continuing registration at Loma Linda University indicates agreement with and adherence to these policies. University and school policy Students at the School of Dentistry, by virtue of their registration, indicate their agreement with and plan to c omply with University and school policies. Students are required to understand and comply with the University policies including, but not limited to: general and sexual harassment social media facility use parking and vehicle use Any breach of University or school policy is treated as a professional standards issue. Student Handbook 125 HONESTY Academic honesty Cheating is not tolerated at the School of Dentistry. Cheating robs students of an opportunity to learn, leads to a loss of self -esteem, renders peer relationships dif ficult, and impacts teacher - student relationships. Such lapses are not in the best interest of the student, the school, or the profession; and they are dealt with as breaches of professional standards. Specifically, faculty must provide students with optim al examination conditions to foster independent student effort. For example: No materials, except those specifically authorized, are permitted when taking an examination. All other materials (e.g., backpacks, notebooks, textbooks, coats, purses, cellular telephones, computers, or any other electronic communication device) must either be left outside or at the front of the examination room. Communication with other students during quizzes or examinations is prohibited. Students should request other seating if they feel that other individuals are using their examination or quiz answers. Students are responsible for protecting the integrity of their work. Using unauthorized aids during examinations and quizzes is prohibited. Behaviors that give the appearance of cheating are prohibited. Misrepresenting the work of others as one's own, as in class assignments or laboratory projects, is prohibited. Plagiarism or excessive paraphrasing of another's written work is prohibited. Excessive, unexcused absences from cla sses or clinical assignments are inappropriate. Failure to report incidents of academic dishonesty by others is considered a breach of professional standards. Forgery Forgery includes falsifying signatures or altering the content of documents after they ha ve been signed, and may include other forms of lying or intentional misrepresentation. Examples of forgery include, but are not limited to: falsifying instructors' signatures on charts or evaluation forms altering patient records, grade forms, evaluation sheets, or other documents after a signature is received signing other students' names on class attendance records falsifying a signature on clinic records Theft or vandalism Theft includes taking or having unauthorized possession of another's property. Va ndalism includes destroying another's property. Examples of theft or vandalism include, but are not limited to: 126 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY taking another's clinic or laboratory equipment unauthorized use of clinic facilities or supplies failure to charge, collect, or turn in approp riate fees for service provided to patients defacing or vandalizing the school's facilities or others' personal property PROFESSIONAL AND PER SONAL BEHAVIOR Students and faculty must conduct themselves in a manner appropriately reflecting the highest person al standards, protecting the reputation of the School of Dentistry, and demonstrating Christian love and concern for all. Examples of personal misconduct include, but are not limited to: intentional disruption or obstruction of any University or school ac tivity physical abuse, threats of violence, or other conduct threatening the health and safety of others use, possession, sale, or manufacture of narcotics or illegal drugs public conduct or acts that are in conflict with the core values of Loma Linda Univ ersity (e.g., drunkenness, immorality, use of profanity) Misconduct \u2014whether in didactic, laboratory, or clinical courses \u2014indicates a lack of professional development. In some cases, the misconduct may be considered to be academic and handled through the A cademic Review Committee process. The majority of professional standards cases are dealt with by the Professional Standards Committee process. Other specific examples include, but are not limited to, classroom decorum and clinic conduct. Classroom decorum The nature of education is to enhance the personhood of the student as a learner and to promote an atmosphere of openness and acceptance, thus enhancing the learning process. Such an environment is central to the didactic and patient care experiences. In t he classroom, students are required to be respectful of their faculty and peers. Disruption of the learning environment is not accepted. Clinic conduct The School of Dentistry's goal is to ensure a clinic environment in which students become qualified prac titioners and professional providers of dental care. The school's focus centers on a Christ -like concern for others \u2014including sensitivity for the needs of patients, peers, auxiliaries, and faculty; and ministering to those we perceive to be in need. This c oncern is reflected in the relationships students develop with those around them, particularly with patients. The clinic is to be a center for learning, but concern for the patient's needs should always be the primary focus. Any activity that places the ne eds of students ahead of the needs of the patient is unacceptable. Altruism lies at the heart of the professional -patient relationship and is central to the professions of dentistry and their code of ethics. Student Handbook 127 PROFESSIONAL APPEARA NCE Students at the school a re expected to present an appearance consistent with the highest professional standards \u2014one that projects to the public an image of cleanliness and competence. The image should be modest and consistent with the mission and philosophy of Loma Linda Universi ty. To that end, professional appearance standards are applied during scheduled school hours, Monday through Friday, while in Prince Hall, its classrooms and laboratories, all campus facilities used for dental school education purposes, clinics, and off -campus assignments \u2014 including service learning and clinic rotations. The intent of the appearance standards is to create a professional and safe environment for members of the school family and patients. Exceptions are made for casual wear (e.g., T -shirts, j eans or modest shorts) for weekends, holidays and evenings when there is no scheduled patient contact. Professional appearance standards Appearance must be modest, neat, clean, and conservative in style. Clothing and the use of jewelry is to be compatible with a professional and safety conscious work environment. Personal cleanliness and oral hygiene are required. Hair must be clean, neat, and well -groomed. During patient care, hair must be held back from the face. Facial hair must be trimmed neat. Jewelry is discouraged. However, if worn, it must be conservative and professional. Earrings (for women) must be limited to one per ear and not drop below the bottom of the earlobes. Men may not wear earrings. Visible tattoos and body piercings (except ears) are not permitted. For both women and men, pants must be dress slacks. Denim is not considered professional attire. Shirts for men must have collars and be designed to be worn with a necktie. Neckties are preferred but are not required. Women must wear modest tops. Skirts must approximate or fall below the knees, even if worn over tights or leggings. Shoes must be clean, in good repair, and professional in style. Surgical scrubs may be substituted for professional dress. The following standards apply: Surgica l scrubs must be neat, clean ,and professional in appearance. A plain T -shirt (long or short -sleeved) with a crew or v -neck may be worn under the surgical scrub top and must be tucked in at the waist. Predoctoral and hygiene students must wear light or dar k blue scrubs. Scrub top and bottom must match. Advanced education students may wear other color scrubs, provided they have been approved by relevant supervisors and clinic area directors in consultation with clinic administration. 128 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY The following are consi dered inappropriate for professional attire (except as noted in the general comments section): T-shirts worn as outer garments. Visible undergarments. Denim pants, skirts, or dresses of any color Shorts Halter tops, tank tops, midriffs, or \"spaghetti\" st raps Sweatshirts and pants Hats, caps, beanies, or \"hoodies\" worn indoors Area -specific standards In clinic and laboratory areas, shoes made of nonporous material must be worn, at a minimum completely covering the top of the foot and toes, and meet all app licable OSHA requirements. School -approved clinic barrier gowns must be worn at all times in the clinics \u2014including off-campus service learning assignments or rotations while providing or assisting in patient care. A University ID badge must be worn above t he waist and visible at all times while on campus and while providing or assisting in patient care. Presence in clinical areas requires wearing surgical scrubs, a white lab coat, school - approved clinic barrier gown, or dress clothes. (Some clinic areas may prohibit street clothes.) NONCOMPLIANCE Compliance with the professional appearance standards is the responsibility of the entire school family. When addressing violations, patient care must be the highest priority. If a professional standards violation i s deemed significant, students may be dismissed from the clinic, laboratory, or classroom until they meet the appearance standards. OSHA violations involving professional standards not covered in the code must be addressed and corrected before students can return to the laboratory or clinic. When students observe an alleged violation of the standards by a faculty member or staff, they may contact any supervisor or administrator. Noncompliance is considered a professional standards issue. PROFESSIONAL STANDA RDS REVIEW PROCESSES Dentistry and dental hygiene are identified health -care professions, and members are challenged to uphold the highest ethical and professional standards. Important contributors to the maintenance of high standards are review processes characterized by fairness, consistency, and transparency. Another contributor is the direct involvement of \"share -holders\" in the monitoring and remediation of colleagues when ethical and professional challenges occur. The three levels of the professional standards review processes facilitate the address of matters associated with ethical and professional standards involving Loma Linda University Student Handbook 129 School of Dentistry students. The levels include several decision points and are defined and described by the fo llowing elements. Level one peer review (support) An important element in the maintenance of high professional standards is the willingness of members to monitor themselves and to seek assistance and counsel before concerns turn into problems. Students fro m class Professional Standards Committees, or selected individuals for specific issues, provide the following peer review support. REQUESTED Students may request peer review to share concerns about an ethical or professional issue. The issue may be identif ied in didactic, laboratory, clinical, or personal settings. The process provides opportunities for consultation, clarification, and counsel. RECOMMENDED Students may be recommended to meet with a peer -review group to evaluate an incident or receive counse l from a wider group before proceeding with a specific professional decision. Administrators, supervisors, instructors, or colleagues might make the recommendation because of the students' limited experience with specific challenges, in the belief that wid er counsel would produce a superior outcome. REQUIRED Students may be required, by the personnel listed above, to work with a peer review group regarding a specific issue. While not meeting the level of a breach of ethical or professional standards, an iss ue may be considered serious enough to warrant a focused peer review. Level two peer review (remediation) Each School of Dentistry class group selects a professional standards committee to be chaired by the class president or representative. The committee may be elected by a class vote or appointed by the class officers or school administration. Alleged breaches of professional standards are reported, in writing, to the associate dean for student affairs and/or the chair of the school's student Professional Standards Committee (PSC). The associate dean and the chair of the PSC have the option of forwarding the allegation to either the class peer -review committee or the school professional standards committee. Certain issues, including but not limited to, per sonal disputes between students, classroom or laboratory decorum, and ethical concerns considered minor, may be referred to the class peer review process. The associate dean or the chair of the PSC notifies students in writing of the following: The profes sional standard in question and the nature of the breach, including a brief summary of the facts (i.e., the time, date, and place of the occurrence). The policy, rule, or regulation allegedly breached. The due process procedure options. Issues referred to the peer review remediation process should include the following actions: 130 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY Meeting with the students. Reviewing the allegation and verifying the relevant facts. Identifying the relevant professional standards. Discussing the implications and outcomes. Recommending sanctions, if warranted. All recommendations, including sanctions, must be confirmed by the associate dean and the chair of the PSC. Level three peer and faculty review process The peer and faculty review process describes the role of the School Professional Standards Committee (PSC). PROFESSIONAL STANDAR DS COMMITTEE (PSC) Scope of practice The Professional Standards Committee provides the venue for a formal and comprehensive professional standards review process. The process examines, reviews, a nd recommends appropriate action on matters related to alleged ethical violations, breaches of professional standards, or noncompliance with school policies. This review process is initiated under any of the following conditions when: The associate dean or the chair of the PSC determines an alleged breach requires formal and comprehensive attention. The associate dean and the chair determine the peer review processes (support or remediation) are unable to satisfactorily consider all the relevant informati on and render an informed decision. The student subject to the allegation is unwilling to have the matter reviewed by the peer review process. The peer review process is unable to arrive at a decision. The peer review group, the associate dean, and chair o f the PSC cannot reach a consensus on outcomes or sanctions. The student subject to the allegation appeals the conclusions of the peer review process. Membership and structure STUDENTS The School Student Leadership Committee annually submits a list of pros pective student members to the associate dean. From the list, the associate dean identifies four student members for each committee session. FACULTY Four faculty members serve staggered terms of three years. The faculty are nominated by the Faculty Council Nominating Committee and formally elected, re -elected, or replaced at the Student Handbook 131 annual Faculty Council election. Faculty may not serve more than two consecutive three -year terms. CHAIR The dean, in consultation with the associate dean for student affairs, appoi nts a faculty member as chair. The chair may exercise a casting vote. SECRETARY A staff or faculty member, appointed by the chair, serves as the recording secretary. The secretary has no vote. QUORUM A minimum of four members (two faculty and two students) is required for a quorum. An equal number of faculty and students is preferred. Notification and counseling interview As with the peer review processes, the associate dean or the chair of the PSC notifies the student(s) in writing of the following: The p rofessional standard in question and the nature of the breach, including a brief summary of the facts (i.e. the time, date, and place of the occurrence). The policy, rule, or regulation allegedly breached. The due process procedure options. From the date of the written notification, students have five days to contact the office for student affairs and schedule a counseling interview. The interview includes the chair of the PSC and/or the associate dean. The individual submitting the allegation may be invit ed to attend. During the interview, students are: Fully informed of the allegation. Provided copies of documents relevant to the allegation. Given opportunity to respond to and / or give an explanation for the allegation. Advised that confidentiality will be maintained regarding matters shared in the interview or any succeeding PSC process. However, that confidentiality cannot be assured when issues required by law (e.g., danger to self or others, issues of child abuse or neglect) must be reported to schoo l administration, individuals in danger, and or appropriate authorities. If the interview results in agreement between the parties, the matter is concluded. A copy of the agreement, including any resolution and/or sanctions, is retained by the associate d ean. At the discretion of the associate dean, the report may be included in the student's permanent file. If agreement on resolutions and/or sanctions cannot be reached during the interview, or it is determined the issue requires formal and comprehensive r eview, the matter is referred to the full PSC. Relevant documentation and background information is made available to the PSC. 132 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY Committee process The PSC process is private, unless students specifically request others be invited. Written requests for invite es must be submitted at least one day in advance of the scheduled meeting for approval by the chair of the PSC. Neither students, nor the school, can be represented by legal counsel. The PSC process is as follows: Invitees may be asked to present relevant background information and are then dismissed. Students explain their understanding of the allegation and answer questions. The committee considers the relevant information associated with the allegation. Votes taken are by written ballot and are retained by the chair. Sanctions require a simple majority vote. Most recommendations are confirmed by the associate dean and the chair of the PSC. Recommendations for discontinuation must be confirmed by the dean. Documents distributed to committee must be relinq uished at the conclusion of the meeting. The chair retains one set of documents for the minutes. Privileged information related to deliberations and recommendations of the PSC is confidential and remains \"in committee,\" except as required by school policy. Actions Sanctions vary depending on the nature and severity of the breach. Students eligible to graduate cannot receive a diploma until all professional standards issues are resolved. Incidents of verified cheating or other fraudulent misrepresentation in cur severe penalties and no sanction less than suspension is deemed appropriate. Sanctions include: WARNING OR REPRIMAND Minor breaches may result in a verbal and/or written warning outlining in detail the nature of the infraction and the expected complian ce. REMEDIATION In addition to a warning, specific remediation may be required. This may include counseling, additional work for restitution, alteration of behavior, or other activities deemed necessary for correction of the breach of professional standard s. Completion of remedial action must occur within a specified time. PROBATION A period of probation may be required during which time academic or clinical restrictions may be imposed. This may be in addition to remedial activity, and generally results i n the loss of specific privileges (e.g., a student on probation may not serve as an officer for any class, school, or extracurricular organization). Repeat violations during a period of probation may lead to suspension or discontinuation from the school. Student Handbook 133 SUSPENSION Suspension from class, laboratory or clinics may be recommended for a specified time. Following a reinstatement, students remain on probation for the duration of their academic program. DISCONTINUATION The PSC may recommend discontinuation from t he school. However, only the dean can confirm this recommendation. If a discontinuation occurs in the students' first two years (first year for DH and IDP) return to the school would be through the normal admissions process. If discontinuation occurs in ye ars three or four (second year for DH and IDP), students must present a request in writing to the dean. Reporting The PSC decision (including the facts of the allegation, the findings, and the recommendations) are reviewed by the associate dean and the cha ir of the PSC. This review ought to occur as soon as possible, and must not exceed five days from the date of the decision. The associate dean and the PSC chair accept or modify and then implement any sanctions up to, but not including, discontinuation. An y modifications are reported to the Executive Committee. Within five days of the PSC decision, students must be informed in writing of the decision and sanctions. Further, the associate dean and the PSC chair will discuss with the student the academic and professional implications of the decision and sanctions. Documents dealing with the matter are kept in the PSC minutes, and a copy of the decision letter is retained in the students' permanent file. A summary of the outcomes, including any sanctions, is co mmunicated with School of Dentistry administration (Administrative Council), department chairs (Executive Committee), faculty (Faculty Council), and students (Student Leadership Committee). Appropriate communication limits are applied to protect the confid entiality of the students involved. Appeals Students may appeal a PSC decision to the dean on two grounds: one, if there is any failure to follow due process, and two, if new or additional information, not available to the PSC, is discovered. The dean may uphold, modify, or appoint a review process to consider the original decision. The dean also decides whether students may continue with school activities during the appeals process. The dean's decision is final. 134 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY Academic Standards and Processes ATTENDANCE Regular attendance of classes, lectures, clinics, and other assemblies is expected. These meetings provide information essential for successful completion of the program. Students are responsible for all material covered and assignments made. Absences in e xcess of 15 percent may be sufficient cause for a failing or unsatisfactory grade to be recorded. Clinics and individual instructors may apply more stringent requirements. Lectures begin on the hour, unless otherwise arranged. Students are required to be p resent in the classroom and seated on time. Instructors may refuse admission to those who arrive late, and assess penalties for habitual offenders. For safety reasons and the need to optimize the learning environment, children are not permitted in classroo ms, laboratories, or clinics. School policy requires all students take examinations at the scheduled time. Medical issues documented by Student Health Service and conveyed to the course director prior to the examination are the only acceptable excuse for n ot taking an examination at the scheduled time. The consequences of missing an examination are determined by the course director. Students arriving late for an examination may be denied admission. If students are permitted to take the examination, they are required to finish at the scheduled time. For the D4 and the IDP4 years, a modified clinic attendance policy is applied. Consult the \"Extended D4 Clinic Year\" document for details. ABSENCES Leave of absence A short -term leave of absence is defined as bei ng away from school for obligations that may or may not be school sponsored. A leave of absence form, requiring instructor and administrator signatures, must be obtained from the Office for Student Affairs and completed prior to departure. When a leave of absence is approved, the appropriate course directors are notified. Emergency leave Emergency leave is defined as an unforeseen circumstance requiring immediate action. The emergency should be reported to the Office for Student Affairs and the appropriate forms completed as soon as possible. If students are unable to make adequate arrangements for patient coverage due to the nature of the emergency, the Office for Student Affairs notifies appropriate faculty and or staff. Medical leave If students, for medi cal reasons, are unable to attend class, they should call the Office for Student Affairs to report their medical reasons, if possible, before they miss a class. A voic e-mail message may be left at the Office for Student Affairs if the office is closed. For medical issues requiring more than two days' absence, students must provide documentation of medical consultation/treatment to the Office for Student Affairs on their return to school. While the Student Handbook 135 Office for Student Affairs does not issue excuses, it does s erve as a record keeper for instructors who may wish to verify a reason for absence. Academic leave of absence Academic leave of absence is a specified period of time during which students are withdrawn from their academic program. Guidelines for an academ ic leave of absence include, but are not limited to: Students having a serious academic deficit that cannot be remediated while continuing with current course work Students not meeting the criteria for promotion to the next academic year Students having t hree consecutive quarters on academic probation Students not passing the National Board Examination Part I on schedule after two attempts and requiring full -time study to prepare for the next attempt Students fulfilling the criteria for academic discontinu ation, yet showing promise for future success Students may be requested to fulfill specific requirements prior to reentering their academic program. Students wishing to return from an academic leave of absence must reapply in writing to the associate dean for academic affairs. They must meet the requirements for readmission specified by the ARC at the time the leave of absence was granted. Upon request, and by approval of the ARC, students may return to their program at a quarter specified by the committee . COURSE SCHEDULES Course schedules are prepared by the Office for Academic Affairs. They are posted on Canvas and sent to students by e -mail prior to the beginning of each quarter. SERVICE LEARNING Service learning at the school continues the original pur pose of the school \u2014training dental - health professionals to provide service to underserved populations, both locally and overseas. Field experience for the school includes extramural opportunities within the U.S. and internationally. In addition to providin g clinical treatment, service learning experiences include local health fairs and elementary school dental health presentations. Service experiences may last from one day to several weeks. Students should consult the Service Learning department for specifi c details and service learning opportunities. Students are required to be in good and regular standing to be eligible to participate in elective international service learning experiences. PROMOTION STANDARDS The following criteria identify the standards r equired for promotion from one class to the next. 136 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY Pre-doctoral Dentistry (D.D.S.)

Ex -officio members of each committee include the associate dean for academic affairs, the associate dean for student affairs, the associate dean for admissions, and the course coordinators of all respective courses for the academic year. The associate dean for clinic administration and the key attending faculty are members of the D3 and D4 academic review committees. In addition, two student membe rs from the class one year ahead of the class being reviewed are appointed by the associate dean for student affairs in consultation with the DSA. Academic review committee (ARC) processes The academic review committees meet once a quarter in order to eval uate student academic and clinical performance. The committee makes recommendations regarding academic and clinical Student Handbook 137 promotion, special recognition for academic or clinical excellence, academic and clinical remediation, academic and clinical probation, or o ther appropriate remediation strategies. Students whose academic or clinical performance does not meet established standards may be recommended for remediation, suspension, or discontinuation from the school. The associate dean for student affairs notifies students of the time, place, and nature of sub - committee meetings (hearings) called to address specific academic and clinical performance issues. Students may be called to appear before the committees. The academic review committee considers the student's presentation and all available information in order to make appropriate recommendations. ACADEMIC SUPPORT Disability accommodation LLUSD provides reasonable and appropriate accommodations in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act for individu als with documented disabilities who demonstrate a need for accommodation. The Americans with Disabilities Act defines a person with a disability as an individual with a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activit ies. Problems such as English as a second language, test anxiety, slow reading without an identified underlying physical or mental deficit, or failure to achieve a desired outcome are generally not covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act. To be cons idered for an accommodation based on a learning disability, a student must experience marked difficulty when compared with the average person in the general population, not just other dental school students, in one or more basic academic areas as a result of a significant information processing or attention disorder. Students requesting accommodations must provide supporting documentation for the disability requiring accommodation, including: A report from a licensed professional approved by Loma Linda Uni versity School of Dentistry identifying the diagnosed disability and the recommended accommodations Record of any previous accommodations provided by educational institutions or other testing agencies If no prior accommodations were provided, the licensed professional should include a detailed explanation as to why no accommodations were given in the past and why they are needed now Documentation needs to be reviewed by the associate dean for student affairs before accommodation is formally implemented. Wh ile awaiting assessment and documentation, temporary accommodation may be granted. The temporary accommodation will not exceed 90 days. Students requesting accommodation are responsible for: Reporting their request for accommodation to the Office for Stu dent Affairs 138 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY Providing the supporting documentation Informing relevant course directors and instructors at the beginning of each quarter Confirming the accommodation request with the course director and the Office for Student Affairs one week prior to an e xamination The Office for Student Affairs is responsible for: Recording the receipt and filing the accommodation documentation Providing the letter of support to course directors, including the nature and scope of the accommodation Arranging facilities a nd proctors for examinations, if required Counseling services Counseling and support services are available for students with personal, relational, family, and/or spiritual needs. In addition to the general services described above, specific help is availa ble for students with substance abuse or dependencies and other problems associated with addictive behavior. Students should consult with the associate dean for student affairs for referral information. Tutoring The Office for Student Affairs encourages th e use of peer tutoring for students experiencing academic difficulties. Students who desire or have been advised to seek tutoring should contact the department in which tutoring is desired. Financial assistance may be provided in certain situations to stud ents who work as tutors. ACADEMIC REMEDIATION Academic probation Academic probation is a specified period of time during which students are given opportunity to comply with academic standards. Such actions are confirmed in writing. Criteria for academic pr obation Academic probation is justified by one or more of the following conditions: A quarterly or cumulative grade point average below 2.0 Any grade below a C - (e.g., D+, D, F, U) in any required course Clinical performance below minimum standards for a current academic level Breaches of professional standards that have significantly impacted academic and/or clinical performance Levels of academic probation The levels of academic probation indicate the seriousness of the cumulative academic deficiency. De pending on the seriousness or nature of the academic deficiency, students may be considered for academic leave of absence or discontinuation at any level of probation. Student Handbook 139 Level 1: First quarter on academic probation. Level 2: Second quarter on academic proba tion, consecutive or nonconsecutive (exception \u2014continued academic probation due to failing grade in a course that cannot be repeated until a later quarter). Level 3: Third quarter on academic probation (consecutive or nonconsecutive). If students are unabl e to remove probationary status within the following quarter, they may be considered for academic discontinuation (exception \u2014continued academic probation due to failing grade in a course that cannot be repeated until a later quarter). Level 4: If students meet the criteria for academic probation for a fourth quarter, consecutive or nonconsecutive, an academic hearing is required to consider discontinuation from the school. Probation restrictions Students on academic probation: May not serve as an officer f or any class, school, or extracurricular organization May not take any elective courses May not participate in any elective off -campus service learning or mission activities Remain on academic probation until all the terms of the probation sanctions have b een fulfilled, unless they are discontinued from the school Request for Incomplete (I) notation An Incomplete (I) notation is given only for circumstances beyond a student's control. This notation is not granted as a remedy for overload, failure on final e xaminations, absence from final examinations for other than emergency situations, or a low grade to be raised with extra work. Students must petition the instructor to receive an \"I\" notation, stating the reason for the request. If approved, the instructor reports the incomplete, as well as the grade the student will receive if the deficiency is not removed within the time limit. An Incomplete (I) notation may be changed to a passing grade only by the instructor before the end of the following quarter. Reme dial actions As a condition for continued enrollment, remedial action may consist of: Counseling, tutoring, and/or repeating assignments or course work Additional assignments or course work, possibly including repeating an academic year or portion thereof Other specified requirements Repeating a course An unsatisfactory or failing grade in a required course requires additional work. Based on the original grade earned by the students, and on recommendation of the academic review committee, one of the follow ing plans is initiated: 140 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY Students receiving an unsatisfactory grade (D+/D/U) must reregister for the course, review the course work independently, repeat required assignments or quizzes, and take any or all course examinations as required by the course dir ector. The highest grade allowed for a remediated course is C. At the discretion of the ARC and course director, students may be required to repeat a course at the next course offering. Both grades appear on students' transcripts. Students receiving a fail ing grade (F) must reregister for the course, attend the class and/or laboratory, and take all course examinations at the next regular course offering. Both the original and repeat grades are entered in the students' permanent academic record. Only the rep eated course grade is computed in the grade point average. ACADEMIC DISCONTINUA TION Guidelines for academic discontinuation include: D1 Any quarter with one or more failing grades, regardless of term or cumulative G.P.A. Three or more unsatisfactory or fai ling grades within the academic year, regardless of term or cumulative G.P.A.

If students are not satisfied, they may then appeal to the associate dean for academic affairs. ACADEMIC APPEAL Academic review committee decisions may be appealed to the dean. Such appeals are not routine and should be considered only in circum stances where new and relevant information exists that was not available for consideration by the committee. After reviewing the information, the dean either renders a decision or appoints a three - member ad hoc committee to review the ARC decision. Members of the ad hoc committee have not been involved in the ARC decision process. The dean determines whether the appealing student is permitted to attend classes, laboratories, or clinics during the appeal proceedings. The ad hoc committee determines whether d ue process was followed, reviews the new information, and makes a judgment whether the record supports the decision. The committee reports its findings and recommendations to the dean, who then makes a determination on the issue. 142 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY ACADEMIC WITHDRAWAL Withdr awal from a course or courses must be authorized in writing by the associate dean for academic affairs. ACADEMIC AWARDS Dean's List Outstanding academic performance is recognized by publication of the Dean's List each quarter. The eligibility requirements are: At least twelve units of graded course work completed during the quarter A term grade point average of at least 3.5, with no grade lower than B - No Incomplete grade Other awards Recognition is given not just for academic and clinic performance, but a lso for leadership, service, integrity and character demonstration. An awards ceremony is held at the end of each academic year for the predoctoral dentistry students, at which time various awards are presented, predominantly to students of the graduating class. Some are also presented to students in other classes. International Dentist Program graduates receive awards of recognition during the IDP banquet held prior to the graduation weekend. During a special pinning ceremony held graduation weekend, stud ents of the graduating dental hygiene class receive awards for academic and clinical accomplishments.

The medical school was founded in 1909 and was known as the College of Medical Evangelists until 1961, when it was renamed Loma Linda University. The medical school was established f or the unique purpose of educating Christian physicians to continue the healing and teaching ministry of Jesus Christ. For nearly a century, the School of Medicine has held to its founding mission of clinical excellence, whole person care, and global partn erships. The curriculum in whole person care is designed to make the students competent in managing the patients' physical, mental, and spiritual well -being. Our global partnerships throughout the world provide a broad spectrum of service learning opportun ities for our students. You were accepted to this school because of your commitment to continue and expand its historic mission and because you have demonstrated the academic and personal qualities necessary to become competent, ethical, and caring physic ians. This Student Handbook contains information that will guide you in your professional development and protect your rights as a student. It is important that you read and understand these policies and guidelines. If you need assistance, or if you have q uestions about the School's policies and practices, I encourage you to contact the Offices of Student Affairs and Medical Student Education. Once again, welcome. Sincerely, Roger Hadley, M.D. Dean 148 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY The Mission of the School of Medicine OUR MISSION To continue the healing and teaching ministry of Jesus Christ, \"To make man whole\" (Luke 9:6). PREPARING THE PHYSIC IAN Our overriding purpose is the formation of Christian physicians, educated to serve as generalists or specialists providing integrative, whole person care to individuals, families, and communities. To discharge this responsibility requires: Education Creating an environment in which medical students, graduate students, and residents will acquire the knowledge, skills, values, and attitude s appropriate to Christian health professionals and scholars. Research Cultivating an atmosphere of inquiry and discovering new routes to wholeness through basic and clinical research. Service Ministering to the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual needs of patients in a timely and cost-effective fashion with due regard for their privacy, dignity, and valid consent; providing diagnostic and therapeutic services in primary and tertiary care settings to patients of all ages, races, religions, and socio economic backgrounds. DEVELOPING THE WHOLE PERSON The Christian view of wholeness holds that the needs of patients go beyond the healing of the body, and that the development of students involves more than the training of the mind. We are dedicated to pro moting physical, intellectual, social, and spiritual growth in our faculty and our students; and to transforming our daily activities into personal ministries. REACHING THE WORLD Providing integrative, whole person care wherever the opportunity arises; pa rticipating with the world community in the provision of local medical education; providing international physicians and scientists the opportunity for professional interaction and enrichment; sharing the good news of a loving God, as demonstrated by the l ife and teachings of Jesus Christ \u2014these are the goals of the students, faculty, and graduates of the School of Medicine. The objectives of medical education are to: Provide an opportunity for students to build a solid foundation of medical knowledge with lifelong commitment to learning; Assist students in the attainment of professional skills; Student Handbook 149 Instill in students an investigative curiosity and a desire to participate in the advancement of knowledge; Guide in the development of a balanced sense of Christian values as revealed in intellectual, ethical, spiritual, and humane concerns; and Engender and nurture in students the desire to serve mankind in this country and throughout the world. 150 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY Loma Linda University School of Medicine Physician's Oath Before God th ese things I do promise: In the acceptance of my sacred calling, I will dedicate my life to the furtherance of Jesus Christ's healing and teaching ministry. I will give to my teachers the respect and gratitude which is their due. I will impart to those w ho follow me the knowledge and experience that I have gained. The wholeness of my patient will be my first consideration. Acting as a good steward of the resources of society and of the talents granted me, I will endeavor to reflect God's mercy and compass ion by caring for the lonely, the poor, the suffering, and those who are dying. I will maintain the utmost respect for human life. I will not use my medical knowledge contrary to the laws of humanity. I will respect the rights and decisions of my patients. I will hold in confidence all secrets committed to my keeping in the practice of my calling. I will lead my life and practice my art with purity and honor; abstaining from immorality myself, I will not lead others into moral wrong doing. May God's kingdo m, His healing power and glory be experienced by those whom I serve; and may they be made known in my life, in proportion as I am faithful to this oath. Student Handbook 151 Clinical Facilities Clinical instruction takes place primarily at Loma Linda University Health, which i ncludes the Loma Linda University Medical Center, Loma Linda University Children's Hospital, Loma Linda University Medical Center East Campus, Loma Linda University Medical Center Heart and Surgical Hospital, Faculty Medical Offices (FMO), and the Loma Lin da University Behavioral Medicine Center. Additional local training sites include the Arrowhead Regional Medical Center, Jerry L. Pettis Memorial Veterans Medical Center, Glendale Adventist Medical Center, Kaiser Permanente, Riverside County Regional Medic al Center, and White Memorial Medical Center. Also utilized are Kettering Medical Center in Dayton, Ohio; Portland Adventist Hospital in Portland, Oregon; Florida Hospital in Orlando, Florida; and Hinsdale Hospital in Hinsdale, Illinois. Many local outpati ent sites are also utilized. Additional information may be found in the online Loma Linda University CATALOG. 152 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY Professional Expectations Loma Linda University School of Medicine was established to provide medical student education of future physicians in a n atmosphere where basic Christian values are honored. The rigorous academic expectations of the institution are consistent with the example of personal excellence embodied in the Christian tradition and expected of those who enter the profession of medici ne. Integrity is an essential personal quality for successful completion of the M.D. degree program and for the practice of medicine. Upholding the standards of professional and personal conduct expected of physicians includes both acquiring behavioral pat terns and attitudes consistent with the oath taken at the time of graduation; and also being accountable for one's own conduct, as well as assuming responsibility for the professional behavior of one's colleagues. Some examples of serious breaches of integ rity that are not acceptable include: lying, cheating (including plagiarism), falsifying reports, and submitting documents such as clinical log books that contain forged or unauthorized signatures. Other examples that may appear to be more minor but that c onstitute misrepresentations of truth and are thus also of concern include such things as signing someone else's name on an attendance sheet (for a required class or meeting, etc.) or signing oneself in as present and then leaving, etc. Assuming responsibi lity for the professional behavior of one's colleagues means exemplifying integrity oneself; encouraging colleagues to be honest and responsible; and refusing to ignore or cover up serious breaches of integrity, such as cheating, stealing, or falsifying re cords. Medicine is a profession that society rightfully expects to be self -governing. The process of becoming a member of this trusted profession begins when a student enters medical school. Application to and enrollment in the University constitute the st udent's commitment to honor and abide by the academic, nonacademic, and social practices, policies, and regulations of the University and the School of Medicine. These policies are found in bulletins, handbooks, announcements, and other published materials . LIFESTYLE GUIDELINES AND GOVERNING PRACTI CES From the day of enrollment in the School of Medicine, students are considered to be junior colleagues in the medical fraternity. They are an integral part of the treatment team and must exhibit conduct consist ent with the ideals of the profession. CONDUCT Students of Loma Linda University School of Medicine are expected to abide by the standards of Loma Linda University and of the School of Medicine and to uphold principles of behavior in harmony with the teach ings of the Seventh -day Adventist Church. These standards and principles are outlined in the University CATALOG, the Student Handbook , and other written policy statements provided at matriculation and after enrollment. The student's personal life will be i n harmony with conduct expected by the school and the Seventh -day Adventist Church. Student Handbook 153 The use of tobacco, alcohol, or other harmful substances is not consistent with citizenship as a student. Also, it is to be understood that it is the policy of the Universi ty that faculty and students are not to attend secular, professional, or business meetings during the hours of Sabbath when acting as representatives of, or identified as, Loma Linda University students or faculty members. Specific policies regarding these and other areas of behavior are in the University policy section of this Student Handbook . IMPLEMENTATION OF TH E ETHICS OF CONFIDEN TIALITY Since time immemorial, patients and physicians alike have recognized the importance of trust in the patient -physicia n relationship. The role of confidentiality in nurturing and protecting trust is enshrined in the Hippocratic Oath: \"What I may see or hear in the course of treatment, which no one must spread abroad, I will keep to myself...\" Maintaining confidentiality i s difficult when patient confidences are shared among those assisting the physician in caring for the patient. The difficulty is compounded in the teaching hospital where many other categories of people\u2014hospital employees, students, representatives of the payer organizations, etc. \u2014have access to written and electronic patient records. LLU Medical Center practices safeguarding confidentiality The Medical Center requires an affirmation from each school that rotating students have had instruction in medical e thics. It also requires that the school have a disciplinary procedure for dealing with students who deliberately or chronically breach patient confidentiality and privacy. Similar requirements exist for hospital employees and medical staff. Breaching patie nt confidentiality Some areas of potential risk for breaching patient confidentiality are (1) having conversations that might be overheard in public areas (elevators, corridors, cafeterias, etc.), (2) attending conferences open to those not caring for the patient, (3) failing to sign off at computer terminals, sharing one's confidential computer sign -on with others, or snooping when accessing computer databases. Each student has been entrusted with the sacred right of patient care. A student should not do a nything to make him/her undeserving of this trust. It is the student's responsibility to respect patient confidentiality. As members of a medical health -care team, students should see only those patients to which they have been assigned by the team. COMPET ENCY: PROFESSIONALIS M LLUSOM definition As servants of a trustworthy God, we understand professionalism to be a set of beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors that enhance trustworthiness of physicians individually and collectively. Amplification of definition Successful Medicine Program students consistently demonstrate personal and professional attributes and societal responsibilities that perpetuate trust by others (including patients, 154 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY teachers, colleagues, members of the health -care team, and society). The fo llowing are examples of such attributes and responsibilities: Personal attributes Consistently present self in an appropriate manner (e.g., dress, hygiene, language, behavior). Optimize personal wholeness by proactively addressing health, behavioral, psych ological, or physical limitations and/or biases (e.g., gender, cultural) that may interfere with learning and patient care. Be responsive to patients' needs that supersede self -interest while recognizing the need for personal wholeness. Demonstrate respect for teachers and the educational process through adequate preparation, active participation, punctuality, and timely completion of requirements. Honestly acknowledge errors, including in clinical situations (e.g., CQI). Communicate accurately and truthful ly. Adhere to bio -ethical principles and human values in caring for patients and in relating to patient's families and others involved in patient care. Embrace feedback regarding noncognitive achievement and seek to improve behaviors related to the feedbac k. Embrace feedback regarding cognitive achievement and seek to improve behaviors related to the feedback. Relationship attributes Demonstrate compassion and empathy to others. Provide whole person support to patients and their families (physical, educati onal, social, psychological, and spiritual). Treat others with respect. Treat patients with dignity, civility and respect \u2014regardless of race, culture, gender, ethnicity, age, socioeconomic status, disability, or sexual orientation. Manage conflict and resp ect patients' autonomy when their values differ from one's own. Maintain patient, research subject, and student confidentiality. Advocate for individual patient needs. Respectfully address differences of opinion with others while continuing a professional relationship with the individual with whom the student disagrees. Maintain appropriate relationships and boundaries with others. Societal responsibilities Communicate constructive feedback to colleagues (e.g., peer -peer evaluation of teamwork). Recognize u nprofessional behaviors and misconduct in colleagues and seek advice to carry out an ethically appropriate response. Actively participate in small groups and other educational opportunities. Student Handbook 155 Intentionally seek opportunities to be helpful to the clinical t eam, including maintaining prompt and appropriate accessibility. Comply with institutional requirements and regulatory and professional standards Recognize health disparities. Demonstrate awareness of the responsibility to promote health at the societal le vel. Exhibit honesty in interactions, documentations, research, and scholarly activity. Advocate for just distribution of health resources. STANDARDS FOR APPEAR ANCE AND APPAREL Students at Loma Linda University are expected to maintain an appearance that is consistent with the highest professional standards and that projects to the public an image of cleanliness, competence, and professionalism. The image should be modest and consistent with the mission and philosophy of Loma Linda University. Good taste i ndicates that haircuts, hairstyles, and personal grooming be neat and conservative rather than ostentatious. Grooming and style should also be practical so as to enable one's duties to be performed without embarrassment, inconvenience, or threat to safety. Specifically: Hair must be clean and neat, avoiding radical styles. Mustaches and beards, if worn, must be clean, neat, and trimmed. Cosmetics and perfumes should be inconspicuous. Loma Linda University discourages the wearing of jewelry. If a woman chooses to wear earrings, they should not drop below the bottom of the earlobes and should be limited to one per ear. Earrings are not permitted for men. Visible tattoos and body piercing, such as facial and tongue studs, are not permitted for men or wome n. Fingernails should be maintained in a professional manner, be closely trimmed, and should not interfere with patient care or professional duties. Nail polish, if worn, should be subdued in color. For clinical appointments, and whenever students are in the Medical Center or other clinical facilities, clean, short white coats with approved name tags are to be worn at all times, including assignments at affiliated hospitals and while on electives. University ID badges must be worn in a visible location ab ove the waist at all times. Men are to wear neckties and neatly pressed slacks (not jeans). Women should wear professional appearing skirts, dresses, or slacks. Some clinical sites may have dress requirements that are more specific than those listed here. Modest casual wear is appropriate on campus and in class. In settings where shorts are acceptable, they must be neat and at least mid -thigh in length. Sloppy clothing, tank -tops, tight - fitting shorts, clothing that is torn or frayed, bare midriffs, miniski rts, and skirts with deep slits are not appropriate in any of the clinical facilities or in such places as classrooms, the libraries, or the cafeteria. Words, pictures, and/or symbols displayed on clothing should be consistent with an Adventist Christian i nstitution and sensitive to a diverse student population. Shoes are considered standard apparel. Flip flops or sandals are not appropriate in any clinical facility. 156 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY WEEKEND ASSIGNMENTS Becoming a physician includes learning to accept responsibility for pat ients 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year \u2014except when alternatives for coverage have been arranged. There are no formal educational activities on Sabbath, but students are expected to participate in patient -care activities on Sabbath as part of the medical team. Weekend assignments usually do not exceed three consecutive weekends. Clerkships are instructed to provide students who are on weekend call time off to attend worship services. TRANSPORTATION Students must have access to transportation fo r off-campus assignments and, if driving, maintain a valid driver's license. All student vehicles must be registered with Loma Linda University Department of Parking and Traffic. EMPLOYMENT It is recommended that students refrain from assuming work obligat ions that divert time, attention, and energy from the full -time task of medical education. ADDRESS, TELEPHONE N UMBER, AND NAME CHAN GES It is essential that the school and the University have the student's current address and telephone number. Students who move or change any of their contact information should update that information by logging into the Student Services website as soon as possible. If a student marries and/or wishes to make a name change, s/he must provide official documentation of the name change to University Records. STUDENT SUPPORT SERV ICES There are a number of services available for students who wish to benefit from personal counseling. The University and School of Medicine provide counseling and support services for students with per sonal, relational, family, and/or spiritual concerns. The services are easily accessible, and the School of Medicine encourages students to take advantage of them during times of need. In addition to assistance for emotional issues, specific help is availa ble for students with study skills and time management challenges, substance abuse/dependencies, and other problems of addictive or compulsive behavior. Specific information about access to these services can be found in Section III (\"Student Services\" ) and Section V (\"Student Policies\") of this Student Handbook , as well as in the orientation materials given to each beginning School of Medicine class. Students may personally contact the Student Counseling Center or Student Assistance Program for confidentia l counseling services. They may also consult with the associate dean for student affairs for assistance. IMMUNIZATION REQUIRE MENTS Exposure to patients takes place during year one of medical education. Because of this, it is necessary for students to have immunizations against certain infectious diseases. In order to complete registration for the first academic quarter, students must give evidence in the form of physician records or college health service records that they have met immunization requirements . Students without proper verification will be required to receive immunizations, Student Handbook 157 and the charges will be billed to the student's account. The pre -entrance requirements may be found at <llu.edu/ssweb/documents/immunizations.pdf>. Students are also required to have certain injections and immunizations repeated at various intervals during their enrollment. These include an influenza vaccine and annual skin test for tuberculosis. STUDENT MISTREATMENT POLICY Loma Linda University School of Medicine seeks to edu cate ethical and proficient Christian physicians and scholars through instruction, example, and the pursuit of truth. In order to do this, the School of Medicine and its faculty are committed to the following fundamental values: compassion, integrity, exce llence, freedom, justice, purity/self -control, and humility. These values may occasionally be formally taught by faculty; but more often they are learned informally by students through observation of models of professional behavior toward students, colleag ues, and patients. The development and nurturing of these values is enhanced by and based upon the presence of mutual respect between teacher and learner. The diversity of students, faculty, residents, and staff \u2014combined with the intensity of their interac tions\u2014may, however, lead to alleged, perceived, or real incidents of inappropriate behavior or mistreatment of students. Examples of such mistreatment include verbal mistreatment1, physical mistreatment2, discrimination3, excessive or unreasonable time dem ands4, sexual harassment5, and the use of grading or other forms of assessment in a punitive manner. Such behavior by faculty or staff, or other behavior that is inimical to the development of mutual respect, is unacceptable. In the history of medical educ ation, it has not been uncommon for teachers, in an effort to motivate students to excellence, to publicly degrade or humiliate those whom they judge are inadequately prepared or behaving inappropriately. This practice is not acceptable at Loma Linda Unive rsity. While teachers do have the responsibility to motivate and correct students, when correction of an individual is needed, this is usually best done in private, but always in a way that shows respect for him/her as a person. An important part of the te aching of mutual respect among professionals is the perception of students as they observe faculty in their interactions with each other. Therefore, faculty 1 Verbal or nonverbal mistreatment \u2014includes: a. shouting, hostility, profanity, or offensive gestures; and/or b. repeated or blatant conduct directed toward any person, which is intended to insult or stigmatize that person. 2 Physical mistreatment \u2014includes physical punishment such as hitting, slapping, pushing or kicking; the threat of physical punishment; and intentionally or negligently placing another at risk of physical harm. 3 Discrimination \u2014includes disparate treatment based on ge nder, age, ethnicity, race, disability, or sexual orientation that stigmatizes or degrades that person. 4 Unreasonable time demands \u2014includes: a. requiring a student to perform personal services, such as shopping or babysitting; and/or b. requiring a student to perform menial tasks with the intent to humiliate the student. 5 Sexual harassment \u2014see \"LLU Sexual Harassment Policy\" in the University Policy section of this Student Handbook . Additional copies are available at the Office of Student Affairs and the appropriate campus centers. If the mistreatment involves sexual harassment, the procedures of the sexual harassment policy must be followed. Copies of the sexual harassment policy a re given to students at orientation. 158 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY should avoid inappropriate behavior or mistreatment of other professionals and staff. This includes the avoidance of derogatory remarks about or attitudes toward individual colleagues, services, or departments. Students also learn professional behavior and demeanor by observing their teachers as they interact with patients. Such professional interaction s should always be courteous and respectful. Respect for individuals includes, but is not limited to, such things as punctuality, thoughtfulness, mindfulness of personal space; as well as manner and mode of address, appropriately modest draping, tone and c ontent of verbal interchanges, and body language. In addition, discussion of patients out of their hearing should continue to show the same degree of respect and should not include contemptuous, derogatory, judgmental, or demeaning remarks. If a medical st udent expresses an unwillingness to participate in an aspect of training or patient care as a matter of conscience, that stance should be explored in a nonjudgmental manner to ensure that the teacher and student fully understand the issue. The student's po sition on matters of conscience should be honored without academic or personal penalty, as long as it does not interfere with the welfare of the patient and the overall educational goals of Loma Linda University School of Medicine. Any student who feels s/ he may have been mistreated by residents, faculty, or staff in violation of these standards of behavior has the right and is encouraged to initiate one of the procedural options outlined in the Loma Linda University \"Student Mistreatment\" policy that is found in Section V of this Student Handbook . Reports of sexual harassment or mistreatment should be made to the School of Medicine administration or, in cases of sexual harassment, to the Title IX officer . Within the School of Medicine, the mistreatment can be reported to the following administrators: the vice dean for academic affairs (Tamara Thomas, M.D.); the senior associate dean for medical student education (Leonard Werner, M.D.); the associate dean for clinical education (Tami Shankel, M.D.); the assoc iate dean for student affairs (Henry Lamberton, Psy.D.); or the associate dean for basic sciences and translational research (Penny Duerksen -Hughes, Ph.D.). BREACHES OF CONDUCT AND PROFESSIONALISM Cases of misconduct, including violations of school or Uni versity policies or breaches of professional behavior, are dealt with and resolved at various administrative levels, depending on the nature and seriousness of the misconduct and whether or not the misconduct represents a pattern of behavior. Where specifi c forms of misconduct are addressed by specific policies, the procedures outlined in the policies shall be followed. Cases of misconduct or breaches of professionalism that are identified by a course director or the Office of the Dean may be referred to th e School of Medicine Professionalism Committee. The Professionalism Committee shall review reports of inappropriate behavior and may ask a student to meet with the members to address questions and concerns. The committee may establish and require specific remediation \u2014including counseling, supervision, or professional evaluation. In situations where the committee determines that a student's behavior may merit a modification of the student's academic program or suspension or dismissal, the committee will refer the matter, along with its findings and recommendations, to the Academic Review Committee for further action. Student Handbook 159 Academic Policies Cognitive and noncognitive academic performance (including personal suitability to assume the responsibilities of the medical profession) is monitored by the Academic Review Committee. What follows includes some of the academic policies of the school, but does not cover all of the specific policies for which students are accountable. Additional policies are provided at matricula tion and/or class orientations. ACADEMIC VARIANCE Upon being registered as a medical student, variation from the regular academic program for any reason (i.e., independent study, leave of absence, postsophomore fellowship, research degree, etc.) must be ap proved by the senior associate dean for medical student education. Until approval is confirmed, the variance will not be recognized. INTERRUPTION IN ACAD EMIC PROGRAM/LEAVES OF ABSENCE Students who have matriculated (attended freshman orientation and regist ered) are expected to complete the first two years of medical education without interruption. Students who fail to pass the first year or interrupt the first year of study for reasons other than lack of professionalism, personal misconduct, or other noncog nitive academic issues will ordinarily be allowed one opportunity to repeat the year. Students may be required to delay the repeat year at the discretion of the Academic Review Committee. The time at which students are allowed to begin a repeat/makeup year will depend upon: (1) the number of spaces available once an entering class has been filled by regular applicants and other students (e.g., students in the M.D./Ph.D. combined degrees and in the Biomedical Science Program, and repeating students) the scho ol determines to be most qualified for a space in the class, AND (2) the merits of the circumstances that contributed to their failure and/or that necessitated taking a leave of absence from medical school. Students who are not permitted to begin a repeat year at the beginning of the academic year that immediately follows the year they failed or during which they took a leave of absence will be given first priority the following year to repeat. Students who experience academic or personal difficulty that ne cessitates they repeat an academic year will be expected to fulfill remediation requirements as specified by the Office of the Dean before they are granted permission to begin the repeat year. These will include spending time with a counselor who is approv ed by the Office of the Dean, and undergoing educational assessment to identify possible learning strengths and weaknesses that can be addressed to help the student be successful. Students who are not able to pass the first two years within three years and /or who are not able to pass the third and fourth years within three years will not be allowed to remain in school, except in unusual circumstances when the Academic Review Committee and/or Executive Committee determine that an exception is in order. A des cription of academic reasons (both cognitive and noncognitive) for which a student may be dismissed from school is found in the policies in the section entitled \"Dismissal from School.\" Note that one reason for dismissal is \"failure to satisfactorily compl ete the Year 2 160 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY curriculum within thirty -six months of starting medical school, unless prior approval for additional delay is obtained (in writing) from the Office of the Dean.\" A second reason is \"failure to satisfactorily complete all requirements for gra duation within thirty -six months of completing the Year 2 curriculum and USMLE Step 1, unless prior approval for additional delay is obtained (in writing) from the Office of the Dean .\" Student Handbook 161 Examination Policy MISSED EXAMINATIONS Students who have an excused ab sence for one day of a three -day midterm examination will receive their two -day score, and the percentage earned on the cumulative final examination (including NBME subject examinations) for each course will be substituted for the missed examination. Stude nts who miss two or three days of a three -day midterm examination are required to take a makeup examination within two weeks of the missed examination dates at a date and time scheduled by the course director. Makeup examinations may differ in content and/ or format from the missed examinations. In addition, course directors may require other remediation at their discretion. Should a student miss an in -house final examination because of an excused absence, arrangements must be made with the course directors to make up the missed examinations. The course directors, at their discretion, may opt to have the student take an examination that is different in format, content, or length from the final examination that was administered to the class. Should a student m iss a national board subject examination because of an excused absence, the student will be allowed one opportunity at the end of the academic year to take and pass the subject examination upon completing all other course work for that year. Arrangements f or the makeup examination must be made through the Office of Medical Student Education. CONDITIONS TO BE MET FOR AN EXCUSED ABSEN CE In order to have an excused absence, the student must get a written excuse from the Office of Medical Student Education prio r to the administration of the test in question. Students missing examinations for health reasons must provide written documentation of their illness from Student Health Service or another examining physician. Whether or not this documentation is an adequa te excuse for missing an examination will be left to the discretion of the senior associate dean for medical student education. Under no circumstances are students allowed to take examinations early. In the event of a bona fide emergency where prior approv al is not feasible, the Office of the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Student Education ( 909/558 -4255) must be contacted as soon as possible. Failure to do so will result in an unexcused absence. Students who miss examinations without prior approval from the Office of the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Student Education have an unexcused absence. As a result, the student will receive a zero for the missed examination(s). Missing more than one examination in any course or combination of courses could re sult in a student having to repeat the course(s) during the next academic year. TEST SITE POLICIES LLU School of Medicine examinations will be administered in a manner similar to those given by the National Board of Medical Examiners. The following test si te policies have been adapted 162 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY from the National Board of Medical Examiners' (NBME) policies for administration of examinations. Personal belongings in the testing room Students are not permitted to bring the following items into the seating area of the tes ting room: Backpacks ( No backpacks will be allowed in the testing room. ) Students must deposit their backpack in their locker or car before entering the room. Backpacks cannot be left in the hallway because it is an unsecured area and the items are consid ered obstructions for fire evacuation. Reference materials ( No books, notes, papers, etc., will be allowed in the testing room. ) These items may not be left in the rooms adjacent to the testing facility. They should be stored in a secure place, such as a l ocker or car. Food or drink of any kind. Students with health concerns who require an exception may make special arrangements through the Office of Medical Student Education. Caps, hoods, or nonreligious head coverings. Purses, pencil boxes, or any other s mall items. Pencils or pens (dry erase pens and whiteboards or pencils and scratch paper will be supplied). Calculators (calculators are available on the examination computer). Cellular telephones, paging devices, or personal digital assistants ; or any dev ice that stores or transmits information Watches with alarms, computer or memory capability, or recording capability Recording/filming devices. Sound devices (iPods, etc.), earbuds, or headphones (earplugs are acceptable). Entering the examination room Students must show their ID badge in order to be admitted to the examination room. Students should arrive 10 to 15 minutes prior to the scheduled start time so that the examination can begin on time. To prevent confusion about who is present and who is not, once students have been admitted to the testing facility, they are expected to take their assigned seat and remain there until after the chief proctor has finished reading the instructions and the examination has begun. Late arrival In order to take an ex amination, students must be present when the chief proctor reads the examination instructions at the designated start time. Students who arrive late to an examination will be denied entrance. If, due to special circumstances, a student has been given permi ssion by the Office of Medical Student Education to arrive late to an examination, the number of minutes the student is late will be deducted from the allotted examination time. Students who arrive after any other student has left the examination for any r eason will not be permitted to take the examination. For national board subject examinations, students will be denied entrance once the examination has started, without exception. Student Handbook 163 Restroom break Proctors will escort students to and from the restroom and pe riodically check the restrooms for examination -related materials. Examination time continues while students are absent from their computer terminal. Restroom breaks will not be permitted during the last 10 minutes of regularly scheduled examination times. Completion of examination Students who complete the examination before the end of the allotted time may leave the testing area as dismissed one at a time by a proctor after turning in their scratch paper and pencil (or cleaning and turning in their whitebo ard and dry -erase pen). Students are not allowed to linger in the hallways outside the test site. Restrooms adjacent to the examination room are for the use of students still taking the examination. Students who have finished their examination early must u se another restroom. 164 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY Grading Policy Course/clerkship directors assign grades at the end of each course/clerkship. Grades reflect the success or failure of the student in meeting the objectives of the course/clerkship in terms of knowledge, skills, attitude s, values, and behaviors. The University transcript records grades for completed courses/clerkships as Satisfactory (S), Marginal Satisfactory (MS), or Unsatisfactory (U). For the purposes of determining eligibility for promotion, the School of Medicine u tilizes grades of Satisfactory (S), Marginal Satisfactory (MS), Unsatisfactory (U), or In Progress (IP). Course/clerkship directors assign a grade of Satisfactory (S) when a student's performance clearly exceeds the requirements of the course/clerkship. A grade of Marginal Satisfactory is assigned when the course/clerkship director judges student performance meets but does not exceed the minimal requirements of the course. A grade of Unsatisfactory is assigned when a student's performance fails to meet the minimal requirements for the course/clerkship. A grade of IP is used to identify students having unfinished course/clerkship requirements. Subjective narrative descriptions of student performance are submitted to the Office of the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Student Education and may be used in the medical student performance evaluation (MSPE/Dean's Letter). Students who wish to contest a grade should discuss the grade first with the course/clerkship director, then with the department chair. If the st udent is not satisfied, s/he may then appeal the grade to the Office of the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Student Education. DETERMINATION OF DEA N'S LETTER GRADE For the medical student performance evaluation (MSPE/Dean's Letter), students will be assigned one of the following five designations for each course/clerkship: H (honors) HP (high pass) P (pass) MP (marginal pass) U (unsatisfactory) Each designation will be based on predetermined criteria established by the course/clerkship dire ctor in collaboration with the Office of Medical Student Education. The criteria for ranking may include student performance on faculty -generated examinations, national standardized subject examinations, active and computer -based learning activities, patie nt-care activities, objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs), medical simulations, and other academic activities as set forth by the course/clerkship director. Students who have failed a course or clerkship -specific NBME subject examination are n ot eligible to receive Dean's Letter grades of honors or high pass in that course/clerkship. Student Handbook 165 Junior and senior medical students will not be ranked against each other. Clerkship grades and performance on school -required activities will be reported on the Me dical School Performance Evaluation (MSPE/Dean's Letter). STUDENT PERFORMANCE FOR ACADEMIC PROMOTI ON OR RETENTION Promotion from year to year is contingent upon satisfactory academic performance. Cognitive and noncognitive (including personal suitability to assume the responsibilities of the medical profession) academic progress are monitored by the Academic Review Committee. The committee evaluates cumulative academic performance, not just performance in current or most recent course work. Students must p ass each course to demonstrate overall satisfactory performance. The Academic Review Committee will consider overall student performance to be unsatisfactory when the student: Receives a grade of Unsatisfactory in any course; Receives multiple grades of I n Progress resulting from unsatisfactory performance in clinical responsibilities, noncognitive academic performance, or cognitive academic performance; Receives some combination of grades of Marginal Satisfactory, In Progress, or Unsatisfactory; Fails to meet school -determined minimum performance requirements on national board examinations, United States medical licensing examinations, or other externally standardized examinations; or Demonstrates a lack of professionalism and/or is identified as having un acceptable noncognitive academic problems. ACADEMIC PROBATION A student whose overall performance is judged to be unsatisfactory by the Academic Review Committee is placed on academic probation. While the Academic Review Committee has the prerogative to d etermine the duration of academic probation on a case -by-case basis, the customary duration of probation lasts for the entire subsequent academic year. By placing a student on academic probation, the school is giving the student formal notice that any addi tional grades of In Progress, Marginal Satisfactory, or Unsatisfactory during the term of probation could result in the student's dismissal from school. In addition, expanded and more specific terms of probation may be stipulated for individual students, a s judged necessary by the Academic Review Committee. Students on academic probation are not permitted to run for or hold elected or appointed class, school, or University leadership positions during the period of probation. 166 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY FRESHMAN AND SOPHOMO RE YEAR PROM OTION POLICIES To receive a grade of Satisfactory in a preclinical course, student performance must exceed the minimum course requirements. Specifically, students must: Exceed a minimum cumulative score (to be defined by the course director) on faculty - generated examinations; and Pass the NBME subject examinations at or above the 7th percentile nationally on the first attempt; and Satisfactorily participate in and complete all required laboratory/small -group assignments; and Demonstrate acceptable noncogni tive behavior; and Complete any other specific requirements as deemed necessary by the course director. A grade of In Progress is assigned when a student: Achieves a score of less than the 7th percentile nationally on the NBME subject examination, but ot herwise exceeds the minimum cumulative score identified as passing on faculty -generated examinations; or Has unfinished course requirements that the course director will allow the student to finish at a later specified time. A grade of Marginal Satisfacto ry is assigned when a course director judges that student performance has met but not exceeded minimum course requirements. A grade of Unsatisfactory is assigned when student performance has not met the minimum requirements for overall performance as defin ed by the course director. An Unsatisfactory grade will be assigned if a student: Fails to attain a score at or above the 7th percentile nationally on the NBME subject examination on the first attempt and fails to exceed the minimum cumulative score ident ified as passing on faculty -generated examinations; or Attains a passing score (7th percentile nationally or above) on the NBME subject examination on the first attempt, but fails to meet the minimum cumulative score identified as passing on faculty -genera ted examinations; or Fails the NBME subject examination (below the 7th percentile nationally) after taking the examination a second time to remove a previous grade of In Progress; or Demonstrates unsatisfactory noncognitive behavior; or Fails to participat e in or complete any other assignments and requirements that the course director will not allow the student to finish at a later time. Freshman students must satisfactorily meet Year 1 milestones and knowledge competencies in order to be promoted to the s ophomore year. All students must take the NBME Comprehensive Basic Science Examination upon completion of the sophomore year curriculum. This examination consists of 180 questions from Student Handbook 167 the core basic science disciplines and will be given during the last ex amination week of the sophomore year. Taking the examination is a requirement for beginning the clerkships of the junior year. REMEDIATION POLICIES FOR THE FRESHMAN AND SOPHOMORE YEARS Grades of In Progress must be removed before students can register for course work in the subsequent academic year. A student who receives a grade of In Progress because of an NBME subject examination failure has one opportunity to remove the In Progress by taking and passing (at or above the 7th percentile nationally) the su bject examination prior to beginning the next academic year. To remove a grade of In Progress due to subject examination failure(s) in the freshman year, students must repeat the examination in question by the end of the third week in July if they are t o avoid registering with the incoming freshman class. To remove a grade of In Progress due to subject examination failure(s) in the sophomore year, students must: Repeat the NBME subject examination in neuroscience and/or behavioral sciences during spring break of the sophomore year. Repeat and pass the NBME subject examinations in biochemistry, microbiology, pathology, and/or pharmacology prior to taking Step 1 of the USMLE. Have taken and passed all subject examinations by the beginning of the next sopho more year. When students pass the NBME subject examination(s) on their second attempt, the grade(s) of In Progress will be changed to Satisfactory or Marginal Satisfactory according to their overall performance in the course. Students who fail a course -specific NBME subject examination are not eligible to receive a Dean's Letter grade of honors or high pass in that course. When students fail the NBME subject examination(s) on their second attempt, they must repeat the course(s) in its entirety for which th e subject examination failure(s) occurred. The grade(s) of In Progress will be changed to Unsatisfactory. Grade(s) of In Progress assigned because of the student's inability to complete course requirements for reasons other than unsatisfactory scores on su bject examinations must be removed before the beginning of the next academic year. Failure to do so will result in the student being assigned a grade of Unsatisfactory for the course in question. Grades of Marginal Satisfactory do not need to be remediated unless: A student is required to repeat course work because of grades of Unsatisfactory during the subsequent academic year. If a student with a grade of Unsatisfactory is permitted by the Academic Review Committee to repeat course work during the summer , the student need not repeat a course for which a grade of Marginal Satisfactory was recorded; or 168 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY The Academic Review Committee judges that the student's overall record and/or multiple grades of Marginal Satisfactory is so deficient that repeating those c ourses would provide the student with a more secure foundation for future academic and professional success. Students with an Unsatisfactory grade must repeat and pass the course(s) for which the grade of Unsatisfactory were recorded prior to advancing to the next academic year. A freshman student with up to two grades of Unsatisfactory may remediate the failed course during the summer between the freshman and sophomore years \u2014provided the course director for the respective course supports such a decision and the Academic Review Committee judges that the student's overall academic record supports such a decision and the student is able to make appropriate arrangements to do so. A freshman student with three or more grades of Unsatisfactory should expect to : Repeat the entire freshman year with the subsequent freshman class; or Be dismissed from school. Which of these two options is applied will depend on the student's overall academic record and any extenuating circumstances that may have contributed to that record. For students who repeat or are dismissed, any grades of In Progress will revert to grades of Unsatisfactory for transcript purposes. Students who are permitted by the Academic Review Committee to repeat a year are not guaranteed a space in the class immediately following the year they failed. They may be required to remain out of school for a year on a leave of absence. In such cases they will be given priority for enrollment at the beginning of the subsequent year. Decisions regarding when a s tudent begins a repeat year will depend upon (a) space available, (b) the student's overall academic record, (c) any extenuating circumstances that may have contributed to that record, and (d) whether or not the Academic Review Committee determines that a student is likely to benefit from additional leave time to address and/or remediate factors that contributed to his/her failure. A sophomore student with a single grade of Unsatisfactory may remediate the failed course during the summer, provided the cours e director for the respective course supports such a decision and the Academic Review Committee judges that the student's overall academic record supports such a decision, and the student is able to make appropriate arrangements to do so. Sophomores who ar e remediating a course during the summer will be required to take the week of orientation to the third year clinical clerkships at its regularly scheduled time. A sophomore student with two or more grades of Unsatisfactory should expect to: Repeat all or part of the sophomore year with the subsequent sophomore class; or Be dismissed from school. Student Handbook 169 Which of these two options is applied will depend on the student's overall academic record and any extenuating circumstances that may have contributed to that rec ord. For students who repeat or are dismissed, any grades of In Progress will revert to grades of Unsatisfactory for transcript purposes. Students should be aware that being required to repeat course work and/or NBME subject examinations, especially repea ting a year of medical school, can significantly impact their ability to obtain a residency upon graduation. Students must complete the first two years of medical school within three years of matriculation. Failure to do so will most likely result in dismi ssal. Students must successfully complete all freshman and sophomore year course work (including all required basic science NBME subject examinations) before they are eligible to take Step 1 of the USMLE. Students who have completed all freshman and sophom ore year requirements are expected to take USMLE Step 1 prior to orientation to the junior year and to begin junior year rotations immediately following orientation. Students who have not completed first - and second -year requirements by the time of junior year orientation must take the USMLE Step 1 no later than the end of the first ten - week clerkship block of the third year in order to continue with the third year. They will be expected to attend junior year orientation but will not start clinical rotatio ns until they have taken Step 1. Students must take USMLE Step 1 no later than November 1 following completion of their second year. Students who fail to meet the November 1 deadline will be subject to dismissal from school. Students who fail USMLE Step 1 on the first attempt must take Step 1 for the second time no later than February 1 of the year following the completion of their second year. Should a student fail USMLE Step 1 a second time, s/he must take it for the third time no later than May 1 of the year following the completion of the second year, unless s/he has requested and received approval in writing from the Office of Medical Student Education to audit second -year courses and retake second -year examinations for diagnostic and remediation purpos es. Such students must then take USMLE Step 1 before the beginning of the junior year following completion of their audit year. Students have three opportunities to pass the Step 1 examination. Failure to pass in three attempts will result in the student's dismissal from the school without mandatory review by the Academic Review Committee. Students should be aware that with each failure of Step I of the USMLE, they become significantly less competitive for the limited number of postgraduate training positio ns. It is also important to understand that some states have regulations that limit the number of times a student may take USMLE examinations and still be eligible for licensure. JUNIOR YEAR PROMOTIO N POLICIES Promotion from year to year is contingent upon satisfactory academic performance. The cognitive and noncognitive (including personal suitability to assume the responsibilities of the 170 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY medical profession) academic progress of each student is monitored by the Academic Review Committee. The committee eval uates the student's cumulative academic performance, not just performance in current or most recent course work. The student must pass each course/clerkship to demonstrate overall satisfactory performance. Clerkship grades are a combination of clinical per formance and cognitive performance. Grades used by the Academic Review Committee for determining academic promotion and retention in the clinical years are reported as Satisfactory, Marginal Satisfactory, In Progress, and Unsatisfactory. Students may not e nroll in the core clinical disciplines (medicine, surgery, obstetrics -gynecology, pediatrics, psychiatry, family medicine, neurology) until they have completed all of the junior orientation requirements. To receive a grade of Satisfactory in a clinical cou rse, the student's performance must exceed all course requirements. The student must: Pass the NBME subject examination (passing is determined by each department but will not be less than the 7th percentile nationally) on the first attempt; and Cumulative ly pass faculty -generated written examinations on the first attempt; and Receive a full pass on all clinical evaluations; and Satisfactorily complete any required skills/patient logs, including PDA data; and Demonstrate acceptable noncognitive behavior; and Participate in and complete any other specific requirements as deemed necessary by the clerkship director. A grade of In Progress will be assigned when the student: Fails an NBME subject examination on the first attempt; or Cumulatively fails departm ental faculty -generated examinations on the first attempt; or Demonstrates substandard clinical performance that the clerkship director judges could be improved if the student spent more time (but less than the full rotation) on the clinical service; or Demonstrates some deficiency(ies) in noncognitive academic performance that the clerkship director judges could be improved if the student spent more time (but less than the full rotation) on the clinical service; or Fails an OSCE/standardized patient examin ation; or Has unfinished course requirements that the clerkship director judges will allow the student to complete at a later specified time. A grade of Marginal Satisfactory is assigned if the course director judges that the student's performance has me t, but not exceeded, minimum course requirements. A grade of Unsatisfactory is assigned if the student: Fails both the NBME student examination and cumulatively fails faculty -generated examinations on the first attempt; or Student Handbook 171 Demonstrates marginally accepta ble clinical performance and fails either the NBME subject examination or any faculty -generated examination on the first attempt; or Demonstrates unsatisfactory clinical performance that the clerkship director judges can be remediated only by having the st udent repeat the entire clinical rotation; or Demonstrates unsatisfactory noncognitive academic performance that the clerkship director judges can be remediated only by having the student repeat the entire clinical rotation; or Fails to complete any requir ed skills/patient logs required by the clerkship; or Fails to complete any other specific requirements that the clerkship director will not allow the student to finish at a later time; or Fails the NBME subject examination or any faculty -generated examinat ion after taking the examination a second time to remove a previous grade of In Progress. All students must take the NBME Comprehensive Clinical Science Examination (CCSE) prior to taking either component (clinical knowledge and clinical skills) of USMLE Step 2. Students who have completed the junior year curriculum, with the exception of the family medicine rotation, will be allowed to take the examination on the date set by the Office of the Dean. Students who are delayed in other clerkships must wait un til their junior year is completed before taking the CCSE. Students may not begin the senior year curriculum until they have taken the CCSE. JUNIOR YEAR REMEDIAT ION POLICIES Grades of In Progress for any clerkship must be remediated before the student will be allowed to register for senior course work. Students who fail one or two clinical science subject examinations are allowed one opportunity to retake each and pass prior to the beginning of the senior year. No senior elective credit will be awarded for time used to study for the repeat examination(s). A prescribed amount of study time is not required by the Office of the Dean. However, it is recommended that a student use a minimum of two weeks to study for each failed examination. The time spent studyi ng will come out of senior year vacation time. If students fail a repeat subject examination, the grade of In Progress will become Unsatisfactory. The student is then required to repeat the entire clerkship(s) for which the failure occurred. Should a stud ent not receive a full pass after repeating a clerkship in its entirety, the Academic Review Committee will reconsider the student's situation and could recommend that the student be dismissed from school. Students who receive grades of In Progress result ing from deficiencies related to noncognitive academic performance may be required to fulfill individualized remediation 172 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY requirements and show evidence that the identified deficiencies have been remediated prior to beginning required senior year course wor k. Assigned remediation may include working with a designated faculty mentor, working with a professional counselor or other professionals who the school determines qualify to help the student remediate specific deficits or areas of weakness. For deficien cies judged not to be clerkship or discipline specific, remediation may take place on other required clerkships during the junior year without disruption of the student's schedule. For deficiencies judged to be clerkship or discipline specific, students wi ll be required to spend additional time (length to be determined by clerkship director) on the clerkship in question. No senior year credit will be awarded for time spent in remediation. If remedial work is judged to be unsatisfactory, the grade of In Prog ress originally reported for the junior year clerkship will be changed to a grade of Unsatisfactory. Students who receive grades of In Progress in three or more clerkships (from any combination of examination failures and/or substandard clinical performan ce) must repeat those clerkships in their entirety. Students who receive grades of In Progress in twenty -four or more weeks of their junior year course work will be required to repeat the entire junior year, including those clerkships they previously passe d. The Academic Review Committee may require grades of Marginal Satisfactory to be remediated when a student is required to remediate any grades of Unsatisfactory or In Progress during the subsequent academic year. Students who receive a single grade of Unsatisfactory in any clerkship will be required to repeat the entire clerkship, including all examinations and clinical duties. This repeat work must be completed prior to beginning senior year course work. Students who receive multiple grades of Unsatisf actory or some combination of Unsatisfactory, In Progress, and Marginal Satisfactory may be required by the Academic Review Committee to repeat the entire junior year, and could ultimately be dismissed from school. Students should be aware that being requi red to repeat course work and/or NBME subject examinations, especially repeating a year of medical school, can significantly impact their ability to obtain a residency upon graduation. Students must complete the last two years of medical school within thre e years of beginning the junior year curriculum. Failure to do so will most likely result in dismissal. Students must successfully complete all junior year course work (including passing all junior year NBME subject examinations) and take the NBME Comprehe nsive Clinical Science Examination before they are eligible to take either component (clinical knowledge and clinical skills) of the USMLE Step 2 examination. Student Handbook 173 The CCSE is a general, integrated achievement test covering material typically learned during c ore clinical clerkships and will be given the last week of the junior year. SENIOR YEAR PROMOTIO N POLICIES In order to graduate, students must: Pass all required senior course work, including on -campus and off -campus electives; and Pass both components of USMLE Step 2; and Perform satisfactorily on the California Consortium for the Assessment of Clinical Competencies examination; and Satisfactorily complete the Critical Incident Medical Response course; and Turn in a completed School of Medicine skills log . A grade of Satisfactory for senior year course work is assigned when a student: Receives a grade of Satisfactory for clinical performance; and Receives a cumulative passing score on faculty -generated examinations on the first attempt; and Passes the NB ME subject examination for those clerkships in which one is required (passing is determined by each department but will not be less than the 7th percentile nationally) on the first attempt; and Satisfactorily participates in and completes all other require ments deemed necessary by required clerkship and elective rotations, including completion of required patient logs (PDA or paper) and submission of all required evaluations; and Demonstrates acceptable noncognitive behavior. A grade of In Progress is ass igned when a student: Cumulatively fails faculty -generated examinations on the first attempt; or Fails the NBME subject examination on the first attempt; or Demonstrates substandard clinical performance that the clerkship director or elective preceptor ju dges could be improved by having the student spend additional time on the rotation; or Demonstrates some deficiency(ies) in noncognitive academic performance that the clerkship director judges could be improved by having the student spend additional time o n the rotation; or Has unfinished course requirements that the clerkship director or preceptor judges will allow the student to complete at a later specified time. A grade of Marginal Satisfactory will be assigned when the course director or preceptor judges that student performance has met, but not exceeded, minimum course requirements. A grade of Unsatisfactory is recorded when a student: 174 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY Demonstrates unsatisfactory clinical performance that the clerkship director or elective preceptor judges can only b e remediated by having the student repeat the entire clinical rotation/elective; or Demonstrates unsatisfactory noncognitive academic performance that the clerkship director judges can only be remediated by having the student repeat the entire clinical rotation/elective; or Has unfinished course requirements that the clerkship director or elective preceptor will not allow the student to finish at a later time; or Fails an NBME subject examination or cumulative course examinations after taking them a second time to remove a previous grade of In Progress. SENIOR YEAR REMEDIAT ION POLICIES Students who receive a grade of In Progress because of an examination failure may continue with their senior year schedule. They must retake the failed examination at the end of their next regularly scheduled elective. If a student has no elective time remaining, then the examination must be taken after completing all other required senior year course work prior to graduation. If a student passes the repeat examination, the gr ade of In Progress will be changed to a grade of Satisfactory or Marginal Satisfactory at the discretion of the course director/elective preceptor. If a student either fails to take the examination or fails an examination a second time, the grade of In Pro gress for the senior rotation will be changed to a grade of Unsatisfactory. In that case, the student must repeat the failed rotation in its entirety after having completed all other required senior course work. If, after repeating the entire senior year r otation, a student fails the examination a third time or performs clinically in an unsatisfactory manner, the Academic Review Committee may act to delay the student's graduation, pending a prescribed course of remediation. In unusual circumstances, the com mittee may recommend that the student be dismissed from school. Students who receive a grade of In Progress because of substandard clinical performance or because of a deficiency in noncognitive academic performance must remediate their unsatisfactory per formance (excluding examinations) in lieu of their next scheduled elective, and no elective credit will be awarded for the remediation. If a student has no electives remaining, then the remediation must be done following the completion of all other require d senior year course work and prior to graduation. Assigned remediation may include working with a designated faculty mentor or preceptor, working with a professional counselor, or working with other professionals who the school determines qualify to help the student remediate specific deficits or areas of weakness. When a student successfully completes the remedial course work, the grade of In Progress for the original rotation will be changed to a grade of Satisfactory or Marginal Satisfactory at the dis cretion of the clerkship director/elective preceptor. Student Handbook 175 When a student fails the remediation activity, the grade of In Progress for the original senior rotation will be changed to a grade of Unsatisfactory, and the Academic Review Committee may delay the stu dent's graduation, pending a prescribed course of remediation. If students receive a grade of Marginal Satisfactory in the senior year, they will not be required to remediate the Marginal Satisfactory unless they also received a grade of Unsatisfactory on at least one other senior rotation. In that case, the student will be required by the Academic Review Committee to repeat all rotations for which grades of Marginal Satisfactory, In Progress, or Unsatisfactory were reported. Students who receive a grade o f Unsatisfactory for any required rotation or elective will be required to repeat the course in its entirety. Students who receive multiple grades of Unsatisfactory, In Progress, and Marginal Satisfactory amounting to twenty weeks of their senior year cour se work will, at the very least, be required to repeat the entire senior year or could ultimately be dismissed from school by the Academic Review Committee. Students must pass both the USMLE Step 2 knowledge and clinical skills examinations in order to gra duate. Students must pass the USMLE Step 2 clinical knowledge (CK) component in no more than three attempts and within twenty -four months of the first attempt; the first attempt must be completed by November 1 of the senior year or within three months of completing the junior year requirements. If a student fails USMLE Step 2 CK, s/he must take this examination for the second time within four months of the first examination date. The clinical skills component of USMLE Step 2 must be taken by December 31 o f the senior year. If the dean's office has not received a score for both components of Step 2 by early February of their senior year, students will not be permitted to participate in the National Residency Matching Program, as the ability to graduate and start residency on time cannot be guaranteed. Failure to pass either component of the USMLE Step 2 in three attempts will result in the student's dismissal from the school by the dean without a mandatory review by the Academic Review Committee. Students wh o have completed all curriculum requirements except for passing Step 2 must remain enrolled in the school on directed study until they do pass. Students will be charged tuition for the time spent in directed study. Students should be aware that with each failure of any step of the USMLE, they become significantly less competitive for the limited number of postgraduate training positions. It is also important to understand that some states have regulations that limit the number of times a student may take U SMLE examinations and still be eligible for licensure. Students should be aware that being required to repeat course work and/or NBME subject examinations, especially repeating a year of medical school, can significantly impact their ability to obtain a re sidency upon graduation. Students must complete the last two years of medical school within three years of beginning the junior year curriculum. Failure to do so will most likely result in dismissal. 176 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY CONSEQUENCES OF UNSA TISFACTORY ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE In the case of unsatisfactory academic performance, the Academic Review Committee will recommend that the student: Be required to take remedial work; or Be placed on academic suspension; or Take a leave of absence (frequently accompanied by other recommendati ons); or Continue in school with specified conditions and/or restrictions; or Continue in school without restriction; or Be dismissed from school. Unsatisfactory academic performance will result in the student having to repeat course work as specified in school policies. GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE TO CONTEST GRADES If a student disagrees with a grade (Marginal Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory), the student should first contact the course/clerkship director within two weeks after grades are released. If there is n o satisfactory resolution, the student should contact the department chair. If the course/clerkship director and the department chair cannot resolve the issue, the student should then contact the Office of the Senior Associate Dean for Medical Student Educ ation. When deemed appropriate by the senior associate dean, the student may then appeal to an ad hoc appeals committee convened by the Office of the Dean. DISMISSAL FROM SCHOO L The Academic Review Committee may make the decision that a student should be dismissed from school on the basis of his/her overall academic performance or on the basis of specific deficiencies. Specific deficiencies in performance that may result in the Academic Review Committee determining that a student be dismissed from school i nclude: Receiving grades of less than full pass in more than half of the course work attempted in any academic year; Receiving a grade of less than full pass in any course being repeated; Receiving any grade of less than full pass while on academic prob ation; Failure to pass the USMLE Step 1 examination in three attempts and according to the time frame specified in the promotion and remediation policies; Failure to satisfactorily complete the Year 1 curriculum within twenty -four months of starting medica l school, unless prior approval for additional delay is obtained (in writing) from the Office of the Dean; Failure to satisfactorily complete the Year 2 curriculum within thirty -six months of starting medical school, unless prior approval of additional del ay is obtained (in writing) from the Office of the Dean; Failure to complete required milestones and competencies within the specified time frame. Student Handbook 177 Failure to satisfactorily complete the Year 3 curriculum within twenty -four months of completing the Year 2 c urriculum, unless prior approval for additional delay is obtained (in writing) from the Office of the Dean; Failure to pass the USMLE Step 2 examination in three attempts and according to the time frame specified in the promotion and remediation policies; Failure to complete all requirements for graduation within thirty -six months of completing the Year 2 curriculum and USMLE Step 1, unless prior approval for additional delay is obtained (in writing) from the Office of the Dean; and A pattern of unacceptabl e noncognitive academic performance or breaches of professionalism or a single serious incident of unethical or unprofessional conduct. SUSPENSION AND REMOV AL FROM SCHOOL In cases of serious misconduct, including breaches of professional behavior, and pend ing an investigation or determination of formal action, the dean (or designee) may require a student to not attend class, meet clinical appointments, attend campus events, or be present on campus without permission of the dean (or designee). ACADEMIC DUE P ROCESS In cases where the Academic Review Committee's action may involve formal suspension or dismissal from school, the student will be allowed to make a presentation before the Academic Review Committee before the committee acts to suspend or dismiss the student. The student may be accompanied and represented at the committee by another student from the School of Medicine or by a full -time faculty member from the School of Medicine who is not a voting member of the Academic Review Committee or the Executi ve Committee. The student will be notified in writing at least five working days prior to the Academic Review Committee meeting in which a decision for formal suspension or dismissal is considered. Following the student's appearance, the committee will con sider the case and make a decision, or it may decide to gather additional information and hold a second meeting prior to making a final decision. If the committee determines that a second meeting would be helpful, the committee may give the student the opp ortunity to reappear and address further questions. The Academic Review Committee may, at its discretion, refer matters related to breaches of professionalism or misconduct to the School of Medicine Professionalism Committee for determination and implement ation of remedial actions or for recommendations that will be brought back to the Academic Review Committee. In situations where there may be questions or disagreements of fact regarding allegations of unprofessionalism or noncognitive academic misconduct , the dean or the dean's designee may appoint a small committee to investigate the facts of the case and report its findings to the Academic Review Committee and/or the Executive Committee. APPEAL PROCESS If the Academic Review Committee determines that a student be formally suspended or dismissed from school, the student may appeal the decision to the School of Medicine Executive Committee by notifying the dean in writing of his/her desire to appeal. The student's written notice must be received within ten business days of the student's receipt of notification in 178 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY his/her University e -mail of the decision of the Academic Review Committee to suspend or dismiss him/her from school. The dean (or designee) will then notify the student of when the Executive Commi ttee will meet to consider his/her appeal. The student will be allowed to make a presentation to the Executive Committee before the Executive Committee acts. The student may be accompanied and represented by another student from the School of Medicine or b y a full -time faculty member from the School of Medicine who is not a voting member of the Academic Review Committee or the Executive Committee. After the Executive Committee makes a determination, the dean will make a final and binding decision. The decis ion of the dean shall be communicated to the student by the Office of the Dean. The student will be notified in writing of determinations of the Academic Review Committee and Executive Committee and the final action of the dean. Neither the school nor the student shall be represented by legal counsel at any stage of these proceedings. Failure of the student to cooperate in these proceedings may result in immediate termination of the proceedings and imposition of suspension or dismissal from the Loma Linda University School of Medicine. Student Handbook 179 Disability Policy Federal and state law and Loma Linda University policy require the School of Medicine to provide students who have disabilities, and who are able to meet the technical standards of the School of Medicine, re asonable accommodation in its academic programs. Learning disabilities are included under this policy. It is the responsibility of a student with a disability to request an accommodation in writing and to provide adequate documentation of the nature and ex tent of the disability to the school before an accommodation can be granted. Further information regarding documentation and accommodations is found in the LLU Disability Accommodation Policy in Section V of the LLU Student Handbook . Students who plan to r equest an accommodation for a learning -related disability and/or ADHD should request a copy of the School of Medicine's \"Guidelines for Assessment and Documentation\" of the disability from the Office of the Associate Dean for Student Affairs. Requests must meet these documentation requirements in order to receive approval. 180 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY School of Medicine Student Organizations The purpose of the Loma Linda University School of Medicine student organizations is to: Create an avenue through which students may seek constru ctive solutions to problems and enhance their educational experience; Develop ways to further the mission of the school and add to the medical school experience by organizing social, spiritual, and service activities; Engage students in issues related to m edical education and health care through participation in regional and national professional organizations. At registration into the School of Medicine, students automatically become members of the Loma Linda University School of Medicine Student Associat ion (SMSA). The SMSA Senate includes the following individuals: president, vice president, pastor, secretary, treasurer, and community services coordinator of SMSA; president and two elected senators of each of the four classes; the School of Medicine's re presentative to the Organization of Student Representatives (OSR) of the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC); president or designated representative of each School of Medicine student organization, with the exception of the medical specialty in terest groups.

These service -focused organizations, which involve students from a number of schools within the University, are as follows: the Healthy Neighborhoods Project the Mission Interest Group . Loma Linda University students are represented by peers at the San Bernardino County Medical Society, the California Medical Associat ion, the American Medical Association, the American Medical Student Association, the Association of American Medical Colleges, and the Student National Medical Association. Student Handbook 181 Each class holds annual elections for class officers using procedures approved by t he Office of the Associate Dean for Student Affairs. Class office rs include, but are not limited to, the following: president, vice president, social vice president, pastor, secretary, treasurer, a sports coordinator , and two senators to the School of Medi cine Student Association (SMSA) . If the class chooses to produce a senior class yearbook, the yearbook editor serves as a class officer from the time s/he is elected. During the freshman year, the first -year class officers meet with the associate dean for student affairs to select a class representative to the Student Affairs Council of the Alumni Association of the School of Medicine. The selected student serves a four -year term provided s/he remains in good and regular academic standing and continues to b e a member of the original class. This representative serves as a class officer. The associate dean for student affairs of the School of Medicine is the official liaison between the Office of the Dean and all School of Medicine student organizations, exclu ding medical specialty interest groups that are under the direction of the assistant dean for career advisement. Officers of student organizations, including editors of student publications such as class yearbooks, are expected to work closely with the ass ociate dean for student affairs to ensure that their plans are in harmony with School of Medicine policies. Students are required to receive prior approval for activities and events before they are finalized or announced to the class. Funds belonging to st udent organizations are held by the Office of the Dean. Students responsible for the use of an organization's funds are required to submit appropriate documentation to the Office of Student Affairs for approval and processing. Students who wish to be reimb ursed for personal funds spent for organizational purposes are required to submit original receipts as soon as possible after the purchases are made, but no later than 60 days after the expenditure is made (LLU policy). Representatives of student publicati ons or student organizations are not allowed to make financial agreements or contracts on behalf of an organization or publication without prior written authorization from the Office of the Associate Dean for Student Affairs. Activities of student organiza tions that involve off -campus travel or that involve off -campus (nonfaculty) speakers or entertainment must be preapproved by the Office of the Associate Dean for Student Affairs before the event is advertised. The start time for off -campus events that are sponsored by student organizations should be scheduled and announced to begin at the off-campus location and not involve organized carpooling. Any organizations that identify themselves with the School of Medicine or Loma Linda University must be approved by the Office of the Dean. Students who wish to start a new organization should contact the associate dean for student affairs. MEETINGS OR OTHER AC TIVITIES PLANNED BY STUDENTS Students or student organizations planning on -campus activities where food o r refreshments are to be served must make prior arrangements with the manager of the School of Medicine Office of Student Affairs for food orders. 182 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY Policy for Selling or Distributing Materials Students or student organizations must not advertise or sell goo ds or services or promote business opportunities on University property or via the University's computer network without the permission of the Office of the Associate Dean for Student Affairs. This includes the selling of textbooks and educational material s other than what a student owned for his/her personal use. Students who wish to sell personal property may advertise in the Trading Post or submit a small announcement to the Office of the Dean for posting in the student lounge. Loma Linda University Heal th has guidelines governing the design of any materials representing any aspect of the organization, whether or not they include the LLU logo. These guidelines may be found at <llu.edu/gig>. Assistance in complying with these standards is available from th e dean's office graphic design representative. Organizations or individual students who wish to sell or distribute articles (such as T -shirts, pens, etc.) that are identifiable with the School of Medicine or University must have the designs approved by the Office of the Associate Dean for Student Affairs prior to ordering or distribution. Authorization for students to charge such articles on student accounts must be made through the Office of the Associate Dean for Student Affairs. The sale of goods or serv ices on the property of the Loma Linda University Medical Center or any of its affiliated hospitals \u2014including Children's Hospital, East Campus Hospital, Heart and Surgical Hospital, Behavioral Medicine Center \u2014is not permitted without permission of Medical Center and/or LLUAHSC administration. Student Handbook 183 Qualifications for Student Office and Committee Membership School of Medicine students seeking elected office in school or University student organizations (including but not limited to class office, student associatio n office, OSR, AMA, AMSA), or those seeking appointed positions to School of Medicine committees, must be in good and regular standing within the school. Students on academic probation, students who have any below passing grades, or students who are subjec t to disciplinary action are not eligible to hold office or serve on committees. Once elected or appointed, students must remain in good and regular standing within the School of Medicine for the duration of their term of office. In the event of academic or nonacademic difficulty requiring discontinuation from office, the student shall have the opportunity to resign his/her position before steps are taken by administration to replace the student. The student administering elections for a student organiza tion is expected to review nominees for elected or appointed offices with the associate dean for student affairs before final voting or selection takes place to assure that students are eligible to hold an office. Two students may choose to run together as co -officers (e.g. , co-social vice presidents) for a single position. However, only one student may serve in the role of president or treasurer of a c lass or student organization. 184 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY School of Medicine Policies School of Medicine policies may be updated, re vised, or added to as deemed necessary. Revisions to policies provided to students in writing (including those posted on an LLU or LLUSM website) are equally binding as the policies provided in this handbook. In the event of a conflict between School of Me dicine policies and Loma Linda University policies, the School of Medicine policies shall control.

Marilyn Hermann, Ph.D., RN Dean Student Handbook 187 Our Mission The mission of the School of Nursing, in accord with the comprehensive missio n of Loma Linda University, is the education of professional nurses who are dedicated to excellence in nursing science. Committed to Christian service and distinctive Seventh -day Adventist ideals, the school seeks to reflect God's love through its teaching and healing ministry. Baccalaureate and graduate nursing programs contribute to the development of expert clinicians, educators, administrators, and researchers who benefit society by providing and improving delivery of whole person care to clients \u2014indivi duals, families, groups, and communities. 188 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY Academic Practices REQUIREMENTS FOR REG ISTRATION Listed below are the requirements that must be met by all School of Nursing students before registration can be completed. BASIC CERTIFICATION Current hands -on CPR t raining is required of all students while attending Loma Linda University School of Nursing (LLUSN). Throughout the time any clinical nursing course is taken, the CPR certification must be valid. Verification is established by presenting a copy of the CPR card with the expiration date to the academic affairs office f or the student's department. Certification or renewal may be done through a local program recognized by the American Heart Association; or Life Support Education, which is located at 24007 Taylo r Street, Loma Linda. The telephone number is: 909/558 -4977. Undergraduate students must have a current first aid card before beginning the undergraduate clinical sequence. IMMUNIZATIONS AND HE ALTH CLEARANCE It is necessary for all new students to have pro of of immunity for certain diseases. This is a safeguard to the health of both the student and patients with whom the student works. All disease and immunization dates must be recorded and verified by Student Health Service (See University CATALOG, Health/ Immunizations). Clinical agencies require seasonal flu immunizations. Additional immunizations may be required based on epidemiological evidence. A PPD (TB test) is required each year and must be done before registration. If the PPD results are positive, t hen a chest x -ray will be required with appropriate follow -up. A two -step process is required for beginning students. See specific information in the University CATALOG (Health/Immunizations). If a student cannot meet these requirements, continuation in t he School of Nursing could be in jeopardy. BACKGROUND CHECK All incoming students will need to clear the LLU background check before they can register. This is required by the clinical agencies where students will be practicing nursing (see registration we bsite). Additional background checks may be required by a clinical agency. Student Handbook 189 Academic Progression PROGRAM PROGRESSION Baccalaureate program Progression is contingent upon satisfactory scholastic and clinical performance and the student's responsiveness to th e established aims of the school and the nursing profession. Students are to be considered as making satisfactory progress as long as they maintain a C or better in every course and complete the requirements of the following time frame: 1st year 2nd year 3rd year 4th year 5th year 29 units 48 units 96 units 144 units 193 units Graduate program progression Progression is contingent on satisfactory scholastic and clinical performance and the student's responsiveness to the established aims of the school and the nursing profession. Graduate students shall be considered as making satisfactory academic progress as long as they: Earn a grade of B or higher in all courses. Yearly, give evidenc e of satisfactory completion of \u2014 a. 20 percent or more of courses requir ed for curriculum (M.S. and D.N.P.) b. 15 percent (Ph.D.) c. 67 percent or greater of the courses attempted, including transfer credits Complete the program in: a. 5 years (M.S. and D.N.P.) b. 7 years (Ph.D.) Provision is made for full -time or part -time study. Opti onal acceleration through baccalaureate program for students with a bachelor's degree in another field A student entering with a B.S. or B.A. degree and who has a G.P.A. of at least 3.3, has no grades lower than a C, and has completed all prerequisite cour ses and statistics may accelerate through the nursing program. The request and acceleration plan must be arranged with the associate dean. Students who have failed or withdrawn from a nursing course because of failure will not be permitted to continue on t he accelerated track. The student will be returned to a regular schedule the quarter immediately after the quarter his/her G.P.A. falls below 3.0 or after failing a class. 190 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY Nursing Course Grades UNDERGRADUATE PROGRA M Assignment of grades to nursing courses Most nursing courses in the undergraduate curriculum are divided into approximately equal components of theory and clinical laboratory practice. A grade for a nursing course represents the combination of the theory and the clinical laboratory grades. In or der to pass a nursing course, a student must receive a grade equivalent to a C or above in both the theory and clinical laboratory sections of the course. A grade of C - or below places the student on probation status, and the course must be repeated. In or der to pass classes, students must achieve 76 percent or higher on cumulative examination scores. Withdrawal A student may withdraw (W) only once from any nursing or required cognate course and withdraw no more than two quarters during the nursing program. Repeating undergraduate courses A grade of C (2.0) is the minimum passing grade for nursing and required cognate courses. A student may repeat a course, including a nursing course or a required cognate, only one time. Required cognates include ethics, nu trition, statistics, and writing. Any nursing course or named cognate course taken while a student at Loma Linda University School of Nursing in which the earned grade is C - or lower must be repeated before the student can progress to another course. When a student repeats a course, both the original and repeat grades are entered on the student's permanent record; but only the repeat grade and credit are computed in the grade point average and included in the total units earned. Academic probation Students who have received a C - or below in a nursing course or named cognate, or who have withdrawn (W) due to failing, are placed on academic probation. Students who receive a grade less than a B - in Fundamentals of Nursing or in Basic Skills and Health Ass essme nt must enroll in NRSG 244 Strategies for Academic Success the following two quarters. Students on probation status will be required to take NRSG 244 Strategies for Academic Success, under the supervision of the Learning Assistance Program (LAP) and to com municate regularly with the academic advisor. Students on probation status may take only one clinical nursing course at a time and no more than 12 units. When the course work has been repeated successfully, the student is returned to regular status. Enroll ment in the School of Nursing will be terminated if a student receives two grades of C - or below in nursing or required cognates (See Student Handbook for Grievance Procedure). Challenge examinations An undergraduate student may meet academic requirements by passing an examination at least equal in scope and difficulty to examinations in the course. Undergraduate students with prior Student Handbook 191 education in nursing or in another health -care profession are eligible to challenge nursing courses required for California state licensure. The applicant's background in health -care theory and clinical experience must be commensurate with the theory and skills required for the course. Challenge examinations in nursing courses include both a written examination covering theory and an examination of clinical competence. A fee is charged for a challenge examination. (See the \"Schedule of Charges\" in School of Nursing in the Financial Information section of the University CATALOG). Progression to the next level in the program is p ermissible only after successful completion of the challenge examinations. A grade of S is recorded for challenge credit earned by examination only after the student has successfully completed a minimum of 12 units of credit at this University with a G.P.A . of 2.0 or above. GRADUATE PROGRAM Assignment of grades to nursing courses Students are expected to maintain a G.P.A. of 3.0 (B average). Course grades The expected earned grade level for graduate studies is a cumulative grade point average of 3.0 (B av erage) or higher. Students must earn a grade of B (85 percent) or higher in all core or concentration courses. If the earned grade is less than a B, the course must be repeated. For all CNS and NP clinical courses, an earned grade of less than B (3.0) ma y not be repeated. For all required nurse anesthesia courses, an earned grade of B (3.0) may not be repeated. Withdrawal and repeating courses A student may withdraw only once from a core, concentration, or clinical course. A student may repeat no more tha n one course in the program. Students requesting to repeat a clinical course due to a withdrawal are placed on a waiting list, according to the timing of the request. Nurse anesthesia students may not withdraw from or repeat a course. Academic probation At the end of each quarter, student G.P.A.s will be reviewed. Students will be placed on probationary status if the earned G.P.A. is less than 3.0 for the quarter, cumulatively, or in the nursing major . While on probation a student: May not take the clinica l focus courses, unless this is the course that must be repeated. May not submit the comprehensive project. 192 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY Academic probation may be removed by: Raising the G.P.A. to 3.0 or higher the next quarter. Retaking the course in which a grade lower than a B wa s earned to raise the earned grade the next time the course is offered. Academic termination Academic enrollment will be terminated if: The cumulative G.P.A. has not been raised to 3.0 or above while on academic probation. Any grade lower than B has not been raised within two quarters or the next time the course is offered. A CNS or NP student earns a grade of B - (2.7) or lower in a clinical course. A nurse anesthesia student earns a grade of B - (2.7) or lower in any course. Undergraduate and graduate cli nical laboratory experiences Clinical laboratory grades in the School of Nursing are assigned to pass/fail, except for nurse anesthesia. Specific criteria for clinical evaluation are shared with students at the beginning of each nursing course. Percentage breakdown for grading The School of Nursing (graduate and undergraduate programs) uses the following breakdown of percentages for computing student grades: 95-100% 85-87% B 71-75% C- Academic integrity All students in the School of Nursing are expected to adhere to the highest standards of academic honesty. It is the responsibility of students to avoid both dishonest practices and the appearance of dishonesty. The s tudent should make the necessary effort to ensure that his/her work is not used by others. Students shall be subject to discipline for any form of academic dishonesty, including, but not limited to: copying from another's examination or allowing another t o copy from one's own; plagiarism; giving or receiving aid on class work without permission or on take -home tests; and representing as one's own work the work of others without giving credit. (See University portion of this handbook and the University CATA LOG for more details.) Disciplinary actions may range from a zero on the work involved, lowering the course grade by one letter, dropping the student from the course, or total dismissal from school (See Grievance below). Student Handbook 193 Academic Discipline ACADEMIC DUE PR OCESS If the student wishes to contest a grade, the following steps should be taken: Discuss the grade with the course coordinator. If the matter is not resolved, the student should discuss the grade with the associate dean. If the matter still is not re solved, the student may appeal in writing to the Academic Review Committee, whose decision is binding. The committee will review the student's written appeal and vote a decision. The Academic Review Committee meets at least once each quarter to review stu dent progress. Actions recommended by the Academic Review Committee other than dismissal from school are not subject to appeal beyond the committee. Actions that are not subject to appeal include, but are not limited to, requiring a student to do remedial work in a course, or repeating a course in which the student received a failing grade in either the theory or clinical portion. Grievance A student dropped from school for academic reasons and who contends that the appropriate procedure was not followed, m ay file an appeal to the dean of the school. This appeal must be filed within one quarter from the date on which the Academic Review Committee voted to drop the student from school. A grievance will be reviewed only if the appeal is filed within this time frame. The grievance process is not available to individuals who fail to achieve admission or readmission to the school, or who take exception to the terms and conditions of admission or readmission. Process for grievance The student requests the dean to a ppoint a Grie vance Committee to evaluate the situation . This request must be presented in writing and must include pertinent information. Based on their review, the Grievance Committee makes a recommendation to the dean. 1. The dean, upon receipt of a writte n petition for grievance, appoints a committee of three faculty members selected from faculty of the school who were not previously parties to the review of this case. The fourth, nonvoting faculty member, from the Academic Review Committee, is also select ed by the dean to meet with the Grievance Committee. The Grievance Committee may interview the student, faculty, clinical faculty, or other individuals who may be knowledgeable about the situation. The student may be accompanied only by a faculty advisor \u2014not by friends, family, or legal counsel. 2. The committee renders a written recommendation to the dean upon completion of their review. After reviewing the findings and recommendations of the Grievance Committee, 194 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY the dean makes a decision, which is final and binding. The student is notified of the decision in writing. Nonacademic discipline A student's conduct will come under question if the student: neglects nonacademic obligations or other student duties; displays social conduct that is inappropriate; fails to maintain professional standards; violates policies or regulations of the University and/or the school. An illustrative list of the expectations regarding student conduct can be found in Section V of the Loma Linda University Student Handbook . Alleged student misconduct is subject to review by the School of Nursing to determine whether discipline is appropriate. Disciplinary actions by the administration and faculty normally fall into, but are not limited to, the following categories \u2014based on the serio usness of the infraction of University policies, rules, and regulations by students: warning\u2014cautionary admonition, usually given verbally; censure\u2014reproof for an infraction; probation \u2014disciplinary status indicating that a student may be dismissed for con tinued or repeated conduct without further committee action; suspension \u2014exclusion from the University or from a school or a segment of a school's program, for a specific period; termination at the end of the quarter \u2014actual dismissal but with permission to complete the courses in progress, provided the student's conduct is acceptable during the interim period; or dismissal \u2014immediate expulsion from the University for an indefinite period. NONACADEMIC DUE PROC ESS When a student fails to observe the University or School of Nursing policies or regulations that govern nonacademic and nonclinical general conduct, the following disciplinary procedures are instituted. 1. Upon receipt of a serious allegation of misconduct, a student may be suspended from the school, pen ding and during the immediate investigation of the allegations. Suspension shall mean that the student may not attend class, meet clinical appointments, attend campus events, or be present on campus without permission from the dean or designee. 2. At the conc lusion of this investigation, the associate dean for the program either decides that the allegations lack a substantive basis for further investigation; or decides that there is a substantive basis to justify disciplinary action. Should the student feel th e decision is unfair, s/he may request that the matter be referred to the specially appointed Student Handbook 195 Student Conduct Committee, which is composed of five faculty members from the School of Nursing, with at least three from the department of the student's enrollme nt 3. The committee meets to review the student's request. The Student Conduct Committee will interview the student, as well as those bringing the allegations. In addition, the committee may interview anyone else who may help clarify the merits of the allegat ions. The student may request that specific witnesses be allowed to appear before the committee in support of the student. The student may appear before the committee in the meeting room with a representative from the faculty of the School of Nursing but may not be accompanied by family, friends or legal counsel. 4. The student may present new information not previously submitted if relevant to the allegations. It is the responsibility of the student to provide any new information or witnesses to the committee at the time the Student Conduct Committee meets. 5. Neither the student nor his/her representative may be present during the deliberations. The Student Conduct Committee may conclude either that there is no substantive evidence of the alleged misconduct or t hat the allegations are supported by substantive evidence of general (nonacademic and/or nonclinical) misconduct, and then make their recommendations to the dean. The dean gives the student written notification of the decision. NONACADEMIC GRIEVANC E ACTION If the student is dismissed from school and feels the appeals process has not resulted in a fair resolution, s/he may proceed to grievance by following the steps outlined above under Academic Discipline. The student must file the petition regarding the gr ievance no later than one month after the disciplinary action. Following a review by the Grievance Committee and the dean's consideration of the recommendation, the decision of the dean is final and binding. 196 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY Credentialing UNDERGRADUATE: LICEN SING EXAMINATI ON Loma Linda University School of Nursing prepares students to write the National Council Licensing Examination.

Student Handbook 199 Impaired Student Policy Loma Linda University is dedicated to the development of individual wholeness and fu nctions with the following beliefs: a campus environment free of alcohol, tobacco, and recreational/illegal drugs provides a learning environment conducive to the fullest possible human development; addiction and other emotional disorders affect the aca demic and clinical performance of students; and addiction and other emotional disorders can be treated, and the individual can return to a productive level of functioning. It is the responsibility of students to seek treatment. Loma Linda University Sch ool of Nursing is committed to assisting its students with recovery. IMPAIRMENT BY ALCOHO LISM AND/OR DRUG ABU SE Refer to Alcohol, Controlled Substances, and Tobacco Policy in this Student Handbook . The nursing faculty requires that nursing students provide safe, effective, and supportive client care. To fulfill this purpose, nursing students must be free of chemical impairment during participation in any part of the nursing program \u2014including classroom, laboratory, and clinical settings. The School of Nursin g faculty defines a chemically impaired student as a person who, while in the academic or clinical setting, is under the influence of, or has abused, either separately or in combination: alcohol, over -the-counter medication, illegal drugs, prescribed medic ations, inhalants, or synthetic designer drugs. Substance abuse includes episodic misuse or chronic use that has produced psychological and/or physical symptoms. This health problem must be proactively addressed when identified with the nursing student pop ulation. The nursing faculty will intervene with the chemically impaired student as outlined in the established procedure. IDENTIFICATION, INTE RVENTION, AND TREATM ENT Identification of substance abuse and other emotional disorders will be based on a patter n of observable behaviors (e.g., erratic behavior, alcohol on breath, slurred speech, motor incapacities, and absenteeism) that suggest impairment of the individual's ability to meet standards of performance and safety in clinical sites or the classroom. W hen such observations are made, the student shall be removed immediately from the clinical setting; and the faculty shall report the observations to the dean and/or associate dean. Interventions shall involve the dean and/or associate dean and a mental hea lth or chemical dependency specialist meeting to present the student with the reported behaviors. The goal of this intervention is to secure agreement for treatment. If the individual agrees, a prompt referral will be made to a facility specializing in the specific impairment. If the individual is unwilling to agree to treatment, s/he will face dismissal. If the student is a registered nurse, the California 200 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY State Board Diversion Program (CSBDP) will be notified. If the treatment is refused, the state board must receive a report of observed behaviors. Treatment will be provided by an organization specializing in substance abuse or emotional disorders. Treatment costs will be reimbursed according to student health insurance policy. The school will allow the in dividual a reasonable leave of absence for treatment. The fact and content of treatment are confidential. However, the student will be asked to sign a release of information form to enable the School of Nursing to receive reports validating compliance with treatment and readiness to reenter the educational program. STEPS TO ADDRESS SUB STANCE ABUSE OR EMOTIONAL DISORDERS Should a problem with substance abuse or emotional disorders be suspected, faculty members will take the following steps: If the student i s impaired, s/he is immediately removed from the setting; and the drug screening of body fluids will be done. The student will be requested to sign a release form for the School of Nursing to receive the results of the drug screen. If the student refuses t o sign the release, s/he will be dismissed from the program. Within a reasonable time, the student must meet with the Impaired Student Committee (course coordinator, department chair, and faculty member with expertise in specific area of impairment), at wh ich time a contract and plan of action will be developed and signed. Faculty will document all objective data suggestive of the problem. The plan will include the following: The student is assisted in initiation of an appropriate treatment/counseling pro gram. The student and the School of Nursing will sign a release of information form. The chemically or emotionally impaired student will not be allowed to participate in clinical nursing courses until approved for reentry. Once the contract is fulfilled, t he student's case is reviewed by the Impaired Student Committee for possible readmission. If readmitted, a student contract will be written and signed. This agreement will be designed to support the student's continuing recovery and to assure patient safe ty. A student with drug or alcohol abuse will be required to have random drug screening during enrollment in the School of Nursing. If the student fails to comply with the terms of contract, the student may be dismissed from school. Student Handbook 201 Sources of Academic A ssistance The School of Nursing provides students with a variety of assistance . ACADEMIC ADVISEMENT Each student is assigned a faculty advisor. The advisor is a resource person available to help interpret the academic requirements of the School of Nursing \u2014including help with registration, information about classes, and finding resources on campus. The advisor is also available to discuss other problems and concerns, if a student so chooses. It remains the student's responsibility to meet all requirements fo r graduation. The available hours to meet with advisors are posted. If these times are not convenient, other appointments may be made by telephone or e -mail. Should a student desire a different advisor, a written request should be submitted to the associa te dean. Course coordinator Each nursing course at LLUSN has a course coordinator. This is the individual to contact regarding course content, requirements, or any concern related to that course. If a student is ill or misses classes, the student must con tact the course coordinator to make arrangements for missed assignments and/or clinical laboratories. COURSE SCHEDULING Undergraduate The sequencing of nursing courses is arranged by the associate dean for the undergraduate program. Request forms for clin ical lab placements are available from the Undergraduate Office for specific scheduling needs. These requests will be considered in planning the schedule. Issues relating to course sequencing or program concerns should be taken to the associate dean for th e undergraduate program. Graduate The sequencing of nursing courses is determined by the graduate student and advisor at the beginning of the program of study and may be modified as needed. Learning resources and the Learning Assistance Program The School of Nursing provides the Learning Assistance Program (LAP) for students who desire to improve their study skills. The LAP offers diagnostic tests to help identify areas of learning needs; individualized help with study skills; tutoring; examination analysis program; workshops in NCLEX -RN preparation \u2014including tips for taking examinations, time management, and how to take notes and study efficiently. Self-directed instructional materials, such as videos and CDs, may be found at the Del Webb Library. The libra ry is open for students to use for study. The School of Nursing maintains a computer laboratory. Assignments requiring computer work may be completed in this area. 202 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY This is to be a quiet room. All cellular telephones and personal conversation should occur elsewhere. Student Handbook 203 Student Affairs There are a number of opportunities for student involvement in the school and the University. The associate dean and faculty advisors work with the Associated Students of Nursing (ASN) in planning and organizing functions for stud ents. The associate deans also provide guidance in the cocurricular activities and lifestyle expectations of the school. Students wishing to serve in leadership positions must meet the following qualifications: have and maintain a G.P.A. of 3.0; no history of academic probation in nursing courses while a student in the School of Nursing; willing to uphold and model social and Christian values and standards of the School of Nursing and the University; and willing to take on the functions and responsibilities of the office (see the ASN Bylaws for listing of specific officer functions). STUDENT ORGANIZATION OFFICERS The Associated Students of Nursing (ASN) and undergraduate class officers make up the student leadership within the School of Nursing. ASN officers include: president, social vice president, spiritual vice president, secretary, treasurer, representatives for the sophomore classes, and other positions as needed. Class officers include president, social vice president, religious vice president, secreta ry, treasurer, and historian. 204 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY Awards and Scholarships Scholarships and awards are given in recognition of scholastic attainment, leadership ability, and financial need.

Student Handbook 205 SECTION XI SCHOOL OF PHARMACY 206 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY Dean's Welcome Welcome to Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy. Our goal is to educate pharmacists in a Seventh -day Adventist Christian setting. Pl ease familiarize yourself with this Student Handbook , as it is the roadmap to ensure your success. During your time at LLU , you will learn to provide high -quality pharmacy care as a fully participating member of a hea lth care team committed to whole person care. I urge you t o take advantage of the many co curricula r and extra curricular activities that will enrich your pharmacy education. Get ready \u2014the years at the School of Pharmacy will go by fast. You will be challenged intellectually, relationally, physi cally , and spiritually \u2014but these experiences will prepare you for a life of service in your chosen profession. Wishing you continued success as you strive to achieve your personal and professional goals! W. William Hughes, Ph.D. Dean Loma Linda Univer sity's Doctor of Pharmacy program is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education, 135 South LaSalle Street, Sui te 4100, Chicago, LLUSP Oath of a Pharmaci st I stand on the campus of Loma Linda Universit y before you and in the presence of God. I promise to devote myself to a lifetime of service to others through the profession of pharmacy. In fulfilling this vow: I will consider the welfare of humanity and relief of suffering my primary concerns. I will apply my knowledge, experience, and skills to the best of my ability to assure optimal outcomes for my patients. I will respect and protect all personal and health information entrusted to me. I will accept t he lifelong obligation to improve my professional knowledge and competence. I will hold myself and my colleagues to the highest principles of our profession's moral, ethical , and legal conduct. I will embrace and advocate changes that improve patient care. I will utilize my knowledge, skills, experiences, and values to prepare the next generation of pharmacists. I take these vows voluntarily with the full realization of the responsibility with which I am entrusted by the public and by God. PLEDGE OF PROFE SSIONALISM As a student of pharmacy, I believe there is a need to build and reinforce a professional identity founded on integrity, ethical behavior, and honor. This development, a vital process in my education, will help ensure that I am true to the profe ssional relationship I establish between myself and society as I become a member of the pharmacy community. Integrity must be an ess ential part of my everyday life, and I must practice pharmacy with honesty and commitment to service. To accomplish this goa l of professional development, I as a student of pharmacy should: Develop a sense of loyalty and duty to the profession of pharmacy by being a builder of community \u2014one able and willing to contribute to the well -being of others and one w ho enthusiastically accepts responsibility and accountability for membership in the profession. Foster profe ssional competency through life long learning. I must strive for high ideals, teamwork , and unity within the profession in order to provide optimal patient care. Support my colleagues by actively encouraging personal commitment to the Oath of Maimonides and a code of ethics set forth by the profession. Incorporate into my life and practice, dedication to excellence. This will require an ongoing reassessment of personal an d professional values. Maintain the highest ideals and professional attributes to ensure and facilitate the covenantal relationship required for the pharmaceutical caregiver. 208 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY The profession of pharmacy is one that demands adherence to a set of rigid ethic al standards. These high ideals are necessary to ensure that quality of care extended to the patients I serve. As a student of pharmacy, I believe this does not start with graduation; rather, it begins with my membership in this professional college commun ity. Therefore, I must strive to uphold these standards as I advance toward full membership in the profession of pharmacy. Developed by the American Pharmaceutical Association Academy of Student of Pharmacy/American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy Council of Deans (APhA -ASP/AACP -COD) Task Force on Professionalism; June 26, 1994 Student Handbook 209 Policies and Procedures BACKGROUND CHECK Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy (SP) students are required to have a background check prior to registration at the start of ea ch academic year. Students beginning the PY1 year must have background check results prior to orientation for the PY1 year. PY4 students must complete a background check prior to the start of APPE rotations. The only approved vendor for the background chec k is accessed through the LLU Student Portal . Background check results are placed in the SP student file. If a fail grade is received on a background check it is automatically referred to LLU General Counsel for review. General Council will make the determ ination whether the student is allow ed to participate in University -sponsored clinical sites. This decision may adversely affect continued enrollment. Enrolled students have the obligation to self -report to the associate dean of student affairs and admissi ons if an event occurs while enrolled in the School of Pharmac y program that would warrant a \"hit\" (or fail) on their background check. Failure to self -report may be cause for disciplinary action. University General Council's opinion does not extend to the State of California Board of Registered Pharmacists and does not guarantee that the Board of Pharmacy will accept this opinion. CARS Students are expected to have access to a car and a valid driver's license for off -campus assignments. All student vehicle s must be registered and have a valid parking permit irrespective of whether or not their car is parked in a University parking lot. CPR AND FIRST -AID CERTIFICATION Students must be currently certified in cardiop ulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and first aid during their enrollment in the School of Pharmacy. School policy requires that students must successfully complete the CPR and first a id provider training at the LLU Life Support Education Center. This certification ensures consistency in the education and training, which is necessary to fulfill school obligations to School of Pharmacy preceptors and sites, according to affiliation agreements. All PY1 students are scheduled for CPR and first aid certification courses at the start of the Fall Quarter. PY3 stu dents must renew their CPR and first aid certification at the start of the PY3 Fall Quarter , and all PY3 students must participate in the recertification class scheduled at the Life Support Education Center by the Office of Student Affairs. Attendance is mandatory for all students , even if they have had prior CPR and first aid training classes from other facilities. INTERN LICENSE Students must possess a valid, non probationary intern pharmacist license to participate in the experiential components of the Do ctor of Pharmacy Program. Upon matriculation into the Pharmacy Program all students must complete the application to be licensed as an intern 210 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY pharmacist in the State of California. Accepted students are given instructions on downloading and completing the application prior to the orientation program. During orientation week , these completed pharmacy intern license applications are submitted to the Office of Stude nt Affairs. After processing, the applications for the entire class are submitted to the Board o f Pharmacy. Once the applications are received and processed, the Board of Pharmacy mails the intern license to each student individually . When the students receive their intern license in the mail , they must bring the intern license to the Office of Stude nt Affairs , where a copy will be made for the permanent student file. Failure to clear the California State Board of Pharmacy process for issuing an intern pharmacist license (i.e. \" clear\" not \" probation\") prior to the start of Winter Quarter in the PY1 Year will result in the student being placed on a leave of absence. The student will be allowed to return to the Pharmacy Program the following year at the start of Winter Quarter if at that point s/he has successfully cleared the licensing process and ha s been issued a valid, non probationary status license to practice as an intern pharmacist in the state of California. If at any time during a student's participation in the Pharmacy Program the State Board of Pharmacy places his/her license on probationary s tatus , the student's progress in the program will be halted. Careful review and consideration regarding the circumstances surrounding the decision to place the license on probation will occur , and a decision regarding whether the student is fit to continue in the program will be made. It is the student's responsibility to inform the Office of Student Affairs if the State Board of Pharmacy takes action to change the status of his/her intern license. Failure to do so will result in immediate dismissal from th e program. It is not possible to participate in IPPE or APPE rotations without a current California pharmacy intern license (i.e. , \"clear\" not \" probation\"). STUDENT SUPPORT SERV ICES Advising Students enrolled in the School of Pharmacy are assigned a facult y member for advisement on academic matters and professional development. This advisor serves as a mentor and is the student's first line of communication in addressing professional, academic and personal issues. Utilizing this resource can enhance the stu dent's educational and professional experience. The school considers it part of each student's professional responsibility to monitor his/her own academic progress and be aware of the potential consequences of academic, professional and/or personal diffic ulties. Students are expected to take responsibility for communicating with their faculty advisor on a regular basis, particularly when experiencing academic difficulty. Coordination for student advisement is through the Office of Student Affairs. Advisor s meet with their assigned advisees at least once per quarter. Academic support The Office of Academic Support provides resources to facilitate student academic success. Academic support services include: Needs assessment(s) Tutoring referral(s) based on needs Student Handbook 211 Time management evaluation and development Study strategy evaluation and development Test taking strategies development To make an appointment with the Office of Academic Support , please call 909/558 -4615 or e- mail Duane Tan at <dutan@llu.edu >. ADA ACCOMMODATION It is the policy of LLU and the School of Pharmacy to comply with the provisions of the Ameri cans with Disabilities Act and S ection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The School of Pharmacy is committed to making reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities. Within the School of Pharmacy , the dean has designated the associate dean for student affairs and admissions to oversee student accommodation requests and facilitate the accommodation processes involved. ACCOM MODATI ON POLICY IMPLEMENTA TION W ITHIN THE SCHOOL OF PHARMACY Once a student has communicated an accommodation need and the appropriate documentation has been submitted, the associate dean for student affairs and admissions creates a letter that outlines the accommodations for which the student qualifies . The student then presents this letter to the faculty of each class in which accommodatio n is needed. If a class is team taught, this letter must be presented to each teacher who is involved in the class. No additional accommodations from those stated in the letter will be granted. The associate dean for student affairs and admissions cannot send out a list of students who qualify for accommodations. The student who is requesting accommodations is the only one w ho can communicate this information. It is the student's responsibility to make arrangements with each professor well in advance of each quiz or exam ination . PRINCIPLES FOR PROFESSIONAL STANDAR DS Loma Linda University is sponsored and operated by the Seve nth-day Adventist Church. LLU's distinct purpose is to prepare students academically who are dedicated to Christ -centered values and have a commitment to Christ -centered service. In harmony with the goals of LLU, students are expected to demonstrate a patt ern of personal discipline with lifestyle expectations that are consistent with those of the Seventh -day Adventist Church. Joining the Loma Linda University family is an honor and requires each individual to uphold the policies, regulations, and guidelines established for all members of the LLU team. All alleged violations involving misconduct will be investigated following the University Discipline and Appeals Process. Students who exhibit conduct that is contrary to expected behavior may be subject to di sciplinary action. DRUG -TESTING POLICY The LLU School of Pharmacy has instituted random drug testing for all students. Many clinical sites also mandate drug testing. Testing also serves as a safeguard for the integrity of the Pharmacy Program and protects the public from the dangers of drug abuse by student 212 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY clinicians. Students are required to give written consent indicating their knowledge of and compliance with this policy. Drug and alcohol testing may involve the use of tests that are able to detect prio r usage within days, weeks , or months. Drug testing will be random and/or for reasonable cause and may occur at anytime while enrolled in the Pharmacy Program. Testing occurs at LLU Student Health Service and/or local laboratory collection centers. Through out the testing process , students have a ri ght to privacy and confidentialit y. A signed consent indicating receipt of this policy and acknowledgement to comply will be placed in the student's file. Any violation of this policy, including the refusal to sub mit immediately to a requested search or test(s), may result in immediate suspension. Students have the right to appeal disciplinary actions as per policy. Under no circumstances is the medicinal use of Schedule 1 controlled substances permissible in the L LU School of Pharmacy. CLASSROOM ATTENDANCE Regular class attendance is expected of all students. Instructors may require attendance in class as a condition of passing a course or as part of the student's course grade. CLASS ABSENCE If a student is unable to attend class due to medical reasons , it is the student's responsibility to contact the associate dean for student affairs prior to missing class. Contact information for the associate dean, Linda Williams , is by e -mail at <lwilliams@llu.edu > or by telephone at 909/557 -0472. (In case of an emergency , make contact as soon as possible.) The a ssociate dean, Linda Williams , will contact the course coordinator of the class or classes that will be missed, notifying them of the student 's absence. Upon return t o school , the student is to provide documentation of medical consultation/treatment to the Office of Student Affairs. Documentation indicating that a medical professional has seen the student must be dated the day of the student's absence from school. Docu mentation dated after the fact will not be accepted. The Office of Student Affairs does not issue \"excuses\" for absence from class; howeve r, this office does serve as a \"record -keeper\" for instructors to verify the validity of an absence. Make -up assignme nts are at the discretion of the individual course coordinator. If the student absen ce results in missing any point -generating activities and the instructor is willing to allow makeup of the missed activity, the course coordinator will contact the student to schedule makeup exercises. Class absence to attend professional meetings Students who miss class to attend professional meetings must make appropriate arrangements well in advance of the absence. To make arrangements to miss class to attend a profession al organization meeting , contact Associate Dean Linda Williams at <lwilliams@llu.ed u> outlining the organization meeting, the location of the meeting, and the dates the student will be absent from class. Associate Dean Linda Williams will forward this info rmation to the course coordinator of the missed classes , and the course coordinator will contact th e student if there are any make up assignments. Student Handbook 213 IPPE attendance ( referenced from the IPPE manual) It is mandatory for the student to be in attendance at the s ite on a weekly, full -time basis, 8 hours/day per week for the specified number of weeks. It is the student's responsibility to immediately report absences/tardiness directly to the preceptor and the IPPE coordinator for the Department of Experiential and Continuing Education . The student is required to submit the IPPE absence reschedule form to the preceptor and then submit this to the Department of Experiential and Continuing Education as early as possible . The form will be maintained in the student's fi le. Excessive rescheduled absences/tardiness will result in a \"failure\" grade for the IPPE course. A minimum number of hours are required for each IPPE experience. IPPE rotations are scheduled for each Tuesday. Students are not permitted to arrange an alternative work schedule with the preceptor without prior approval from the Department of Experiential and Continuing Education. Failure to adhere to this policy will constitute an unexcused absence for that day. While scheduled for IPPE , students are ex pected to attend a mandatory classroom reflection schedule. Professional d evelopment Professional development activities are encapsulated into a required zero -credit course, Professional Development, and are offered every quarter throughout the PY1 to PY3 years. This cour se is graded on a satisfactory/ unsatisfactory basis. The purpose of this course is to encourage students' participation in portfolio development, leadership development activities, and other relevant exercises. A list of detailed a ctivitie s can be found in the course syllabus. The school believes that participation in the professional development course, as well as involvement in professional organizations, will adequately prepare students to demonstrate professional behavior in their inter actions with other students, faculty , and staff; as well as other health care professionals throughout their tenure at LLUSP and thei r entire career as pharmacists. DRESS CODE POLICY Students enrolled in the School of Pharmacy are expected to maintain an a ppearance that is consistent with the highest professional standards and that projects an image of cleanliness, competence , and professionalism. The image should be modest and consistent with the mission and philosophy of Loma Linda University. VIOLATIONS OF APPEARANCE STANDARDS Students who violate appearance standards will be subject to disciplinary action. DISCIPLINE FOR NONACADEMIC ISSUES If a student's professional (i.e. , nonacademic) behavior is inappropriate or not within University guidelines , the alleged misconduct is subject to review by the associate dean for student affairs and admissions \u2014at which time it will be determined whether discipline is appropriate. When a serious allegation of misconduct is made , and pending an investigation or determ ination of formal action, a student may be suspended and not allowed to attend class, meet IPPE/APPE rotation appointments, attend campus events , or be present on campus unless given permission by the dean (or designee). 214 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY The process for evaluating alleged misconduct is as follows: 1. For minor infractions , the associate dean of student affairs and admissions may impose discipline as appropriate. 2. The individual alleging the misconduct files the allegation, in writing, to the associate dean of student affairs a nd admissions 3. The associate dean of student affairs and admissions may then conduct an informal investigation. If the matter is found to be substantive, with basis to justify continuing the investigation, it is referred to the dean of the school. The dean may call a special committee to determine the facts and provide a disciplinary recommendation to the dean. Where irrefut able circumstances are present \u2014for example a positive drug screen, Internet pornography, HIP PA violations \u2014the Dean may choose to handle the situation to determine a final ruling. 4. If the case is referred to the special committee called by the dean, the committee can be guided by the following University procedures outlined in the LLU Student Handbook : a. The associate dean of student affairs and admissions will provide the special committee with the allegations of misconduct and any other information pertaining to the alleged misconduct. b. The dean shall notify the student in writing of the allegations and that a special committee has been appoi nted. The special committee shall review the written allegations, interviewing individuals as needed to assemble appropriate information. c. The student shall be given the opportunity to appear before the committee. A n SP faculty member may attend this meetin g in support of the student. The committee will deliberate and provide a report of the findings , giving a recommendation for disciplinary action to the dean. The student and representative shall not be present during committee deliberations. The use of leg al counsel at this meeting, by the student or the school, is not permitted. d. It is the student's responsibility to contact his/her faculty representative to ensure availability at the time the committee meets. Failure of the student to meet these responsibi lities shall not be construed to prevent the committee from continuing its investigation and completing its deliberations. e. After appropriate review of all information, the special committee recommends disciplinary action to the dean of the school. The dean of the school makes the final decision for discipline. f. Disciplinary measures include but are not limited to warning, probation, censure, leave of absence, suspension, or expulsion. APPEAL PROCESS FOR NONACADEMIC DISCIPLI NE Following University policy (LLU Student Handbook ), the student who is under discipline and who does not believe the discipline is appropriate, has the right to request the dean of the school to have the disciplinary action reviewed by the Executive Committee. This request must Student Handbook 215 be presen ted to the dean of the school in writing within five (5) days of notification of disciplinary action. Within five (5) days of the date that the decision of the Executive Council is communicated to the student, the student may present a written request to t he dean of the school to review the committee decision. After review, the decision of the dean of the school is final. A student who questions whether the process provided by the school has followed the policy in regard to his/her appeal, may request that the University provost conduct a review of the process used by the school in responding to his/her appeal. GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES Loma Linda University has policies that have been established to resolve student problems and issues in a fair and impartial man ner. The University's most important business is to help students learn while maintaining high academic and ethical standards. Grievances related to sexual harassment, racial harassment, or discrimination against the disabled shall be pursued in accordance with University policies specifically relating to these items. The complete policy can be found in the LLU Student Handbook or at < llu.edu/central/handbook >. COMMUNICATION WITH T HE SCHOOL OF PHARMACY Announcements for the School of Pharmacy and University are posted on digital signs placed strategically in the School of Pharmacy. Students are responsible for all notices placed on School of Pharmacy digital signs. CANVAS The University incorporates the Canva s course management system , which allows students and professors to deliver course material in an online environment. Canvas is often used to supplement the face -to-face classroom instruction with the use of documents, content pages, discussion forums, exercises, and quizzes or exam ination s. In addition, a Canvas community is created for each class that serves as a communication tool between the students and staff, faculty, administrators, and the University. General information pertinent to student success is often placed into the appropriate Canvas commu nity. MAILBOXES Each pharmacy student in the PY1, PY2, and PY3 is assigned a mailbox. Student mailboxes are located in the Student Lounge , and the Office of Student Affairs administers mailbox assignments. Students are responsible for checking their mailbo x frequently enough to be kept abreast of current situations and information. Many professors return assignments, quizzes, and exam ination s to student mailboxes. E-MAIL MESSAGES Requests to distribute e -mail announcements or advertisements to groups of stu dents must be approved by, and distributed through, the Office of Student Affairs. Students are responsible for the security and activity related to their school e -mail account. 216 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY COMMUNICATION DEVICES All electronic devices are to be turned off during sched uled class times. In the event of an emergency, the Office of Studen t Affairs ( 909/558 -7441) can be called ; and a message will be promptly delivered to the individual involved. No phones, PDA s, calculators, laptops or electronic/wireless communication dev ices may be used in the classroom or lab oratory unless specifically approved by the faculty member in charge. Some faculty may stipulate that no electronic devices ( including , but not limited to cell phones, including Blackberries or iPhones ; pagers; compu ters; MP3 players , including iPods ; etc.) may be present in the classroom. STUDENT LEADERSHIP Qualifications for s tudent leadership and committee membership Students wishing to participate in school -sponsored activities or hold organization leadership positions must be a student in good standing academically and professionally. A minimum cumulative G .P.A. of 2.75 is required to be eligible to run or hold a student officer position. Students on academic probation or students experiencing a non academic situ ation subject to disciplinary action are not eligible to participate in school -sponsored activities or hold organization leadership positions. PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZ ATIONS Involvement in professional organizations is an integral part of the educational proce ss at Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy. Active involvement and networking with local and state leaders within the professional organizations enhances the overall educational experience and provides opportunities for career development. The School of Pharmacy pays professional organization membership dues for one student organization, which provides an opportunity for involvement and leadership experience. Active participation in at least one professional society is expected of all students. The associate dean for assessment and professional affairs is the official liaison within the School of Pharmacy for professional organizations. Professional organization officers are expected to work closely with the organization advisor and the associate dean f or assessment and professional affairs when planning association gatherings and travel. Professional organization policies and procedures Operating policy for professional organizations can be found in the Professional Organizations Policies and Procedure s Manual. This manual is maintained in the Office of Assessment and Professional Affairs and is distributed to all professional organization advisors and officers. Professional organization student travel and conduct As representatives of Loma Linda Unive rsity School of Pharmacy, students participating in off - campus professional organizational meetings are held to the same conduct expectations as outlined previously in this document. Being off campus does not absolve students from the responsibility of ad hering to all University policies, particularly as they relate to conduct and alcohol consumption. The organization sponsor must approve travel to professional Student Handbook 217 organizations , and an event petition must be completed and submitted four weeks prior to the planned travel. A list of students traveling to the professional meetings must be submitted to the assistant dean for student affairs and admissions prior to traveling to the meeting. The Loma Linda University Student Handbook outlines University policy on at tendance and participation at professional organizational meetings during the Sabbath hours. The complete policy can be found at <llu.edu/central/handbook >. SCHOOL OF PHARMACY CLASS ORGAN IZATIONS Each class elects class leaders to guide fellow students in class -related student issues , as well as to be a class representative to the administration. It is important to note that the class officer role does not extend to individual student issues since each student must ta ke personal responsibility for his/her own academic and professional success. Class members in the current PY1, PY2, and PY3 classes elect class officers at the end of the Spring Quarter to serve for the following year. Elections for class leader positions within the incoming PY1 class are sched uled in the middle of the first Fall Quarter. The Office of Student Affairs works closely with class leaders in addressing class issues and planning class events , as well as providing a strong communication link to and from the students to the administrati on. Each class elects a full time faculty member to serve as class advisor. The class advisor's function is to be a mentor and leader for the class , keeping abreast of class issues and maintaining an open communication link to the associate dean of student affairs and admissions. If a class chooses not to elect a student to a class office , that office shall remain empty until the next class election. The associate dean of student affairs and admissions is the official liaison within the School of Pharmacy f or class organizations. Class officers are expected to work closely with the class advisor and the associate dean of student affairs and admissions when planning school - sponsored events. Students who wish to start a new organization must work closely with the associate dean of student affairs and admissions to assure that processes are formulated appropriately. The dean of the School of Pharmacy, or his designee, must approve any organizations that wish to identify themselves with the School of Pharmacy. STUDENT EVENTS Student organizations and individual classes are encouraged to plan professional and social events for fellow classmates throughout the school year. All school -sponsored events must be appropriate within the conservative guidelines that are f undamental to Loma Linda University. In line with the hea lth practices of the University , all food that is served on campus must be vegetarian. Students planning events must follow the student event petition guidelines listed below. School -sponsored studen t events must have a faculty advisor who ha s been involved in the planning and is present at the event. If the advisor cannot be present , arrangements must be made for another faculty or administrator to attend. Most student events occur on campus ; however , three off -site venues have been approved for student and p rofessional organization events: the Spaghetti Factory restaurant in Redlands, the Hilton Hotel on Hospitality Lane , and the Redlands Country Club. School -sponsored events must comply with the exp ectations outlined in the School of Pharmacy Policy and Procedure Manuel as well as the LLU Student Handbook . 218 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY Student event petitions Student -planned social and professional organization events must be approved through both the Office of Student Affairs a nd the Office of Assessment and Professional Affairs. For an event to be approved , a student event proposal must be submitted to the Office of Student Affairs two weeks prior to the planned event. This allows for appropriate advertisement and adequate plan ning time to assure the event will run smoothly. The faculty sponsor who is involved in the event planning must sign the student event proposal form. These forms are located in the Student Affairs Office. When student travel is involved, an event proposal must be submitted for approval four weeks prior to the event. Displaying signs and event posters The Office of Student Affairs must approve all event announcements prior to posting. Event announcements are displayed only on the digital signs throughout the school. Signs and pos ters cannot be placed on walls or doors or in the elevator. STUDENT -GENERATED PRINT ITEM S A products/ apparel proposal request form must be submitted for s tudent -generated print items such as T -shirts, newsletters, flyers, etc. The products/ apparel proposal form must be approved by the organization's faculty sponsor and must have all the required signatures listed on the form prior to signing a work contract and beginning production. All such materials must comply with University value s and standards. Print materials must also comply with University Graphic Identity Guide (GIG) standards. Student Handbook 219 Academic Policies and Procedures ACADEMIC INTEGRITY P OLICY The School of Pharmacy follows the University academic integrity policy , as stated previou sly in this manual. HIPAA VIOLATIONS It is illegal for anyone to access any medical record that s/he has not been given specific permission to access , including his/her own profile. HIPAA (protected health information) violations are reported directly to t he dean. The dean will meet with the student to review the compliance report. The dean may seek counsel on appropriate disciplinary action from academic, institutional , and/or other agency personnel. The dean will determine the appropria te disciplinary act ion and communicate to the student and to the corporate compliance officer the action(s) taken . In all cases, the action of the dean is final. The student may follow through only with a University -level procedural appeal as related to the procedures contai ned in this section (i.e., HIPAA Violations). STUDENT PROGRESSION/ REMEDIATION Policy effective for the Class es of 2018, 2017, and those that previously opted into this policy 1. All students are required to maintain a minimum G .P.A. of 2.75 in all required c ourses at the conclusion of each academic year (PY1 -PY3) to be eligible to proceed with the following year of matriculation. 2. Any student who fails to achieve a minimum cumulative G .P.A. of 2.75 of all required courses at the conclusion of the academic yea r (PY1 -PY3) will be dismissed from the Pharm .D. program. 3. Any student who fails a required course within an academic term will be given an opportunity to remediate the class by taking a comprehensive exam ination that will be offered during the first three d ays of the week following final exam ination s. a. The stu dent must achieve a score of 80 percent or higher on the comprehensive exam ination in order to continue full enrollment in the Pharm .D. program. If the student achieves this score, s/he will receive a g rade of C - for the course. b. A score of less than 80 percent on this comprehensive exam ination will require the student to repeat the course the following academic year when it is offered. The student may choose to enroll in a zero -credit professional development course for the next two quarters (not including summer) and sit in on any course that was taught before the course s/he failed. The student is permitted to participate in campus activities and student organizations (no leadership roles), and maintai n his/her intern license. Alternatively, the student may go on academic leave of 220 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY absence for two quarters and surrender his/her intern license. Upon return, the student must repeat the course failed initially. Returning students are able at their own discr etion to take elective courses for which they are qualified. Repeated courses are posted as actua l grade earned (per LLU policy); however , both grades remain on the transcript. Only the latter grade is used for G .P.A. calculation. c. To prevent arbitrariness in this process, the Office of Academic Affairs will require each course coordinator to submit a comprehensive exam ination for his/her course at the beginning of the quarter. It is the responsibility of the Office of Academic Affairs to administer this exa mination to students who have received a grade below a C - in that class. d. Preparation for the comprehensive examination is the student's responsibility. Facu lty will not be required to relecture or reteach subject matter to students who are preparing for th e examination. e. Failing nine credit hours of required course work, whether accumulated in a single academic quarter or throughout the entire academic program, will result in dismissal from the program. A student will have a maximum of six calendar years to complete the Doctor of Pharmacy degree, beginning with the initial date of matriculation. Policy effective for Class of 2015 1. All APPE courses must be passed with a grade of \"S\" (satisfactory). Any student who receives a \"U\" (unsatisfactory) will have to re peat the APPE course. 2. Any student who fails one APPE course during the PY4 year will be allowed to participate in the commencement ceremonies only if s/he has not accumulated nine hours of failed required courses since the start of the program. However, th e student will not officially graduate until s/he successfully pass es the previously failed rotation when it is offered in the following academic year. 3. Students failing two APPE rotations will be dismissed from the program because they will have exceeded t he nine units of required courses. Student progression for Class of 2016 The curriculum is to be followed in a stepwise, block manner. All prerequisites must be completed before a student can enroll in a course. Students must pass all of the professional courses in each quarter before enrolling in courses in the next quarter. The Academic Standing Committee reviews the academic standing of each student quarterly. Students who fail to meet the minimum standards will be notified in writing by the associate dean for academic affairs and/or chair of the Academic Standing Committee. A minimum grade of C - is required to pass all pharmacy courses and electives. A student's progression will stop following a core course failure. The student will then be placed on a l eave of absence status for two academic quarters (not including summer). Alternatively, the student may choose to enroll in a zero -credit professional development course for the next two quarters (not including summer) and sit in on any course that was tau ght before the course s/he failed. The student is permitted to participate in campus activities and student orga nizations (no leadership roles) and maintain his/her intern license. Upon returning from the leave of absence, Student Handbook 221 the student must repeat the cours e failed initially. Returning students are able to take elective courses at their own discretion for which they are q ualified . Repeated courses are posted as actua l grade earned (per LLU policy); however , both grades remain on the transcript. Only the latter grade is used for G .P.A. calculation. A student will be permitted a cumulative total of nine credit hours of unsatisfactory core course work during the academic program. Exceeding nine credit hours of unsatisfactory core course work, whether accumulated in a single academic quarter or throughout the entire academic program, will result in dismissal from the program. A stud ent will have a maximum of six calendar years to complete the Doctor of Pharmacy degree, beginning with the initial date of matriculat ion. GRADING The following grades and grade points are used in the School of Pharmacy. All courses taught are approved for letter grades only. The exceptions are forum, professional development, and independent study\u2014which will be graded on a \"satisfactory /unsatisfactory\" basis. Each course coordinator is responsible for establishing the policy for rounding of scores in that class. Letter grades are determined based on performance in gaining a certain percentage of total points possible in each class. The g rade distribution below shows the percentage range and the letter grade associated with each range. A passing grade of C - or above is requi red in all courses. At least 70 percent of the total points must be achieved to pass each course. The grade distribu tion is as follows: S 0.0 Satisfactory performance in pharmacy f orum or professional development U** 0.0 Unsatisfactory performance in pharmacy forum, professional development, or chapel * marginal performance ** unsatisfactory performance Based on the grading policy above, a course is passed with a grade of C - or above unless both conditions listed below are met in the order listed. 1. The final percentage poin t of p erformance is below 70 percent . 222 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY 2. The final percentage point is below 1.75 standard deviations of the class percentage point mean. Incomplete (I) grade The notation \"I\" (incomplete) in a course is given only for circumstances beyond a student's control. It w ill not be granted as a remedy for course overload, failure on a final examination, absence from a final examination for reasons other than an emergency situation, or a low grade to be raised with extra work. To receive an incomplete , the student is respo nsible for initiating a request to receive a grade of \"I\" by completing a petition to receive incomplete grade on-line form (<myllu.llu.edu >), stating the reason for the request. If this request is approved, the instructor reports an \"I\" as well as the gra de the student would have received if the deficiency is not removed within the time limit. An \"I\" notation must be changed to an earned letter grade before the end of the following term (excluding the summer sessions). Failure to complete course requireme nts will cause the incomplete work to be counted as a zero and factored in with the existing grade to calculate the final grade for the course. DEAN'S LIST AND HONOR ROLL A student who earns a 3.30 to 3.69 grade point average in a given quarter, with no in compl ete grades during a term is given honor roll standing. A student who earns a 3.70 or better grade point average in a given quarter, with no incomplete grades, is given Dean's List standing. FINAL COURSE GRADE A PPEAL AND GRADE -CHANGE POLICY Every stud ent has a right to receive a grade assigned upon a fair and unprejudiced evaluation , based on a method that is neither arbitrary nor capricious. Furthermore instructors have the right to assign a grade based on any method that is professionally acceptable, communicated to all students in the course syllabus, and applied equally. Instructors have the responsibility to provide careful evaluation and timely assignment of appropriate grades. Course and project grading methods are explained to students at the beginning of the term. Academic integrity assumes that the judgment of the instru ctor of record is authoritative and the final grades assigned are correct. A grade appeal is confined to charges of unfair action toward an individual student and may not involv e a challenge of an instructor's grading standard. A student has a right to expect thoughtful and clearly defined approaches to grading, but it must be recognized that varied standards and individual approaches to grading are valid. The grade appeal consid ers whether a grade was determined in a fair and appropriate manner; it does not attempt to grade or re - grade individual assignments or projects. It is incumbent on the student to substantiate the claim that his or her final grade represents unfair treatme nt. Only the final grade in a course may be appealed. In the absence of compelling reasons \u2014such as clerical erro r, prejudice, or arbitrariness \u2014the grade assigned by the instructor of record is to be considered final. In a grade appeal, only arbitrariness, prejudice, and/or error will be considered as legitimate grounds for an appeal. Student Handbook 223 1. Arbitrariness: The grade awarded represents such a substantial departure from accepted academic norms as to demonstrate that the instructor did not actually exercise profession al judgment. 2. Prejudice: The grade aw arded was motivated by ill will and is not indicative of the student's academic performance. 3. Error: The instructor made a mistake in fact. The grade -appeal procedure applies only when a student initiates a grade appeal and not when the instructor decides to change a grade due to possible error. This procedure does not cover instances where students have been assigned grades based on academic dishonesty or academic misconduct. Also excluded from this procedure are grade a ppeals alleging discrimination, harassment , or retaliation in violation of Loma Linda University's Sexual Harassment Policy. The grade -appeal procedure strives to resolve in a collegial manner a disagreement between student and instructor concerning t he as signment of a grade . The intent is to provide a mechanism for the informal discussion of differences of opinion, and for the formal adjudication by a grade -appeal panel only when necessary. In all instances, students who believe that an appropriate grade h as not been assigned must first seek to resolve the matter informally with the instructor of record. If the matter cannot be resolved informally, the student must proceed with a grade appeal in the proc edure outlined below. The grade -appeal process must be started within ten working days after the end of the academic quarter in which the disputed grade is received. Student Grade -Appeal Process Step 1. A student who wishes to question a grade must first discuss the matter with the instructor within ten worki ng days after the end of the academic quarter in which the disputed grade is received. In most cases, the discussion between the student and the instructor should suffice , and the matter will not need to be carried further. The student should be aware that the only valid basis for grade appeal beyond Step 1 is to establish that an instructor assigned a grade that was arbitrary, prejudiced, or in error. Step 2. If the student's concerns remain unresolved after Step 1, the student may submit a written request to meet with the appropriate department chair within five working days of speaking with the instructor. In situations where the instructor of record is a department chair or associate dean, then the dean will serve as the appropriate department head in th is step. The appropriate department chair will meet within five working days with the student; and if the department chair believes that the complaint may have merit, s/he will meet with the instructor. After consultation with the department c hair, the ins tructor may choose to let the grade remain or to change it. The department chair will communicate the result to the student and instructor. Step 3. If the matter remains unresolved after Step 2, the student should submit to the dean within two working days a written request that includes all supporting documents . The dean will appoint a grade -appeal panel to review the request. Please note that only appeals directly related to the assignment of a final grade are considere d; and that attendance, illness, per sonal circumstances, or other reason for appeal not directly related to the assignment of a grade will 224 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY not be considered. The panel may require any or all individuals associated with the appeal to appear. The panel is charged to determine whether the grade was assigned in a fair and appropriate manner, or whether clear and convinci ng evidence of unfair treatment \u2014such as arbitra riness, prejudice, and/or error \u2014might justify changing the grade. The panel will make its decision based on a majority vote and is o nly required to state their decision, not the rationa le for their decision. If the p anel concludes that the grade was assigned in a fair and appropriate manner, it will report its conclusion in writing to the student, the instructor , and the dean; and the matter will be considered closed. If the panel determines that compelling reasons exist for changing the grade, it will request that the instructor make the change \u2014 providing the instructor with a written explanation of its reasons. Should the instructor d ecline, s/he must provide a written explanation for refusing to change the grade. If after considering the instructor's explanation the panel concludes that it would be unjust to allow the original grade to stand, the panel will then determine what grade i s to be assigned. The new grade may be higher than, the same as, or lower than the original grade. Having made this determination, each panel member will sign the grade change form and transmit it to the Office of University Records. The instructor, the student , and the d ean will be advised of the new grade. Under no circumstances may persons other than the original faculty member or panel change a grade. Should the panel conclude that the instructor's written explanation justifies the original grade, the panel will report t his in writing to the student, the i nstructor , and the dean; and the matter will be closed. PERFORMANCE LEVELS Good academic standing To remain in good academic standing , pharmacy students must maintain a minimum cumulative grade point av erage of 3.00. Failure to maintain a good academic standing will result in action by the school (see below, Academic Monitoring). In addition to the cumulative G.P.A., a grade of at least a C - must be earned in any course for which credit is to be applied towards completion of the requirements for the Doctor of Pharmacy degree. Academic monitoring Each student's academic status will be reviewed by the Academic Standing Committee at the end of each academic quarter , including each student's cumulative G .P.A. as reported by University Records. A student with a cumulative G .P.A. of less than 3.00 will be monitored by the Academic Standing Committee until the student has achieved two successive quarters with a quarterly G .P.A. above 3.00. Each student being moni tored by the Academic Standing Committee must meet with the director of academic support no less than two weeks after the end of the quarter. The director of academic support and the student will design an academic improvement plan (AIP). The AIP may inclu de mandatory study/advising sessions, mandatory class attendance, and/or other stipulations aimed at encouraging and supporting student academic success. Student Handbook 225 Academic dismissal The progression policy addresses most elements of academic dismissal. The followin g paragraphs address addition al elements relating to academic dismissal. Since required courses may not be attempted more than twice (i.e., a course may be repeated only once), including APPEs, grades of D+, D, D -, F, and W are considered to be attempts to complete degree program courses. Failure to complete any course in the program within these limits will result in dismissal from the program. A dismissed student will receive written notification from the associate dean for academic affairs in person. Th e notice will include procedures for appeal. Dismissed students are required to turn in any LLU identification badges and will have their electronic and parking privileges revoked. The school will also notify the California Board of Pharmacy for terminatio n of the student's intern pharmacist license. Readmission of dismissed students A dismissed student may appeal his/her dismissal from the program directly with the Office of the Dean within five business days. Withdrawal from the program If, after having b een registered, a student finds it necessary to withdraw during the course of a quarter, the associate dean of student affairs and admissions must be notified in writing. Arrangements for formal withdrawal must then be made by electronic submission (<myllu .llu.edu >). An exit interview with a member of the School of Pharmacy administration is required. EXAMINATION PROCEDURES AND REVIEW Exam ination technology requirements (beginning with Classes of 2017 and 2018) The School of Pharmacy has a computer require ment policy. All incoming students will be required to have their own computer. The majority of testing will be done using a computerized testing program called SofTest, a com ponent of the company ExamSoft; and students will need their own computer or iP ad that meet s or exceed the following requirements for test taking.

Students will be allowed to have at their desk during the examination period only those items necessary for completion of the examination. All cell phones and PDAs must be turned off and placed with all other items at the front of the room. 2. Students will be responsible for furnishing their own writing utensils , including n o. 2 pencils for the Scantron. 3. Students may be assigned random seating during the examination period. Whenever possible, multiple rooms will be used during examination periods in order to maximize space between students. Whenever possible, a ratio of one proctor per 35 students will also be maintained. 4. Bathroom breaks will be allowed only at the discretion of the inst ructor/coordinator. Students are encouraged to limit fluid intake and to use the bathroom prior to the start of the examination. Student Handbook 227 5. Late arrivals are disruptive. Be on time. At the instructor's discretion, students who arrive late to an examination will be al lowed to take the examination only if no student who has completed the examination has left the room. Students who arrive late will not be given additional time and are must turn their examination in at the same time the instructor calls time for those stu dents who arrived on time. 6. It is important to write clearly. If the instructor or course coordinator cannot read your answer, it will be counted wro ng. Examination review If exam ination s are not to be returned to the students permanently, exam ination revie ws can take place under the following conditions : 1. Students must leave all personal items at the front of the room or outside the office (i.e., purses, backpacks, cell phones, PDAs, tape recorders, jackets, coats). 2. Students will not be allowed to have writ ing material or utensils during the review , unless specifically allowed by the instructor. 3. The exam ination review can occur eithe r at a pre scheduled time or may be individually scheduled in the instructor 's/coordinator 's office, and in all cases will occur under the direct supervision of the instructor or course coordinator. 4. Writing down questions and/or answers from an examination i s prohibited and if attempted will constitute academic dishonesty , with the requisite consequences up to and including dismiss al from the program. 5. At the instructor 's/coordinator 's discretion, examinations and quizzes may be reviewed in class but will be collected immediately thereafter. Failure to return a test will result in a zero (0) grade on it. Faculty will be responsible f or ensuring that all tests are returned. Request for examination regrade Students will be allowed to review their exam ination s during instructor office hours, during a review session, or upon return of essay/calculations exam ination s. All requests for exam ination regrades must be submitted in writing within seven days after the date when grades for the exam ination have been communicated to class students, and must a ddress specific disagreements. The instructor or course coordinator will respond to the reque st in writing, stating whether or not each particular grade change request has been allowed. Once an exam ination has been submitted for re grading, the course coordinator reserves the right to re - grade the entire exam ination , not just the question(s)/sectio n for which the exam ination has been submitted for re grade. This may result i n additional point deductions. After the one-week review period, requests for re grade will not be accepted for any reason. Missed examination policy Makeup work fo r missed examina tions will be granted only when proper procedure for being absent has been followed (see Class Absence Policy) and at the discretion of the course coordinator. Such an absence requires timely notification to the course coordinator and proper documentation provided to the Office of Student Affairs. Absences for religious reasons or school -approved activities will be honored. The student must notify the course coordinator in 228 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY advance of the examination that such a situation exists. Makeup exam ination s may be d ifferent in both content and form from the original (missed) exam ination . Disclaimer The faculty of the School of Pharmacy reserves the right to revise the curriculum at any time to assure that students acquire the most current and relevant training possib le. If curricular changes become necessary, every effort will be made to apprise students of the change and how it impacts their course of study. However, assurance of well -prepared graduates will prevail as the dominant concern. The School of Pharmacy wi ll graduate only those students it deems ready to accept the moral, ethical, and professional responsibilities of the practice of pharmacy, and consequently reserves the right to withhold the recommendation for graduation of any student who does not confor m to these standards.

STUD ENT POLICIES A ND PROCEDURES MANUAL The Student Policies and Procedures Manual is annually reviewed and updated. A printed copy of the manual is provided to all pharmacy students at the beginning of each academic year. The link to the University Student Han dbook is <llu.edu/central/handbook >. TECHNICAL STANDARDS FOR ADMISSION, PROMOT ION, AND GRADUATION Graduation Pharmacy education requires that the accumulation of scientific knowledge be accompanied by the simultaneous acquisition of skills and professiona l attitudes and behavior. Pharm acy school faculty have a responsibility to society to matriculate and graduate the best possible pharmacists. Thus, admission to the School of Pharmacy is offered only to those who present the highest qualifications for the study and practice of pharmacy. Technical standards presented in this document are requirements for admission to, promotion within, and graduation from Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy. It is the policy of the Loma Linda University School of Pharm acy that no person shall be denied admission, promotion, or graduation on the basis of any disability, provided that the individual demonstrates ability to meet the minimum technical standards set forth herein. Standards are developed as criteria to achiev e the Doctor of Pharmacy degree in preparation for licensure as a practicing pharmacist and for postgraduate professional training and education in any of the varied fields of pharmacy. Further, the safety of the patient must be guarded as the final and ul timate consideration. Therefore, it is not only reasonable, but also essential, for competent patient care to require minimum technical standards for the education of pharmacists. Graduates of schools of pharmacy must have the knowledge and skills to funct ion in a broad variety of clinical, administrative , and leadership situations ; and to render a wide spec trum of pharmaceutical care. Loma Linda University School of Pharmacy acknowledges Section 504 of the 1973 Vocational Rehabilitation Act and PL 11 -336, the Americans with Disabilitie s Act (ADA) 1993, but asserts that certain minimum technical standards must be present in the prospective candidates. The Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education requires that the curriculum provide a general professional education, enabling each student to 230 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY eventually practice as a pharmacist generalist. This requires the development of broad knowledge, skills, behaviors, ongoing self -directed learning, and the eventual ability to deliver competent pharmaceutical care with in a reasonable time frame and within the context of the legal and ethical framework of the profession. Technical standards Technical standards specify those attributes the faculty consider necessary for initiating, continuing, or completing a high -quality pharmacy education program, thus enabling each graduate to enter practice, residency, or fellowship training. Faculty has responsibility to monitor the maintenance of these standards. Students must be able to perform independently all of the described fun ctions. A candidate for the Doctor of Pharmacy degree must have aptitude, abilities, and skills in the following areas: observation, communication, motor coordination and function, intellectual -conceptual, integrative and quantitative abilities, behavioral and social attributes , and ethical values. The School of Pharmacy will consider for admission any applicant who demonstrates the ability to perform or to learn to perform the skills listed in this document. Applicants are not required to disclose the nat ure of their disability(ies) to the Admissions Committee. However, any applicant with questions about these technical standards is strongly encouraged to discuss his/her specific issue(s) with the associate dean for student affairs and admissions prior to the interview process. If appropriate, and upon the request of the applicant, reasonable accommodations will be provided. This commitment also holds for current students whose health or abilities change while enrolled in the program. The School of Pharmacy recognizes that certain student disabilities can be accommodated without compromising either the standards required by the school or the integrity of the curriculum. Technological compensation can be made for some handicaps in these areas, but a candidate should be able to perform in a reasonably independent manner. The school is committed to the development of innovative and creative ways of opening the curriculum to competitive an d qualified disabled candidates while protecting the care of patients. The use of a trained intermediary means that a candidate's judgment must be mediated by someone else's power of selection and observation. Therefore, third parties cannot be used to assist students in accomplishing curricular requirements in the skill areas sp ecified above. Observation Students must be able to observe demonstrations and conduct exercises in a variety of areas related to contemporary pharmacy practice, including but not limited to monitoring of drug response and preparation of specialty dosage f orms and experiments in the basic sciences. A student must be able to observe a patient accurately at a distance and close at hand, noting nonverbal as well as verbal signals. The student must be able to observe and interpret presented information. Specifi c observation requirements include, but are not limited to , the following abilities: visualizing and discriminating findings on monitoring tests; reading written and illustrated material; observing demonstrations in the classroom or laboratory, including projected images; observing and differentiating changes in body movement; observing anatomic structures; discriminating numbers and patterns associated with diagnostic and Student Handbook 231 monitoring instruments and tests; observing a patient's environment; and competently using instruments for monitoring drug response. Communication A student should be able to speak, hear, and listen to patients in order to elicit information; describe changes in mood, activity, and posture; and perceive verbal as well as nonverbal communic ations. Students must be able to relate effectively and sensitively with patients and their caregivers/partners, and convey a sense of compassion and empathy. Students must be able to communicate effectively and sensitively with patients, colleagues , and o ther personnel in the School of Pharmacy. Communication includes speech, reading, writing, hearing, and computer literacy. Students must be able to communicate quickly, effectively , and efficiently in oral and written English with all members of the health -care team. Specific requirements include but are not lim ited to the following abilities: communicating rapidly and cle arly with members of the health -care team individually and collectively; eliciting a thorough medication and medical history; and communi cating complex findings in appropriate terms that are understood by patients and their caregivers, partners, and various members of the health -care team (fellow students, pharmacists, faculty and staff members, physicians, nurses, aides, therapists, social workers, and others). Students must be able to prepare and communicate concise but complete summaries of individual activities, decisions , and complex, prolonged encounters with patients. Students must be able to complete forms or appropriately document activities according to directions in a thorough and timely fashion. Motor coordination and function Students should have sufficient motor function and skills necessary to perform basic tasks in the practice of pharmacy and to elicit information from patien ts by various screening maneuvers. Student s should be able to execute motor movements reasonably required to participate in the general care and emergency treatment of patients. They must b e able to respond promptly to emer gencies within the practice setti ng and must not hinder the ability of their co -workers to provide prompt care. Examples of such emergency treatment reasonably required of pharmacists include arriving quickly when called, administering cardiopulmonar y resuscitation, applying pressure to s top bleeding, participating in the initiation of appropriate procedures, rapidly and accurately preparing appropriate emergency medication, and preparing sterile intravenous medications. Such actions require coordination of both gross and fine muscular mov ements, equilibrium, and functional use of the senses of touch and vision. Students must have sufficient sensory and motor function to monitor drug responses and to prepare and or dispense pharmaceuticals. A candidate should be able to perform basic labora tory tests (e.g., blood glucose and lipid levels), administer immunizations (intramuscular and subcutan eous), compound sterile and non sterile dosage forms, use current technology for drug information evaluation, read EKGs, drug blood levels, and other labo ratory results. It is also necessary for the student to be able to access drug and disease information sources (both paper and electronic) within a reasonable time frame and record data correctly so that it is clearly understood by other health professiona ls. 232 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY Intellectual -conceptual, integrative , and quantitative abilities A student should possess sufficient intellectual, conceptual, integrative and quantitative abilities to complete a rigorous and intense didactic and experiential curriculum. These abiliti es include measurement, calculation, rational reasoning, problem analysis and solving, decision - making, judgment, numerical recognition, information integration, and solution synthesis. In addition, the student should be able to comprehend three -dimensiona l relationships and to understand the spatial relations of structures. Especially important is the appropriate and rapid calculation of dosages for a variety of patient -specific conditions \u2014such as renal or hepatic failure, obesity, cardiac or respiratory a rrest, etc. Additionally, calculations involving appropriate dilution or reconstitution of drug products, electrolytes, etc. , must be made accurately and quickly. Problem solving and critical ski lls demanded of all pharmacists require all of the above -ment ioned intellectual abilities and must be performed quickly, especially in emergency situations. The ability to incorporate new inf ormation from peers or teachers , as well as to locate and evaluate new information from the literature to be used appropriatel y in formulating assessments and pharmaceutical care plans , is essential \u2014as is good judgment in patient assessment and therapeutic planning for disease management. Students must be able to identify and acknowledge the limits of their knowledge to others , when appropriate , and must be able to recognize when the limits of their knowledge indicate further study or investigation is essential before participating in decision making. A student must be fully alert and attentive at all times in clinical settings. Behavioral and social attributes Empathy, integrity, honesty, concern for others, kindness, patience, good interpersonal skills, interest , and motivation are all personal qualities that are required. Students must possess the emotional and mental health req uired for full use of their intellectual abilities, the exercise of good judgment, the prompt completion of all responsibilities attendant to the screening and care of patients, and the development of mature, sensitive, and effective relationships with patients of differing cultures and backgrounds. Students must also be able to develop mature, sensitive , and effective relationships with patients and their caregivers and partners \u2014providing comfort and reassurance when appropriate. Students must possess adeq uate endurance to be able to tolerate physically, intellectually, and emotionally taxing workloads and to function effectively under stress or with distractions. At times this requires the ability to be aware of and appropriately react to one's own immedia te emotional responses and environment. For example, students must maintain a professional demeanor and organization in the face of long hours and personal fatigue, dissatisfied patients, and tired colleagues. Students must develop the skills necessary to instruct and supervise technical personnel assisting with the delivery of pharmaceutical services. Students are expected to accept appropriate suggestions and criticism and, if necessary, respond quickly, appropriately and cooperatively by modification of behavior. Empathy, patience, integrity, concern for others, interpersonal skills, interest, and motivation are all personal qualities that should be assessed during the admission and education processes. Student Handbook 233 Ethical values Student s must demonstrate the highest level of professional demeanor and behavior, and must perform in an ethical manner in all dealings with peers, faculty, staff, and patients. Students must also be able to develop professional relationships with patients and their caregivers and partners w hile protecting patient confidentiality. Students must also meet the expected ethical standards set forth by the pharmacy profession. Good moral character, decent values , and principled judgment are paramount attributes for being a professional. In order t o participate in key components of the curriculum, a student must be able to obtain and maintain a valid intern pharmacist license from the California State Board of Pharmacy and pass requisite criminal background checks and random illegal drug screens req uired by the Board of Pharmacy or affiliated clinical institutions of Loma Linda University. Applicable technical standards requirements 1. The candidate/student observes demonstrations and participates in experiments in the basic pharmaceutical sciences. 2. The candidate/student analyzes, synthesizes, extrapolates, solves problems, and reaches therapeutic judgments and monitoring parameters. 3. The candidate/student sufficiently uses the senses of vision and hearing and the somatic sensation necessary to perform a physical assessment. (For example, the candidate/student performs palpation, auscultation, and percussion.) 4. The candidate/student relates to patients of all cultures and backgrounds and establishes sensitive, professional relationships with them. 5. The candi date/student communicates therapeutics options and decisions to the patient and to colleagues with accuracy, clarity, and efficiency. 6.

The candidate/student perform s with precise, quick, and appropriate actions in emergency situations. 8. The candidate/student displays good judgment in the assessment and treatment of patients. 9. The candidate/student possesses the perseverance, diligence, and consistency to complete the Pharmacy Program and to enter the practice of pharmacy. 10. The candidate/student accepts criticism and responds with the appropriate modification of behavior. In summary Candidates for the Doctor of Pharmacy degree must have somatic sensation and the functiona l use of the senses of vision and hearing. Candidates must have sufficient use of senses (touch, pain, temperature, position, pressure, movement, and vibratory ) and motor function to permit them to carry out the activities described above. Students must be able to consistently, quickly , and accurately integrate all information receive d by whatever sense(s) employed; and they must have the intellectual ability to learn, integrate, analyze, and synthesize data. Finally, 234 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY students must have good moral character , decent values , and principled judgment ; and are expected to meet the ethical standards set forth by the pharmacy profession. Any faculty or administrative team member may question any enrolled student's or admission candidate's ability to meet any techni cal standard. A request for such an investigation of a specific individual must be made in writing to the associate dean for student affairs and admissions, detailing the reasons why such an evaluation is deemed necessary. The dean will be notified if such a request is granted. MISCELLANEOUS Pets and/or children in the School of Pharmacy during school hours Taking into consideration the liability to the School of Pharmacy, children are not permitted in the school during school hours. Pets also present a li ability , along with possible sanitation and allergy issues for students and faculty; consequently, pets are never permitted in the School of Pharmacy buildings. Student Handbook 235 SECTION XII SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEA LTH236 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY Dean's Welcome We are living in exciting and challenging times for public health. The increase in diseases directly related to lifestyle choices, the reappearance of infectious diseases that science believed were under control, the widening gap between those who have and those who don't and its impact on their l ife and health \u2014these are all examples of public health issues that demand our attention. And yet, they are not necessarily the most important. Questions like: Why do bad things happen to good people? At the end of the day, what does any of this really matt er? Am I important, of value to God, or to other human beings? These questions are at the core of our existence; and the answer to them can make the difference in someone's life, health, and future. This is the reason that LLU's School of Public Health exi sts as one of the CEPH -accredited schools. We are a community that cares about public health issues: We value wholeness and the importance of healthy lifestyle decisions, offering the only M.P.H. degree program in lifestyle medicine and a thriving nutritio n department; we are serious about creating and advancing knowledge as our faculty members and students engage in research that spans epidemiological studies and community -based participatory enterprises; and we care about people, not just as populations, but also as individuals. We care about people's access to comprehensive health care, we care about the environment we live in, we care about policies that are developed to empower people to make the right choices, and we care about working with individuals and communities as we all strive to effectively connect what we know with how we live. We are special because we are part of an educational and health care system that can be found in the whole world, from the most remote village to the most advanced metr opolis; and our faculty members prepare our students to practice public health in such a world. However, the reason we exist as a school goes beyond all that has been mentioned. We are here because we want to explore the other questions with you. When you leave here, our prayer is that you will deepen your relationship with a God who loves you, who values you as an individual, who has a mission for your life, and for whom you matter. We hope that you get a chance to meet Him in the classrooms, down the hall ways, in devotional events and spiritual retreats, and especially in the faces of those we will serve together. Welcome to Loma Linda University's School of Public Health. I hope this academic year provides you with many opportunities to bring hope, healt h, and healing to your community. Get involved, participate, and try something new. Let's pray together that we may fulfill our mission. Tricia Penniecook, M.D., M.P.H. Dean Student Handbook 237 Academic Policies ACADEMIC CREDIT Unit of credit Credit is granted in terms of the quarter unit, which represents ten -to-twelve didactic class hours, together with the requisite study, preparation, and practice; or a minimum of twenty laboratory hours, or the equivalent in pre - and/or postlaboratory study. All courses not listing a cademic credit in units must list credit earned in total hours of contact or clock hours. Extension credit No degree credit is given for extension courses carrying the prefix EXTN and/or special course numbers earned either at LLU or at another accredited or nonaccredited institution. Exception may be granted when documentation shows the course is a regular class offered for academic credit. Continuing education credit No degree credit is given for continuing education credit (CEU) or other special course numbers earned either at LLU or at another accredited or nonaccredited institution. Transfer credit Transfer credit is credit completed at another accredited institution of higher learning, and then approved for application to a School of Public Health deg ree program. Transfer of credit becomes official after having been formally requested by academic variance petition, recommended by the student's advisor and academic program, and approved by the assistant dean or the associate dean. If credit is being s ought in place of a required school course, the instructor of the school course must also approve the transfer. A minimum grade of B is required for all courses accepted for transfer credit. Transfer of credit to a school program is applicable only if the course work was completed less than five years prior to acceptance into the school degree program. Transfer credit courses must be equivalent to courses appropriate to degree requirements as specified by the programs in the school. Transfer credit may red uce the number of units required to be earned at Loma Linda University, but does not reduce any other requirements (such as residence requirements, culminating activity, practicum requirement). Units that have been previously applied to another degree prog ram may be accepted for transfer credit. The maximum number of transfer credits may not exceed 20 percent of the minimum units required for the degree. For the school, up to 9 units may be applied to a master's 238 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY degree program and up to 12 units to a doctor al degree program. They must be graduate -level or upper division, undergraduate courses that qualify for graduate credit within the policies of the school from which the course was offered. Transfer credit may not reduce the total units required below 47 f or a single -major M.P.H. degree program. After advanced standing and transfer credit have been applied, the minimum number of units that must be earned for a doctoral degree is 60. Extramural credit When a student begins a degree program at this school, it is understood that usual course work for which degree credit is desired should be taken at this University. Exceptions to this are subject to the same guidelines that govern transfer credit. Prior to registration for extramural course work, the student c ompletes an academic variance petition form. Final recommendation for transfer credit is made at completion of course work by the academic advisor of the student's major department program and the admissions director assistant dean or associate dean. Grade (s) received for extramural course(s) cannot be used to raise G.P.A. obtained in School of Public Health courses. Relationship of extramural credit to transfer credit The use of the term \"extramural credit\" in the School of Public Health must be understood to indicate a particular type of transfer credit. Since extramural credit is a type of transfer credit, it then must come within the requirements applied to transfer credit in general. Thus, the limit applied to transfer of credit into SPH degree programs applies to the total units of credit transferred, whether that credit is earned before or after a student is enrolled as a regular student in a School of Public Health degree program. In this context, then, extramural credit must fit within the 20 percent limit used to include all transfer credit. Advanced standing In some cases, a student may have taken a course similar to one required by the program in the SPH; but it may not be available for transfer credit. Advanced standing may be requested with the approval of the student's academic advisor and major program. Instructor approval may be required. The course must be graduate level, taken for academic credit in an accredited institution within the past five years, for which a grade of B or better was received. Advanced standing is not granted for religion courses. Advanced standing may not be used to meet elective requirements. Advanced standing may only be used for courses taken prior to acceptance into the school. Experience alone may not be used t o justify advanced standing. Student Handbook 239 Advanced standing may not reduce total units below minimum required; i.e., 47 for master's degree programs, 60 for doctoral degree programs. Shared units The maximum number of units that may be shared between two master's degre es or between a doctoral and a master's degree within the University is 18 units. The maximum number of units that may be shared between two doctoral programs within the University is 36 units. The maximum number of units that may be shared between any deg ree program and a certificate program is 9 units. Students may request shared units by submitting an academic variance petition. Shared units are not automatically guaranteed. Waiver of a program requirement A student may request waiver of a requirement if prior course work or experience fulfills the intent of the requirement but does not qualify for transfer of credit. Waiver requires the consent of both the primary course instructor(s) and the academic advisor of the student's academic program. Waiver of a required course does not exempt students from the units required for their program. Students are to choose other course units in lieu of the waived course in consultation with their advisor and their major program. Students' previous academic records sho uld be reviewed to see that they are not required to repeat courses for which credit already exists. Courses credited toward an undergraduate degree may justify waiver of a School of Public Health degree program requirement. Other course units must be chos en to replace the waived course units. Course work used to justify a waiver must have received a grade of B or better. Waiver of a particular requirement may be granted after it is requested by academic variance petition, recommended by the academic adviso r, approved by the course instructor(s), and approved by the assistant dean or associate dean. In evaluating a student's qualification to waive a requirement, an equivalency examination may be required by the student's major program (if course is required for their major) or by the instructor of the course being waived (if the course is a public health core course). Petitions for waiver of a course requirement must be submitted prior to the beginning of the final quarter of the student's program. Students a re to request waiver of a particular requirement using the academic variance petition. They first seek the recommendation of their advisor and academic program. This is indicated by signature on the academic variance petition. Students are to choose the su bstitute course units in consultation with their academic advisor and their major program. If the course is required for their major, their advisor and program faculty must concur on the substitution. If the course is a public health core course, the instr uctor of the course must be involved in the decision regarding an appropriate substitution. 240 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY Credit by examination The School of Public Health (SPH) does not permit credit earned by equivalency examination to be applied toward a graduate SPH degree program requirement. Equivalency examinations may be used by SPH students to justify waiver and/o r advanced -standing petitions only. This may include waiver of prerequisites. Students must pay the designated equivalency examination fee prior to the examination. Requests for equivalency examinations must be approved by the instructor of the course for which request is made, as well as department advisor and chair. Equivalency examination(s) must be scheduled four weeks prior to the quarter in which the course(s) is/are offered. Academic credit accountability No credit can be granted for academic work done during any particular quarter when there is no valid registration for the work performed. All course work must be registered for during the particular quarter for which credit is requested or expected. REGISTRATION Registration for credit Students must register by the deadlines stated in the University portal. No one may attend class without being registered. Students are not allowed to register for courses that have conflicts in time, even if the conflict exists only for part of the lectures or laboratory. The assistant dean of the School of Public Health Office of Academic Records can register students who must be absent due to school business during the registration period, provided the registration information has been received prior to the re gistration period and financial clearance has been obtained by the student. Posted deadlines for registration and change of registration (see University portal) are in effect and binding; the school academic office will not intercede to obtain a variance. Any and all academic work must be registered for during the quarter for which credit is requested or expected. Audit registration A student wishing to audit a course must register for it and pay the audit tuition, which is approximately one -half of the c redit rate. On-campus students wishing to change a course from audit to credit or from credit to audit must request the change no later than the fifth day after the beginning of instruction. A course taken for audit cannot be repeated for credit later. Students without a valid bachelor's degree will be restricted to audit registration for School of Public Health graduate courses. Student Handbook 241 Audit registration is generally not available for courses that are predominantly laboratory experience. This includes all course s requiring extensive computer laboratory use. VETERANS A student eligible to receive veteran's benefits under the 1966 enactment should contact University Records at Loma Linda University to make arrangements for the transfer of records to the veteran's administration regional office. Students must maintain eligibility throughout their program of study. Please refer to the School of Public Health, Academic Practices section of the University CATALOG for eligibility criteria. Further information may be req uested from University Records. ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE Continuation in a course of professional studies is contingent upon satisfactory scholastic performance and on factors related to aptitude, proficiency, and responsiveness to the established aims of the school and of the profession. Minimum academic performance for SPH degrees In order to maintain regular academic status, students in graduate -level programs must maintain a cumulative G.P.A. of 3.0 or higher. A G.P.A. of 3.0 determined from courses requir ed in the major program must be maintained. A student's cumulative school G.P.A. is calculated upon the minimum number of units required for the student's degree program. In consultation with their advisor, students may choose which elective courses to in clude within the degree program for G.P.A. calculation purposes. Students whose academic performance is not adequate to maintain regular status are placed on academic probation. A student on academic probation may not graduate or obtain a degree from the s chool. Minimum academic performance for SPH courses A grade of C - is the minimum grade for which credit can be granted. A grade of C or better is required for all prerequisites. Any exceptions must be requested specifically by the program involved. Policie s for repeating a course A student wishing to improve his/her grade, once grades have been posted for a course, must repeat the course. When repeating a course, the student must attend class and laboratory sessions as ordinarily required and take all regul arly scheduled examinations. Full tuition is charged. Both the original and repeat grade performances are entered in the student's permanent record, but only the second or repeat grade is computed in the program G.P.A. and included in the total program uni ts earned. Both grades remain on the transcript. 242 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY A student may repeat a course only once. No more than two courses may be repeated in a student's degree program. Academic probation After grades roll at the end of any academic quarter for full -time students or beginning at the completion of 12 units for part -time students, when the cumulative G.P.A. is less than 3.0 (graduate) or 2.5 (undergraduate), but where a mathematical opportunity exists for the student to achieve 3.0 (graduate) or 2.5 (undergraduate) within the specified units for his/her curriculum, the academic office is authorized to place that student on academic probation status. Students will be issued a communication warning them that they are at risk for probation, or if they have been placed o n academic probation, as appropriate. 1. A student on academic probation is permitted to register for no more than 12 units in a given quarter. 2. A student on academic probation cannot be promoted to regular status until all Incomplete (I) and In Progress (IP) notations have been replaced by permanent grades that show evidence of satisfactory completion. 3. A student on academic probation for two quarters, regardless of whether the quarters have been consecutive, may be prevented from continuing in the program. In order to continue in the program, the student's academic review must show a reasonable plan by which the student may complete requirements, and must document the argument that would justify allowing the student to continue. 4. If at the end of any quarter a student's G.P.A. is such that obtaining a cumulative G.P.A. of 3.0 (graduate) or 2.5 (undergraduate) is a mathematical impossibility within the specified units for the student's curriculum, the student must submit an official withdrawal request to the scho ol or be dismissed. a. Veterans educational benefits eligibility If a student receives educational assistance from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and his/her cumulative grade point average (G.P.A.) remains below the graduation requirements for more than the equivalent units of three consecutive terms, the student will not be certified for veterans affairs educational benefits until his/her academic status is restored to regular standing. GRADING POLICIES SPH courses The utilization of the S/U gradin g scheme is not a School of Public Health student option for school courses listed in the University CATALOG. Each school course is restricted to either the A/B/C letter grade; or S/U notations, as designated by the academic council. Honor points are grant ed or calculated for the A/B/C system only. Grading requirements should be stipulated in writing at the beginning of the course. Student Handbook 243 Grading in specially structures courses Grading in special registrations \u2014such as directed study, special project, research, dis sertation, and field practicum \u2014is standardized by permitting the use of only the S/U grading system. The S grade is interpreted as B or better level of performance for graduate course work, according to the A/B/C system. Incomplete (I) notation GENERAL PRO CEDURE University policy states that a student must request an I (Incomplete) notation from the instructor by completing a petition to receive an I (Incomplete) form, and state the reason for the request. If approved, the instructor will then report the I notation on the instructor grade report, as well as the grade that the student will receive if the deficiency is not removed within the time limit. This additional grade, along with the I notation, will be included on the student's permanent record until a final grade has been submitted. When a student submits a petition to receive an I (Incomplete), the instructor and department chair are responsible to monitor the reasons. The form lists the reasons that are considered to be insufficient. If a student is unavailable to complete the form, the instructor is asked to complete the form. Instructors have a maximum of two weeks after the deadline for the Incomplete has passed to submit a grade. This is provided the deadline is within the time allowed. If an In complete has not been made up by the date listed on the form, the instructor, upon request of the student, must request an extension of time and state the new projected completion date. Absolute deadline for students to make up an Incomplete is the last d ay of examination week of the subsequent term. The earned grade is the permanent grade unless a change of grade is submitted by the instructor within the deadline allowed. Upon evaluation of the required additional work, which is due on the date agreed u pon, the instructor will turn in the corresponding final grade on a change -of-grade voucher to the office of University Records no later than the final day when grades are due the succeeding term. ACCEPTABLE REASONS F OR GRANTING AN INCOM PLETE (I) NOTATION Emergency situations beyond the student's control Student's illness Death in the student's immediate family Absence of the instructor Loss of documents or materials outside the student's control UNACCEPTABLE REASONS FOR GRANTING AN INCOMPLETE (I) NO TATION A remedy for overload 244 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY Failure on final examination Absence from final examination for other than an emergency situation Low grade to be raised with extra work Failure to complete assignments on time Inability to access data or other information Removal of an In Progress (IP) notation IP indicates that the course work has a duration extending more than a single quarter and will be completed by the student no later than the final quarter planned for the course. The removal of an IP notation must be initiated by the instructor Calculation of cumulative G.P.A. The cumulative University G.P.A. is calculated on all course work (admission deficiencies excluded) completed at LLU during the time period when the student is registered in the School of Public Health. A student's total school G.P.A. is calculated based on the minimum number of units required for the student's degree program. In consultation with their advisor, students may choose which elective courses to include within the degree program for G.P.A. calculation purposes. Change of grade Once a grade has been submitted on the instructor's grade report, it may be changed only when an error has occurred in determining or recording the grade. Changes of grade may be processed only if requested on a change -of-grade voucher and at the request of the faculty member teaching the course. Change of grade must be requested and submitted on a change -of-grade voucher within one quarter following submission of the original grade. ATTENDANCE Eligibility Only duly regist ered students are eligible to attend classes. Any exceptions to this must have the approval of the associate dean. Visiting scholars On occasion, scholars from other university or academic settings are desirous of attending classes or otherwise participati ng in the academic life of Loma Linda University School of Public Health. Any person seeking such an affiliation shall meet the following criteria: The individual shall hold a regular appointment at an accredited academic institution or other appropriate setting as determined by the dean of the School of Public Health. The individual shall obtain from the appropriate institutional officer of the parent organization (department chair, vice president for academic affairs) official notice of Student Handbook 245 his/her leave sta tus with the time interval involved. This shall be forwarded to the associate dean of the school. The individual shall present a curriculum vitae satisfactorily demonstrating to the associate dean competence and/or involvement in an area of study consisten t with the goals and interests of the SPH. 1. The time available for participation in the activities of the school shall not exceed one school year, with a possible one -year extension at the dean's discretion. 2. The visiting scholar will be allowed a maximum o f 12 quarter units of class work on a cost -free basis over the year, with the time to be arranged in whatever fashion would be suitable for his/her academic purposes. Class attendance CREDIT Students are required to attend all class sessions. Absences in e xcess of 15 percent of the appointments in a course may be sufficient cause for the recording of a failing or unsatisfactory grade. AUDIT Since audit registration indicates an attendance -only involvement of the student, attendance in at least 80 percent of the class sessions is required to receive an AU notation on the transcript. The notation AUW (Audit Withdrawal) is given to indicate the 80 percent attendance requirement was not satisfied. Chapel Students are required to attend school - and LLU -sponsored chapels. Unexcused absences from these convocations are reported to the school's Office of the Executive Associate Dean for Student Services and Alumni Affairs and, if absence irregularities persist, to the dean. Conflicting course times Students will not be permitted to register for courses conflicting in time, even if a conflict exists for only part of the lectures or laboratory. Off-campus activities Instructors scheduling the participation of students in off -campus activities that result in absence from scheduled on -campus courses or other academic activities must clear the schedule through the associate dean. Approval should be sought from the associate dean prior to announcing the event to students or soliciting student participation. 246 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY COURSE LOAD Gener al statement In harmony with the University Administrative Handbook (C-8,1.4), a graduate -level student in the School of Public Health must register for at least 8 units per quarter to be considered a full - time student. The normal full course load is consi dered to be 12 units per quarter. General overload requests A regular master's degree student registering for more than 15 units per quarter must obtain permission to do so by completing an academic variance petition form available from the academic office . A doctoral student's course load is dictated by his/her particular approved curriculum, and no special permission is necessary so long as the approved curriculum is followed and G.P.A. is maintained as indicated below. Students on academic probation are restricted to a maximum of 12 units per quarter and ordinarily are not eligible to petition for an overload. The following G.P.A. guidelines have been established for the approval of overload requests. The school's academic council must approve requests fo r 19 units and above. Cumulative units allowed G.P.A. Master's 3.3-3.4 16 3.5-3.75 17 above 3.75 18 Doctoral 3.5-3.75 17 above 3.75 18 International students In order to maintain their student visa qualifications, international students must reg ister for a minimum of 8 units per quarter. Field practicum registration of 400 clock hours per quarter is considered full -time study. If less than 8 units are needed to complete degree requirements, the University international student advisor (extension 44560) should be notified. The international student advisor will contact authorities for the necessary approval. The total academic and workload includes the following: Number of credit units registered at LLU; Registration in a field practicum, clerkshi p, externship, or residency through LLU (may be considered a full -time program); Number of credit units (prerequisite or other courses) at another college or university (this includes a correspondence course); or Number of hours in volunteer or gainful emp loyment. Student Handbook 247 General policy governing student workload As a general policy, a student taking a full study load (12 -15 units) should expect to be involved full-time in his/her academic study program and, therefore, should not attempt volunteer or gainful employ ment simultaneously. Students are not encouraged to request exceptions to this policy. Students taking a full load of study should expect to be involved full -time in their study program. A student planning to work more than 20 hours per week should contact the advisor in order to reduce his/her academic load. PETITIONS FOR ACADEM IC VARIANCE Requests for transfer credit, waiver, or advanced standing of a particular course are not accepted for processing while the student is classified as probationary. Unacce pted students are likewise not eligible to submit such variance requests. Requests for waiver, transfer credit, substitution, advanced standing, and other departures from the standard program should be submitted to the School of Public Health Office of Admissions and Academic Records on a petition for academic variance form. COURSES BEYOND DEGRE E REQUIREMENTS For various reasons, some students may desire to register for a course(s) beyond degree requirements. This could postpone their graduation date. As a working policy, the Office of Academic Records will allow students who wish to postpone their date of graduation to take a maximum of 12 units of course work beyond degree requirements. This approach applies the same restrictions as are applied to those w ho have completed degree requirements and graduated. Financial Aid restrictions apply. RELIGION REQUIREMENT S Objectives To provide a spiritual dimension to the professional training of School of Public Health students. To provide students with an opportuni ty to further develop their skills in dealing with life's challenges. Policies The School of Public Health requires a 500 -level course for the completion of religion requirements in the various graduate degree options. The University publishes a list of recommended courses each quarter in an attempt to assist students in their choice. Students must complete the specified number of religion units for their graduate degree program during their enrollment in the School of Public Health. A letter grade is requi red, with no option for the student to choose S/U or pass/fail grading. Only courses with an REL code prefix can be used to satisfy the religion course requirement. 248 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY The religion requirement may not be waived by registering for a religion course at a univer sity other than LLU. Undergraduate students should follow religion requirements outlined in the general education requirements. FIELD INSTRUCTION PR OGRAM Field instruction in the School of Public Health includes the field practicum, field experience, inter nship, and residency. Individual programs in the school may require completion of a field practicum or field experience as a part of the degree program. If field practicum or field experience is required as part of a degree program, this requirement must be clearly stated in the program's curriculum outline. Field practicum or field experience requirements stated in a program's curriculum outline are as binding as are course requirements. The number of field practicum or field experience clock hours requir ed for a particular degree program is determined by the program faculty and published as part of the curriculum requirements stated in the School of Public Health section of the University CATALOG. Students required to complete a field practicum as part o f their program requirements must register for the appropriate field practicum. Students registering for field practicum complete a regular registration form accompanied by a title request form. Tuition is charged according to the school's field practicum tuition rate schedule. Only students accepted into a school degree program and having regular status may register for the field practicum. Students may apply for a field practicum if they do not have regular status, but they must have achieved regular sta tus before registering. Students may register for a field practicum with Incomplete (I) notations on their academic record. Students planning multiple quarters in field practicums should register for all quarters before they begin the practicum. Arrangemen ts must be made with student finance for tuition payment and registration clearance. Students who need to leave for a field practicum prior to registration may submit preregistration materials to the school's Assistant Dean for academic records. It is the responsibility of the program director and field practicum coordinator to verify the fact that each student who is active in a field project or residency training program has completed all the required registration procedures and is listed on the official roster as distributed by University Records. Students enrolled in a full -time field practicum, clerkship, externship, internship, or residency are covered by the University student health insurance plan during any quarter they Student Handbook 249 are registered and pay the f ield practicum tuition. Nonregistered students participating in a field activity are not covered. Grading of field practicum The grade for the field practicum shall be Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U). If the required work/time has not been completed at t he end of a quarter, an I or IP may be assigned as appropriate. Students who receive a U grade in field practicum are required to participate in additional field practicum as determined by their program faculty, with registration and payment of tuition. Students required to complete field experience (not field practicum) as part of their degree program must satisfy the requirement as defined by their particular program. 1. The field experience requirement must be clearly stated in the program curriculum outli ne. 2. Requirements for the field experience must be published by the departments and distributed to students in the departments. 3. No registration or tuition payment is required. 4. Field experience is monitored within the department faculty, with notification to the school's Office of Admissions and Academic Records upon completion. INDEPENDENT AND DIRE CTED STUDY/SPECIAL PROJECT REQUIREMENTS Independent study Independent study in the School of Public Heath includes directed study/special project and research regi strations. Independent study is offered to provide opportunity for the student to gain academic experience beyond that which is available in regular course work. Thus, it is seen neither as a substitute for other course requirements nor as a mechanism to obtain course work that is not scheduled at that time. It is supervised by one faculty member with expertise in the area of study. It is evaluated according to specific objectives prescribed in a document of agreement, which includes: 1. A description of the work to be done 2. The basis for grading 3. The number of credit units to be earned 4. A schedule for student/instructor contacts Registration for directed study/special project and research with any school prefix is limited to students majoring in that particula r area. Special permission may be granted 250 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY by the associate dean. Independent study courses offered by other LLU schools are not under SPH jurisdiction; hence, this policy would not apply to such courses. Limitations: M.P.H. degree M.P.H. degree students ac cepted for a specific program are restricted to 4 units of independent study within the units required for the degree. Limitations: Doctor of Public Health degree in preventive care For the Dr.P.H. degree in preventive care, the maximum number of units per mitted is 4 per year; or a maximum of 6 units for the entire degree program. Extended campus degree programs Extended campus degree program students who have missed one or more regularly scheduled classes should be encouraged to enroll for these at one of the other off -campus programs or on the LLU campus. Directed study will not be offered in lieu of regularly scheduled off -campus courses. Grading Grading for all independent study (directed study/special project and research) credit in the School of Public Health may be S/U or a letter grade, as determined by the department. General guidelines To be eligible to register for independent study courses, students must have completed 12 units of School of Public Health courses and must have regular status. As a general rule, registration in a regular course is preferred above directed study/special project, and perhaps even research (provided the research is not a required component of the student's program). Students registering for any independent study course are required to complete the directed/independent study title request form as part of the registration process. For every unit of credit, a minimum of thirty clock hours of academic work is required. If grading is on an S/U basis, independent study may no t be used to improve a student's G.P.A. SPECIAL EXAMINATIONS Definition A special examination is defined as a written or oral examination given to the student at a different time than scheduled by either University Records or the school's academic office. It is understood that this policy refers to major examinations scheduled in a given course, i.e., unit examination, midterm, or final examination. A special examination is defined as a written or oral examination Student Handbook 251 Policies Except in unusual circumstances be yond the immediate control of the student, requests for special examinations will not be granted. The student is responsible for stating his/her request on an academic variance form. The completed form is then given to the associate dean, who consults with the faculty member(s) involved and makes the final decision. A special examination fee is charged. EQUIVALENCY EXAMINAT IONS The school does not grant credit for subjects challenged by examination at the graduate level. The school does not accept for trans fer any credit earned by examination at another institution at the graduate level. Students in the school may utilize equivalency examinations for the following purposes: 1. To demonstrate competence in a prerequisite area, thus satisfying the prerequisite; 2. To demonstrate competence in the subject matter of a course required in the degree program, thus justifying waiver of that course requirement; or 3. To validate competence in a course taken previously, justifying advanced standing relative to a required cours e in the degree program. CLEP examinations The college -level examination program (CLEP) sponsored by the College Board offers the opportunity for students to obtain credit by examination. On -the-job experience, purposeful reading, adult school, corresponde nce course, or television or taped courses may have prepared individuals to take CLEP tests. Two types of examinations are possible, namely general and subject. The school accepts results for single -subject examinations only (not combinations). Graduate c redit will not be given by the school for satisfactory results on a subject examination. Validation of results for credit must be obtained from La Sierra University or some other accredited undergraduate school. The school will accept satisfactory performa nce on CLEP examinations only to justify waiver of specific course prerequisites of a school graduate degree program. In order for a waiver of a degree course prerequisite to be approved, the applicant/student must achieve a score above the 50th percentile on the appropriate subject examination. Only score reports received from the College Board, Box 1824, Princeton, New York 08541, will be accepted by the Office of Admissions. WITHDRAWAL Students planning to withdraw from a degree program must submit a pro gram withdrawal request via the University portal. 252 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY Student must contact the University Office of Financial Aid and the Student Loan Collection Office before leaving the campus to ensure the proper documentation of forms has been completed. Tuition refund All or part of tuition paid for a quarter may be refunded, depending on the date of formal withdrawal from the program. Rules applied to refund of tuition in dropped courses are applied in the case of total withdrawal from a program. LEAVE OF ABSENCE Polic y A graduate student must either be registered or on official leave of absence each regular academic quarter until a degree is awarded. Failure to be registered or on leave of absence will result in a lapse of student status. Lapse of student status may re quire a student to be readmitted to the University under different CATALOG requirements and necessitate extension of the program. In addition, deferment of loan repayment is subject to quarterly registration or official leave of absence. Leaves of absence are available only to continuing graduate students with regular status (minimum 3.0 G.P.A.). Leave of absence is a privilege granted 1. to facilitate the timely completion of a degree; or 2. to respond to emergencies a. The deadline for requests for leaves of ab sence and extensions of leaves of absence is two weeks prior to the quarter in which the leave of absence or extension is to begin. b. Each leave of absence or extension of leave may be granted for one -to-four quarters. c. The total amount of leave of absence ti me for any student may not exceed one year for master's and two years for doctoral degree students, with the exception of students pursuing medical or dental degrees. d. Students on leave of absence to pursue another professional degree are expected to provid e evidence of satisfactory progress toward that degree by submitting a transcript at the close of each academic year. Students not providing this information may be inactivated. e. Students will be automatically inactivated from the program if they fail to re turn at the end of the leave of absence or fail to request an extension of the leave. Continuation in the program requires the full reactivation process. f. A student on official leave of absence is restricted in use of University facilities or faculty time u nder the provisions detailed below: Student Handbook 253 i. A student may make unrestricted use of the Library. ii. If it is anticipated that a student will use twelve or more hours of University facilities (excluding Library) and faculty time during the period of the leave of absen ce, the student is not eligible for a leave of absence or an extension of the leave of absence. iii. If the student has accumulated twelve or more hours of use of University facilities (excluding Library) and faculty time since last being registered, the stude nt is not eligible for an extension of the leave of absence. Request A student who wishes a leave of absence for one or more quarters must submit a leave of absence request via the University portal. A student who discontinues his/her studies at the Unive rsity must meet the entrance requirements in force at the time of his/her reentrance, unless s/he has been granted a leave of absence. INACTIVATION/REACTIV ATION Deferral prior to first registration A newly accepted student who has not yet registered for co urse work as School of Public Health student may request deferral of acceptance to a future quarter. Such cases do not require inactivation procedures. The deferred enrollment places the student under requirements of the curriculum in effect at the time of first actual enrollment. The school's Office of Admissions notifies the student regarding status and requirements. A deferral can be granted for a maximum of one year for the original term of acceptance. Accepted students failing to enroll Students accept ed to begin in a certain quarter, but who fail to register in that quarter, are contacted by the school's Office of Admissions and inactivated if no response is received. In such cases, the student may subsequently request deferral for up to one year from the original date of the application submission. Approval by the program faculty is required, the student comes under requirements of the curriculum in effect at the time of actual first enrollment, and the school's Office of Admissions notifies the studen t regarding status and requirements. Students who do not request deferral, or who request deferral for more than one year, must pass through the full reactivation process before they are allowed to enroll in courses in the degree program. Leave of absence Students on leave of absence who return within one year may continue under the requirements of their original curriculum. 254 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY Students who fail to return at the time specified in their leave of absence agreement are inactivated and must follow designated proce dures for reactivation. Enrolled students failing to register If an on -campus student fails to register in two consecutive quarters (three quarters, extended campus degree programs), s/he is informed by the school's Office of Academic Records that the admi nistrative withdrawal process will be activated and that his/her student status will be inactivated for the beginning of the next quarter unless s/he contacts the office or registers for a course before that time. If such a student fails to make contact (a nd submit a leave of absence) or register for a school course, the school's Office of Academic Records inactivates the student for the beginning of the following quarter. Such cases require that the student pass through the full reactivation process before registering for additional courses. Full reactivation process Because of the conditions of their inactivation by the school's Office of Academic Records, students may be required to pass the full reactivation process before being permitted to register for additional courses. (Note: In many other cases, the full reactivation process is not required.) The full reactivation process: 1. The student must supply a new application, accompanied by the reactivation fee, official transcripts of any course work taken e lsewhere during the absence, current recommendations (number to be determined by the Office of Admissions), and an interview with a representative of the student's major department in the school. 2. Approval for reactivation is granted or denied by the major program faculty, and is officially recorded as reactivation in the minutes of the school's Admissions Committee. 3. The reactivated student comes under the requirements of the curriculum in effect at the time of first enrollment after reactivation. 4. The school 's Office of Admissions provides official notification of the student's status to the student, to the student's program office, and to University Records. TIME LIMIT FOR COMPL ETION OF DEGREE Master's degree The time lapse from first enrollment in a graduat e curriculum to the conferring of the master's degree may not exceed five years. Students who are unable to complete the M.P.H. degree within five years may be granted two one -year extensions. This is not automatic but must be initiated by student request and depends on evidence of appropriate progress. Student Handbook 255 Doctoral degree The time lapse from first enrollment in a doctoral curriculum to the conferring of the doctoral degree may not exceed seven years. Advancement to candidacy Maximum time allowed from first enr ollment in a doctoral degree program to advancement to candidacy is five years. Request for extension Any request for extension of the time limit for completion of the degree must be submitted to the school's Office of Academic Records. Such requests may b e considered on the basis of individual merit for one -year extensions, which may be granted two times. Reactivation Reactivation requests by students whose time limit has lapsed or will lapse before the degree can be completed are handled in a manner simil ar to that used for new applicants. The program director makes recommendations to the Assistant Dean and Associate Dean, indicating courses required \u2014including courses that need to be updated because they were taken too long ago. It is expected that the pro gram director will obtain counsel from instructors of such courses. If necessary, the student may be required to submit an extension of degree completion form which must be approved by the associate dean for academic affairs, and in some cases, the provos t. EFFECTIVE CURRICULUM Upon approval of the department, a student may choose to change to the curriculum outlined in any University CATALOG in effect during the time s/he is enrolled as an accepted student in the School of Public Health. To do so, s/he m ust fulfill all requirements listed in the CATALOG, including prerequisites, comprehensive examinations, culminating activities, and field practicum/experience. The existing policy regarding inactivation/reactivation still applies. That is, if the student has been on a leave of absence for more than one year, or failed to register for two or more quarters, s/he is required to reenter the program under the CATALOG in effect at the time of reentry. A request to change to a different effective curriculum must be submitted to the school's Office of Academic Records in a petition for academic variance. GRADUATION REQUIREME NTS General notation Students are expected to complete graduation requirements as stated in the School of Public Health section of the Universi ty CATALOG in effect at the time they enter the program, provided degree requirements have been met without interruption in residence. 256 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY Specific requirements A candidate for a degree shall have met the following conditions: completed all requirements for admission to a School of Public Health degree program; completed satisfactorily all requirements of the curriculum \u2014including required attendance, cumulative grade point average of 3.0 (exceptions may apply) computed separately for the total degree program and for required courses in the major area (for doctoral students, all specific course requirements are considered major courses), number of credit units, specific course and field instruction requirements, applicable comprehensive examination and culminat ing activity requirements, and length of academic residence; given evidence of moral character, of due regard for Christian citizenship, and of consistent responsiveness to the established aims of the University and the school; and discharged financial obl igations to the University. This includes meeting with the Office of Student Finance and the Student Loan Collection Office. Comprehensive examinations MASTER'S DEGREE PROG RAMS Although there is no general school requirement for a comprehensive examination for the master's degree, individual departments may require such special examinations. If required, the program director or academic advisor will be able to acquaint the student with the requirements and procedures. DOCTORAL DEGREE PROG RAMS Comprehensive and qualifying examinations are required for doctoral degrees. (See the University CATALOG School of Public Health for specific details.) Culminating activity A culminating activity is required of all M.P.H. degree students beginning their program since June 1, 1982. Individual programs may require different types of culminating activity. Diplomas All diplomas issued to School of Public Health graduates list the degree only. No official diploma is awarded that identifies the major(s). The official transcrip t identifies the specific area of specialization. The official date indicated on the diploma will be the last day of the quarter in which all requirements have been completed or the commencement date in Spring Quarter. Diplomas are distributed by Universit y Records by mail after it has been determined that all degree requirements have been satisfactorily met and financial obligations to the University have been discharged. Student Handbook 257 PARTICIPATION IN COM MENCEMENT EVENTS The University reserves the right to prohibit pa rticipation in commencement events by a candidate who has not satisfactorily complied with all requirements. Candidates may not participate in commencement events unless they have completed all degree requirements, including pre - and corequisites, with ex ceptions as specified in the University academic policy C -13. Doctoral degree candidates may participate in commencement events and have their names listed in the commencement program providing they have also met the deadlines for the dissertation defense specified in the most recent version of the Doctoral Handbook . 258 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY Awards and Honors Students demonstrating superior scholarship, professionalism, and promise of future contribution to the field of public health may be nominated for recognition in several ways .

Student Handbook 261 SECTION XIII SCHOOL OF RELIGION262 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY Dean's Welcome Dear Student: Welcome to the most unusual school of Loma Linda University. The School of Religion has three degree programs that associate areas in the sciences with religion, plus a Division of Humanities. However, the major task of the School of Religion remains enriching programs in the other seven schools of the University with a faith - based, wholistic approach to the health sciences. So, in whate ver program you have enrolled, you will come in contact with School of Religion offerings that have been uniquely designed to help you prepare for wholistic ministry within your chosen profession. Studying at Loma Linda University is about more than just careers and professions; it is about mission and purpose for all of life. The School of Religion is pleased to have an important role in helping to prepare you for the most fulfilling life and career possible. Since the School of Religion is the newest sch ool of the University, we have not yet found it necessary to establish school -specific student policies. The policies we follow are those listed for the University as a whole in the University CATALOG and this Student Handbook . Should your situation not be covered by these policies, contact our School of Religion director of student services at 909/651 -5849. If I can be of any help, my door is always open to you. May God enrich your studies. Sincerely, Jon Paulien, Ph.D. Dean Student Handbook 263 Academic Policies and Proced ures SCHOOL OF RELIGION \u20145 GOALS The faculty is deeply committed to incorporating, in diverse ways and to varying degrees, the following five goals into every single religion course: 1. Demonstrate knowledge and competent use of Scripture. 2. Show understanding of Christian theology and history, with specific attention to Seventh -day Adventist life and thought. 3. Explain the interaction between ethics and religious commitments and beliefs. 4. Explore the ways in which faith relates to personal wholeness, professional practice, and witness. 5. Describe ways in which moral advocacy can shape society. ACADEMIC INTEGRITY The School of Religion seeks to educate ethical and competent professionals and scholars who are committed to the practice of honesty and the pursuit of trut h. The school is committed to the following fundamental University core values: compassion, integrity, excellence, freedom, justice, purity/self -control, and humility. It is expected and understood that students who apply and are admitted to a School of Re ligion program will be committed to these values and will choose to support them. Examples of serious breaches of integrity include, but are not limited to, lying; cheating (including plagiarism); falsifying reports, records, and the results of research. Other examples which may appear to be minor but which constitute misrepresentations of truth, and are thus also of concern, include such things as signing someone else's name on an attendance sheet (for a required class or meeting) or signing oneself in as present and then leaving. Assuming responsibility for the professional behavior of one's colleagues means exemplifying integrity oneself; encouraging colleagues to be honest and responsible; and refusing to ignore or cover up serious breaches of integrity, such as cheating, stealing, or falsifying records. The process of becoming a member of one of these trusted professions begins when a student enters the Loma Linda University School of Religion. ACADEMIC DISHONESTY Academic dishonesty is an act of deliber ate deceit in the fulfillment of a student's obligations to the academic community. It includes, but is not limited to, the failure to observe rules of fairness in taking examinations or writing papers, plagiarism, fabrication, and cheating. Plagiarism is the act of presenting the work of another as if it were one's own. It includes quoting, paraphrasing, summarizing, or utilizing material from the Internet or from books, articles in periodicals, magazine and newspapers without appropriate citation. Any unacknowledged use of another's ideas constitutes plagiarism, including the use of 264 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY papers written by other students, interviews, radio or TV broadcasts, and any published or unpublished materials (e.g., letters, pamphlets, leaflets, notes, or documents). Fabrication is the act of contriving or making up material, data, or other information and submitting this as fact. Cheating is the act of receiving, which includes such acts as looking at another's examination during any form of testing, using unauthorized a ids (e.g., notes, electronic equipment) to retrieve or communicate information during examinations, or whatever else is deemed contrary to the rules of fairness, including violation of specific rules designated by the instructor of the course. Facilitation of academic dishonesty is the act of attempting to help someone engage in plagiarism, fabrication, cheating or any other type of academic dishonesty. PROCEDURES 1. If any faculty member, employee, or student of the school has reason to believe that academic dishonesty or unethical conduct may have occurred, s/he shall report the incident to the appropriate instructor, course director, dean, academic dean, or director of student services. 2. When an allegation of misconduct is made, the faculty member or school a dministrator is responsible to ensure that a preliminary inquiry is made to determine if the concern/allegation is substantive. If there appears to be substantive evidence of misconduct the matter must be reported to the dean or the dean's designee. 3. If the dean or dean's designee determines that further action should be taken and/or that the matter should be referred to the school's designated academic committee, the student shall be informed in writing. 4. The final action will be reported to the involved s tudent by the dean or dean's designee. APPEAL OF DISMISSAL 1. The student, after the actions and recommendations of the designated academic committee, may appeal to the dean who may uphold or modify the sanction(s) recommended by the hearing committee. In all cases, the action of the dean is final. 2. The dean, in sole discretion, shall determine whether the student is suspended pending the final decision of the appeal or if the student may continue to attend classes and/or conduct clinical activities. PROCEDURAL APPEAL If the student contends that the appropriate procedure was not followed or there is new evidence relevant to the decision that was not available to the student during the procedure, the student may make an appeal in writing to the provost or design ee regarding these two issues. If the provost finds that the appropriate procedure was not followed or there is new evidence the provost will return the issue to the school for additional consideration ( Administrative Handbook , C-26).

I Incomplete - given when the majority of the course work has been completed and circumstances beyond a student's control result in the student being unable to complete the quarter. An I notation may be changed to a grade only by the instructor before the end of the following term. Incomplete units are not calculated in the grade point average. By the use of the petition form - available online \u2014the stud ent requests an I notation from the instructor, stating the reason for the request. The instructor will then enter the I notation as well as the grade the student will receive if the deficiency is not removed within the time limit. The student must submit this form before the end of the quarter. The notation I is not granted as a remedy for overload, failure on final examinations, absence from final examination for other than an emergency situation, or a low grade to be raised with extra work. IP In Progres s - indicates that the course has a duration of more than a single term and will be completed by the student no later than the final term of the course, not to exceed five quarters for independent study and research courses (original quarter of registratio n plus four additional quarters). Note: A person who is not enrolled in regular classes but who is registered or has an IP grade in research, thesis or dissertation is classified as a student. By filing an academic load validation form every quarter at re gistration, the academic load may be validated for maintaining student status for immigration purpose or for deferring student loans. 266 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY FA Failure to Attend - indicates that the student registered for a course but failed to attend classes and did not withdra w from the course in a timely manner.

The School of Religion sends the approved petition for academic variance to University Records for processing. For further information, please call the Office of Student Services at 909/651 -5849. COUR SE LOAD To be considered a full -time student, a graduate student must be registered for at least 8 units of graduate course work per quarter. The normal course load, including all course work for which a graduate student may be registered at this or anothe r institution, is 12 units per quarter. A student of exceptional ability may, with the approval of the dean, register for additional course work. PROGRAM PROGRESSION Students are considered to be making acceptable academic progress if they are maintaining a cumulative G.P.A. of: Bioethics: B+ (3.30) - no grade lower than a C, with no grade lower than a B - in a core course.

Student Handbook 267 PROGRAM TIME LIMIT Completion of the graduate experience signals currency and competence in the discipline. The dynamic nature of graduate courses makes dilatory or even leisurely pursuit of the degree unacceptable. Five years are allowed for completion after admission to a master's degree program and seven years for a doctoral degree program. Petitions for an extension of time may be granted if recommended by the advisor or the guidance committee chair to the dean. Course credit allowed toward the master's degree is nullified seven years from the date of course completion, and course credit allowed toward the doctoral degre e is nullified after eight years from the date of course completion. GRADUATION POLICY Graduate candidates from all School of Religion programs must complete all course and non - course requirements before participating in the commencement exercises. All req uirements must be completed by the end of the spring quarter of the year the student plans to march. This means that students will not be able to march who are holding IPs, have not turned in their publishable paper/thesis, have not completed clinical inte rnships or comprehensives, or who have not performed the oral defense. PERSONAL LEAVE OF AB SENCE The school realizes that there are circumstances in a student's life that might require an interruption of her/his program for a short period. The student can petition the leave -of-absence by completing the leave of absence form through the student website. A leave -of-absence may be as short as one quarter but no longer than one year. The student should consult the School of Religion Office of Student Services regarding the possibility of maintaining health coverage while on leave of absence. If the student had health coverage through Risk Management, then s/he would be able to buy into the health plan on a quarterly basis for a maximum period of one year. Leav e-of-absence status does not extend the student's five -year (masters) or seven -year (doctoral) time limit for completion of a degree program ( Administrative Handbook , C-24). WITHDRAWAL FROM PROG RAM If the student finds it necessary to withdraw from a degre e or certificate program, it is the responsibility of the student to first inform the program director. The student then arranges for formal withdrawal from the program by filing an online program withdrawal form, which is available on the student services website. The program withdrawal form should be completed and submitted on the last day of class attendance. The date the program withdrawal form is properly submitted to University Records will be the date of withdrawal used to calculate tuition refunds. Failure to file the program withdrawal form may result in avoidable charges to the student's account. ADMINISTRATIVE WITHD RAWAL Students who fail to make arrangements for a leave of absence and/or continuing registration may be administratively withdrawn f rom school. University policy states: \"A student who has not enrolled for any classes, or paid the continuous registration fee for courses still in progress 268 LOMA LINDA UNIVERSITY from a previous term, will be inactivated at the beginning of the second quarter of nonenrollment, unless s/he is on an approved leave of absence.
