More and more families are discovering that periodic chiropractic checkups and adjustments promote health and healing without drugs and dangerous medical treatments. More and more people are turning away from symptom treatment and choosing natural ways of achieving and maintaining health. Tired of taking drugs? Welcome to the world of chiropractic - discover how natural health can be. Welcome to our patient newsletter This issue's table of contents - Why are people turning away from symptom treatment and choosing natural ways of healing? - Measles at a glance - Good fats/bad fats - McChicken - Researching chiropractic - Did you know? - Success Story - Humor - References Why are people turning away from symptom treatment and choosing natural ways of healing? What can be wrong with treating symptoms? On the surface it sounds great - being pain-free, no inflammation, no rash, no runny nose, no diarrhea, no vomiting, no aches, normal blood pressure, normal cholesterol - who doesn't want to feel good by simply taking a pill, rubbing on an ointment or otherwise using an artificial chemical? But there's a big down side to artificially being symptom free. For one thing symptoms are how your body tells you there is something wrong. Symptoms are like a fire alarm alerting you to trouble. Taking drugs to get rid of symptoms is like breaking the alarm. The cause - the \"fire\" - will continue to smolder and burn. The cause is not being addressed. Symptoms are also how your body heals. Fever helps kill bacteria and viri, a rash is how the body externalizes poisons, diarrhea helps expel toxins, cholesterol fights inflammation, blood pressure is a response to stress and dehydration and the list goes on and on. The body has wisdom, and the goal of all healers is to work with that wisdom rather than try to interfere with what the body is trying to do. For example, there is research showing that children who have had fevers and rashes have less cancer as an adult. The study consistently revealed a lower cancer risk for patients with a history of febrile infectious childhood diseases. (1) Respecting and working with the body, using expressive (chiropractic, homeopathy, naturopathy, aroma therapy, etc.) care rather than suppressive (medical) care is the best way to guarantee a healthier life for you and your family. Measles at a glance Which is more dangerous, measles or the measles vaccine? There were many cases of measles that occurred in Disneyland in California recently. As a result there is a big push for immunizations. However before running out to get a measles shot the following should be known: Number of measles deaths in the US in the past ten years according to the centers for Disease Control (CDC): 0 (zero, nada, none). Number of deaths from the measles vaccine in the past ten years: 108 (and that may be a fraction of the real number due to serious under-reporting of vaccine deaths and injuries by MDs) Now the question - which is more dangerous? Measles or the measles shot? Measles is a benign (harmless) condition that provides life-long immunity and protection against chronic illness. Contracting and overcoming childhood diseases are part of a developmental process that actually helps develop a healthy, robust, adult immune system able to meet the challenges that inevitable encounters with viruses and bacteria will present later on. (2) Natural measles is safer and more effective than the measles shot. Deaths from the measles dropped nearly 98% before the vaccine was introduced. (3) Why would any parents let their child get a dangerous vaccine that is linked to autism, allergies, asthma, learning disorders, skin problems, encephalitis and death? They would do it only if they didn't know this or were forced into doing it. By the way, here's a graph showing how measles deaths dropped 98% BEFORE the vaccine was introduced. The vaccine had nothing to do with the drop in measles mortality. A wonderful article on the subject of childhood vaccinations by F. Edward Yazbak, MD can be found at [http://www.vaccinationnews.org/In-Perspective-Exemptions-and-Health-2015-YazbakFE](http://www.vaccinationnews.org/In-Perspective-Exemptions-and-Health-2015-YazbakFE). Good fats/bad fats Low fat diets and bad fats are killing people. Our bodies need lots of good fats or they don't function properly. People that consume good fats are thinner, have more energy and are healthier; but you need to make sure you are getting good fats and avoiding bad fats. Here's a partial list: Avoid bad fats Bad fats create inflammation, damage your heart and are linked to cancer as well as many other chronic illnesses. If anything in your refrigerator or pantry has any of the following do yourself and your family a favor and dump them in the garbage: - Hydrogenated oils - Partially hydrogenated oils - Cottonseed, soybean, canola and vegetable oils - Trans-fats - Especially avoid margarine or butter oil \"spreads\" or \"blends\" Choose good fats Good fats promote health and healing. Good (saturated) fats include: - Butter (especially from raw milk and grass-fed cows) - Olive oil (virgin and cold pressed) - Coconut oil - Fish oil (smaller fish such as herring, sardines, etc. are best) - Avocados - Good quality tallow, lard and other animal fats from grass-fed, pastured (not factory farmed) animals - Some of the best fats come from bone broth that draws out the nutrients in the marrow. (4) McChicken (edited) From The Douglas Report by William Campbell Douglass II, M.D. [http://douglassreport.com/2015/03/09/mcdonalds-2/](http://douglassreport.com/2015/03/09/mcdonalds-2/) Most \"McChicken\" products such as the \"crispy chicken\" and the infamous McNuggets contain dozens of ingredients, only one of which is actually chicken. These include autolyzed yeast extract to trick your brain into believing you're eating something delicious and not some awful McThing. Autolyzed yeast extract is related to MSG. The oil McDonald's uses is a blend of soy, corn and canola that is so volatile they need to add an anti-splattering agent called dimethylpolysiloxane, presumably to keep McDonald's workers from going to the ER with third-degree burns. It's not easy to replace the guy at the fry basket mid-shift, you know. But you won't just find dimethylpolysiloxane in food. You'll also find it in a few other places... like Silly Putty... The cooking oil also contains tertiary butylhydroquinone, aka tBHQ, which is made from petroleum and is known to cause nausea, vomiting, delirium and more. So don't be fooled by PR campaigns and hype over a single ingredient. It was garbage yesterday, it's garbage today and it'll still be garbage tomorrow - and the only time to eat garbage is never. Researching Chiropractic There seems to be no end to the conditions that respond to chiropractic care - physical as well as psychological conditions. That is because chiropractic does not \"treat\" a particular condition. Chiropractic care \"treats\" or, more accurately, \"corrects\" a serious interference to brain, nervous system and energy function known as the subluxation. No matter what condition you or a loved one may have, you and they will always function better when free from subluxations. Chiropractors are uniquely trained to locate and correct subluxations. Enjoy this month's cases and see more next month. Trigeminal neuralgia - last resort. A ten-year-old male was diagnosed with trigeminal neuralgia (TN) by a pediatric neurologist. The boy's mother took him to a chiropractor as a last resort. TN is referred to as the \"suicide disease\" because the intense pain has sometimes driven sufferers to take their own lives. In the past the boy had suffered from intense headaches, earaches, neck pain and extreme facial pain. He was prescribed medications by a neurologist with no overall relief. Chiropractic care consisted of upper cervical (upper neck subluxation correction) care. As his upper cervical subluxation was corrected his symptoms improved significantly. After 7 months of care he was symptom free. A follow up appointment one and a half years later showed him to be symptom free. (5) Shoulder pain. A 73-year-old female presented with a chief complaint of shoulder pain of one-year duration. She reported burning pain at the left shoulder joint. Tylenol\u00ae provided only temporary and minor relief. An MRI (magnetic resonance image) of her cervical spine revealed nerve impingement and some degenerative changes. She was medically diagnosed with brachial neuritis (arm pain) and cervicalgia (neck pain). The patient was cared for with spinal adjustments, and following 11 visits over 2\u00bd months she was pain free with improved functioning and quality of life as measured by the Upper Extremity Functional Index and Bournemouth Neck Pain questionnaires. (6) Did you know? It has been shown in studies that babies delivered by C-section have more of a predisposition to asthma, allergies, and autoimmune diseases later in childhood. (7-8) Success Story SEVERE SHOULDER PAIN AND SCIATICA I originally went to see Dr. Horning 3\u00bd years ago for pain in my right shoulder. I was unable to lift my right arm above my shoulder and the pain made performing routine daily activities difficult. My X-rays revealed a pinch nerve and degenerated disks. After four weeks of treatment, my shoulder was like new and the pain was completely gone. Next, Dr. Horning went on to stop the radiating pain I had in my leg due to my Sciatica. I was amazed because this was something I had suffered with since I was 13 years old. Unbelievably, I am now able to jog which is just one of the few things Sciatica had prevented me from doing for years. Recently, I started to feel that severe pain again, however, this time it was in my left shoulder. Once again, simple daily activities were accompanied with severe pain and discomfort until finally, they became almost impossible. Even sleeping was a challenge, as I was unable to find a comfortable position where my shoulder was not in agony. Just the sheer weight of my arm was incredibly painful. However, the worst part for me was the pain kept me from exercising, something that I could not have imagined my life without. At the advice of Dr. Horning, I got an X-ray which revealed that there were large masses of calcium buildup in the ligaments of my shoulder joint, causing it to become extremely inflamed. Within just four weeks, Dr. Horning was once again able to eliminate all the pain in my shoulder. I can go about my day without any pain and I finally have full mobility of my arm again. Best of all, I am able to exercise again. I had a few people tell me that I would need several cortisone shots and months of physical therapy in order to fix my shoulder. However, I am happy to say I am pain free and it was all done without one cortisone shot or PT session. I truly do not know what I would have done without Dr. Horning. If you put your trust in Dr. Horning and follow his advice, I am certain that he WILL help you. He is unlike any other doctor or chiropractor I have ever known. I am now on a four to six week maintenance program with Dr. Horning and I have never felt better! Thank you, Dr. Horning!!! DR Humor A Short History of Medicine 2000 BCE: \"Here, eat this root.\" 1000 this is superstition, drink this potion.\" 1940 AD: \"That potion is snake oil, swallow this pill.\" 1985 AD: \"That pill is ineffective, take this antibiotic.\" 2000 AD: \"That antibiotic is artificial. Here, eat this root.\" Author unknown Getting Older A distraught senior citizen phoned her doctor's office. \"Is it true,\" she wanted to know, \"that the medication you prescribed has to be taken for the rest of my life?\" \"'Yes, I'm afraid so,\"' the doctor told her. There was a moment of silence before the senior lady replied, \"I'm wondering, then, just how serious is my condition because this prescription is marked 'NO REFILLS'.\" An older gentleman was on the operating table awaiting surgery and he insisted that his son, a renowned surgeon, perform the operation. As he was about to get the anesthesia, he asked to speak to his son. \"Yes, Dad, what is it?\" \"Don't be nervous, son; do your best, and just remember, if it doesn't go well, if something happens to me, your mother is going to come and live with you and your wife....\" Aging: Eventually you will reach a point when you stop lying about your age and start bragging about it. Two guys, one old, one young, are pushing their carts around WalMart when they collide. The old guy says to the young guy, \"Sorry about that. I'm looking for my wife, and I guess I wasn't paying attention to where I was going.\" The young guy says, \"That's OK, it's a coincidence. I'm looking for my wife, too...I can't find her and I'm getting a little desperate.\" The old guy says, \"Well, maybe I can help you find her...what does she look like?\" The young guy says, \"Well, she is 27 years old, tall, with red hair, blue eyes, is buxom...wearing no bra, long legs, and is wearing short shorts. What does your wife look like?' \"Doesn't matter, let's look for yours.\" References - Albonico HU, Braker HU, Husler J.
