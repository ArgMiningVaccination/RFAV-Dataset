About Lung Cancer Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. In the United States, NSCLC accounts for 75-80% of all lung cancers. Although progress has been made in recent years, the majority of patients with advanced stage lung cancer still die from their disease. New treatments are needed. Precision cancer medicines continues to impact the lives of lung cancer patients with research into genomics and genetics leading to unprecedented progress in improving outcomes. Tailored treatments have emerged to match a person's genetic makeup or a tumor's genetic profile. As a result, patients with lung cancer now typically receive molecular testing that guides their physicians in determining which therapies are more likely to boost the chances of survival while limiting the potential for adverse effects. Results from studies evaluating immune-modulatory approaches using anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies have demonstrated promising results and are advancing the standard of care for lung cancer. About Keytruda Checkpoint Inhibitors Keytruda belongs to a new class of medicines called \"checkpoint inhibitors.\" Checkpoint inhibitors are a novel precision cancer immunotherapy that helps to restore the body's immune system in fighting cancer by releasing checkpoints that cancer uses to shut down the immune system. PD-1 and PD-L1 are proteins that inhibit certain types of immune responses, allowing cancer cells to evade detection and attack by certain immune cells in the body. A checkpoint inhibitor can block the PD-1 and PD-L1 pathway and enhance the ability of the immune system to fight cancer. By blocking the binding of the PD-L1 ligand these drugs restore an immune cells' ability to recognize and fight the colon cancer cells. A diagnostic test to measure the level of PD-L1 is available. For the KEYNOTE-407 clinical trial a total of 559 patients with untreated metastatic squamous NSCLC were enrolled and treated with either keytruda plus chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone and directly compared. At the time of interim analysis, 204 participants were available for analyses and the average duration of survival was improved to 15.9 months for the Keytruda treated patients compared to only 11.3 months for chemotherapy alone.

There is no doubt in my mind that this benefits patients and that we need to adopt this starting today, if available,\" said Dr. Aggarwal.
