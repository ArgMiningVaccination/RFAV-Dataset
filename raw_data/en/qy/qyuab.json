Introduction: About a year ago, I attended a Reiki Spiritual Retreat in Mount Shasta. To be honest, I wasn't sure what to expect nor did I know exactly what I was in for. A good friend of mine is a Reiki Practioner and insisted I attended the three-day retreat with her. I didn't think much of it, I was in a dark place and I wanted to find myself again, so I agreed to go. By the end of the retreat, I had learned a lot about Reiki Healing which is form of alternative healing therapy also known as energy healing. A lot of people are not aware of this form of therapy. So today I will discuss what Reiki Energy is, how and why Reiki is used, and how it has become an alternative form of therapy for patients with ongoing diseases. Transition: First I will define what Reiki means. I.Reiki is an energy healing treatment that works holistically; on the whole body, mind, and spirit. The purpose of a Reiki treatment is to relieve stress and pain, induce relaxation, release emotional blockage and accelerate natural healing. A.The word Reiki (RAY-KEY) also known as \"universal life energy\", is made of two Japanese words. 1.Rei - which means \"universal life\" 2.Ki - which means \"energy\" B.Reiki was rediscovered in the mid 1800's by a Japanese Buddhist Monk, Dr. Usui. 1.Dr. Usui was determined to learn the secret of energy healing so that he may help others. a. According to The International Center for Reiki Training,during his journey, Dr. Usui travelled to the holy mountains of Kori Yama where he fasted and meditated for 21 days in order to attain a high altered state of consciousness which he believed would empower him with healing energy.
