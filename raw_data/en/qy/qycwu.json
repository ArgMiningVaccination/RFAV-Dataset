If you have deep, mild aches in your arms and legs that just won't seem to go away, you may benefit from this lotion. As our body's natural \"vacuum,\" the lymphatic system gathers up dead cells, bacteria, and more. It eliminates all the junk when it's working properly. However, our lymphatic system doesn't have a natural pump so sometimes fluid gets stuck. This causes swelling, uncomfortable aches and pains and can even lead to headaches, low immunity, and gut health issues. The ingredients in Lymphatic Cream gently but effectively encourage drainage to help get fluid moving and bring relief.
