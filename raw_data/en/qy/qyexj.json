The new Institute is equipped with state-of-the-art analytical equipment, and staffed by experts from diverse disciplines who, working together, will increase scientific rigor in the study of herbs while honoring the traditional knowledge at the base of modern herbal medicine. It's a place where cutting edge phytochemical analysis is guided by deep ethnobotanical wisdom. \"The herbal industry is often criticized for the lack of evidence in botanical medicine,\" says Bill Chioffi, VP of Strategic Partnerships & Business Development at the Institute, reflecting on mainstream medicine's reflexive dismissal of herbs. \"That's why elevating the research and engaging future naturopaths, medical doctors, and natural products companies is so important.\" Funded by an unrestricted grant from Ric Scalzo, founder of the popular brand, Gaia Herbs, the Institute's 4,385 square foot lab facility features a complete phytochemical characterization lab featuring liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technology for identification and quantification, as well as preparatory high-performance liquid chromatography, and low, medium, and high-pressure chromatographic separation instruments. The Institute also has a molecular biology lab equipped with a darkroom for immunoflouorescent spectrometry, and a full suite of analytical technology for bioassays, including real time PCR, Elisa, Western Blot, and transcriptome profiling. The Institute is licensed as a Biosafety Level 2 lab (BSL-2) for its viral culture lab, in which researchers can test the effects of various herbs against a host of human pathogens including MRSA, Borrelia, Influenza, Coronaviruses, Herpes, HIV, and others. Jeffrey Langland, PhD, Director of Research at the center, is a molecular biologist/virologist, with decades of experience in both academia and pharmaceutical development. Consequently, molecular biology and pre-clinical basic research figure strongly into the new institute's agenda. Langland and his core team, which includes six PhDs, three ND-herbalists, and a pharmacist are working to elucidate the biochemical mechanisms by which phytochemicals exert their effects on human or microbial physiology. Why do certain botanical compounds disrupt viral replication or kill certain bacteria? How do cannabinoids modulate pain? What drives the adverse effects seen with some herbs? How do phytochemicals affect human metabolism? In answering questions like these, they hope to provide quantitative validation of traditional botanical medicine, Ayurveda, Chinese medicine, and modern naturopathy, while at the same time nurturing development of new and truly evidence-based herbal combinations. \"The herbal industry is often criticized for the lack of evidence in botanical medicine. That's why elevating the research is so important.\" Bill Chioffi, VP of Strategic Partnerships & Business Development, Ric Scalzo institute for Botanical Research The Scalzo Institute is part of the research department at SCNM. The college's clinical faculty provides guidance, and the institute offers opportunities for SCNM students to participate in research projects. Simultaneously, the school's on-site clinics will be sites for human pilot studies that can lay the groundwork for larger clinical studies. Scalzo Institute researchers have undertaken projects across a wide range of clinical themes, including: Phytochemical composition of commonly used medicinal herbs Impact of herbs on viral infections, including influenza, rhinovirus, herpes, papillomavirus, and coronavirus How herbs affect bacterial pathogens, as well as the normal microbiome Botanical interactions with the human immune system Elucidation of mechanisms of action for herbs that relieve pain, anxiety, and stress Validation of the in vitro activity of specific Cannabis chemovars Beneficial and Harmful Herb-Drug Interactions The goal, Chioffi says, is to focus on topics relevant to human, and in some cases, animal health. Among the team's main objectives is to publish in prominent peer-reviewed journals, to present research at scientific conferences, and to educate scientists, practitioners, and the general public. Beyond academia, there's also a vision for translating basic research into useful products through partnerships with natural products companies. Chioffi says the Institute is developing multi-year research contracts with leading botanical supplement makers with the goal of developing evidence-based, patentable, and when appropriate, IP-protected ingredients and formulations. With its emphasis on interdisciplinary collaboration, and its \"petri dish to patient care\" scope, the Scalzo Institute shares common features with the Nutrition Innovation Center established by Standard Process in Kannapolis, NC, several years ago. Hot Projects In its first year of operation, the Institute has already launched a number of projects many of which have led to clinically significant findings. Bioactive Constituents in Echinacea & Potential Interactions with Pharmaceutical Ingredients: Plants in the genus Echinacea produce compounds that induce or inhibit cytochrome enzymes, P-glycoprotein, organic ions, and other transporter molecules. At the Institute, Susan Trapp, PhD & Narges Kiyani PhD, have been assessing how Echinacea-derived phytochemicals affect metabolism of commonly used drugs For example, some Echinacea extracts can inhibit cytochrome P2A1, which will increase blood concentrations of caffeine when the herb is taken concomitantly with caffeine-containing beverages. Cyclosporine, which has a narrow therapeutic window, is metabolized by several enzymes affected by Echinacea-derived compounds; therefore, it is best to avoid using Echinacea when taking this drug. But other drugs, like prednisone and azithromycin are not affected by this herb. To some extent the effect of Echinacea on drug metabolism depends on which part of the plant is used for the extract; roots seem to produce more compounds that affect cytochromes and transporter proteins than aerial parts. Combatting Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria with Propolis: Researchers Daniel Clark & Melissa Bellman have been studying the antimicrobial properties of propolis, the sticky resinous substance bees produce to maintain the structural integrity of their hives. Propolis also keeps hives pathogen-free, and it has long been promoted for human immune system support. Though propolis is not a botanical in the strict sense, its biochemical composition derives largely from the plants on which the bees feed. Phytochemical constituents can vary widely from region to region. The SCNM researchers tested 100% ethanol extractions of propolis from several US states, as well as from Canada, Russia, Brazil, Lithuania, Greece, Ukraine, and Bulgaria against three troublesome bugs: methicillin resistant Staphylococcus dose level, propolis resulted in a one million-fold reduction in colonies of MRSA. With drug-resistent Klebsiella, a 30-microliter dose of propolis resulted in a 10 million-fold bacterial reduction, the SCNM team reports. The Pseudomonas strain, which was resistant to ampicillin, cephalosporin, nitrofurantonin, and other drugs, was tougher. But it was still susceptible to the propolis extract. At a 30-microliter dose, there was a 1,000-fold drop in bacterial colonies. That might seem modest compared to the near eradication of MRSA and Klebsiella, but it is more or less the same level of antimicrobial activity as advertised for common hand sanitizer products. The propolis extracts had similar activity against antibiotic-sensitive strains of the same pathogens. Though this work is still very pre-clinical, it does have important implications given that 2.8 million people are affected with antibiotic-resistant bacteria every year, and roughly 35,000 die from them. Botanical Synergies for SARS-CoV-2 Infection: Dr. Langland, who had considerable vaccine development experience prior to entering botanical research, heads a large project to screen herbs with potential antiviral properties, especially those that might be useful in combatting SARS-CoV-2. Drawing largely from the Asian medical literature on use of herbs to treat the virus responsible for the 2004 SARS epidemic, he and his team compiled a list of 40 potential candidates that might be able to either directly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 or improve immune defenses. It included widely known herbs like Angelica, Artemisia, Camellia, Ginger, Cinnamon, as well as other less common ones. Since the SCNM lab is not cleared to handle highly pathogenic viruses like SARS-CoV-2, Langland and colleagues collaborated with Arizona State University, which has a BSL-3 level lab. For each of the plants in question, the researchers first tested 20% to 70% ethanol extracts in cell toxicity assays, to look at effects on healthy human cell cultures. This determines basic safety: if exposure to high doses of an herb has little effect on healthy cell cultures one can presume the herb is not cytotoxic to normal cells. This was followed by viral plaque assays in which they apply the herbal extracts to cultures infected with SARS-CoV-2, to determine if the herbs can mitigate viral replication and spread. \"What we want to see is little (cyto)toxicity at high doses, but very low doses required for inhibition of virus replication,\" Langland said. This Selectivity Index\u2014a simple division of the cytotoxic dose by the viral inhibitory dose\u2014\"is really the best measure we have to evaluate a drug or botanical extract for in vitro antimicrobial effects.\" \"Our goal is to use botanicals to target different steps in the replication process, to create a truly synergistic blend for inhibiting replication of these viruses.\" -Jeffrey Langland, PhD, Director of Research, Ric Scalzo Institute for Botanical Research Most of the herbs on the original list turned out not to be effective antivirals. But five stood Salvia miltiorriza (Red sage). All were highly effective in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2, with little cellular toxicity in normal cells. Some had broad spectrum activity against other coronavirus types as well. Based on previously published work, the SCNM researchers identified proposed target sites and mechanisms by which these five herbs most likely exert their effects. Camellia, and Salvia appear to interfere with viral attachment to host cells. Chrysanthemum, Scutellaria, and Houttuynia inhibit viral transcription, enzymes in the replication process, or protein processing. This raises the question of synergy: Can several herbs be combined to amplify the antiviral effect? In most of the world's longstanding botanical traditions, that's how herbs are used\u2014in combination, not as single agents. The short answer is, Yes. Langland's team developed a core combination, and then added various fourth herbs, assessing the combinations against SARS-CoV-2. They found they could markedly increase the inhibitory effects\u2014sometimes by as much as five-fold over what would be predicted based on the profiles of the individual herbs. \"Our goal is to use botanicals to target different steps in the replication process, to create a truly synergistic blend for inhibiting replication of these viruses,\" he said. Artemisia annua (Wormwood) is another herb under intensive research at SCNM. Used widely worldwide to treat malaria, extracts of this herb are proving to be highly effective against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. The effects are partially attributable to Artemisinin, a bioactive compound isolated from this plant in 1972 by Prof. Youyou Tu of the China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medical Sciences. For her discoveries, Dr. Tu was awarded the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Dr. Langland stressed that Artemisia produces many other compounds aside from artemisinin that may also contribute to its antiviral effects. As SCNM's researchers forge on with their projects, the Scalzo Institute is poised to become a major worldwide hub for the discovery and development of novel herbal formulas. Though none are yet ready for clinical prime-time, the potential is very clear. Why are some plants-and the substances derived from them-beloved and broadly-embraced, while others are vilified, restricted, and viewed with suspicion? The reflexive answer might be: Some are dangerous, while others are beneficial. But if you take a deeper look, it's seldom so simple. As an herbalist, I am prone to questions like this. And lately, I've been thinking a lot about the unique and different fates of Hops (Humulus lupulus) and Hemp (Cannabis sativa)-two widely cultivated and distributed plants here in the US, and abroad. Many people don't know that these two are related. They belong to the same plant family, Cannabaceae, and of the higher order Urticales. Let's think of them as sisters sharing similar genetics and traits. Hemp and hops both have flowers that we humans have used\u2014and abused\u2014owing to their calming and intoxicating effects. The flowering parts of Humulus lupulus and Cannabis sativa both produce trichomes containing resinous substances, and over the centuries, we have cultivated and bred both of them for specific morphological traits or organoleptic characteristics. But from a legal and regulatory perspective, these two sisters have been treated very differently here in the United States and in other parts of the world. Divergent Histories For the last 150 or so years, up until very recently, cannabis has suffered stigmatization, criminalization, and scorn in the US, while its sister\u2014Hops-on the other hand, has long been a key component in a multi-billion-dollar legal consumer alcoholic beverage market. Beer would not be beer without hops. The alpha acids in hops flowers, especially humulone, and the sesquiterpene, humulene, are the main phytochemicals studied in beer. They minimize the growth of unwanted bacteria, regulate foam production, and give beer its characteristic aroma and flavor. Compounds within Hops also have a calming effect, though this is not generally the reason for including them in beer recipes. The German government's Commission E \u2014an internationally recognized authority on the evidence-based use of medicinal plants\u2014approved the use of hops for mood disturbances such as restlessness and anxiety as well as sleep disturbances. Though not as widely known as Chamomile (Matricaria camomillia), Valerian (Valeriana officinalis), and other plants with calming effects, is not unusual to find hops in herbal formulations that \"support a good night's rest.\" As a commercial crop, hops have a welcome place in the nation's economy, as well as it's pantry. Unlike its botanical sister, this member of the Cannabaceae family has never been marginalized or criminalized. Hemp's Rise and Fall Hemp was not always frowned upon. In fact, it was central to the economy of the early US. During the colonial period, and up until the Civil War era, hemp was widely cultivated as a fiber crop. It was essential for making fabric, rope, twine, and sails. \"The record stands that throughout the 125 odd years elapsing from the entrance of the Anglo-Saxon farmers into the wilderness down to the present time, a few counties of Kentucky have furnished army and navy, the entire country, with all but a small part of the native hemp consumed.\" It took roughly 120,000 pounds of hemp fiber to rig the USS Constitution, aka \"Old Ironsides,\" and that's not including the sails and the caulking, which were also made from hemp. But by the middle of the 1800s, hemp fiber was largely supplanted by cotton, and hemp-based agriculture suffered a long, slow decline. It no longer had the same industrial impact, though its resinous flowers and leaves were certainly valued by many for their psychoactive properties. Hops, Hemp & the ECS The flowers of Cannabis sativa L. (Hemp) produce a Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and Cannibidiol (CBD) are certainly the best known and most popular. They've also recently been adopted into the manufacturing standards for botanical preparations of hemp, which have become extremely popular with consumers and practitioners. But there's far more to this plant than just THC and CBD. Cannabinoid research is booming worldwide, as investigators discover more about these compounds and their receptors within the human nervous system. Both hemp and hops produce compounds that love to interface with the human endocannabinoid system (ECS), and we are learning more and more about the ECS every day as manufacturers and scientists' race to understand this gateway to so many other major biochemical and physiological systems. These two sisters also produce a variety of interesting mono- and sesquiterpene compounds. Myrcene and beta-pinene are found in both hemp and hop buds. These chemicals give both plants their distinctive aroma. Other shared terpenoids include humulene and beta-caryophyllene. In the characteristic flowery prose of his era, James Lane Allen describes this olfactory phenomenon: \"And now, borne far through the steaming air floats an odor, balsamic, startling: the odor of those plumes and stalks and blossoms from which is exuding freely the narcotic resin of the great nettle. The nostril expands quickly, the lungs well out deeply to draw it in: fragrance once known in childhood, ever in the memory afterward and able to bring back to the wanderer homesick thoughts of midsummer days in the shadowy, many-toned woods, over into which is blown the smell of hemp fields.\" From Commerce to Criminalization The criminalization of cannabis began in the early 1900s. The crop had dwindling value for fiber, but it remained somewhat popular for recreational and medicinal use\u2014in certain communities. By 1906, various states began redefining Cannabis sativa as a drug and/or poison, and by the 1920s, many states prohibited the cultivation, possession, and personal use of cannabis. Then came the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937, a nationwide move which levied heavy taxes on the sale of cannabis, also known as \"Indian hemp\" back then. The legislation was spearheaded by Henry J. Anslinger, the first commissioner of the US Treasury Department's Federal Bureau of Narcotics. Anslinger was a prohibitionist firebrand who laid the groundwork for the so-called \"War on Drugs\" that continues today. He was no friend of alcohol, but he had a special contempt for cannabis\u2014and the people who used it. In radio PR campaigns described it as: \"the deadly, dreadful poison that racks and tears not only the body, but the very heart and soul of every human being who once becomes a slave to it in any of its cruel and devastating forms. ... Marihuana is a short cut to the insane asylum. Smoke marihuana cigarettes for a month and what was once your brain will be nothing but a storehouse of horrid specters. Hasheesh makes a murderer who kills for the love of killing out of the mildest mannered man who ever laughed at the idea that any habit could ever get him.\" It is interesting to note that at the time, the Marihuana Tax Act was opposed by the American Medical Association because the tax applied to physicians and pharmacists who prescribed and dispensed cannabis and its derivatives. But the tax had powerful allies, including business magnate Andrew Mellon, newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst, and the DuPont family. Hearst was not pleased about the development of the decorticator\u2014a device that mechanically stripped hemp fiber from its stem, a job that previously had to be done by hand. A re-emergent hemp industry that could easily produce hemp paper was a threat to his holdings in timber for wood pulp. The DuPonts were heavily invested in developing synthetic fibers like nylon. The possibility of a re-emergent hemp fiber industry did not appeal to them. Mellon, who was Secretary of the Treasury at the time, was heavily invested in the DuPont company. Facing Racism Business interests drove the tax, but the cultural vilification of cannabis as incited by Anslinger and his allies, was driven by a different motive: racism. Historically, use of cannabis was common among people of African, Latin American, and Asian descent, and it has a long tradition of medical and recreational use in many parts of Africa, Asia, South and Central America, and the Caribbean. But unlike beer and other forms of alcohol made from fermented grains, cannabis was never part of the cultural heritage of Northern Europe. To the dominant US culture\u2014White and of Northern European descent\u2014use of cannabis was \"other.\" It belonged to the dark-skinned people. In his book, Allen points out that the Anglo-Saxon hemp farmers of Kentucky had no interest in the flowers and leaves of the plant, pointing out that: \"the whole top being thus otherwise wasted\u2014that part of the hemp which every year the dreamy millions of the Orient still consume in quantities beyond human computation and for the love of which the very history of this plant is lost in the antiquity of India and Persia, it's home\u2014land of narcotics and desires and dreams.\" The criminalization of cannabis went hand in hand with the stigmatization, marginalization, and criminalization of African-Americans, Latin Americans, and Asian and Southern European immigrants. Hops, the sister Cannabacean, also produces mildly intoxicating compounds. But nobody ever went to jail for cultivation or possession of hops. Anslinger and the early drug warriors tried hard to make a public health case for criminalization, insisting that cannabis was a dangerous, addictive drug that destroyed health and predisposed people to violent crime. Some physicians at the time, including the AMA's own attorney, Dr. William Creighton Woodward, refuted Anslinger's claims as unscientific and nonsensical. They were largely ignored. Winds of Change Today, one would be hard-pressed to convince anyone that cannabis use is inherently more dangerous or \"criminal\" than drinking beer. But hemp in all its forms still carries a stigma that hops never had. Currently, hemp has three approved uses as an ingestible substance in the US: Hulled Hemp Seed Oil (GRN778) and hemp Seed Protein (GRN771). The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (S.3042), enacted by the 115th Congress of the United States in 2017-2018 and referred to as the Farm Bill, defines and permits the cultivation of industrial hemp (low-THC producing cannabis), but defers regulatory authority to the individual states. All over the US, the rules are in flux. Industry trade groups have coalesced to persuade FDA to deliver clear policy guidelines. Laws governing the medical and recreational use of high-THC cannabis, and even low-THC cannabidiol (CBD), are highly variable from state to state. The one exception is Epidiolex, a prescription CBD product approved by the FDA in 2018 for treatment of certain types of epilepsy. But as more states legalize cannabis, it is clear that attitudes are changing. Though many Americans still view cannabis with suspicion, it is not nearly the dangerous \"other\" that it was portrayed to be in the 1930s and 1940s. I don't think it is coincidence that the increasing acceptance of cannabis is happening at the same time as our collective reckoning with the ongoing legacy of racism, and with issues of ethnic and cultural diversity. Both are movements in the direction of healing, inclusion, and the righting of historical wrongs. We can envision the day when hemp rejoins its sister, hops, as an ordinary crop free of stigma. Likewise, we can envision\u2014and work toward\u2014a future in which all people, regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, or gender are safe, respected, and treated fairly under the law.
