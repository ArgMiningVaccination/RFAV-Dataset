His books are semi academical and semi non-fictional. All of his books carry awesome informative along with the necessary botanical background. His reach to his readers is also good, he has always acknowledged our reviews and questions related to his books in the past. So it was obvious that we would be checking his latest book. Unlike Sudhir's previous books, which usually start with herb history and spice route/trade, this book is well planned. The author has taken the first chapter to explain to readers how content is designed and divided. Sudhir has covered 3 major natural/herbal trends in this book, Ayurveda, Tibetan Medicin, and Traditional Chinese Medicine. Based on these three major methodologies author has divided book in 4 parts. In the first part, he has properly explained each method's fundamental principles. This part helps to understand how these methodologies work in a holistic manner. The second section of the book (which covers 40% portion) is about actual herb's and their usage. The 3rd part covers various Yoga techniques that one can use to stay healthy physically & mentally. The last part is the most serious one, it is a bibliography section, where botanical part of herbs was discussed. My observation about the book 1) Easy to follow language usage 2) A wonderful compilation of Ayurveda, TCM and Tibetan medicine 3) Got to know many things to prevent or avoid cancer-related issues 4) More informative less academic (reverse to Sudhir's previous book) 5) Few chapters seem too generic. More information could have been given to increase the value proposition to readers 6) My most favorite section was the 3rd one, where each Yoga-Asana was provided with illustration, technique, and word of caution Overall a recommended serious read to know about alternate (natural) ways to help cancer patients. Ayurveda, in simple terms is about learning how to cleanse our tissues, organs and mind. Vannoy Gentles Fite writes that 'for every illness or ailment known to man, God has a plant out here that will heal it. We just need to keep discovering the properties for natural healing.' The book 'Natural solutions for cancer' written by Sudhir Ahluwalia goes a step forward and besides giving us an overview of cancer and the role of plants, explains us at length the various systems of alternative medicine that exist and how they can all come together to solve issues that have been a source of a lot of pain for us. The author points out that 'a total of 1.74 million new cases of cancer and 0.61 million deaths from cancer occurred in the United States in 2016' and that this should be reason enough to pay attention to all that a carefully structured diet can help. According to the author all ayurvedic formulations can have 75-80 percent plant-based ingredients, 10-15 percent may be from animal sources, and 10 percent could be made up of metals and minerals. This science is vital for us because so far as cancer is concerned, it is chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery that continue to be the dominant treatment modes today. This book with its nearly 600 pages is a virtual treasure for those who want to understand Ayurveda that literally means knowledge of life and is regarded as the fifth branch of the Vedas that 'gives it a certain degree of religious sanctity'. Plants, as we already know, have been a major source of medicinal molecules and these include turmeric, red chili, ginger, fennel, kokum, fenugreek, black cumin, among others that are said to have chemicals that prevent cancer. You may not have heard of these chemicals, but curcumin, capasaicin, eugenol, zerumbone, anethole, gambogic acid, diosgenin, and thymoquinone are all derived from the plants that I have just listed and are a part of the powerful cache of ammunition that nature has stored for us. Natural solutions for cancer isn't a book that is only cancer specific. The author has taken care to also discuss alternative methods in curing patients and specifies that these include a combination of the Indian Ayurvedic system, traditional Chinese medicine, homeopathy, naturopathy, and even Tibetan medicine that have a role in the treatment of diseases, including cancer. The book also has reasonable explanations of the tenets of Ayurveda which is rather useful for a reader who doesn't understand the finer nuances of this science. For instance, the book tells me that treatment initiation depends entirely on first identifying the personality type that could be sattva, rajas, or tamas and that this classification of personality types is connected to the nature or prakriti of a person. A few chapters in the book also helpfully inform me that food has four properties - cold, cool, warm, hot and then says that there is another category called Neutral foods that have no energetic temperature. The author tells me that there are five tastes existing in the alternative systems - sour, bitter, sweet, pungent, and salt. Each has a different function, for instance, pungent foods invigorate the blood, sour foods constrain sweating, stop cough, and relieve diarrhea, bitter foods help expel toxicity, sweet foods harmonize the body, relieve pains and spasms, and salty foods nourish blood and Yin. Even the colour of food has a link to certain body parts as 'energy flows through meridians in the body nourishing the organs'. Alcohol and greasy fried foods are Yang foods and are really bad as they deplete the Yin. It is important that people who get hold of this book, go through these chapters carefully. No, the book isn't going to replace consulting an expert... it is just that it is an advantage to know more about a system that one may want to adopt for treatment. So far as cancer is concerned, the author points out that there is very little research going on in India and that 'we have just scratched the surface' while practitioners from Europe, North America, and China have gone deeper into knowing more about these systems. It is these experts who have proclaimed that cancer is a debilitating disease where nutrition management is vital. This isn't all because cancer treatment in Ayurveda involves medicines and detoxification through panchkarma therapy. Panchkarma, for the uninitiated, includes various types of massages, aromatherapy, purging, and vomiting besides diet, lifestyle management, counselling, treatment with herbal oils, inclusion of yoga and meditation, and the use of mantras and chants. The book does state that currently 'most of the focus on treating patients is on herbal medicine. A conversation on food and nutrition is often integrated into the treatment. The other two ancient aspects of daiva (chants and mantras) and Sattva (psychotherapy and yoga) are rarely integrated in the treatment practices'. A vast amount of what this book has can be termed excellent so far as research goes. Almost every issue is backed by references and thus this there are no tales that a reader will read and forget. One keeps coming back to this book even if it is to know more about the medicinal values and the botanical insights into plants. Let me give you an example of turmeric. Turmeric plant is a perennial herbaceous plant from the ginger family. Turmeric is the boiled and dried rhizome of the Curcuma longa plant and curcumin is the yellow pigment in turmeric - poorly absorbed in the blood stream. I loved the fact that black pepper substantially enhances the absorption of curcumin and that the anti-cancer action of curcumin is attributed to its ability to inhibit a cancer master switch, which is called nuclear factor kappa beta. The book informs me that there is an ointment of curcumin available and researched and that curcumin inhibits proliferation and helps kill cancer cells. Ar turmerone isolated from turmeric is said to suppress growth of leukemia cells..., says the author, and he goes on to write that 'curcumin is non-toxic to humans even at high doses'. Now where else will I get so much (and more) information on turmeric? Even browsing the net for information is going to be a lengthy and painful exercise. There is a series of plants that are discussed at length and their role in the treatment of cancer is derived... * Please read the complete review on my blog: http://passey.info/2019/04/cancer-and... * Health is Wealth, they say. This book talks about the most important factor in a human's life in a very precise manner. I have not read science after completing my 10th standard. However, this book has rekindled my interest on Botany(Plants and Herbs) as it has captured the essence of our day to day in a crispy way. What makes this book interesting? This book talks about various herbs and its medicinal use in a detailed way. This is supported by appropriate pictures. Author has taken great pain in collating all the details in one place by way of a book. I would rather call this an \"Encyclopedia\" since it very much deserves the title and I even thought \"Why not this book be adapted as one of the syllabus in the studies of Alternate Medicine?\" The book is divided into two parts namely 1. Fundamental Principles and 2. Select Herbs Used in Cancer Author through his experience of having served as an Indian Forest Service officer, had gathered all the details for each and every topic and has presented in such a way that you would want to read them all in one go but it is easier said than done. The reason being, to grasp all the contents in the book, to some extent, you need to read the book over a period of at least a week, if not more. The herbs were given a clear description which includes its botanical name, place of origin, how and where it grows, various uses etc to name a few. Some herbs were used for various purposes and though author did touch upon them, he made it a point that he has not diverted from the main concept \"Solutions For Cancer\" The book talks in great detail about Ayurveda, Tibetan Medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine(TCM), comparison between Herbal versus Modern Medicine, Herbal Formulations and Supplements,Nutrition and Food, Detoxification, Aromatherapy and Massage in Part 1. Part 2 talks about the usage of herbs in Ayurveda and Chinese Medicine. The book also has covered few Yogasanas since the Ayurveda basically comprises of this which has been forgotten and it is almost treated as a separate entity. I would like to highlight few points that I made a note of, among some 1,000+ information that has been given in this book: 1. Tibetan Medicine aka Rigpa has elements drawn from both Indian and TCM. 2. Chinese Medicine has 8 branches namely meditation, exercise, diet, acupuncture, cosmology, feng shui, bodywork and herbal medicine. 3.Things we use in our day to day life like Turmeric, Red Chili, Cloves, Ginger, Fennel, Fenugreek, Black Cumin, Kokum contains chemicals that prevent Cancer. 4. Tea and Tea components including a cup of Ginger Tea(daily) are effective in fighting Cancer. 5. Four Tantras of Tibetan Medicine - The Root Tantra, The Explanatory Tantra, The Oral Instruction Tantra and The Last/Subsequent Tantra. 6. Tibetan Medicine has 4 types of therapies - Diet, Behavior, Medicine and External Therapies. 7. Surgery is no longer used in Tibetan Medicine. 8. The Men Tse Khang school of Tibetan Medicine in Dharamsala,India, offers five-year courses in Tibetan Medicine.Men means Medicine Tse means Astrolofy and Khang means House which is known as \"House of Medicine and Astrology\". 9. TCM has five key organs - Heart, Liver, Spleen, Lungs and Kidney. These are aka Zang Organs. The FU organs includes Gall Bladder, Stomach Bladder, Large Intestine and Small Intestine. 10. TCM has two concepts - Yin and Yang. Yin is dark, cold, passive or female aspect. Yang is the active, bright, hot and male aspect I am stopping here because the notes I have made would run into pages. Author has given a clear warning in the very beginning that though herbs are mostly not dangerous, it needs to be taken or administered only after consulting with a specialist. Author has also clearly mentioned that this book must be used only for reference purposes. My take on the book - It is a MUST READ and if you love Ayurveda/Alternate Medicine, this book would surely help you in all aspects related to Cancer. Despite having modern treatment facilities, science is still searching for a cure for Cancer. This disease not just takes the life of a patient but also traumatized every person related to the patient. I have witnessed two to three cases of cancer in my locality and my father-in-law also passed away last year, after suffering two years by esophagus cancer. In spite of giving chemotherapy and other available treatment, his condition deteriorates rapidly. His condition and pain were unbearable to watch. There are reasons which make treatment of cancer impossible but after reading the title of this book, I decided to know what the natural and alternative treatments of cancer are. The author of this book is an ex-member of Indian forest service and he holds great knowledge of various herbs. I have already read and reviewed his previous books. The book starts with the introduction of cancer and how modern medicines are failing to treat it completely. After this, the author has talked about the available treatments of cancer which are helping the patients; however, nothing from this is full proof. Further, the author has written about how trees, plants, fruits, and vegetable play a vital role to impart the necessary nutrients in our body and many of them actually shield us from cancer. There are many treatments available in the world which are totally natural and are plant-based. The author has mainly focused on Ayurveda, Tibetan Medicine, and Traditional Chinese medicine. These three methods of treatments are ancient and now people are turning towards them slowly. The further chapters respectively describe these ways of treatments and how they are originated. All these treatments have many concepts and they are based on the elements getting from trees and plants. Many of these fruits, herbs, and plants are in our daily diet but we are not aware of their importance. This book elaborately narrates about various herbs and their medicinal properties. In the end, the author has also given importance to yoga and has given various asana to keep our body fit and energetic. My perception: This book is very well-researched and the author has done great work compiling it in a book which is definitely going to aware many people. Human civilization is very ancient and we are evolving every day, however, the methods used by our ancestors are still applicable. Through this book, I have got to know about Tibetan medicine and how they also emphasize astrological aspects. This book gives a detailed insight into various herbs which are available all around the world. The information on Ayurveda and Chinese is very interesting to read. This is an informative and non-fiction book which will be enjoyed by the readers who loves to read about various informative things. Overall, I suggest you pick this book to know more about cancer and other available alternative treatments. This book is important contribution to complementary healing of cancer. It is not a secret that chemotherapy has a number of side effects and many patients are not getting a cure from it. Using a herbs that for thousands of years proved their efficacy can be a vital alternative for such a people. Based in his over 30 years of expertize on flora and fauna, Sudhir Ahluwalia discloses most popular alternative medicine adjunct cancer treatment systems of Indian Ayurvedic medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine. Author explores the role of plants in disease prevention and cure, emphasizing their ability to enhance the immunity. The book also reviews the role of other natural solutions to cancer treatment such as of meditation, yoga, detoxification, aromatherapy, and massage that helps to protect us from disease and activate the ability of the body to self-heal. Being the psycho-oncologists, I am particularly pleased that Ayurveda stresses on aligning treatment with the personality of an individual, considering a health as \"the personal experience of physical, mental, and spiritual contentment\". The word Ayurveda literally means knowledge of life. Reading this book bring this knowledge into your life as well. Vladislav Matrenitsky, M.D., Ph.D, author of the book 'Carcinogenic Mind: The Psychosomatic Mechanisms of Cancer.' The author of this book is an ex-member of Indian forest service and he holds great knowledge of various herbs. This book is yet another fantastic piece of information, all compiled so well. This is on similar grounds as his other books, which I have read in the past. His books are a mix and match of history, botany, scientific and medical aspects of naturally available herbs and medicines. He combines the information meticulously, and the content very well depicts the great amount of research put in through the process of doing so. Cancer has become such common disease these days. Almost everyone reading this book knows/ is related to someone who is suffering from/ has died from cancer. Thankfully, our civilization is blessed with some many natural cures/ preventive herbs. The only thing is not all of us really know how to leverage the abundantly available resources. The author in this book, provides good insight into such herbs. He also focusses on Yoga as a medicine, and details about it in the book. Also, he has covered various other medical methodologies like the Chinese, Tibetian and Indian Ayurvedic treatments. Cancer is a kind of disease which stings like a scorpion and it can sting anyone or any of our loved ones. Reading such books and holding the knowledge of cure/ preventions in advance is of no harm. We have a rich heritage as humans, and this book covers the richness and brings it to us. All of this is written in an easy to follow language. The information is backed by references. The herbs were given a clear description which includes its botanical name, place of origin, how and where it grows, various uses etc to name a few. The author also describes on how our day-to-day and readily available kitchen items be effectively used as cure/ preventive measures against cancer. Some of them include Ginger tea, turmeric, cloves, fennel, fenugreek, kokum, red chilli. I like the Yoga-asana illustrations demonstrated in the last section of the book, since I myself am a yogic person. The book is really very informative. I have gone the content of the book and it has suggested practical solutions for curbing cancer which is unknown to us. These natural sources can be easily available to us and we can make use of them to curb the most potent disease (Cancer) till date. I found the book immensely useful and I would suggest users buy this one as one is a really impressive one. One important aspect of the book is that it has covered all the natural sources available around in the biodiversity ranging from herbal sources to Ayurveda solutions to the traditional Chinese medication. The author has given useful insights on the grave topic of Cancer as the potential solutions are still a pressing problem to date. You will find precise explanations and appropriate solutions for all types of cancer existing in the human body. As per the current scenario, natural sources are proving out to be an extraordinary cure for cancer so I strongly recommend this book to you. As from a reader's point of view, the author has used simple language which makes it easy to read and understand for a non-medico person. The language is understandable and easy to connect. The book, 'Natural Solutions For Cancer' do justice to the various alternatives that are cost-effective as well as meet up with scientific standards. Sudih Ahluwalia in these 600 pages books exhausts in simple terms how herbs can be used to fight cancers. The book is, without doubt, resourceful for all without respect for your financial strength. In addition, he explains how the use of herbs removes the barrier of severe pains faced by patients who undergo modern medicinal treatment. I affirm that information provided in this book would go a long way to prevent several souls from being snatched up in the cold hands of cancer. You should also get a copy of this book, someone close to you might need the information provided therein anytime soon. The 1.65 pounds book is highly resourceful detailing the basic principle in which traditional methods such as the use of herbs can be used. It further grounds the fact that the ultimate solution to every problem facing human can be found in nature. I summit that the lessons learnt in this book are enormous. I look forward to seeing more books from the writer, as I'll love to buy them. This is an amazing book that I have ever read before. This book gives all the important information needed the people to know the natural solutions to prevent cancer. I have seen many people how they afraid to cancer and do not believe that it can be treated specially by natural remedies. This book gives them a ray of hope. This book is divided into two parts; First one is fundamental principles and second one is Selection of herbs. In both parts, each and every step is clearly defined to treat the cancer. This book also explains how herbs are more effective than modern medicines, how Arurveda and Tibetan medicine can help to recover patients soon. This book also elaborates the kind of nutrition should be given to patients suffering from cancer and suggests some therapy or exercises according to their stage. The Language is very simple, anybody can understand it. In present times, many people are suffering from cancer. I highly recommend this book to all of them going through this and hope to see positive changes in their life and a beautiful smile on their face. Amazing book by Mr. Ahluwalia. Very logically and step by step explained the Ayurveda and it's benefits and how it has solution of each of the different body types. Never knew that treatments in Ayurveda is customized for person's nature of body. Explained very well that how Ayurveda's core belief is that cancer cells are always present in a human body, and it is their imbalance that causes the problem. Amazed by the knowledge of Ayurveda demonstrated by the author in this book. "}
