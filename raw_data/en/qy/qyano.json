If you would like to see how we adjust each level for difficulty (while allowing the whole family to come together), please visit this page [HERE.](https://campfirecurriculums.com/colorcoding/) UNIT DESCRIPTION: This unit is the first in our series of natural medicine! Through it, your entire family will be able to come together and learn (all ages) about natural medicine in all forms! Throughout the unit, you will be gaining hands-on experience in tinctures, oils, salves, poultices, infusions, and so much more. This unit is so comprehensive! We made sure to include living book format to draw in the youngest of learners, while also maintaining advanced level for the adults and older students! If you want to teach your family about medicine, health, herbs, anatomy, history, foraging, application, AND how to stand upon the evidence behind it (and we're just hitting a few points)... then this is for you! There are additional activities ranging from respiratory capacity to golden coffee to dandelion cookies to full dinners, too! If you want to see what else is included, you can keep scrolling...
