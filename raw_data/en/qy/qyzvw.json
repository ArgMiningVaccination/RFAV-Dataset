OK, so before we dive into how homeopathic beauty applies to you, beauty pro, we want to give you a quick breakdown of homeopathy in general. Context, you know? First, let's chat about the definition of [homeopathy](https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/homeopathy#:~:text=Homeopathy%20is%20an%20alternative%20medicine,those%20diseases%20in%20healthy%20people.). Translated, homeopathy literally means \"like with like.\" Homeopathic solutions are generally made through ingredients like plant, mineral, or animal materials-then diluted repeatedly before being crafted into their final form. The general idea of homeopathy is that the body can solve most of its own problems with a little natural assistance-hence the \"like with like\" explanation. So, homeopathic beauty products and practices are focused on natural, from-the-earth, or from-the-body ingredients and treatments. Why Homeopathic Cosmetics, Products, & Beauty Practices? Homeopathic cosmetology is often looked at as a more natural approach cosmetology. It tends to avoid chemicals, rather focusing on natural remedies like diluted plant extracts or substances that naturally occur within the body or on the planet. No, homeopathy isn't specifically about avoiding chemicals-rather, the perspective is to \"treat like with like.\" If your body or the earth isn't producing it, it's likely not found in homeopathic treatments, products, or practices. Some people believe that homeopathic beauty is the trend to turn to because the manufacturing of other products with excess chemicals and artificial ingredients can cause irreparable diseases, deformities, and more. Of course, that's not everyone's reasoning for turning to homeopathic beauty. Some people like that it takes a more natural, \"like with like\" approach. Others like that it all sort of coalesces with the holistic beauty trend, too. Either way, homeopathic beauty is taking off-and it's something to consider in your own establishments and practices.
