Using computational methodologies, broadly reactive hemagglutinin- and neuraminidase-based vaccines are being assessed using cutting-edge scientific and statistical modeling technologies. Additionally, the CIVR-HRP network is investigating novel platforms to deliver universal influenza vaccines, including recombinant proteins, microparticles, live attenuated viruses, and microneedle skin patches. Combining traditional and cutting-edge immunology, epigenetics, structural biology, virology, systems biology, and statistical modeling with various OMICs assessments of host responses to influenza vaccination and infection in high-risk models, the CIVR-HRP is developing the next generation flu vaccines for people and the models needed to predict their effectiveness.
