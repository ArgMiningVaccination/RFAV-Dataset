Contents of the pack and other information 1. What COMIRNATY (Bivalent) is and what it is used BA.4 -5 Vaccine (nucleoside modified) is called COMIRNATY (Bivalent) (For 12 Years of Age and Older) (Vials with Grey Cap). COMIRNATY (Bivalent) is a vaccine used for preventing COVID -19 caused by SARS -CoV -2 virus. COMIRNATY (Bivalent) (For 12 Years of Age and Older) (Vials with Grey Cap) is given to adults and adolescents from 12 years of age a nd older who have been previously vaccinated with COMIRNATY or COMIRNATY (Bivalent) (For 12 Years of Age and Older) (Vials with Grey Cap). The vaccine causes the immune system (the body's natural defences) to produce antibodies and blood cells that work a gainst the virus, so giving protection against COVID -19. As COMIRNATY (Bivalent) does not contain the virus to produce immunity, it cannot give you COVID -19. 2. What you need to know before you receive COMIRNATY (Bivalent) COMIRNATY (Bivalent) should not be given if you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6) Page 2 of 9 Warnings and precautions Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before you are given the vaccine if: you have ever had a severe allergic reaction or breathing problems after any other vaccine injection or after you were given COMIRNATY or COMIRNATY (Bivalent) in the past. you have had myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) or pericarditis (inflammatio n of the lining outside the heart). you are feeling nervous about the vaccination process or have ever fainted following any needle injection. you have a fever. you have a bleeding problem, you bruise easily or you use a medicine to prevent blood -clots. you have a weakened immune system, because of a disease such as HIV infection or a medicine such as corticosteroid that affects your immune system. you have received another COVID -19 vaccine. There is a remote chance that COMIRNATY or COMIRNATY (Bivalent) c ould cause a severe allergic reaction. A severe allergic reaction would usually occur within a few minutes to one hour after getting a dose of COMIRNATY or COMIRNATY (Bivalent). For this reason, your vaccination provider may ask you to stay at the place wh ere you received your vaccine for monitoring after vaccination. Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include: Difficulty breathing Swelling of your face and throat A fast heartbeat A bad rash all over your body Dizziness and weakness Myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) have occurred in some people who have received COMIRNATY. In most of these people, symptoms began within a few days following receipt of the seco nd dose of COMIRNATY. The risk of myocarditis and pericarditis seems lower in children ages 5 through <12 years compared with ages 12 to 17 years. The chance of having this occur is very low. You should avoid strenuous physical activity for two weeks after vaccination. You should seek medical attention right away if you have any of the following symptoms after receiving COMIRNATY or COMIRNATY (Bivalent): Chest pain Shortness of breath Feelings of having a fast -beating, fluttering, or pounding heart As with any vaccine, COMIRNATY or COMIRNATY (Bivalent) may not fully protect all those who receive it and it is not known how long you will be protected.
