Similar to Traditional East Asian Medicine, functional medicine takes a holistic approach to diagnosis and treatment, considering aspects of an individual's past and current medical history, socioeconomic status, and other determinants of health\u2014this information is considered alongside data gathered from comprehensive diagnostic testing to create a unique life-style, nutritional, and nutraceutical treatment plan for each patient. Functional medicine may be supportive in the treatment of a variety of conditions, such as metabolic and/or endocrine disorders, headaches, gastrointestinal disorders, immune disorders, anxiety, depression, menstrual issues and infertility, and more. Prior to an initial functional medicine visit, patients will be asked to complete an in-depth medical systems questionnaire. At the initial visit, patients complete a full medical intake and physical and any necessary diagnostic testing will be ordered. This visit typically lasts 60 minutes. At the next visit\u2014the review of findings\u2014the patient and provider will go over laboratory test results and treatment options. This visit typically lasts 30-60 minutes, in-office or via telemedicine. Follow-up appointments to discuss patient progress and make any needed modifications to the treatment plan are recommended every 3 to 4 weeks. These appointments typically last 30-60 minutes, in-office or via telemedicine. Acupuncture may be included as part of in-person visits. At an initial chiropractic visit, patients will complete a full medical history and thorough physical exam before receiving safe, gentle chiropractic manipulation to restore proper joint mobility and pain-free movement. During the adjustment, a quick, direct force is applied to the affected joint. Patients may hear popping or cracking or feel movement at the joint. Issues with lack of proper motion in the back, neck, pelvis, hips, or other joints are behind many musculoskeletal problems. Chiropractic care can benefit many conditions, including but not limited to: back pain, neck pain, headaches, sciatica, joint pain, sports injuries, herniated discs, arthritis, and pregnancy-related aches and pains. At follow-up visits, patients will complete a short, problem focused physical exam before receiving their adjustment. In an acupuncture session, patients complete a full medical intake and may be treated for a variety of conditions, including back pain, headaches, gastrointestinal disorders, allergies, anxiety, depression, menstrual issues, infertility, hypertension, circulatory disorders, and more. Acupuncture addresses disharmonies and gently brings the body into a state of balance, increasing vitality and improving the body's ability to heal itself. Private acupuncture sessions may also include adjunct therapies such as cupping, nutritional counseling, herbal formulas, vitamins & supplements, moxibustion, guasha, and TDP heat lamps. At your first session, we will design your individualized treatment plan. Whether from posture, injuries, or emotional trauma, our muscles and fascia hold patterns. Manipulating soft tissue helps us release these patterns and live with more comfort and ease. Treatments are individualized and can vary from clinical trigger point therapy and muscular rehabilitation to sessions that focus more on nourishing and grounding, incorporating medical massage techniques and acupressure to reduce anxiety and increase relaxation. While many sessions focus on pain relief and optimizing physical function, we also believe in the simple healing power of touch to promote ease and comfort. Sessions may also include cupping, guasha, or floor-based Shiatsu-style bodywork. Reiki Reiki is a hands-on Japanese technique for relaxation and healing. Reiki utilizes universal energy channeled by the practitioner through their hands toward the patient. This energy helps reduce stress and anxiety, and promotes natural self-healing. Most patients feel a deep sense of relaxation, to the point of falling asleep. Soul Sessions Soul Sessions with Jennifer are an intuitive healing technique that combine Reiki with spiritual coaching to remember and renew your awareness of the eternal parts of yourself. Each session is unique, and designed to create and hold the vision of the highest version of you. Sessions take place by phone or video call. Cupping uses a vasopneumatic device to improve circulation, decrease back pain, remove toxins, and improve lung function. The suction pulls fascia away from the bone and helps to break up knots by flushing the area with fresh blood to repair and relieve inflammation in sore, stiff, or stagnant areas. Cupping may be included in any private acupuncture treatment, or be booked as a standalone treatment. Herbs help to bring the body into balance. In creating your custom herbal formula, we will consider your medical history, physical symptoms, constitution, as well as any supplements or medications you may already be taking, and create an individualized treatment for you. Unlike many pharmaceutical drugs, herbal formulas are meant to be taken either short-term or long-term, but never forever; they correct patterns of imbalance, and once the pattern is resolved, you no longer need the formula. Herbal consults can occur during a private acupuncture appointment for no additional charge, and your formula will be prepared while you receive your acupuncture treatment. The skin is the largest organ of your body and reflects your whole body's health. You can support a healthy aging process with microneedling treatments. Microneedling is a non-invasive method that stimulates your skin's natural healing abilities by boosting collagen and elastin production. The end result is smooth, firm, even-toned, and bright skin tone as well as reduced size of scars, pores and wrinkles. Consider 3-6 treatment sessions about every month for maximum benefit or up to 8 sessions for harder to treat issues like deep scarring.

We look forward to meeting you soon. Functional medicine is a data-driven, biology-based approach to health that focuses on identifying and addressing the root cause of disease. Functional medicine takes a holistic approach to diagnosis and treatment, considering aspects of an individual's past and current medical history, socioeconomic status, and other determinants of health\u2014this information is considered alongside data gathered from comprehensive diagnostic testing to create a unique life-style, nutritional, and nutraceutical treatment plan for each patient. Functional medicine may be supportive in the treatment of a variety of conditions, such as metabolic and/or endocrine disorders, headaches, gastrointestinal disorders, immune disorders, anxiety, depression, menstrual issues and infertility, and more. Prior to an initial functional medicine visit, patients will be asked to complete an in-depth medical systems questionnaire. At the initial visit, patients complete a full medical intake and physical and any necessary diagnostic testing will be ordered. Once the results are received and analyzed, a variety of treatment strategies may be recommended, including herbal medicine, nutritional supplements, acupuncture, and lifestyle modifications, among others. Acupuncture improves the body's functions and self-healing capabilities by stimulating specific anatomical sites, known as acupuncture points. Modern research has demonstrated acupuncture's effect on the nervous system, endocrine system, immune system, digestive system, and cardiovascular system. Acupuncture has been found to release various neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, dopamine, and GABA, as well as to modulate chemicals that influence pain. By stimulating, regulating, and harmonizing the various systems of the body, acupuncture can resolve pain and injuries, improve sleep, mood, menstrual cycles, and digestion, and instill an overall sense of well-being. Acupuncture is well-known for its effectiveness at treating pain. Many patients come in for neck pain, back pain, headaches, migraines, joint pain, and injuries. However, acupuncture is a complete medicine, and can treat a great variety of other conditions as well, including allergies, anxiety, insomnia, gastrointestinal problems, menstrual issues, infertility, and more. Acupuncture may also be used as preventive medicine, for overall health maintenance, regulation, and disease prevention. You don't need to have a specific complaint or issue to use acupuncture medicine. At your first acupuncture or chiropractic visit, we'll do a complete medical intake, have a session, and recommend a course of treatment depending on your individual conditions and concerns. Injuries and more severe conditions require more frequent visits until the condition stabilizes, at which point we decrease the frequency of the treatments. Many people feel they benefit from weekly acupuncture treatments or chiropractic adjustments to deal with different issues as they come up (one week it may be anxiety, the next seasonal allergies, the next upper back pain) and to have a peaceful weekly ritual. It is ideal to wear comfortable, loose-fitting clothes, but we can always work around whatever you are wearing on any given day. Caffeine inhibits pain-relieving effects and also makes for a less peaceful rest during your treatment, so we encourage you not to drink coffee or strongly caffeinated tea immediately before your treatment. Otherwise, come as you are! Always feel free to reach out to us with any questions & we look forward to meeting you soon. Please contact us by phone (312-291-8298) or email ( [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)) at least 24 hours before the start of your appointment. We charge a $80 no show or late cancellation (less than 24 hours) fee, out of respect for our practitioners' time that they have set aside to see you. Thank you for understanding. Please send an email to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) with proposed dates, details of the workshop, and your social media & website. We love hosting workshops and events and broadening our circle. "}
