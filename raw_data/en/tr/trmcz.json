Use NIOSH -approved particulate respirators, gloves and goggles when working with moldy or damp materials. Additional protection may be needed for high -contamination areas or when activities generate substantial dust. Bloodborne Pathogens Infected blood can enter your system through mucous membranes o pen sores, cuts, abrasions, and/or any sort of damaged or broken skin Adopt universal precautions -assume blood or bodily fluids potentially contaminated with blood are infectious. Wear PPE -gloves, eye protection. Consider receiving the Hepatitis B series vaccination. Animal Bites and Stings Use insect repellent. Be aware of displaced wildlife and pets in the areas. Inspect areas before entering. Be cautious about where you place your hands and feet. Wear proper foot gear and leather gloves when handling materials where nests may be present. Waterborne Disease Remember it is not just rainwater. Contact with contaminated or disease -carrying soil, water, feces, animals. Failed wastewater treatment plants, backed up, overflowing sewer lines, flood water pollution of wells. Drink from bottled water sources until water supplies are safely treated. Contact with Poisonous Plants Learn to recognize poisonous plants or harmful plants . Poison ivy, poison oak, poison sumac Thorn -bearing plants Use gloves and wear long pants. Rubbing alcohol may remove the oily resin causing the reaction. Physical Hazards Factors within the environment that can harm the body without necessarily touching it.

If so, the employers must implement feasible engineering or administrative controls to eliminate or reduce hazardous levels of noise. Where controls are not sufficient, employers must implement an effective hearing conservation program.\" Exposure to over 85 dB can cause hearing loss Hearing protection required at 90 dB Hearing Protection Devices Foam plugs Pre-molded, reusable plugs Canal caps Earmuffs OSHA emphasis program to focus on hazardous noise in Midwest manufacturing | 2021 -06-22 | Safety+Health (safetyandhealthmagazine.com)Body Protection There are many varieties of protective clothing available for specific hazards. Workers must wear personal protective equipment only for the parts of the body exposed to possible injury. Examples of body protection include laboratory coats, coveralls, vests, jackets, aprons, surgical gowns and full body suits. Decontamination The process of removing or neutralizing contaminants that have accumulated on personnel and equipment. Decontamination protects: Workers from hazardous substances Site personnel by minimizing the transfer of harmful materials into clean area Mixing of incompatible chemicals Prevent uncontrolled transportation of contaminants from the site in the communitySummary Emergency managers think of disasters as recurring events with four phases: Mitigation, Preparedness, Response, and Recovery. Establishing and maintaining effective communication is vital to a successful disaster response. During pre deployment, deployment and post deployment their activities, training, and administrative actions necessary to prepare for respond. As a responder is vital to: Identify and prioritize safety and health hazards, complete specific training, know the PPE or other protective actions, behaviors, or activities required to execute potential response assignments.References Emergency Response Guidebook Online guidebook for first responders to help identify specific or generic classifications of materials involved in hazmat incidents and how to protect themselves and the public during the initial response.
