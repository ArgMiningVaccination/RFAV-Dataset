A sur vey of 95 B ritish CAM o rganizations revealed th at few practitioners monitor the side ef fects of their therapies. And ma ny of the organizations questioned said that they don't even co nsider t he possibility that adverse reac- tions mig ht occur. Edzard Ernst, profe ssor of complementary medicine a t the Peninsula Medical S chool of the Universities o f Exeter and Plymo uth, wr ote to the CAM o rganizations in M ay, askin g whether t hey advise their mem bers to report adverse events. H e also asked for det ails o f such events. The o rganizations he a pproached covered some 20 he aling arts, from herbal medicines a nd ho meo pathy to crystal therapy and hypnothera py. Fewer than a third replied. Of those who did, just nine said that they advised members to report side ef fects. And o nly one, an acupuncture ass ociation, ga ve det ails o f adverse reactions reported in 2004. Ernst says that he was sur prised by the gen- eral lack of familia rity wi th the co ncep t of adverse reactions. \"Some respondents said they didn 't really under stand what was me ant by the term,\" he s ays. O thers denied i ts rele-vance t o them. \" Several o rganizations said that adverse events were only connected with mainstream medicine , but were inco nceivable in their o wn says. Side fects do o ccur wi th CAM a nd ca n sometimes b e serious \u2014 str oke can occur after chiropractic treatmen ts and some de aths have been recorded. \"Yet no o ne is lo oking,\" says Ernst. \"In the interest of patient safety, that has to change.\" He wants studies t o be carried out in dif ferent parts of the world t o research adverse events associated with each therapy. \"We have been callin g for mo re regulation for a lo ng time,\" says a sp okesperson for the British M edical A ssociation. \"Doctors kno w that patients lik e these sorts of therapies, a nd they would like to b e confiden t before they refer a p atient to a CAM p ractitioner that the therapy in q uestion works a nd is s afe.\" Terry C ullen, c hairman of the British Complemen tary Medicine A ssociation, says that his o rganization does no t believe the ther- apies it represents could be harmful. For example, he says that even if a c lient receiving reflexology, which involves applying pressur e to the ha nds a nd feet, doesn't end u p mo re relaxed, they are unlikely to have any reaction seri- ous enough to need mon- itoring or regulating. But the Scottish I nsti- tute Reflexology says that Ernst's enq uiry has prom pted it to establish a syst em for mo nitoring adverse effects. \"We are going to intro- duce a s ort of 'yellow- card' syst em li ke the medical profe ssion has \u2014 a f orm that mem bers can fill in a nd return to us if t hey obs erve any ad verse ef fects,\" says M argaret S millie, the institute's presiden t. Smillie adds that comple- men tary medicine sho uld ado pt the same standards as the mainstream. \"W e feel a responsibility to protect the public and our mem bers,\" she s ays.
