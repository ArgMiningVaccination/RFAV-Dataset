In this workshop we will connect to the sacred wisdom of the earth through yoga, aromatherapy and sound healing. All aspects of life such as art, language, ceremonies, and medicine have been influenced by nature's beauty and wisdom. Join Jess on an exploration of the five earth elements: Earth, Water, Fire, Air and Space. When we lose our connection to the rhythms and cycles of nature, which includes our own inner nature we lose our connection to all things in the universe. Working with the elements cultivates self-awareness, bringing energetic shifts and restoring balance. The nature of nature is to expand. In this workshop we will practice yoga postures to tune in to the energy of each element bringing us into an open and balanced frequency. We then dive into the heavenly world of aromatherapy and discover which selected essential oils correlates with each element. Essential oils are powerful allies when we are doing healing work, intuitive/creative work, or anything that involves the senses and emotions. The workshop ends with a sound meditation with crystal bowls and gong, moving into the Space element. Sound has been used for centuries to awaken, heal and transform. We are all unique vibratory beings and life is filled with rhythm. Sound relaxes the body, mind and spirit. ALL LEVELS WELCOME, $25.
