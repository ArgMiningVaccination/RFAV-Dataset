The school had been evacuated from South London to Minehead in Cornwall during the war-years. Soon the first study group - The Wednesday Group - was started by the teachers and parents and gradually our anthroposophical community grew up around it. Now we are surrounded by up to 20 anthroposophically inspired initiatives of which many have their own websites and can be found under links. "}
