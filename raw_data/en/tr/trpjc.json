Tradeoffs in evolut ionary immunology: just what is the cost of immunity? -Oikos88: 87-98. 39 Effects of Increased Protein and Energy fed in Milk Replacer and Heat Stress on Growth Parameters of Neonatal Holstein Bull Calves Andy J. Krenek & Glenn Increased Milk Replacer calves had a significantly greater Wither Height, Heart Girth, Body Length, Hip Height, and ADG than the Conventional Milk Replacer calves. Heat Stressed calves had a significantly higher Water Consumption than the Non Heat Stressed calves. Increased Milk Replacer calves had a greater Water Consumption than the Conventional Milk Replacer calves. Conventional Milk Replacer calves had Poorer Feed Conversion than the Increased Milk Replacer calves. 42 Interaction of Breed and Plane of Pre-weaning Nutrition on Performance and Innate Immune Responses of Pre- and Post-weaned Dairy Calves (summary ) Michael A. Ballou, Ph.D. Department of Animal and Food Sciences, Texas Tech University Calves fed a higher plane of nutrition grew faster & taller Higher plane of nutrition improved post-weaning immune response measures Conceivable that Jersey calves could be fed even higher planes of nutrition without adversely affecting age at weaning TL Ollivett, DV Nydam, TC Linden, DD Bowman, M.

They don't grow as well and aren't as healthy. Feed them more/more frequently Heifers Are we feeding them the right diet? Are we handling them correctly? Grow them later.... Feed Efficiency Decreases With Age Can get 0.5 to 0.8 lbs. of gain for a lb. of feed in the first 2 months Post-weaning its 0.15 to 0.30 lbs of gain per lb of feed. Older heifers (greater than 6 months) feed conversion drops dramatically to less than 0.153 Our objective: Do what's right for the calf by continuing to lead the industry towards improving the health, performance and profitability of raising calves and heifers.
