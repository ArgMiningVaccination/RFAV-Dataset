They can also have very specific symptoms. These diseases are also treated differently depending on how severe they are and how much they affect your immune system. While you may not go to the doctor for a cold, if your symptoms last longer than a few days, you should see a doctor. You can also prevent some diseases by getting vaccinations. Treatment for Infectious Disease Many infectious diseases can be treated by antibiotics (specifically diseases caused by bacteria). Those caused by viruses can sometimes be treated by antiviral medications, and diseases caused by fungi can be treated by antifungals. Some diseases, however, have become resistant to drugs. You should always consult a doctor about the best treatment option for your particular symptoms or disease. "}
