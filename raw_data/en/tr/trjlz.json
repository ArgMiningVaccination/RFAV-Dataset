Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) are an essential source material for scientists researching the human immune response in the fields of immunology, inflammation, vaccination, toxicology, and other areas of study. Commercially available PBMC products offer ready-made blends of adaptive and innate immune cells that fuel research and development of life-saving and life-altering medical treatments. We have created a single guide that brings together our most popular PBMC educational resources, including: - How to use a recall antigen assay to understand immunity - The benefits of testing with pooled PBMC from multiple donors - Research tips and protocols for working with PBMC - PBMC products from healthy and disease-state donors - Pooled PBMC and Irradiated PBMC products - And more! [Access the PBMC guide here](https://astartebio.com/resources/in-depth-guides/pbmc/) to enhance your knowledge of working with these essential immune cells.
