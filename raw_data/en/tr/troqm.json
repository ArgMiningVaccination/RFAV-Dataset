About 50K scholarly articles online Not many randomized blinded controlled studiesDefinitions CAM = Complementary and Alternative Medicine Defined as a group of diverse systems , practices, and/or products that are not generally considered part of conventional or traditional medicine, often used to treat or manage primary or secondary complications resulting from illness or injury Used with (complementary) or instead of (alternative) to conventional treatment Integrative Medicine = blending of conventional and natural/complementary medicines and/or therapies along with lifestyle interventions and a holistic approach -taking into account the physical, psychological, social, and spiritual well -being of the person -with the aim of using the most appropriate, safe, and evidence -based modality(ies) available. Practice of medicine The Consortium of Integrative Medicine, May 2004 edited 2009Definitions Naturopathy = a distinct primary health care profession, emphasizing prevention, treatment, and optimal health through the use of therapeutic methods and substances that encourage individuals' inherent self -healing process Homeopathy = the practice of medicine that embraces a holistic, natural approach to the treatment of the sick. It is holistic because it treats the person as a whole, rather than focusing on a diseased part or labeled sickness Acupuncture = a holistic health technique that stems from Traditional Chinese Medicine practices in which trained practitioners stimulate specific points on the body by inserting thin needles into the skin, to manipulate the flow of energy or Qi, in order to alleviate pain or treat specific health conditionsBackground Survey on national sample of 830 adults with MS, CP, SCI, and OA CAM practitioners consulted by 19% of patients More prevalent among women compared to men More common in the Western US No difference in CAM use between income groups or insurance type All of these patients had private insurance SCI reported the lowest use among the diagnosis groups More barriers to receiving CAM care? Carlson & Krahn, Disability and Rehabilitation, April 2006Background Conditions commonly treated: Pain (especially back pain) Decreased function Lack of energy 44% of patients perceived CAM to be more effective than conventional medicine Dissatisfaction with effectiveness of conventional medicine Philosophical congruence with lifestyle For insured patients with disability, CAM used at similar or higher rates than general populationWillingness to use CAM 2015: \"Use of complementary and alternative medicine in persons with spinal cord injury in Switzerland: a survey study\" 103 patients with chronic (>1 year) SCI: 33 tetraplegia and 70 paraplegia 54 complete, 49 incomplete Data collected over 5 months 74% used some form of CAM since SCI: wide variety of CAM modalities Acupuncture: pain & spasticity Homeopathy: UTI 22% used 2 forms of CAM, 10% used more than 2 Indications: Pain Spasticity UTIs CAM used as a supplement rather than exclusively High satisfaction 85% with CAM use for indications Pannek et al.

The Journal of Spinal Cord Medicine, 2017Acupuncture TCM = Traditional Chinese Medicine Believed to have originated around 100 B.C. in China Came to U.S. in the 20thcentury Involves the belief that a \"life force\" (Qi) circulates within the body in lines called meridians Insertion of ~ 5 -20 thin needles into the skin, left in place for 10 -20 min Can be associated with application of heat, pressure, or laser light Usually used for MSK problems: LBP, shoulder stiffness, knee pain Often used in combination with other approaches Herbs, Acupressure, Cupping, Auriculotherapy , etc. Western
