Our objectives were to verify, document, and characterize Katrina-related mortality in Louisiana and help identify strategies to reducemortality in future disasters. Methods: We assessed Hurricane Katrina mortality data sources received in 2007, including Louisiana and out-of-state death certificates for deaths occurring from August 27 to October 31, 2005, and theDisaster Mortuary Operational Response Team's confirmed victims' database. We calculated age-,race-, and sex-specific mortality rates for Orleans, St Bernard, and Jefferson Parishes, where 95% ofKatrina victims resided and conducted stratified analyses by parish of residence to compare differ-ences between observed proportions of victim demographic characteristics and expected values basedon 2000 US Census data, using Pearson chi square and Fisher exact tests. Results: We identified 971 Katrina-related deaths in Louisiana and 15 deaths among Katrina evacuees in other states. Drowning (40%), injury and trauma (25%), and heart conditions (11%) were the major causesof death among Louisiana victims. Forty-nine percent of victims were people 75 years old and older.Fifty-three percent of victims were men; 51% were black; and 42% were white. In Orleans Parish, themortality rate among blacks was 1.7 to 4 times higher than that among whites for all people 18 years oldand older. People 75 years old and older were significantly more likely to be storm victims ( P/H11021.0001). Conclusions: Hurricane Katrina was the deadliest hurricane to strike the US Gulf Coast since 1928. Drowning was the major cause of death and people 75 years old and older were the most affected population cohort.Future disaster preparedness efforts must focus on evacuating and caring for vulnerable populations,including those in hospitals, long-term care facilities, and personal residences. Improving mortality reportingtimeliness will enable response teams to provide appropriate interventions to these populations and toprepare and implement preventive measures before the next disaster. ( Disaster Med Public Health Preparedness. 2008;:1-1) Key Words: Hurricane Katrina, Louisiana, mortality, drowning, flooding, disaster preparedness Hurricane Katrina struck the US Gulf Coast on August 29, 2005 as a category 3 hurricaneon the Saffir-Simpson scale, causing unprec- edented damage to numerous Louisiana and Missis- sippi communities. 1During the hours and days after Hurricane Katrina, breaches in the levee infrastructure resulted in flooding throughout approximately 80% of New Orleans. A massive rescue and recovery effort was launched by local, state, and federal governments and nongovernmental organizations. Before Hurri-cane Katrina, the deadliest hurricane to make landfall in the United States during the previous 50 years was Hurricane Audrey (1957), with an estimated 416deaths. 2Hurricane Andrew (1995), the last category 5 hurricane to strike the United States, caused 26 deaths.2Although several preliminary estimates exist of the deaths attributable to Hurricane Katrina,1,3,4 no prior report has systematically reviewed all of theavailable death databases to accurately documentHurricane Katrina mortality in Louisiana.Our objectives were to verify and document the num- ber of deaths from Hurricane Katrina among peoplein Louisiana at the time of the storm and to charac-terize the storm's mortality burden by victim demo-graphics, geographic location, timeline, and cause ofdeath. This report is the first to combine multiple death databases to assess the number of storm-related deathsamong Louisiana residents and people who were in Louisiana at the time of the storm and to provideinformation regarding the causes of death. The find-ings in this report will aid public health and emer- gency preparedness efforts and may help reduce themortality burden in future natural disasters. METHODS Data Sources Data sources included the Hurricane Katrina Disaster Mortuary Operational Response Team (DMORT) da-tabase and death certificates collected through Louisi- ana vital statistics and out-of-state coroners' offices.RESEARCH Disaster Medicine and Public Health Preparedness 1 Published on August 28, 2008 Copyright 2008 by American Medical Association.DMORT is a federal response team that provides assistance with mortuary activities during disaster situations. Out-of-state death certificates of Louisiana residents during the pe- riod of August 27 to October 1, 2005, and others that state coroners deemed worth consideration for potential associa-tion with Hurricane Katrina were forwarded to the Louisianacoroner's office from coroners' offices in 26 states and theDistrict of Columbia. Katrina Classification The primary classification of Katrina-related deaths assigned by parish (county) coroners on death certificates was Inter- national Classification of Diseases -10 code X37, victim of cat- aclysmic storm. The majority of deaths had multiple hierar- chical cause-of-death classifications; however, if trauma,injury, or drowning was listed as a contributing cause ofdeath, these victims were categorized as drowning or injuryvictims in our database. A systematic review of all of the records in the DMORT database and of Louisiana deathcertificates yielded a final database of confirmed victims. Anumber of quality-assurance cross-checks were conducted,including ensuring no duplication of records across datasources and date of death occurring within a plausible time-line (August 27-October 31, 2005) and within the geo- graphic location for Katrina-related deaths (ie, death occur- ring in or victim evacuated from the affected southeasternLouisiana parishes). All deaths occurring before August 29,2005 and after October 1, 2005 were reviewed to verify thatHurricane Katrina was listed as a contributing cause of death,and all of the deaths occurring after September 23, 2005 werereviewed to determine whether they were associated withHurricane Rita, which struck southwest Louisiana on Sep-tember 24, 2005. The final case definition for Katrina-relateddeaths in this analysis included all of the deaths in theDMORT database that were determined to be Katrina re-lated, all Louisiana death certificates with victim of cataclys-mic storm listed as the primary or a contributing cause of death, and out-of-state death certificates for Louisiana resi-dents that were classified as related to Hurricane Katrina. Data from Louisiana vital statistics were collected at the local levels through parish coroners' offices and then sent to thestate level. Data from all 3 sources (DMORT, vital statistics,and out-of-state death certificates) were entered into anAccess (Microsoft Corporation, Seattle, WA) database. De-scriptive and inferential statistics were calculated using Stataversion 9.1 (StataCorp College Station, TX). We calcu-lated age-, race-, and sex-specific mortality rates (per 10,000population) for victims in Orleans, St Bernard, and JeffersonParishes, where 95% of Katrina's victims resided. We con-ducted stratified analyses by parish of residence to comparedifferences between observed proportions of victim demo-graphic characteristics (sex, race/ethnicity, and age) and ex-pected values based on 2000 US Census data, using Pearsonchi square and Fisher exact tests. We further stratified by racewithin each age category, where sufficient observations ex-isted, to determine whether there was an age-specific effect of race among victims. We limited our comparative analyses toOrleans, St Bernard, and Jefferson Parishes. Mapping Using Geographic Information Systems To identify high-mortality geographic areas, Louisiana death records with addresses (n /H11005687) were geocoded using Envi- ronmental Systems Research Institute's ArcGIS version 9.2 (Redlands, CA). Most records were geocoded using the En- vironmental Systems Research Institute street file referencegeospatial layer, which was used to match the address forlocation of death to the street file address. Records with onlya nursing facility name were matched to the address of the nursing facility in the Homeland Security Infrastructure Pro-gram Public Health, Nursing Home geospatial layer. Ethical Review The study protocol was reviewed by the human subjects coordinator at the Office of Workforce and Career Develop-ment, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and de- termined to be a public health response that did not require further human subjects review. RESULTS We identified 971 Katrina-related deaths that occurred in Louisiana and at least 15 deaths that occurred among Loui-siana Katrina evacuees in other states, for a conservative storm-related death total of 986 victims. The state coroner was forwarded 446 out-of-state death certificates for Louisi-ana residents. Of these, 15 were clearly related to HurricaneKatrina, and 431 were classified as indeterminate because noindication of hurricane association was listed on the death certificate. Our total mortality estimate of 986 victims likelyrepresents a lower bound estimate for Katrina mortality inLouisiana. Including all deaths classified as indeterminate(DMORT, n /H1100523; and out-of-state, n /H11005431) yields an upper bound estimate of 1440. We limited all subsequent analysesto deaths we determined to be related to Hurricane Katrina (n/H11005986). Cause of Death Excluding the 15 out-of-state deaths, we found that of the 971 people who died in Louisiana as a result of HurricaneKatrina, data on cause of death were available for 800 people. Three hundred eighty-seven victims drowned, and 246 peo- ple sustained trauma or injuries severe enough to cause theirdeaths. The mechanism of injury was unspecified for 226trauma or injury deaths; specified injury-related causes ofdeath included heat exposure (n /H110056), unintentional firearms death (n /H110054), homicide (n /H110052), suicide (n /H110054), gas poisoning (n/H110053), and electrocution (n /H110051; Table 1). Victim Demographic Characteristics Among the 971 Hurricane Katrina victims who died in Louisiana, 512 (53%) were men; 498 (51%) were black(non-Hispanic/Latino); 403 (42%) were white (non-Hispanic/ Latino), and 18 (2%) were Hispanic/Latino (Table 2). OtherHurricane Katrina Deaths, Louisiana, 2005 2 Disaster Medicine and Public Health Preparedness VOL. /NO.victim races included Asian (n /H110054), American Indian (n /H11005 4), and other (n /H110051). Data on race/ethnicity were missing for 42 victims (4%), age was missing for 22 victims (2%), and sex was missing for 4 victims ( /H110211%). The mean age of Katrina victims was 69.0 years (95% con- fidence interval [CI], 67.8-70.2), and their age range was 0 to102 years. Approximately 50% of the people who died as aresult of Hurricane Katrina in Louisiana were 75 years old and older. Fewer than 10% of victims were younger than 45years old. In Orleans Parish, where the majority of victimslived and died, all age categories of victims (except those45-54 years old) were divergent from the overall parish agedistribution of the population. The most dramatic difference occurred among people 75 years old and older (Pearson chi square [ /H92732] 2400; degrees of freedom ( df)/H110051;P/H11021.0001; Table 3). In Orleans Parish, men were more affected ( /H9273217.4, df/H110051,P/H11021.001), and women were less affected ( /H9273218.7, df/H110051,P/H11021.001) by storm mortality, relative to their underlying population distributions. In both St Bernard and Jefferson Parishes, the sex and racial distributions of Katrina victims were not significantly different ( P/H11022.05) from census population figures for those parishes, except for Hispanic/Latino victims in St Bernard Parish ( P/H11005.03; Table 2). In Orleans Parish, the mortality rate among blacks was 1.7 to 4 times higher than among whites for people 18 years old andolder, indicating that the effect of age on mortality con-founded the effect of race. Chi square and Fisher exact testsassessing differences in proportions of black and white vic-tims within age groups found that blacks were significantly more likely to be storm victims than whites in all age group categories 30 years old and older in Orleans Parish ( P/H11021.05). Race-specific mortality rates were also higher among blacks55 to 64 years old in St Bernard Parish and 75 years old andolder in Jefferson Parish, but results from race- and age-specific stratified analyses in these 2 parishes are limited bysmall number of observations (n /H113495). Among the largest age cohort of victims (people 75 years old and older), we furtherstratified by both race and sex in Orleans and St BernardParishes and found that black men 75 years old and older were significantly overrepresented in Orleans Parish ( P/H11021 .001; Table 2). Timeline Of 799 deaths in vital statistics records in which date of death was recorded, 650 (81%) occurred on August 29, 2005.Seven deaths occurred in the 2 days preceding the storm and 4 deaths occurred after October 31, 2005 (Fig. 1). For the 171 victims who were listed only in DMORT and for whom adate of death was not specified, date when victims were foundwas available for 129 people. The majority of these people(n/H1100582, 64%) were recovered during the second and third weeks after the storm (September 5-19, 2005). Where Victims Lived and Died Data on parish of residence and parish of death were available for 934 and 854 people, respectively. The majority of hurri-cane victims lived in Orleans Parish (73%), followed by St Bernard (17%), Jefferson (5%), Plaquemines (1%), and St Tammany Parishes (1%). died in OrleansParish (70%), St Bernard Parish (14%), Jefferson Parish(4%), and East Baton Rouge Parish (3%). Data on bothparish of residence and death were available for 844 storm victims; more than 80% of these victims died in their parishof residence. Sixty-five percent of Hurricane Katrina victimsin Louisiana died of injury or drowning. The majority of thesedeaths occurred in Eastern Orleans Parish, specifically thelower ninth ward; in Lakeview and Gentilly, adjacent to LakePontchartrain; and in St Bernard Parish (Figs. 2 and 3). Drowning and injury-related deaths occurred predominantly near levee infrastructure breaches. Data related to place of death or where victims were found were available for 877 people (Table 3). Deaths or placeswhere victims' bodies were recovered occurred predomi-nantly in residences (36%), hospitals (22%), and nursingfacilities (12%). More than 25% of victims (n /H11005262) were found in other locations, including roadways, the New Or-leans airport, the Convention Center, and the Superdome.For the deaths recorded in the DMORT database only thatdid not have date of death available, it is unclear whether theperson died at the location or the body was brought to the location after death. The date the body was found was avail-able for 129 of 171 people that appear only in the DMORTdatabase. Of these 129 people, 80 (62%) were recoveredbefore September 15, 2005. At least 70 people who were classified as hospital inpatients died during the period August 29, 2005 to September 2,2005, in New Orleans hospitals and an additional 57 victimswere recovered from New Orleans hospitals and brought tothe DMORT facility from September 5 to 12, 2005. FromAugust 29 to September 3, 2005, at least 71 people died innursing facilities in Orleans, St Bernard, and Jefferson Par-ishes, and an additional 7 bodies were recovered from nursingTABLE 1 Cause of Death: Katrina-Related Mortality in Louisiana, 2005 Cause of Death No. % Drowning 387 40 Injury and trauma Mechanism specified 20 2Mechanism unspecified 226 23 Illness Heart disease 107 11Other illness* 46 5Unspecified, Katrina-related 185 19 Total 971 100 *Diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, septicemia, and cancer.Hurricane Katrina Deaths, Louisiana, 2005 Disaster Medicine and Public Health Preparedness 3TABLE 2 Demographic Data for Katrina-Related Deaths: Louisiana, 2005 All Victims (N /H11549971)* Orleans Parish (n /H11549682) St Bernard Parish (n /H11549157) Jefferson Parish (n /H1154942) Characteristic No. (%) Rate No. (%) Census, % P\u00a7 Rate No. (%) Census, % P Rate No. (%) Census, % P Sex Male 512 (53) 16 374 (55) 47 /H11021.001 20 64 (41) 48 .06 1 21 (50) 48 .80 Female 455 (47) 12 306 (45) 53 /H11021.001 27 93 (59) 52 .06 1 21 (50) 52 .80 Race/ethnicity /H20841/H20841 Black 498 (51) 14 459 (67) 67 .69 24 12 (8) 8 .98 1 10 (24) 23 .86 White 403 (42) 15 196 (29) 27 .20 25 141 (90) 84 .06 1 31 (74) 65 .25Hispanic/Latino 18 (2) 8 14 (2) 3 .13 6 2 (1) 5 .03 0 1 (2) 7 .37 Age, years /H1102118\u00b6 20 (2) 1 9 (1) 27 /H11021.001 1 1 (1) 25 /H11021.001 0 0 (0) 25 /H11021.001 Black 10 1 9 80 .22 5 1 11 .11White 0 0 0 13 .62 0 0 80 .20 18-29 18 (2) 2 14 (2) 19 /H11021.001 0 0 (0) 16 /H11021.001 0 0 (0) 16 .001 Black 13 2 12 66 .16 0 0 9 \u2014White 5 1 2 26 .54 0 0 82 \u2014 30-44 47 (5) 3 30 (4) 22 /H11021.001 6 9 (6) 23 /H11021.001 0 2 (5) 23 /H11021.01 Black 31 4 27 64 /H11021.01 9 1 7 .50 White 15 1 3 29 .03 6 8 85 1.00 45-54 119 (12) 14 91 (13) 13 .88 17 16 (10) 14 .18 1 5 (12) 14 .83 Black 78 18 72 63 /H11021.01 18 1 6 1.00 White 38 8 16 31 /H11021.01 19 15 87 .71 55-64 137 (14) 25 95 (14) 8 /H11021.001 39 23 (15) 9 /H11021.01 2 8 (19) 9 .05 Black 80 31 72 61 /H11021.01 180 5 5 /H11021.01 White 54 19 23 32 .08 33 17 88 .05 65-74 136 (14) 36 104 (15) 6 /H11021.001 38 20 (13) 8 .02 1 4 (10) 7 .36 Black 85 50 80 55 /H11021.001 114 2 3 .14 White 43 17 19 38 /H11021.001 34 16 90 .13 /H1135075 472 (49) 121 338 (50) 6 /H11021.001 221 88 (56) 6 /H11021.001 10 23 (55) 5 /H11021.001 Black 198 (42) 150 186 (55) 44 /H11021.001 183 2 (2) 3 1.00 27 5 (22) 8 .03 Male 96 214 91 34 /H11021.001 476 2 39 .15 2 Female 102 117 95 66 /H11021.001 0 0 61 .15 3 White 247 (52) 94 133 (39) 51 /H11021.001 234 85 (97) 91 .12 8 17 (74) 86 .13 Male 90 120 56 33 .03 154 21 38 .01 7Female 157 81 77 67 .03 282 64 62 .01 10 *Missing values: sex (n /H110054), race (n /H1100542), age (n /H1100522).

Out-of-State Deaths The state coroner's office received 446 death certificates from26 states and the District of Columbia for Louisiana residentswho died from August 27 to October 1, 2005 and other death certificates that coroners' offices deemed worthy of consider- ation for potential association with Hurricane Katrina. Themajority of out-of-state deaths occurred in Texas (221, 50%),followed by Alabama (47, 11%) and Mississippi (43, 10%).Of the 446 Louisiana residents who died out of state, 53% were female; 59% were white; and their mean age was 67.3years (95% CI 65.3%-69.3%). The majority of evacuees had lived in Orleans Parish (40%), Jefferson Parish (22%), St Tam-many Parish (5%), and St Bernard Parish (4%). Seventeenout-of-state deaths (4%) occurred among Calcasieu Parish res-idents, likely Hurricane Rita evacuees. Of the 446 deaths, only15 people were classified as Katrina-related deaths by a statecoroner and thus included in our final mortality count. DISCUSSION This report provides a conservative estimate of deaths that occurred in New Orleans and Louisiana associated with Hur-ricane Katrina. We document at least 971 Katrina-related deaths among people in Louisiana and 15 deaths among Louisiana Katrina evacuees. Older adults were clearly themost affected population cohort during Hurricane Katrina,particularly people 75 years old and older, who made up 49%of victims in Louisiana, whereas their age cohort represents fewer than 6% of both the greater New Orleans and theoverall Louisiana population. Children and younger adultswere underrepresented among storm victims relative to theirproportional population size. A total of 178 people 75 years old and older died in their homes, 115 of drowning. There are at least 2 possible expla-nations for these findings. The first is that older people may 7650 54 2913 13 12 55 344 0100200300400500600700 Before 8/29/058/29/2005 Week 1 Week 2 Week 3 Week 4 Week 5 Week 6 Week 7 Week 8 Week 9 After10/30/2005 DateNumber of DeathsFIGURE 1 Timeline of Hurricane Katrina-related deaths in Louisiana, vital statistics (N /H11549799)TABLE 3 Place of Death or Where Body Was Found (N /H11549877) Location No. % Residence 317 36 Hospital Inpatient 168 19Emergency department 24 3Dead on arrival 3 /H110211 Nursing facility 103 12Convention center 10 1New Orleans International Airport 14 2Superdome 7 1Other location 231 26Hurricane Katrina Deaths, Louisiana, 2005 Disaster Medicine and Public Health Preparedness 5have been less likely to leave their homes during the storm evacuation because of prior experience with false alarmsregarding the intensity and potential threat of a hurricane, fear of their abandoned homes being looted, or not wanting to be separated from medical or other routines. Anotherpossible explanation is that older people are more likely todie of drowning and injury during a hurricane or flood andthat comorbidities contribute to their vulnerability to storm- associated mortality. It is likely that both factors contributedto the disproportionate representation of people 75 years oldand older among Katrina victims. In the days following Hurricane Katrina, multiple large hos- pitals in New Orleans flooded and were reportedly operatingwithout power or sanitation services in extreme heat 5while ambient temperatures in the greater New Orleans area were /H1135090\u00b0F (32\u00b0C) during the days and weeks following Hurri- cane Katrina.6As a result of rapidly deteriorating conditions in the New Orleans hospitals and extreme difficulties inevacuating their existing patients, hospitals in the downtownNew Orleans area were reportedly not admitting new patients in the days following the storm. 5At least 70 hospital inpa- tients died in New Orleans hospitals, and an additional 57storm victims' bodies were recovered from hospitals in the daysimmediately following the storm, indicating that their storm-related cause of death occurred in the hospital. The poweroutages and dire conditions reported in certain New Orleanshospitals after the storm underscore the importance of disasterpreparedness. Hospitals in hurricane-prone areas should ensurethat adequate generators are available in elevated locations thatare not prone to flooding. Water, food, and other supplies shouldbe available to maximize the likelihood that patients usingventilators and other life-support interventions will survive if asimilar emergency situation occurs. More than 70 people died innursing facilities in Orleans, St Bernard, and Jefferson Parisheson August 29, 2005 and in the days immediately followingHurricane Katrina, indicating that more targeted emergencyand disaster preparedness planning, especially with respect toevacuation capability, is needed for these types of institutions. FIGURE 2 Location of Hurricane Katrina deaths, southeast Louisiana, 2005 (N /H11549687)Hurricane Katrina Deaths, Louisiana, 2005 6 Disaster Medicine and Public Health Preparedness VOL. /NO.The overall proportions of deaths among non-Hispanic blacks and whites in the most affected parishes\u2014Orleans, StBernard, and Jefferson\u2014were remarkably consistent with their pre-Katrina race/ethnicity distributions from the 2000 US Census (Table 2). However, stratified analyses evaluatingthe effect of race within age groups revealed that the domi-nant effect of age on overall storm mortality masked the differential effect of race in most age groups in Orleans Parish, where race-specific mortality rates were on average2.5 times higher among blacks compared with whites. Olderblack people in Orleans Parish, particularly men, were dis-proportionately represented relative to their underlying pop-ulation distribution. Of note, only 4 storm victims wereAsian, although Asians make up 2% of the Orleans Parishpopulation and 1% of the overall Louisiana population. 7 Although Hispanic/Latino and Asian race/ethnic groups ap- pear to have been less affected by storm mortality relative totheir proportional population size, victim numbers in thesegroups are small, limiting statistical interpretation. Similarly, small numbers of observations (n /H113495) in our stratified analyses of race/ethnicity within age groups in St Bernard and Jeffer- son Parishes limited our ability to assess potential associationsbetween demographic characteristics and mortality. The roleof poverty in Katrina mortality is unclear because we did nothave income data for victims, but socioeconomic status mer-its future research to determine whether age- and race-asso-ciated poverty may have increased the vulnerability of these populations or limited their ability to evacuate. The primary strength of this study is the use of multiple death databases to systematically verify each death as related toHurricane Katrina using consistent and specific criteria. In-corporating DMORT data allowed us to identify 171 victims who were not classified as Katrina related in vital statistics/death certificate data, including 17 victims whom coronerswere unable to identify by DNA matching or other methods.In large-scale high-mortality disasters, DMORTs should be FIGURE 3 Location of Hurricane Katrina deaths, Orleans Parish, 2005Hurricane Katrina Deaths, Louisiana, 2005 Disaster Medicine and Public Health Preparedness 7considered as an additional data source to better document mortality. Limitations This study is subject to a number of limitations. First, thedisaster response aftermath of Hurricane Katrina may havelimited the ability to precisely document all deaths. Al- though unlikely to be a large number, it is possible that some people who died during the storm were never found ordocumented. Second, classifying people who were evacuatedand later died out of state from Katrina-related causes isinherently difficult, especially as regards older people who had serious preexisting medical conditions. It is unknownwhether these people would have died had the storm oc-curred or not. It is also unknown whether the storm exacer-bated preexisting medical conditions enough to lead todeath. The majority of the 446 out-of-state deaths were fromchronic medical conditions, primarily heart disease, respira- tory disease, and cancer. The clearest association with Kat- rina in our review of out-of-state death certificates was 1person whose body was found in the Gulf of Mexico off theFlorida coast. His death certificate specified drowning whiletrying to save a family member who resided in the greaterNew Orleans area as the cause of death. Determining whether Hurricane Katrina contributed to out- of-state deaths was particularly difficult in instances in whichpatients died in hospitals during the days and weeks followingKatrina (n /H11005283), for suicides (n /H110055), for accidents (n /H11005 25) and for cases pending further investigation or toxicologyreports (n /H1100515). The role of Hurricane Katrina in the majority of the 446 out-of-state deaths will probably never beclearly delineated because coroners in different states may have used different criteria for classifying victims as stormrelated. The 15 deaths with victim of cataclysmic storm orother Katrina-related indications on their death certificatesalmost certainly represent a lower bound estimate of out-of-state deaths among Louisiana Katrina evacuees. Hurricane Katrina death data from Louisiana vital statistics first became available approximately 2 years after the storm.Instituting an electronic reporting system for recording deathcertificates would aid with timely use of data for both gov-ernment and community preparedness and disaster responseefforts. 8Alternately, if existing technological infrastructure is unavailable, active mortality surveillance efforts should be initiated immediately to document deaths in the early stages of rescue and recovery responses, not only to aid with accu- rate mortality reporting and victim identification but also tomobilize needed resources (eg, body bags, mobile laboratories,morgues) in a timely manner. CONCLUSIONS Despite the above limitations, this report provides the most complete picture of Katrina-related mortality in Louisiana todate. At least 986 people in Louisiana died as a result of Hurricane Katrina, making it the deadliest hurricane to strikethe US Gulf Coast in more than 75 years. To prevent hurricane-related mortality on this scale from occurring inthe future, disaster preparedness efforts must focus on evac-uating and caring for older people, including those residing inhospitals, long-term care facilities, and personal residences.Adequate mortality reporting in disaster settings, particularlywhen infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed, is vital toensuring timely collection of mortality data. Rapid identifi-cation of vulnerable populations and risk factors during di-sasters will enable response teams to provide appropriateinterventions to these populations and to prepare and imple-ment preventive measures before the next disaster. Projec-tions of a sustained or intensifying cycle of Atlantic Oceanhurricane activity throughout the coming decades 9,10and the unprecedented landfall of 2 category 5 storms (Dean and Felix) during the 2007 hurricane season underscore the crit- ical need for all levels of government to be ready to evacuate and care for vulnerable populations during future storms.
