Larry Goodman, MD President, Rush University; Chief Executive Officer, Rush University Medical Center 9 Rush University Medical Center Mission, Vision and Values Mission The mission of Rush University Medical Center is to provide the very best care for our patients. Our education and research endeavors, community service programs and relationships with other hospitals are dedicated to enhancing excellence in patient care for the diverse communities of the Chicago area now and in the future. Vision Rush University Medical Center will be recognized at the medi- cal center of choice in the Chicago area and among the very best in the United States. Core Values \"I CARE\" Innovation Collaboration AccountabilityRespect Excellence History of Rush University Medical Center Rush University Medical Center is one of Chicago's oldest health care organizations. Its heritage extends back to 1837 when Rush Medical College was established. St. Luke's Hospital, founded in 1864, and Presbyterian Hospital, founded in 1883, merged in 1956 to form Presbyterian-St. Luke's Hospital. The subsequent incorporation of these pioneer institutions in 1969 created Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center, which was renamed Rush University Medical Center in October 2003. Rush is a not-for-profit academic medical center comprising Rush University Medical Center, Rush University, Rush Oak Park Hospital and Rush Health. Renowned Patient Care Rush University Medical Center encompasses a 664-bed hospital serving adults and children, including the Johnston R. Bowman Health Center, which provides medical and rehabilita- tive care to older adults and people with short- and long-term disabilities.It includes Rush's 376-bed Tower hospital building, which opened in 2012 as part of the Medical Center's major campus renovation. Rush's commitment to sustainability innovation earned the Tower LEED Gold certification. It is the largest new construction health care project in the world to be LEED Gold certified. Rush's renovation also includes Rush's Orthopedic Building, which opened in 2010, and the ongoing campus-wide implementation of an electronic medical record system, enhanc - ing patient care and safety. A unique combination of research and patient care has earned Rush national rankings in 9 of 16 specialty areas in U.S.News & World Report's 2013-14 America's Best Hospitals issue, among other recognitions of our quality of care and accreditations. Our nurses are at the forefront of our efforts to provide quality care, receiving Magnet status three times for making outstanding nursing care the standard at the Medical Center. Rush was the first hospital in Illinois serving adults and children to receive Magnet status \u2014 the highest honor in nursing \u2014 and the first in Illinois to earn a third four-year designation. And some of the world's best athletes trust themselves to the hands of our physicians. Rush is proud to be the preferred hospi - tal for the Chicago Bulls. Educating Future Health Care Providers Rush University is home to one of the first medical colleges in the Midwest and one of the nation's top-ranked nursing col- leges, as well as graduate programs in allied health, health sys - tems management and biomedical research. The Medical Center also offers many highly selective residency and fellowship programs in medical and surgical specialties and subspecialties. Rush's unique practitioner-teacher model for health sciences education and research gives students the opportunity to learn from world-renowned instructors who practice what they teach. Committed to Community In addition to patient care, education and research, Rush maintains a strong commitment to the community. Many students, faculty and staff at Rush generously donate their time and skills both within and outside of the Medical Center. Their efforts include numerous health outreach projects in which Rush collaborates with neighborhood clinics, churches, schools and other organizations to provide health screenings and vital health information for underserved children and adults.10 Our education and research endeavors, community service pro- grams and relationships with other hospitals are dedicated to enhancing excellence in patient care for the diverse communities of the Chicago area \u2014 now and in the future. Larry J. Goodman, MD, is CEO of Rush University Medical Center and President of Rush University. He also serves as president of the Rush System for Health, and he is the principal officer of the Rush Board of Trustees. Rush University Mission, Vision and Values Mission The mission of Rush University is to teach, study and provide the highest quality health care, using a unique and multidisciplinary practitioner-teacher model for health sciences education and research, while reflecting the diversity of our communities in its programs, faculty, students and service. Vision Rush University will use a practitioner-teacher model to develop health care leaders who collaboratively translate and develop knowledge into outstanding health care outcomes. Core Values As the academic component of Rush University Medical Center, the University shares the Medical Center's core values: innova- tion, collaboration, accountability, respect and excellence. These I CARE values guide the efforts of Rush University students, faculty and researchers History of Rush University Rush University is the academic component of Rush University Medical Center. Founded in 1972, the University has expanded from one college and fewer than 100 students to four colleges and over 2,100 students. It includes Rush Medical College, the College of Nursing, the College of Health Sciences and The Graduate College. Rush Medical College is named for Benjamin Rush, a physi- cian from Pennsylvania, who also signed the Declaration of Independence. Rush Medical College was chartered in 1837 and opened officially on December 4, 1843 with 22 students enrolled in a 16-week course. During the first century of opera-tion, more than 10,000 physicians received their training at Rush Medical College. Rush Medical College was affiliated with the University of Chicago from 1898 until 1942, when the medical college temporarily suspended its educational program, though it continued its corporate existence. Its faculty contin- ued undergraduate and graduate teaching of medicine and the biological sciences as members of the faculty of the University of Illinois. The charter of the medical college was reactivated in 1969 when it became part of the Medical Center. Rush Medical College reopened in 1971 with a class of 66 first-year students and 33 third-year students. First-year class size reached its projected maximum of 120 in 1976. The College of Nursing represents a combined heritage dat- ing back to the late nineteenth century when its first anteced- ent, the St. Luke's Hospital School of Nursing, opened in 1885 to offer diploma education to nurses. In 1903, the Presbyterian Hospital School of Nursing accepted its first students. From 1956 to 1968 nurses were taught at the merged Presbyterian-St. Luke's Hospital School of Nursing. Before the establishment of the College of Nursing in 1972, more than 7,000 nurses had graduated from these three schools. The College of Health Sciences, established in 1975, traces its origins to the School of Medical Technology sponsored by Presbyterian-St. Luke's Hospital from 1959 to 1972. This school was the second largest of its kind in the city of Chicago. During its operation, it provided a one-year professional internship program to more than 200 baccalaureate students in medical technology. Today, the College of Health Sciences offers doctoral programs in audiology and health sciences, ten programs at the master's level and bachelor's programs in health sciences, imag-ing sciences, medical laboratory science, perfusion technology, respiratory care and vascular ultrasound and technology. The Graduate College was established as a separate aca- demic unit in January 1981, having previously been organized as the Graduate School within the College of Health Sciences. The Graduate College is responsible for educational programs in the basic sciences and offers master's and doctoral degrees in twelve disciplines. The Seal of Rush University The seal of Rush University is a shield, a classic Greek symbol of preservation and protection and also a medieval British emblem used for identification. As such, it recognizes the University's overarching commitment to educating health professionals who preserve life and protect patients and it is the distinguishing 11 identification of Rush University. Its two colors, green and gold, merge the tradition of the past with the custom of the present as gold was the single historical color of Rush Medical College and green is used for the modern Medical Center. The motto, ministrare per scientiam, translated from Latin, means to minister (care for or serve) through scientific knowledge. It was adopted by the Board of Trustees in September 1993 to reflect the commitment to educate car - ing professionals whose practice is based in knowledge. The shadow in the background is the anchor cross, a symbol of hope and steadfastness, which became the emblem of the merged Presbyterian and St. Luke's hospitals in 1957 and the founda-tion that created the vision for Rush University. Superimposed on top is the stylized version of the anchor cross that was adopted in 1971 upon the merger of Rush Medical College and Presbyterian-St. Luke's Hospital. The final elements are Chicago, the city that is home to the University, and the date of the University's founding, 1972. The Rush University Board of Overseers adopted the seal in 1999.

Drug Free Campus and Workplace Rush University Medical Center is committed to achieving and maintaining a drug-free campus and workplace. The Medical Center has established a drug-free policy consistent with its commitment and goals. The policy states in part: The illegal manufacture, distribution, dispensing, use, sale and/or possession of controlled substances on Medical Center property or while performing Medical Center business is strictly prohibited. An employee or student engaged in any such conduct will be subject to discipline up to and including expulsion or termination. In addition, students and employees are subject to all applicable criminal penalties under local, state or federal law for unlawful possession or distribution of illicit drugs and alcohol. Within five days of the conviction, employ- ees and students must report to the Medical Center any convic-tion for violation of a criminal drug statute occurring within the Medical Center. The health risks associated with the use of illicit drugs and the abuse of alcohol are many and varied. Some drugs may cause psychological and physical dependence or addiction. Others attack the central nervous system, making the user dangerous to himself and others. In the extreme, they can result in convulsions, psychosis, coma and possible death. Diversity, Equal Opportunity and Inclusion For over three decades, the Rush approach to equal opportunity, diversity and inclusion has not wavered. Our approach is that these are essential components of the best employment, educa - tional and health care practices and must be furthered. This is a continuation of a policy that emanated from the hospital charters of 1865 and 1883 and the documents governing the establish-ment of Rush University in 1972. In certain instances, the implementation of this policy and our goals in this area require the use of affirmative initiatives. At Rush, these initiatives are focused on strong recruitment, development and retention efforts, not on quotas \u2014 and these recruitment and programming efforts will be continued, consis - tent with federal, state and municipal guidelines. Rush University is committed to attracting students who will enable the student body to achieve the educational benefits of diversity and to providing services to all students, faculty and other employees on a nondiscriminatory, equitable basis. Discrimination or harassment against any member of the Rush University Medical Center community because of age, ancestry, color, disability as defined by Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act, gender, gen- der identity and/or expression, marital or parental status, national origin, pregnancy, race, religion, sexual orientation, veteran's status or any other category protected by federal or state law is prohibited and will not be tolerated, nor will any person for those reasons be excluded from the participation in or denied the benefits of any program or activity within Rush University. Shanon Shumpert, Director, Employee Relations and Equal Employment Opportunity Officer, has been designated to over - see the implementation of this policy for Rush University. Ms. Shumpert can be contacted by telephone at (312) 942-5239 or via email at Shanon_Shumpert@rush.edu Additional resources may be found in Human Resources along with the following university individuals/offices: Susan Chubinskaya, PhD Associate Provost, Academic Affairs Armour Academic Center 441A(312) 942-6306Susanna_Chubinskaya@rush.edu Paula J.

A reason- able accommodation is a modification or adjustment to an instructional activity, facility, program or service that enables a qualified student with a disability to have an equal opportunity to participate in all Rush University student activities. To be eligible for accommodations, a student must have a documented disability as defined by the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Both the ADA and Section 504 define disability as (a) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual; (b) a record of such impairment; or (c) being regarded as having such a condition.

Campus Housing Information pertaining to on-campus housing, including the application process and/or roommate selection, may be obtained from the Office of Student Life, Suite 984, Armour Academic Center. Center Court Gardens, located on Harrison Street across from the Chicago Marriott at Medical District/UIC, consists of apartment style living with almost 300 units available as studios, one-bedrooms and two-bedrooms. All apartments are unfur - nished, carpeted and have individually controlled heating and air conditioning, modern appliances and bathtubs with showers. Basic cable and internet are included in the rent. Electric and heating utilities are not included in the rent. Application Process Students can apply for housing upon their acceptance to Rush University. Applications for both new and returning students 22 are available from the Office of Student Life, Suite 984 Armour Academic Center, or via the web at www.rushu.rush.edu/ studentlife/housing. Because on-campus housing is in great demand, Rush University has established the following set of priorities for assigning students to available units. Students in category number one receive the highest priority followed by those in category number two, etc. Returning undergraduate, graduate and professional students who apply for on-campus housing by the advertised deadline. Incoming undergraduate, graduate and professional students who begin their academic program in the summer academic term and have been accepted for admission and apply by April 15th. Incoming undergraduate, graduate and professional students who begin their academic program in the fall academic term and have been accepted for admission and apply for housing by May 1st. These priorities will be used as a guide when assigning housing. Returning students who fail to submit a housing application for the succeeding year the advertized deadline will lose his or her number one priority. Rush University reserves the right to make exceptions to these priorities when extenuating circumstances exist. Apartment types available: Notification of acceptance into University housing will be sent to each student assigned to on-campus housing. New students must receive an acceptance for admission to the university before any housing notification will be sent. Entering students whose program of study begins in the summer academic term will be sent housing assignments by the beginning of May. Students who begin their programs in the fall will receive hous- ing assignments by the end of May. Returning students will receive their housing notifications in April. Students starting in the winter or spring academic term will receive their housing assignment anytime after May 1st. Lease and Deposit A lease is included with each letter of acceptance into University housing. The lease, accompanied by a security deposit equal to one month's rent, must be signed and returned. Failure to return the lease and the security deposit by the specified deadline will result in the loss of the housing assignment. Students are billed for rent along with tuition and fees prior to the beginning of each academic term. Consolidation Policy In an effort to maximize the number of on-campus housing spaces available to Rush University students, consolidation of tenants may occur. This consolidation policy will affect only those students who occupy an apartment by themselves that was originally leased to two or more students. Such a situation can occur when a roommate leaves University housing during the course of the academic year. If consolidation is necessary, students involved will be informed in writing. At that time the student will have the following options: 1) share an apartment with another student in any building who is also in need of a roommate, 2) find a Rush University student roommate of his or her choice, 3) have a roommate assigned from the available applications, or 4) pay the full rent of the apartment. If the fourth option is chosen, the apartment will become a single accommodation only through the end of the current lease. If the student wishes to renew the lease, the student will have the option of remaining in the apartment with the understand- ing that he or she will receive a roommate or will be given an opportunity to move to another available apartment. Students should address questions concerning the application process, assignment process, or roommate selection to the Office of Student Life. The Office of Student Life is also available to assist students with their off-campus housing needs. Information regarding local apartment listings, transportation, Internet resources, etc., is available. Students are also encouraged to check bulletin boards throughout Armour Academic Center and in the Office of Student Life for apartment leads within walking distance to Rush, including the University Village/Little Italy neighbor - hoods. An off-campus housing guide is available on the housing website (www.rushu.rush.edu/studentlife/housing) to assist in making decisions such as how much rent can be afforded, what commuting distance is acceptable, and if finding a roommate will be necessary. Rush University accepts no responsibility for off-campus arrangements.

Since then, the program has grown to include all disciplines within Rush University.

All degree requirements have been successfully completed, 2. A completed Degree Approval form has been submitted to the Office of the Registrar, and 3. T he official date of graduation for a particular term has been reached. A student who disregards this policy will be referred to the committee that addresses professional ethics violations for that student's program or college. Continuous Enrollment Rush University requires continuous enrollment in the majority of its academic programs from the time a student matriculates through a student's graduation. Exemptions for the summer term only include both first-year medical students and Health Systems Management majors. Students who are not officially enrolled or have not submit- ted a Petition for Leave of Absence or Voluntary Withdrawal form risk being administratively withdrawn from the University. A student enrolled in a noncredit residency or academic enrichment program prior to receipt of his or her degree must be registered for the Continuous Enrollment course to retain his or her student status. Any degree or certificate student not enrolling in a new course but needing to replace an outstanding incomplete grade must register for the continuous enrollment course until the grade is satisfied. A student who is auditing a course and not allowed in other courses during the same term must register for the Continuous Enrollment course to be charged appropriately. Credit by Proficiency A student who passes a proficiency examination at Rush University will earn academic credit toward the degree. Programs have the discretion to offer credit for proficiency and/ or achieved prior learning. Rush Medical College does not offer credit for proficiency. Credit for proficiency and/or achieved prior learning is based upon documented equivalence with courses offered by the program.29 The minimum standards and format for demonstrating profi- ciency are determined by program faculty. Formats for dem- onstrating proficiency may include departmentally developed examinations, licensure/certification exams, portfolios and competency demonstrations. Credit awarded for proficiency will equal the credit value of the course(s) as listed in the RUCatalog under which the student matriculated. Information that is posted on the transcript is the prefix, number and title of the course section along with the grade of \"K.\" Credit for the course will appear in the student's term and cumulative totals as credit earned. Credit earned by this mechanism will not be used in calculating the student's grade point average (GPA). A transcript guide that accompanies all transcripts issued by the Office of the Registrar explains that the K grade means credit was earned through proficiency examination. A fee or partial tuition related to what the student would have been charged may be assessed. Academic Credit Academic credit is awarded to a student upon the success-ful completion of an approved instructional course or by the demonstration of competencies, proficiencies or fulfillment of learning outcomes equivalent to that provided by an approved instructional course. One unit of academic credit is the measure of the total time commitment a typical student is expected to devote to learn- ing per week of study. Total time devoted to learning includes but is not limited to: classroom or faculty instruction in either a synchronous or asynchronous mode; time devoted to individual conferences with instructors; reading and completion of learning activities and assignments; posting in online discussion folders; performance demonstrations; examinations; work associated with completion of capstone assignments, thesis, or disserta - tions; laboratory work; clinical practica; or any other activity required of the student. One hour of credit is an amount of work represented in intended learning outcomes and verified by evidence of student achievement that reasonably approximates not less than one hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out-of-class student work each week for approxi- mately 15 weeks for one semester or one trimester hour of credit or 10 to 12 weeks for one quarter hour of credit, or the equivalent of at least 37.5 hours of work for one semester or one trimester hour of credit, or 25 hours of work for one quarter hour of credit. In this context, an hour of work is defined as 50 minutes. Course credits are not calculated for Rush Medical College and 2nd- or 3rd-year Physician Assistant Studies courses; however, the number of weeks of clinical experiences appears on the student's transcript. Credit hour assignment for time spent in clinical practica, internships, seminars and labora- tory work vary according to college or program requirements. Grade Point Average The student's undergraduate and graduate transcripts show a grade point average (GPA) for each term in which grade points were earned and show cumulative GPA for all work taken at Rush in a particular academic level. When a course is repeated, only the most recent attempt is computed in the GPA; although both grades remain on the transcript. The GPA is computed by dividing the number of earned grade points by the number of hours of credit attempted for those courses. No grade points are assigned for work taken on a pass/ no pass basis, and therefore, are not computed in the GPA. Undergraduate students who are required to enroll in courses that typically are taught at the graduate level will have these courses count toward their undergraduate programs of study; thus, the credits and grade points will be calculated as part of the undergraduate transcript. A grade point average is not calculated for Rush Medical College students since courses are taken under an honors/high pass/pass/fail grading scheme. Grade Report Students can access RUConnected for their grade report. Grade reports are not mailed to students. Printed copies of a student's grade report are unofficial and intended for the student's personal use and should not be accepted by another college/university in lieu of an official transcript.30 Gr ade P oints Description A 4.0 Excellent B 3.0 Good C 2.0 Satisfactory for undergr aduates but may not be acceptable at the gr aduate level D 1.0 Minimal pass for some undergr aduate programs.

Application for Graduation All degree-seeking students must submit both Intent to Graduate and Degree Approval forms to the Office of the Registrar by the published deadlines. Students who do not sub- mit either the Intent to Graduate form or the Degree Approval form by the published deadline risk a delayed graduation and may be charged a processing fee. The student's signature on the Intent to Graduate form signals that the student is ready to graduate; allows, only for purposes of the ceremony, the release of directory information restric- tions enacted by the student through his or her signature on the Directory Information Restrictions form; permits release of the student's name and address to the external photography vendor with whom Rush contracts and to have the vendor place pho- tographs of the student on its website; permits the University to publish the student's picture in a picture composite; for medical students, permits publication of the student's name, photograph, prior degrees and universities/colleges attended in the Rush Medical College yearbook; permits Rush University to print and/ or announce the following: Student's name as indicated on the Intent to Graduate form Honors or awards received Previous colleges/universities attended Prior degrees earned Degree Approval The Degree Approval form must be submitted after all academic degree requirements are completed. These include: All program prerequisites, including general education requirements All courses required in the major program of study and completion of required cumulative credit hours Residency requirements Dissertation/thesis defense (if required by college) Submission of the dissertation/thesis to the library (if applicable) Achievement of the minimum cumulative GPA of 2.0 for undergraduate and 3.0 for graduate students (not applicable to RMC)Commencement Although Rush University has multiple graduation dates during which degrees are conferred, the University has only one com - mencement ceremony held in the spring. Only Rush University students who are candidates for a degree may participate in the commencement ceremony. Certificate candidates are ineligible to participate. The exact date for commencement is published in the academic calendar. Students will be notified by the Division of Student Affairs concerning participation in the event. All commencement inquiries should be directed to ru_commencement@rush.edu. Students are invited to participate in the commencement cer - emony if: They graduated in the fall, winter or spring term immediately preceding the current academic year's ceremony They are anticipated to graduate at the end of the spring or summer terms that immediately follow the current academic year's ceremony Doctoral students writing a dissertation and master's students writing a thesis must provide the title of their dissertation/thesis by the date indicated on the Degree Approval Form in order to have that title included in the commencement program. Publication of a student's name, academic credentials and/or dissertation/thesis title in the commencement program does not indicate that a degree has been officially conferred by Rush University. Should a program director feel that an exception should be granted to the commencement participation policy, she or he must appeal in writing to the dean of her or his college. At the same time, the program director must inform the Office of the Registrar that an appeal has been submitted so that the Office of the Registrar can inform the college of any reason why the request should be denied. The final decision rests with the dean of the college. The dean must inform the program director and the Office of the Registrar of her or his decision. Students whose academic plans change, making them ineligible to participate in the Commencement ceremony, will be then eligible to participate the following ceremony should they suc- cessfully meet degree requirements. Students will be notified of all outstanding obligations, and the Office of the Registrar will encumber the diplomas and transcripts of students until these obligations are met. 32 Awarding of Degrees Rush University degrees are dated the day following the last day of the term in which the degree requirements are com-pleted. Degree requirements must be fully met before the next term officially begins; otherwise, the student will be required to register for the subsequent term and will graduate at the end of that term. The student's transcript, diploma and other notifica- tion of degree conferrals will be held until a student's financial obligation has been met. Outstanding financial obligations have no effect on the awarding of degrees. Latin Honors Candidates for the Bachelor of Science degree who have demonstrated academic excellence are honored at commence- ment by the Rush University faculty. Those earning a 3.40 to 3.59 cumulative grade point average at Rush are awarded the Bachelor of Science degree cum laude; 3.60 to 3.79, magna cum laude; 3.80 to 4.00, summa cum laude. Only Rush University courses are calculated into the GPA. Latin honors appear on the student's transcript and diploma and are typi- cally announced during the graduation exercises, including the Commencement ceremony and at college/departmental convo-cation/awards ceremonies. Graduation Prizes and Awards Many prizes and awards are given at the time of graduation. Award winners are identified in the Commencement ceremony program and in college/departmental convocation/awards ceremony programs. A current list of prizes and awards is avail - able at http://www.rushu.rush.edu/acadresources/graduation/prizesawards.pdf Thesis/Dissertation Requirements for Graduation Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) candidates must complete a disser - tation. Some master's programs require a thesis to meet degree requirements. Each thesis or dissertation must be original and cannot have been used to meet the requirement of any other degree, either at Rush University or any other university. Each student will have a committee whose role is to assure that the student's thesis/dissertation is of high quality and meets the standards of the program and the University for original- ity, contribution to the field and scholarly presentation. Review of a thesis or dissertation will follow the sequence of steps as described by each college, including the prescribed preparation manual for each degree. Students must give a public presentation of the knowledge developed through the thesis or dissertation process to the academic community. Public presentation of the thesis or dissertation must precede the final approval by the thesis or dissertation committee. A copy of the thesis or dissertation must be approved by the Director o the Library of Rush University Medical Center for con- formance to publishing requirements and copyright compliance.

Students are notified at the time of admission of the health requirements for matriculation into the University. Students who do not submit the proper proof of fulfilled health requirements by the designated deadline will be prohibited from registering for the next term and from continuing as a student. Incomplete Grades The grade of incomplete (\"I\") is given only when circumstances beyond the student's control prevent completion of course requirements and the student has received permission to defer completion of these unmet course requirements. Students must be enrolled during the term in which course requirements are completed. Students enrolling only to com- plete requirements for a course in which a grade of incomplete was given must register for the Continuous Enrollment course (XXX999) for zero credit hours. Upon completion of the course requirements the (\"I\") grade will be replaced by the new grade earned in the course. A student receiving a grade of (\"I\") in a course may not begin another course for which the incomplete course is a prerequisite. A student who fails to remove the incomplete grade within the specified time period will receive a final grade of \"F\" or \"N\" in the course. It is the student's responsibility to pursue the completion of an incomplete grade Students in the College of Nursing, College of Health Sciences, The Graduate College and students-at-large must complete the unmet course requirements, typically within one term after the term in which the incomplete grade was assigned and not to exceed one calendar year, unless an extension is approved. Students in the College of Nursing may not register for new courses if they have two or more incomplete grades. Rush Medical College students will be informed by the course instructor and the Office of Medical Student Programs regarding the specific time frame in which an incomplete grade must be resolved. Additional college specific policies may apply. Pass/No Pass Grading Option The pass/no pass option is college- and course-specific, as is the proportion of courses that can be taken pass/no pass. The Course Schedule indicates all courses that may be taken pass/ no pass. The decision to take a course for a pass/no pass grade cannot be changed after the first Friday of the term. Repeated Courses Some courses, such as research and clinical courses, may be repeated. These are usually indicated in the course description. All grades and grade points are counted in the GPA for these courses. For all other courses that are repeated, only the most 34 recent grade is counted in the GPA. Both the original course and the repeated course appear on the student's transcript. Repeated Courses: Rush Medical College All instances of a course are represented on the students' official transcript. Course and exam remediations are also represented. Room Reservations To schedule the use of classrooms, lecture halls and auditoriums in the Armour Academic Center, individuals should request a room from the Office of the Registrar. The Office of the Registrar will assist in making room reservations for classes, meetings and campus events based on room availability. Priority for rooms is given to instructional/class meetings, followed by standing meet- ings, ad-hoc meetings, student organizations and other requests on a first-come, first-served basis. Student events must have the approval of the Office of Student Life regarding the date/time and either the organization faculty sponsor's or the Office of Student Life verification regarding the sponsorship of the event. RULearning (Blackboard) RULearning (Blackboard) is a web-based learning management system for course management and delivery. Instructors may use Blackboard to provide students with course materials, discus- sion boards, online exams, virtual chats and more. The degree to which Blackboard is used in a course varies. Some courses may be conducted entirely online through Blackboard, without any on-campus sessions while others may use Blackboard as a supplement to face-to-face sessions. Account Creation Students will have RULearning accounts created for them automatically when they have a Rush email account created and register for a course that requires Blackboard access. Students will receive their RULearning account through their Rush email. Account Deactivation RULearning accounts for students will remain active for the dura - tion of their affiliation with the university. Students' accounts will be deactivated 14 days after their graduation or their affiliation with the University ends. Course Availability and Retention Courses in RULearning are available to students on the start date of the term. Courses will be retained in RULearning for one year past their expected end date. At the end of this period of time, courses will be archived and removed from RULearning. Students will be informed how to download relevant information from their courses that they might need after leaving Rush. System Availability The Blackboard system is available on campus via the Rush net- work and off campus via public Internet. System maintenance is performed every Sunday between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m. CST. The system may be unavailable during this time. Students-at-Large Individuals not admitted to a degree program but who want to enroll in a course may do so by completing the appropriate student-at-large registration form. Students are not allowed to take Rush Medical College courses as a student-at-large. An instructor is not obligated to accept any student-at-large in his or her class, and students without appropriate background take courses at their own risk. Students in degree programs have priority enrollment over students registering for the at- large-status. At-large students registered for a course may be removed from the course if a degree-seeking student wishes to enroll in the class. If a student cannot be accommodated in a class, a full refund will be issued. A student may accumulate no more than 12 quarter hours of academic credit as a student-at-large. These hours may be taken within one term or over a period of time. Registration as a student-at-large that results in more than the allowable number of hours in the student-at-large status can only be authorized by the dean (or his or her designate) of the college offering the courses. Credit earned as a student-at-large will not necessarily apply toward a Rush degree, if the individual is subsequently admitted to a degree program. Any incomplete (\"I\") grade earned as a student at large will revert to a permanent failing grade (\"F\") unless completed by the end of the next academic term. It is the student's responsibility to pursue the completion of an incom- plete grade. Student-at-large forms must be submitted with tuition payment or will not be processed. Student Email Accounts Rush University creates an email account for each student during the student's first term. Students are expected to check their email account with regular frequency since Rush University considers email an official means of communication. Often, students are notified of important news and deadlines via the campus email system. Students should also use the Rush email 35 account to communicate with faculty and staff versus sending an email using a personal email account. Should problems arise with the email account, please contact the Help Desk at (312) 942-4357 or via email at help@rush. edu. Graduates of Rush University should have access to their Rush email account for 14 days after graduation. Students leaving the University but who have not graduated should expect to have their email accounts terminated immediately. RUMC has the right to assign, reassign or terminate any individual's access to electronic communications, information systems or networks and take disciplinary actions, up to and including dismissal, in response to any negligent or deliberate misuse thereof. Email belongs to the recipient. A user's mailbox is treated in the same manner as any other file belonging to that user. Information proprietary to Rush University Medical Center may not be shared outside the organization without the approval of management. Patients' (HIPAA) protected information may qualify as a medical record and is considered confidential. Therefore, email related to patient care, treatment, therapy or testing should be incorporated into the patient's medical record or be encrypted. Rush University Medical Center is not respon- sible for the content of emails received. Examples of actions that may be subject to disciplinary action include: Sharing account information, including user name and password Attempting to gain access to another's password, user name or email account Attempting to read, delete, copy or modify the email of other users Posting email messages with sexually explicit images or language that may be construed as harassment or dispar - agement of others based on a person's race, color, sexual orientation, gender identity and/or expression, religion, national origin, ancestry, age, marital or parental status, dis-ability as defined by Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, Americans with Disabilities Amendment Act of 2008, veteran's status, pregnancy or any other category protected by federal or state law or county or city ordinance SpammingStudent Account Management and Identity Security Every approved user will be provided an individual computer account with a unique password. Users are able to create new passwords. Generic sign-ons used by groups of individuals are not allowed. Sharing a sign-on and password or the unau - thorized access of another person's computer account is not permitted and can lead to disciplinary action up to and including dismissal. Every Rush-affiliated user is responsible for every transaction originating from his or her computer account. Accounts that are not used for nine months may be deactivated without notice by Information Services. Anyone engaging in unauthorized use, disclosure, alteration or destruction of data is subject to disciplinary action. Computer accounts may not be used in any manner that would be illegal or violate the following: Rush University Medical Center's Code of Conduct policy Any Rush policy addressing privacy; confidentiality; or the use or disclosure of patient, staff, physician, student or other data. Student Identification Cards Rush students are required to wear their student ID card at all times while on campus. Students not wearing a valid student ID card could be asked to leave the University or Medical Center and related clinical sites. A valid student ID card is needed to access and use the library, laboratories, bookstore and student lounge, and is required for admission to some school events. The student ID card is valid only while the student is enrolled at Rush University and is immediately deactivated upon gradua- tion, withdrawal or dismissal from the University. Students must return the ID card to the Office of the Registrar upon separation from the University. New students who attend a formal orientation program will be issued their ID card during the orientation. Otherwise, new students can request an ID card from the Office of the Registrar starting the Friday before the term officially begins in which the student is matriculating. The Armour Academic Center (AAC) building opens at 5:30 a.m. and is locked at 7:00 p.m., Monday thru Friday. On Saturday, the building opens at 8:00 a.m. and is locked at 1:30 p.m. The building is closed on Sundays and Holidays. If there is a special event going on in the building or a special request made, the opening and closing times may change. As always, any visitor 36 may enter Rush through the main visitor entrance in Atrium Building and request a visitor pass. In order to make it easier for students to enter the AAC after the building has been locked at night and to utilize new and extended-hour study spaces, an ID card reader has been installed on the ground floor of AAC near the Bookstore. ID cards for Rush students, faculty and employees may utilize this card reader. Temporary ID badges are available in the event that authorized personnel have forgotten their original ID. Personnel may obtain a temporary ID 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Friday at the University Registrar's Office or at the Security office located in the Tower LL1502 during after hours, weekends and holidays. The temporary ID will allow access for a 24-hour period. If the temporary ID is not returned after the expiration, neither the temporary nor the original ID will work until the temporary ID is returned. The temporary ID represents your original ID. If either is lost, there is a $10 replacement fee. If the ID card is damaged or stolen, then the replacement fee will not be assessed if either the damaged ID card or a copy of a police report is received by the Office of the Registrar. Transcripts Previous Institutions As a part of the application for admission process, Rush University requires final and official transcripts from all institu - tions of higher education that a student attended, regardless of whether or not a degree was earned.Foreign Credential Evaluations Rush University requires an independent evaluation of foreign credentials in the case when a student earned a degree outside of the US or Canada. International medical school graduates can provide proof of Certification from the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG - http://www.ecfmg.org/) in lieu a course-by-course evaluation from the list of approved evaluators below. Non-medical school graduates from foreign institutions require course-by-course U.S. equivalency reports. Evaluations of other types will not be accepted. Please do not submit foreign tran - scripts in lieu of a foreign credential evaluation. Rush University accepts independent credential evaluations from the following agencies. American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers (AACRAO) Foreign Education Credential Services (http://ies.aacrao.org/) Commission on Graduates of Foreign Nursing Schools (CGFNS) International (http://www.cgfns.org) Educational Credential Evaluators (https://www.ece.org) World Education Services (http://www.wes.org) Centralized Application Service (CAS) Applicants Individuals who apply using a CAS should submit their final and official transcripts and/or foreign credential evaluations directly to the CAS.

Rush University Transcripts Copies of academic transcripts can be obtained at no cost to the student. The transcript is released only with written consent of the student or as consistent with legal requirements. Transcripts will not be released if the student has an outstanding financial obligation to the University. Students may complete a Transcript Request form available from the Office of the Registrar website or by writing to the Office of the Registrar, Rush University, 600 S. Paulina Street, Suite 440, Chicago, Illinois 60612. Fax requests are honored at (312) 942- 2310. The letter or fax must include the handwritten signature of the student. Five to six business days should typically be allowed for processing. Transcript requests by Rush Medical College students to be used in support of residency applications should be made to the Office of Medical Student Programs rather than to the Office of the Registrar. A Medical Student Performance Evaluation letter is included with these requests. Copies issued to students will be stamped in red ink as \"Issued to Student.\" All transcripts bear the signature of the university registrar or his designate.Transfer Credit Rush University may accept up to 90 quarter hours or 60 semester hours of credit toward General Education and other lower-level course requirements. Graduate-level transfer credit is subject to the approval of the major advisor, program or division director, or designated college administrator. The numbers of allowable credits transferred for graduate courses is determined by each program or division. Transfer credit typically will only be accepted from an accred- ited college/university. Students must submit official copies of their academic transcript to receive review and determination of transfer credit eligibility. Undergraduate courses must be completed with a \"C\" or better to be awarded credit. Graduate courses must be completed with a \"B\" or better to be awarded transfer credit. Undergraduate-level courses cannot be transferred to meet the requirements of a course taught at the graduate level at Rush. Course information (including grades) from transferred courses is not recorded on the student's transcript; only the number of credits is recorded and added to the cumulative number of credits. Registration Adding/Dropping Courses The first Friday of the term is the last day a course can be added. A course dropped during the first week of the term will not appear on the student's transcript. After that date, one of the following applies: Course dropped weeks 2-5: Grade of W will be issued for the course Course dropped in weeks 6-end of course: Grade of WP (Withdrew Passing), WF (Withdrew Failing), WN (Withdrew Not Passing) will be issued. No course may be dropped after the last day of classes or after a final evaluation of the student has been delivered. No withdrawals are allowed during the final examination period. Rush Medical College students wishing to change their clinical schedules must contact the Office of Medical Student Programs at least four weeks before the start of the scheduled rotation. For additional information concerning tuition refunds, please refer to Financial Affairs: Tuition Refund Policy.38 Auditing a Course A student wishing to attend a course without completing all the requirements for credit may register to audit the course only with permission of the program director. If space in class is limited, continuing and new students have priority. Registration in a course cannot be changed from audit to credit or credit to audit after the first week of the term. Fees associated with auditing a course are listed in the tuition and fee schedule. A student may be required to register in continuous enrollment if they are only auditing course(s) for a specific term. Auditing of laboratory or clinical courses is prohibited. An audit- ing student is subject to the following conditions: May participate in class discussion only at the invitation of the course director Is prohibited from being in class when examinations are scheduled Is expected to attend class An audited course will appear on the student's transcript with the designation of \"AU.\" If the student does not attend the class, a grade of \"W\" will be assigned. A student who has audited a course may not apply for credit for that course at a later time. Earning a grade and receiving credit for the course can only occur by enrolling in and paying for the course during the term it is offered. Rush Medical College (RMC) does not allow students to audit RMC courses except with the permission of the Committee on Student Evaluation and Promotion (COSEP). Course Schedule The Course Schedule is available through the RUConnected stu-dent portal. Typically, the Course Schedule will be available one week before the two-week registration period begins. The Office of the Registrar will generally send an email announcement to students' Rush University email accounts regarding availability of the course schedule. Registration dates and deadlines are also published in the academic calendar. Changes to the course schedule, including updates to meet- ing times, instructors, classrooms and added/closed/canceled courses will be updated in RUConnected. Independent Study To register for independent study, the education coordinator or course instructor offering the course will approve the course and its objectives, then forward the independent study course request form, including instructor, course title, course descrip- tion, number of credit hours and grading system, to the Office of the Registrar. The Office of the Registrar will create the course in the student information system. Once the course has been created, the Office of the Registrar will contact the education coordinator or course instructor and inform them of the status of the course. The education coordinator or course instructor will inform the student when the course is available and the student will regis- ter for the course using RUConnected. Nursing students complete an Independent Study Contract form, which is available in the Office of the Registrar or online. On this form the objectives of the study are defined, a plan to meet those objectives is described, etc. This form should be completed and approved by the preceptor, department chair and the pro- gram director no later than the first day of the quarter in which the independent study is to be taken. The student's preceptor keeps the contract. Health Systems Management students also complete a separate independent study form, which is available in the Department of Health Systems Management Registration Process Each term the Course Schedule is available on the RUConnected student portal. Classes are filled on a first-come, first-served basis according to the following order of priority: 1. Continuing students2. New students3. Students-at-large It is the responsibility of continuing students to register using RUConnected each term during the designated two-week regis-tration period for continuing students. Late fees may be applied to students who register outside of the designated registration period. To register for any given term, students cannot have a registra- tion hold (i.e., missing transcripts, missing/out-of-date immuni - zations, insurance waivers, financial holds, etc.). If the hold is removed before the end of the registration period, the student can register himself or herself without penalty. If the hold is not removed by the end of the registration period, the student will need to register with the Office of the Registrar as soon as the hold is resolved and will be assigned a late registration fee. Registration is complete only when tuition and other charges for the term are paid or satisfactory arrangements for payment are made. Tuition is always due on the first day of the term. 39 Students who register for a class and subsequently decide to withdraw without completing an Add/Drop, Leave of Absence or Voluntary Withdrawal forms will receive a failing grade (F or N) for that course. Withdrawal/Leave of Absence Administrative Withdrawal Administrative withdrawal refers to a permanent departure from the University that is University-initiated and without expecta-tion of the student's return. Rush University requires continuous enrollment in most of its programs from the time a student matriculates through a student's graduation. Students are required to be registered each term or on an approved leave of absence. If the student has decided to withdraw from Rush, voluntary withdrawal paperwork must be submitted to the Office of the Registrar before the voluntary withdrawal will become official. A student who is not registered, on an approved leave of absence or who has not submitted paperwork to voluntarily withdraw will be administratively withdrawn from the University at the end of the term in which the student stopped attending. The administra- tive withdrawal is posted to the student's transcript. Should the student wish to return to Rush in the future, the student will need to be readmitted. Voluntary Withdrawal Voluntary withdrawal refers to a permanent departure from the University that is student-initiated and without expectation of the student's return. After matriculation to Rush University, a student may not arbi- trarily cease registration. All students are required to maintain continuous enrollment or risk administrative withdrawal due to unexplained nonregistration. Withdrawal implies the permanent departure from the University without the immediate expectation of return. Any student withdrawing from the University must give formal notification by completing a Petition to Withdrawal form, which requires the student to obtain specific signatures. The Office of the Registrar is the designated office that a student must notify if he or she wishes to withdraw from the University. The Petition to Withdrawal form may be obtained from the Office of the Registrar or online. The date that the student begins the process of withdrawing will be the official date used in processing the form. No withdrawals are allowed during the final examination period. Withdrawal is also not allowed after the last class day of the term. Official withdrawal from the University entitles a student to a tuition refund from the first through the fifth weeks of the term. No other fees are refundable. The Petition to Withdrawal form must be submitted to the Office of the Registrar by Friday at 4:30 p.m. (Central Time) to be considered valid for a particu- lar week's tuition refund. Leave of Absence After matriculation to Rush University, a student may not arbitrarily cease registration without notice. All students are required to maintain continuous enrollment or risk administra-tive withdrawal after one term due to unexplained nonregistra- tion. Leaves of absence (LOA) are approved and granted at the discretion of the student's college and are accepted only through the first week of the term for which the LOA is desired or as otherwise approved by the college. It is the student's responsibility to communicate directly with his or her college regarding the disposition of the request for the LOA. Students who request a LOA may be displaced into a subsequent cohort, required to take a revised program of study upon return to the University or be delayed in their progression through the program based on availability of courses and/or clinical placements. Students may be eligible for a LOA only after they have com- pleted and submitted the Petition for Leave of Absence required by each college or program to the Office of the Registrar. Failure to complete and submit the Petition for Leave of Absence form will make the student ineligible for any refunds and obligate him or her for the full term's insurance charges. The date that the student begins the process applying for a Leave of Absence is the official date that will be used in processing the form. Students who submit a Petition for Leave of Absence form after the fifth week of the term will receive grades in the courses for which he or she is registered and will be subject to an aca- demic progression review based upon the assigned grades. Any decision reached by the student's academic program or college supersedes the submitted Petition for Leave of Absence form. Each degree has a time limit for completion that includes time away on a LOA. The decision to include the LOA in calculat-ing the time limits for completion of the degree is within the discretion of each college. The maximum length of time that will be approved for a single LOA is 12 consecutive months. Each college may have a maximum length of accumulated leave of absence. Returning from a Leave of Absence Students are responsible for registering themselves for the term in which they are returning from an approved LOA. This 40 registration must occur during the designated priority registra- tion period. Registration outside of this period will result in a late registration fee. It is the student's responsibility to consult with his or her advisor/program director regarding required courses for the term of re-entry. Rush Medical College students should consult with the appropriate Assistant Dean to deter - mine required courses. Students must satisfy the conditions of the LOA before re-entering and must comply with all policies, requirements and course sequences in effect at the time of re-entry. A request to extend a LOA requires that a new clearance form be submitted. A request to extend a LOA requires only the signatures of the student's program director, advisor or desig-nated administrator of the college. The completed form must be submitted to the Office of the Registrar no later than the first Friday of the term for which the extension is being requested. Students who cannot return and who do not have an exten- sion of a LOA approved must withdraw from the institution. Students who fail to return from their LOA on the date that was originally approved risk administrative withdrawal. Student Records Name, Address and Phone Number Changes Rush University requires that student academic records exist under the student's legal name. The Office of the Registrar maintains the current official listing of student names and addresses for Rush University. It is each student's responsibility to keep the Office of the Registrar informed of changes to this information. Name changes require official documentation verifying the new name at the time of the request. Examples of official docu- mentation verifying a new name include: valid driver's license, marriage license (the official government document), passport, Social Security card, court order or dissolution decree. Address or phone number changes can be submitted using an Address/Phone Change form and submitted to the Office of the Registrar for processing. Privacy and Confidentiality of Student Records and FERPA Rush University takes seriously its commitment to protect the privacy of our students and their education records. In addition to upholding the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA), Rush University has taken further steps to protect a person's privacy by extending similar benefits afforded to enrolled students under FERPA to individuals who are applying for admission. If a specific privacy/confidentiality question is not answered in this text, please contact the Office of the Registrar. Nothing in this policy may be construed to prohibit the University from disclosing information provided to the institu- tion under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act concerning sex offenders who are required to register. Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) FERPA is a federal law designed to protect the privacy of students' educational records. Educational records include any information or documentation that is recorded in any way, including records produced by handwriting, computer, e-mail, audio, video, etc. Educational records contain informa - tion directly related to a student, and are maintained by Rush University or any party acting on its behalf. FERPA protects the privacy of students' educational records by setting forth strict instructions and limitations governing the release of information about students. Although FERPA contains exceptions for the release of \"directory information\" without a student's prior written consent, students have the right to request that even such directory information be withheld from disclosure to third parties. Given the restrictions of FERPA, faculty and staff should assume that all students must provide written consent that follows the format specified in FERPA before any educational records may be released to anyone other than the student. Information cannot be released to any third party, including the students' parents, relatives, and friends. Particularly sensitive information includes students' Social Security numbers, race or ethnicity, gender, nationality, academic performance, disciplinary records, financial aid information, and grades. Privacy During the Admissions Process Rush University has chosen to take additional steps to protect a person's privacy by extending to individuals who are applying for admission similar benefits afforded to enrolled students. This pri - vacy protection covers all applicants and their application mate - rials throughout the admissions process. The application process exists between the applicant and a Rush University admissions office; therefore, any communication about candidates and their application status to parties beyond these entities is not accept- able unless a school official has a legitimate educational interest to know this information in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibilities. All those involved in the admissions process (e.g. admissions committee members, interviewers, admissions staff, etc.) must adhere to these guidelines.41 Directory Information Rush University may establish categories of information known as directory information and release this information without student consent, upon request. Rush University designates the following personally identifiable information contained in a student's educational record as directory information: student's full name address (local and permanent) telephone number (local and permanent) Rush pager number (relevant to third- and fourth-year Rush Medical College students, only) Rush e-mail address major and minor field(s) of study including the college, divi- sion, department and/or program in which the student is enrolled student's classification (e.g. junior, senior, etc.) or by number referring to such dates of attendance and graduation, and degrees received date and place of birth photograph or other electronic images* honors and awards received previous colleges/universities attended degrees earned at previous colleges/universities Rush Medical College postgraduate appointment (program/ institution/state) * Rush University records both visually and audibly many campus events and daily activities such as classes, commencement, convocations, student events, and other public occasions. These images, as well as other information about students, are published (e.g. print media; Rush Web site) regularly as part of the University's coverage of campus life and portrayal of the University to a variety of audiences. The University's policy is to restrict the use of any photograph/electronic image to the representation, marketing, or promotion of Rush activities only. Students may restrict the release of their directory informa- tion by completing and submitting the Directory Information Restrictions form available in the Office of the Registrar (or online). The decision to restrict directory information will apply to all requests from third parties (other than those who have legal access to these data elements already), including prospec- tive employers. A student must formally rescind a restriction of directory information by submitting a subsequent Directory Information Restrictions form.Annual Notification of Student Rights under FERPA FERPA affords students certain rights with respect to their edu- cational records. These rights include: 1. T he right to inspect and review the student's educational records within 45 days of the day the University receives a request for access. If an educational record contains information about other students as well, the requesting student may inspect and review only the specific informa - tion which pertains to him or her. Students should submit to the University Registrar, Dean, head of the academic department, or other appropriate official, written requests that identify the record(s) they wish to inspect. The University official will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. If the records are not main - tained by the University official to whom the request was submitted, that official shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed. The University may deny a request for copies of educational records when the requestor refuses to furnish proper identifi- cation and/or information required by the University. 2. T he right to request the amendment of the student's edu - cational records that the student believes is inaccurate. Students may ask the University to amend a record that they believe is inaccurate. They should write the University official responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of the record they want changed, specify why it is inaccurate, and provide the accurate information. If the University decides not to amend the record as requested by the student, the University will notify the student of the decision and advise the student of his or her right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when notified of the right to a hearing. 3. T he right to consent to disclosures of personally identifi - able information contained in the student's education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclo - sure without consent. One exception, which permits disclosure without consent, is disclosure to school officials with legitimate educa- tional interests. A school official is a person employed by the University in an administrative, supervisory, academic, research, or support staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); a person or company with whom the University has contracted (such as an attorney, 42 auditor, or collection agent); a person serving on the Board of Trustees; or a student serving on an official committee (such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks). A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her profes- sional responsibility. 4. T he right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by Rush University to comply with the requirements of FERPA. The name and address of the office that administers FERPA is: Family Policy Compliance Office U.S. Department of Education 400 Maryland Avenue, SW Washington, DC 20202-5901 Commencement/Graduation Activities The Intent to Graduate form signals that a student is ready to graduate. By signing the Intent to Graduate form, the student is giving permission to the University to print the following information in any Rush graduation program and/or announce this information at any Rush graduation ceremony: the student's name as indicated on the Intent to Graduate form, any honors or awards received, the Rush degree and major the student is earning, previous colleges/universities attended, and degrees earned at those previous colleges/universities. If a Directory Information Restrictions form was previously submitted, the student's signature on the Intent to Graduate form temporarily releases (for graduation ceremony/program purposes only) the directory information restrictions enacted by the student so that the information can be published in any Rush graduation program and/or announced at any Rush gradu- ation ceremony. In addition, the student's signature permits Rush University to release the student's name and address to the external photography vendor with whom Rush contracts, and to have the vendor place graduation photographs of the student on its Web site. The student's signature also allows the University to publish the student's picture in a picture composite and the student's image in a DVD that is created and distributed of the Commencement ceremony. The recording of the gradua- tion ceremony could also appear on the Rush University web site and/or social media sites including but not limited to YouTube and Facebook. Finally, if the student is a medical student, the student's signature permits publication of the student's name, photograph, previous degrees earned, and other information in the Rush Medical College yearbook.If there are questions about how the information will used for graduation or commencement purposes, please speak with the Office of the Registrar before signing and submitting the Intent to Graduate form. Educational Records Rush University does not maintain educational records in one central office. Educational records are maintained in the Office of the Registrar and in the respective college and department offices. Other educational records are maintained in the Office of Student Financial Aid (financial aid information, student employment), Office of Student Financial Affairs (financial account payment information), Office of International Services, and other offices. Questions regarding individual student records should be directed to the appropriate location. Rush University will not issue copies of transcripts received from other institutions to anyone, including the student. Deceased Student Records Rush University may, upon the death of a student, release a student's educational records to a third party. This is done at the sole discretion of Rush University. Mailing Lists Rush University does not release student directory informa- tion in mailing lists, except to comply with the federal Solomon Amendment. Additional Questions The Office of the Registrar is the compliance office for FERPA for Rush University. If there are additional questions, please contact the Office of the Registrar at: 600 South Paulina, Suite 440 Chicago, Illinois 60612 (312) 942-5681 registrars_office@rush.edu43 Tuition and Financial Aid Office of Financial Affairs Financial Appeals Payment of Tuition and Fees Student Health Insurance Tuition Refund Policy Tuition Waivers Third-Party Billing Office of Student Financial Aid Financial Aid Process Financial Aid Determination Financial Aid Awards Veterans Benefits Enrollment Status Definitions Satisfactory Academic Progress LEAP Benefits Tuition and Fees 44 Office of Financial Affairs Financial Appeals If a student has a concern about his or her financial account and he or she wishes to appeal the financial decision, the student must file a written appeal with the Office of Financial Affairs within two academic terms from the term in question for the appeal to be considered. The Office of Financial Affairs will investigate the situation and will consult with other offices including the Office of the Registrar, the Office of Student Financial Aid and the student's program, as needed. A decision will be rendered within one month from the time the appeal was received and the student will be notified in writing. If the decision is not in the favor of the student, the student may file a written appeal with the Office of the Associate Provost for Student Affairs. The decision of the Associate Provost for Student Affairs is final. Payment of Tuition and Fees The following statement represents the payment policy for all Rush University students: Charges can be viewed and payment for tuition, fees and on-campus housing can be completed through RUConnected, the University's online system. Payment can be made by credit card or e-check. If full payment of tuition cannot be made by the first week of class, as listed in the Academic Calendar located in the Rush University Catalog, satisfactory arrangements for payment must be made with the Office of Financial Affairs. Students may not attend classes until after registration is complete. Any exception to this policy must be approved in writing by the Associate Provost for Student Affairs. Students have the responsibility to complete one or a combina- tion of the following courses of action on or before the first Friday of classes each term: 1. P ay total tuition, fees and on-campus housing charges for the term. 2. Complete a Deferred P ayment Plan Contract. This plan requires that the first payment and a $15 service charge be paid on or before the first Friday of the term. Additional pay - ments are due every four weeks. The length of the contract is dependent on the length of the term. Contact the Office of Financial Affairs to set up a payment plan. 3. Use the pending financial aid payment option. All students who have financial aid pending will be allowed to defer payment of that portion of tuition and fees that is covered by the anticipated aid. In order to use this option, students must have taken all steps required of them to apply for the aid (e.g., the application for a guaranteed student loan program must have been completed and submitted to the Office of Student Financial Aid). In order to avoid a late fee charge, students must make arrangements for payments of that portion of tuition and fees not covered with pending aid by completing steps one or two above. Failure to follow one of the steps above will result in a $100 late fee. Students who choose the deferred payment plan contract and who fail to make a payment of the specified due dates will result in a $50 late payment fee for each payment date missed. At the end of the academic term, those students who still have outstanding balances with Rush University that are not covered by pending financial aid will: Not receive transcripts/diplomas May be dismissed from on-campus housing Lose all university privileges Not be allowed to register for the following term Student Health Insurance Rush University requires students to be covered by a health plan in order to promote health and well-being while protecting the individual from undue financial hardship that a medical emer - gency could cause. Non-Rush Medical College students must provide proof of existing coverage before registering for the Fall term each year. Students who do not submit proof and receive confirmation of verification of their coverage will not be allowed to register. To that end, students enrolled in degree programs are eligible for the Student Health Insurance Plan offered by Academic HealthPlans, Inc. and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois. For the 2013-2014 school year, the cost of the plan is approxi- mately $237 per month for single coverage. Additional cover - ages are available as follows: child (additional 457.00 per month), children (additional $687.00 per month) and spouse (additional $562.00 per month). This plan allows students to choose a primary care physician from a large list of members of the Preferred Provider Plan (PPO) in the Greater Chicago area. There is an annual deductible of $250 and coverage of 80 percent for most patient services including hospitalization and surgery, as well as outpatient services such as office visits, laboratory and X-ray. Preventative care services are covered at 100 percent. When using a pharmacy in the Prime Therapeudics Network, there is a $20 co-pay for generic prescriptions, a $50 co-pay for brand name prescriptions and an $80 co-pay for brand name prescriptions when generic is available.45 A dental insurance plan is also available and optional to all Rush University students. Details of the plan are available in the Office of Financial Affairs. Enrollment for the dental plan is avail- able at the beginning of the fall term only. Applications will not be accepted after the start of the fall term.

A small portion of fees for Rush Medical College students has been allocated to the Medical Student Health Service Program, supported by Lifetime Medical Associates (1645 W . Jackson, Suite 215). T he Medical Student Health Service Program is designed to work seamlessly with Rush University Health Insurance to provide medical students with acute care. By using Rush University Health Insurance, medical students should expe- rience an enhanced level of service and minimal billing prob- lems, with a $20 fee per office visit. T his will provide the type of Student Health Service with which most students are familiar. Additionally, all Rush Medical College students are covered under a blood and bodily fluids exposure rider. T his works as a supplemental policy to any health insurance to cover treatment or medications necessary as the result of a needle stick, splash or potentially contagious diseases exposure. T ogether with the basic Rush University Health Insurance policy, the rider will completely cover prophylactic medications or injections. Rush Medical College students will be assessed a fee for vac - cinations/immunizations and documentation. T his fee covers any necessary blood tests, vaccinations or updates as well as costs 46 Tuition Waivers Rush Medical College Students Enrolling in The Graduate College Courses Rush Medical College students who take a leave of absence from their MD program may enroll in The Graduate College classes as part of a formal MS or PhD program, or simply for additional knowledge. Medical students are exempt (tuition waiver) from the additional tuition costs associated with enrollment in these classes. Doctoral Students in The Graduate College The Graduate College offers a full tuition scholarship for students enrolled in doctoral program in the basic sciences (Anatomy and Cell Biology, Biomechanics, Biochemistry, Immunology/Microbiology, Medical Physics, Molecular Biophysics and Physiology, Neuroscience and Pharmacology). The scholarship is only for tuition. Health insurance and other fees are the student's responsibility. To receive this scholarship, students must maintain full-time status. A requirement of at least 12 hours per quarter is needed to be a full-time student. If a student fails to register for 12 hours each quarter, the scholarship is rescinded and the student is billed tuition. In addition, most students accepted by The Graduate College receive a stipend. The stipend awarded to a graduate student is a privilege and is contingent upon policies established by individual divisions. Master of Science Students in The Graduate College Students enrolled in master's programs in the basic sciences (Anatomy and Cell Biology, Biochemistry, Biomechanics, Biotechnology, Immunology/Microbiology, Medical Physics, Neuroscience and Pharmacology) pay tuition and fees. Master's students are generally not eligible for tuition scholarships and are expected to be enrolled full-time (12 hours per quarter) unless special arrangements have been made. Third-Party Billing If the student will not be personally paying their account, it is his or her responsibility to forward any bills to the appropriate party as soon as possible. Office of Student Financial Aid Financial Aid Process Instructions for accessing financial aid information on the Rush University website are emailed to all newly accepted students prior to enrollment. The Student Financial Aid website contains in-depth information on policies, procedures and financial aid awarding methodology. The priority deadline for submission of financial aid application materials is March 1st for continuing students and new students starting in the fall. Students starting in a term other than fall should submit financial aid application materials at least two months prior to their start date. Students must be enrolled at least half-time and must be in a degree or approved certificate program to receive financial aid. To receive assistance, all appropriate forms and materials must be on file. Students should expect to receive the majority of assistance in the form of loans. Because of limited institutional funding, finan- cial aid awards will likely contain loans that accrue interest while the student is in school. Grant assistance is available. However, the funds are limited and all applicants (with few exceptions) must provide parental data and meet the institutional criteria for eligibility. Refer to the Office of Student Financial Aid website (http://www.rushu.rush.edu/finaid/) for details. Undergraduate students who have not received a prior Bachelor's degree are more likely to receive grant assistance through federal and state need-based programs. Employment through the Federal College Work Study program may be pos-sible throughout Rush University Medical Center. Depending on a student's academic program, Federal College Work Study may be awarded as part of the financial aid package. It is the student's responsibility to secure employment. The Office of Student Financial Aid assists students in locating jobs within the Medical Center. Financial Aid Determination Financial assistance programs at Rush University are provided to assist students who cannot otherwise afford to pay the full cost of education on their own. In general, financial need is the basic criterion for the awarding of funds. Accordingly, students and their families will be expected to contribute toward educational expenses to the fullest extent possible. The level of the expected contribution is determined by using a standard set of criteria to analyze financial information provided by students and their families. Submission of parental data for institutional grants and loans is required for most university students. Complete informa - tion about this policy is found on the Office of Student Financial Aid website. Student Financial Aid counselors are available to consult with students and parents (with the student's authoriza- tion) on all matters regarding the financing of a Rush University education. Students and authorized parents are welcomed and encouraged to make use of these services. Financial Aid Awards After evaluating student and family resources and assistance from outside the University, the Office of Student Financial Aid 47 will award federal, state and institutional funds (as appropriate) to students with demonstrated financial need. In varying quanti- ties, a financial aid award may include grants, loans and student employment. In order to distribute the available funds in the most equitable manner, the Office of Student Financial Aid estab- lishes a formula that designates the sequence in which funds are awarded to students and the maximum amount awarded under each program. The formula provides for a specific amount of loans and employment before students are considered for grants. These formulas are applied consistently during any given year among all students at a given class level and in a given college (pending availability of funds). Due to differences in the availabil - ity of funds from year to year and changes in eligibility require- ments, the formulas are adjusted annually. Veterans Benefits Rush University participates in the full spectrum of Veterans Education Benefits through the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Post-9/11 GI Bill Provides tuition, fees, books/supplies and housing assistance to eligible veterans. Tuition and fees are paid directly to Rush by the VA. Tuition and fees assistance is capped at the national maxi - mum of $19,198.31 per academic year. Benefit rates vary based on the veteran's circumstances. Some veterans may be able to transfer their benefits to a dependent. Yellow Ribbon Program Effective with the 2012-2013 academic year, Rush University participates in the Yellow Ribbon Program. Veterans entitled to the maximum benefit rate are eligible to apply for additional tuition and fees amounts if their costs exceed the $19,198.31 cap. The amount of additional assistance available and the number of students able to be supported is limited and varies by college. Funds will be awarded on a first-come, first-served basis. Students who have received Yellow Ribbon assistance will have preference for these funds in future academic years. Details are available on the VA's Yellow Ribbon Program information site. Montgomery GI Bill-Active Duty (MGIB-AD Chapter 30) Monthly benefit paid directly to the veteran Montgomery GI Bill-Selected Reserve (MGIB-SR Chapter 1606) Monthly benefit paid directly to the veteran Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP Chapter 1607) Monthly benefit paid directly to the veteran Veterans Educational Assistance Program (VEAP Chapter 32) Monthly benefit paid directly to the veteran Survivors and Dependents Assistance (DEA Chapter 35) Monthly benefit paid directly to the survivor or dependent of the veteran If a student qualifies for participation in more than one Veterans Education Benefits program, the VA website provides a compari- son tool to help determine which benefits might be appropriate. Veterans interested in using their benefits at Rush for the first time should: 1. Apply for benefits through the VA: If the veteran has never used their veterans benefits at an institution before, this step must be completed. 2. Submit form 22-1995 or form 22-5495 (as appropriate) online: If the veteran has used veterans education benefits before, but is a first-time benefits-user at Rush University, the appropriate form must be submitted. 3. Provide a copy of their eligibility letter from the VA (as well as any change of program forms from step 2, above) to the Office of Student Financial Aid before benefits can be certi- fied with the VA. All documents can be mailed, faxed or scanned and emailed to the Office of Student Financial Aid. Please be sure to indicate name and student ID number (or Social Security Number) on all documents. Enrollment Status Definitions Students working toward a degree or certificate and who are enrolled at least half-time may be eligible for student financial assistance. These students may also be eligible to have their federal educational loans deferred. Students are considered full-time or half-time based on the below criteria. Full-time Half-time Medical Students All enrolled students are considered full-time Graduate Students 9 4.5 Undergraduate Students 12 648 Satisfactory Academic Progress The Higher Education Act of 1965 as amended by Congress mandates institutions of higher education to establish minimum standards of satisfactory progress for students receiving Federal financial aid. These standards apply to all Federal Title IV aid programs including the Federal Pell Grant, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant, Federal Perkins Loan, Federal Stafford Loan, Federal PLUS Loan and Federal College Work- Study programs. Accordingly, the Department of Education regulations require that Rush University's Office of Student Financial Aid monitor the academic progress of all financial aid recipients toward the completion of their degree. This process is called Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP). This SAP policy is enforced in conjunction with all other institutional policies and procedures, including the academic progressions policies of Rush University's Colleges and aca - demic programs. For undergraduate and graduate students, the below criteria are checked at the end of each term. For medical students, the below criteria are checked annually at the end of spring term. Enforcement The Office of Student Financial Aid shall have primary responsi- bility in enforcing the SAP policy. The Office of the Registrar and other Rush University offices that maintain student information relevant to the SAP policy shall provide such information, as requested, by the Office of Student Financial Aid. SAP Requirements SAP requirements vary by academic level (undergraduate, graduate and medical students). Please refer to the appropriate section to find the requirements that fit your academic program. UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS SAP for undergraduate students is monitored using three fac-tors: maximum time frame measurement, pace of completion and cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA). SAP is measured at the end of each academic term once final grades are in. Maximum Time Frame Measurement Students may attempt up to 150 percent of the credits it normally takes to complete the program. The total allow- able attempted hours are calculated by multiplying the hours required to complete the degree at Rush (excluding the general education courses required prior to entry in the program) by 1.5 and rounding down to the nearest whole number. For example, for a program that requires 107 credit hours to receive a degree at Rush (not including the general education courses required prior to entry in the program), a student may attempt up to 160 hours. Pace of Completion Students must successfully complete at least 67% of the courses they attempt. This measure will be measured cumulatively over the course of the student's program. For the purpose of this measurement, all of the following are applicable. Successful completion is defined as a grade of A, B or C for a letter grade course, or a grade of P for a course that is pass-fail or pass-no pass. These courses are counted in both the attempted and completed hours totals. Proficiency credit (\"K\" grades) is counted in both the attempted and completed hours totals. All other grades (including incomplete grades) are counted in the attempted hours total, but not in the completed hours total. If an incomplete grade is later converted to a grade that is considered to be a successfully completed grade, the pace of completion percentage can be recalculated. It is the student's responsibility to notify the Office of Student Financial Aid when an incomplete grade has been converted. Students who drop courses but who remain enrolled at the University will not have those dropped courses counted in the attempted hours total if they are dropped prior to the census date. Dropped courses after the census date will be counted in the attempted hours total. Repeated courses are counted as attempted hours during all attempts. Transfer credits that count toward the student's current academic program count as both attempted and completed hours. Students who change majors will only have hours that were previously attempted counted in their cumulative totals if they are applicable to the new academic program. Cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA) Undergraduate students must maintain a minimum cumula-tive GPA of 2.0. Students who have a term GPA of less than 1.0 after their first term at Rush will be immediately placed on financial aid suspension. GRADUATE STUDENTS SAP for graduate students is monitored using three factors: maximum time frame measurement, pace of completion and cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA). SAP is measured at the end of each academic term once final grades are submitted.49 Maximum Time Frame Measurement Students may attempt up to 150 percent of the credits it normally takes to complete the program. The total allow- able attempted hours are calculated by multiplying the hours required to complete the degree at Rush by 1.5 and rounding down to the nearest whole number. For example, for a program that requires 113 credit hours to receive a degree at Rush, a student may attempt up to 169 hours. Please note: nondegree certificate programs are approved by the US Department of Education for financial assistance at a specific number of credit hours. Regardless of a student's actual plan of study, maximum timeframe is calculated using the number of hours for which the program was approved with the US Department of Education. Pace of Completion Students must successfully complete at least 67% of the courses they attempt. This measure will be measured cumulatively over the course of the student's program. For the purpose of this measurement, all of the following are applicable. Successful completion is defined as a grade of A or B for a letter grade course, or a grade of P for a course that is pass-fail or pass-no pass. These courses are counted in both the attempted and completed hours totals. Proficiency credit (\"K\" grades) is counted in both the attempted and completed hours totals. All other grades (including incomplete grades) are counted in the attempted hours total, but not in the completed hours total. If an incomplete grade is later converted to a grade that is considered to be a successfully completed grade, the pace of completion percentage can be recalculated. It is the student's responsibility to notify the Office of Student Financial Aid when an incomplete grade has been converted. Students who drop courses but who remain enrolled at the University will not have those dropped courses counted in the attempted hours total if they are dropped prior to the census date. Dropped courses after the census date will be counted in the attempted hours total. Repeated courses are counted as attempted hours during all attempts. Transfer credits that count toward the student's current academic program count as both attempted and completed hours. Students who change majors will only have hours that were previously attempted counted in their cumulative totals if they are applicable to the new academic program.Cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA) Graduate students must maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0. Students who have a term GPA of less than 2.0 after their first term at Rush will be immediately placed on financial aid suspension. RUSH MEDICAL COLLEGE STUDENTS SAP for Rush Medical College (RMC) students is monitored using three factors: maximum time frame measurement, pace of completion and grade requirements. SAP is measured at the end of each academic year once final grades are in and at the time of awarding. Time Limits on Financial Aid Eligibility The normal timeframe for completion of required coursework for the MD degree is four academic years. Due to academic or personal difficulties, a student may require additional time. In such situations, the RMC Committee on Student Evaluation and Promotion (COSEP) may establish a schedule for the student that departs from the norm and that may require repeating a year of study. For the purposes of this financial aid policy, no more than three years may be devoted to the first- and second-year curricu- lum. No more than three years may be devoted to the third- and fourth-year curriculum. Summer enrollment, if required, is consid- ered part of the academic year for the purposes of this measure. Approved Leaves of Absence do not count in this measure. Completion of Requirements/Pace of Completion 1. First-year students must complete at least 66% of their first- year curriculum with a grade of \"Pass\" or better between the start of the year and the last day of spring quarter exams. This includes repeated courses. 2. T o advance to the second year, students must complete all first-year courses with a grade of \"Pass\" or better by the start of the second year. 3. Second-year students must complete at least 66% of their sec - ond-year curriculum with a grade of \"Pass\" or better between the start of fall quarter and the last day of spring exams. This includes repeated courses. 4. T o advance to the third year, students must complete all second-year courses with a grade of \"Pass\" or better by the start of the CRASH course. 5. A student who is repeating/splitting the first or second year according to a COSEP schedule is considered to be making SAP . 6. T hird-year students must complete at least 66% of the clerk - ships they attempt with a grade of \"Pass\" or better. 50 7. T o advance to the fourth year, students must complete all core clerkships with a grade of \"Pass\" or better. 8. A student who is repeating the third or fourth year accord - ing to a COSEP schedule is considered to be making SAP . Grade Requirements Academic progress in RMC is measured in terms of Honors, High Pass, Pass and Fail grades. A student must complete each required course/clerkship with a grade of \"Pass\" or better in order to graduate. A student who fails a course must retake it and earn a grade of at least \"Pass.\" A student who receives an Incomplete in a course must complete the course and earn at least a \"Pass.\" Financial Aid Warning Undergraduate and graduate students are allowed a finan- cial aid warning period. Professional students (Rush Medical College) are not allowed a financial aid warning period. Undergraduate or graduate students who fail to meet the requirements of this satisfactory academic progress policy will be placed on financial aid warning for one additional term (with the exception of undergraduate students who have a first-term GPA of less than 1.0 and graduate students who have a first-term GPA of less than 2.0. In this case, that student would immediately be placed on financial aid suspension.) Students will be allowed to continue on financial assistance during the warning period. Students placed on financial aid warning will be sent notification by hard-copy letter (through the US Postal Service) and through their Rush email account. The notification will include SAP requirements, steps neces- sary to meet SAP in the upcoming term and the consequences for failing to meet SAP requirements the end of the warning period. Students will be placed on financial aid suspension if they fail to meet the standards of this SAP policy after the one-term financial aid warning period. Suspension of Financial Aid Eligibility Professional students (Rush Medical College) who fail to meet the requirements of this SAP policy will be placed on financial aid suspension. Undergraduate students who have a first-term GPA of less than 1.0 and graduate students who have a first-term GPA of less than 2.0 will be placed on financial aid suspension. Students who still fail to meet the requirements of this policy after their single term on financial aid warning will be placed on financial aid suspension.Students who are suspended from financial aid eligibility will be notified by hard-copy letter (through the US Postal Service) and through their Rush email account. Appealing Suspension of Financial Aid Eligibility A student may appeal the suspension of their financial aid eligi - bility for extenuating circumstances. Appeals from other parties on behalf of the student will not be accepted. All appeals should be submitted to the Director of Student Financial Aid in writing. Each appeal must include: 1) the reasons why the standards of this policy were not met, 2) what has changed in the student's situation that will allow her or him to make satisfactory progress during the next evaluation, and 3) an academic plan for the remainder of the student's studies. Documentation of any state-ments made in the appeal should be included, as appropriate. All appeals must be submitted within 10 business days of receipt of a suspension notice. The Director of Student Financial Aid will review the appeal and will respond to the student within 10 business days from the receipt of the appeal. Students whose appeals are approved will be placed on a financial aid probationary period for one term or for the duration of an academic plan developed by the student's advisor, as appropriate. The probationary period will be defined to include checkpoints that must be achieved in order for the student to remain eligible for financial assistance. Students failing to abide by the terms of their probationary period will be suspended from financial aid after their probationary period. The decision of the Director of Student Financial Aid is final, binding and not subject to further appeal. Reinstatement of Financial Aid Eligibility A student's eligibility for financial aid will be reinstated at such time as she or he successfully meets the standards of the SAP policy. It is the student's responsibility to present evidence to the Student Financial Aid Office at the time she or he meets the requirements for reinstatement. LEAP Benefits All full-time employees (72 to 80 hours per pay period) can receive prepayment up to nine credit hours per term. Part-time employees (40 to 70 hours per pay period) can receive prepay-ment up to six credit hours per term. New employees must com- plete three months of employment prior to requesting prepay tuition. Books and fees are not included in the prepayment cost. A copy of the letter of acceptance from the Rush University must be turned into the LEAP office at the beginning of the LEAP prepay assistance. The LEAP paperwork must be turned into the LEAP office before the final deadlines listed on the next page. 51 F A 13 WI14 SP 14 SU14 College of Nursing *8/9/13 12/23/13 LEAP Deadlines Tuition and Fees (2013-2014) A passing grade (defined as a \"C\" or better per class for undergraduates and a \"B\" or better per class for graduates) must be obtained to continue receiving LEAP prepayment ben- efits. If you receive a non-passing grade, you will not receive tuition credit for the number of credit hours your non-passing grade was worth. The LEAP office will obtain grades from Student Affairs.As of January 2002, federal tax law mandates that prepaid tuition for degree-level coursework, in excess of $5,250 be considered additional taxable earnings in the calendar year (January- December) in which it was received. The amount of prepaid tuition benefits that exceeds $5,250 will be added to the employee's biweekly earnings and taxed based on the employee's payroll tax elections. It is the responsibility of Rush University Medical Center, at the end of each term, to withhold taxes based on this Federal tax law, Section 127.*Priority Deadlines College of Nursing Flat Rate (per term) P er-Credit Rate Tuition, All Nursing Academic Programs $10,851 (12+ credits) $953 (1-11 credits) Tuition, RN First Assist (RNFA) Course Series N/A $700 Technology Fee (New Incoming Students) $50.00 N/A Course Fees NSG 531, 532 and Proctoring) $100.00 Fee NSG 501P (New Incoming Students) $50.00 N/A The Graduate College Flat Rate (per term) P er-Credit Rate Biotechnology $15,000 N/A Health Sciences (12+ credits) $953 (1-11 credits) All Other Graduate College Academic Programs - Rate effective for students beginning their academic program $11,160 (12+ credits) $930 (1-11 credits) in Fall 2013, Spring 2014, or Summer 2014 semesters All Other Graduate College Academic Programs - Rate effective for students who began their academic program $8,700 (12+ credits) $725 (1-11 credits) prior to Fall 2013 semester Tuition and fees for the 2013-2014 academic year are listed below.

This fee does not apply to any other charges such as tuition. Enrollment Deposit The enrollment deposit fee holds a place for the student in the entering class. The deposit is non-refundable and is applied toward payment of the first term tuition. A $150 enrollment deposit is required for students in the College of Health Sciences undergraduate degree, certificate programs, clinical nutrition/ dietetic, medical laboratory sciences, perfusion technology, research administration, respiratory care and imaging sciences program. The enrollment deposit for audiology and speech- language pathology students is $200. The enrollment deposit for health systems management and occupational therapy students is $250. Students in the Physician Assistant Studies program must submit a deposit of $300. Rush Medical College students are required to pay $100 prior to matriculation. College of Nursing students and affiliated students must deposit $300 prior to matriculation. Students in The Graduate College PhD in health sciences program must pay a $150 enrollment deposit. The enrollment deposit for PhD in nursing students is $300, while the enrollment deposit for all basic sciences and biomedi- cal research programs within The Graduate College is $250. Late Registration Fee Continuing students must register during the official two-week registration period. Students registering after the registration period ends will incur the $50 late registration fee. An addi- tional $50 late registration fee will be applied to the student's financial account if the student has not registered by the end of the first day of the term. A student who feels that there are mitigating circumstances as to why the late registration fee should not be applied must first appeal to his or her advisor. If the advisor deems that the information warrants repealing the late registration fee, the advisor must speak with the program director. If the program director concurs with the advisor, the program advisor will notify the Office of the Registrar in writing and the late fee will be removed from the student's financial account by the Office of the Registrar and the Office of Financial Affairs.Continuous Enrollment Fee Students enrolled in a noncredit residency or academic enrich- ment program prior to receipt of their degree must be registered for Continuous Enrollment in order to retain their student status. Any degree or certificate student not taking courses but needing to replace an outstanding incomplete grade must register for Continuous Enrollment until the grade is satisfied. This fee also applies to graduate students who have completed all courses but have not had the dissertation accepted. Hospitalization or physician fees are not covered in this fee. Students auditing a course may be required to register for the continuous enrollment course (see \"Auditing a Course\"). Returned Checks If a student gives the University a check that is returned by the bank upon which it was drawn, marked \"not sufficient funds,\" \"payment stopped,\" or \"account closed,\" a $25 charge will be assessed for each occurrence. Rush Medical College Students and Tuition Charges Rush Medical College students are charged for a maximum of four years of full-time tuition. Medical students needing addi- tional terms to complete degree requirements will be charged the continuous enrollment fee. Although it may be possible for a medical student to complete all degree requirements prior to the spring term of his or her fourth year, a full four years of tuition charges must be paid prior to graduation. Auditing a Course Students who are registered in classes for credit and who wish to audit a separate class or classes will not be charged for the audited course(s). If the student only wishes to audit one or more classes and will not be registered in any classes for credit for that term, the student must register in continuous enroll- ment, at which point one credit hour of charge will be assessed at the student's normal tuition rate.54 RUSH UNIVERSITY Rush Medical College 55 Welcome to Rush Medical College Rush Medical College is a community of 525 medical students, 620 residents and fellows, learning from well over 1000 clinical and basic science faculty members. Educational experiences occur in the inpatient and outpatient environment of Rush University Medical Center, and in our diverse community. Research experiences are plentiful, and over half of our medical students participate in organized research projects. The medical student program is coordinated through the Office of Medical Student Programs, and the resident and fellow programs are institutionally coordinated by the Office of Graduate Medical Education. Students and house staff also are exposed to continuing medical education experiences through their programs. Our programs are primarily focused on clinical training in order to insure that all graduates are prepared to practice at the highest level of evidence-based care. The principles of patient- centered care, and the interaction between physicians and their patients are continually stressed. Faculty members are primarily practitioners of what they teach, and the practitioner-teacher model is central to our educational process and outcomes. In the end, we strive to ensure that graduates of Rush Medical College are prepared to deliver outstanding patient care and are prepared for a lifetime pursuit of knowl - edge and achievement of the highest quality. Thomas A. Deutsch, MD Henry P . Russe, MD, Dean of Rush Medical College 56 Rush Medical College: Philosophy The process of becoming a physician is unique for each student who enters Rush. Each student brings to his or her medical school experience a distinct educational, psychological and social background. As students define career goals, each student develops personal ways of coping with the demands imposed by the medical student's role. The Rush Medical College curriculum encourages pursuit of individual interests by emphasizing a solid foundation in the basic sciences and by offering a wide range of clinical opportunities in the Medical Center and a network of affiliated and associated hospitals. Throughout the educational program, students are encouraged to develop habits of self-education and lifelong study of medi - cine according to individual interests and objectives. Students are assigned advisors whose responsibilities are to provide guidance and to serve as resources for students as they define professional goals. Long after students have taken their last medical school examinations, the sense of responsibility for the welfare of their patients remains the most important stimulus to maintaining the highest level of performance. The Rush faculty seeks to provide educational opportunities and to create an environment that will foster the ability to meet these future responsibilities with competence and compassion. Rush Medical College: Mission and Terminal Objectives The mission of Rush Medical College is to deliver outstand- ing medical education focused on patient care, research and community service. Our diverse students learn in a practitioner- teacher model, which promotes collaboration, accountability and respect. We graduate physicians who are dedicated to the pursuit of excellence in clinical practice, research and service through continuous learning. Domains of Terminal Objectives: 1. P atient Care In their patient care, students must: Complete comprehensive evaluations of patients Develop appropriate treatment plans Apply the principles of health promotion 2. Medical Knowledge Students must: Demonstrate knowledge of the basic, clinical and social sciences related to medical practice Apply the knowledge of basic, clinical and social sciences to patient care3. Interpersonal and Communication Skills Students must: Communicate and collaborate effectively with patients, families and other health care providers Function as a member of the health care team 4. Putting Care in a Practical Context Students must: Be respectful of the diversity of patient backgrounds, beliefs and values Analyze the environmental and contextual factors that influence a patient's health, disease and access to health care Engage the resources of the health care system to enhance patient care 5. Self-Directed and Lifelong Learning Students must: Address personal learning needs Appraise scientific evidence that supports patient care practices 6. Professionalism Students must: Display compassion and empathy when interacting with patients and their families Adhere to the professional responsibilities outlined by Rush Medical College Demonstrate the professional values of medical practice Rush Medical College: Teacher-Learner Relationship Expectations for the Teacher-Learner Relationship Rush Medical College has a long-standing tradition of valuing and creating a productive and positive learning environment for its students-this environment is an institutional asset that is vital to carrying out our missions in teaching, patient care and research. The relationship between teachers and learners should be based on mutual trust, respect and responsibility. The expec - tations for maintaining a professional teacher-learner relation-ship are relevant to all faculty, residents, staff and students who participate in educational activities in the classroom, laboratory, research or clinical settings where there is a focus on education, patient care and ethical conduct. 57 Expectations for Learners Students are expected to participate in the learning process in an active, respectful and professional manner. Students' motiva- tion and actions should be appropriately directed at gaining the knowledge, skills and values that are required to become a competent, ethical and compassionate physician. This includes the following: Being adequately prepared for learning activities in the class- room, laboratory, research and clinical settings Treating faculty, residents, staff and fellow students with respect and collegiality Actively and appropriately seeking information to improve their own performance Reflecting on their performance and educational experiences to inform their self-directed learning and study Adhering to the tenets of the University Statement on Student Conduct and the University Statement on Academic Honesty, as well as the student-authored Student Honor Code Resolving conflict in an appropriate and professional manner Providing constructive feedback and evaluation about their learning experiences Expectations for Teachers Teachers are expected to participate in the learning process in an active, respectful and professional manner. Faculty, residents and staff who work with students and residents are charged with helping these learners to become competent, ethical and compassionate physicians. This includes the following: Being adequately prepared for learning activities in the class- room, laboratory, research and clinical settings Treating learners and fellow teachers with respect and collegiality Providing learners with clear expectations for performance and, when applicable, a detailed, written outline of course objectives and expectations Providing learners with ongoing, specific and constructive feedback about their performance Reflecting on their teaching to inform their own self-directed learning and study Actively participating in the development and improvement of courses and their content Timely completion of fair and accurate evaluation of student performance Holding students accountable to the tenets of the University Statement on Student Conduct and the University Statement on Academic Honesty, as well as the student-authored Student Honor Code Resolving conflict in an appropriate and professional manner Utilizing feedback and evaluation to improve their teaching Behaviors that Undermine Productive Teacher-Learner Relationships It is the policy of Rush Medical College that behaviors that undermine productive teacher-learner relationships such as violence, sexual harassment, discrimination and abuse must never be tolerated. Student abuse may be verbal, psychologi-cal or physical. It includes, but is not limited to, sexual harass- ment, discrimination due to age, racial and ethnic background, religion, national origin or disability. It is understood that all personnel will treat students in a collegial and professional manner. Other types of behavior can be inappropriate if the effect interferes with professional development. Behaviors such as making demeaning or derogatory remarks, belittling com- ments or destructive criticism fall into this category. Student abuse includes but is not limited to treating students in a harmful, injurious or offensive way: attacking in words, speaking insultingly, harshly or unjustly to or about a student; 1 reviling or demeaning a student; or otherwise undermining the self esteem or confidence of a student. Sexual harassment includes but is not limited to: offensive comments to or about the student; unwanted attention or unwelcome verbal advances; unwanted persistent invitations; unwelcome, explicit proposi- tions; offensive displays; offensive body language; unwanted physical advances; and/or sexual bribery. 2 Abuse and harass- ment create a hostile environment in which to work, and are also addressed in the Rush University Medical Center Policies and Procedures . It is understood that incidents of abuse or harass- ment may cover a spectrum from flagrant to ambiguous. The abuser may be a member of the faculty, a resident, a nurse, another student, a member of the administration, a hospital employee or even a patient. Examples of inappropriate behav- iors are: 1. Physical punishment or physical threats 2. Sexual har assment 3. Discrimination based on r ace, religion, ethnicity, sex, age, sexual orientation or physical disabilities58 4. Repeated episodes of psychological punishment of a student by a superior (e.g. public humiliation, threats and intimidation or removal of privileges) 5. Gr ading used to punish a student rather than to evaluate objective performance 6. Assigning tasks for punishment r ather than educational purposes 7. Requiring the performance of personal services 8. T aking credit for another individual's work 9. Intentional neglect or intentional lack of communication While providing critique is part of the learning process, in order to be effective and constructive, it should be handled in a way to promote learning and maintain a positive learning environment. Feedback should focus on behavior rather than personal characteristics. Procedures for Reporting Allegations of Mistreatment The reporting and resolution sections of this policy are designed to protect students from retaliation and to protect those charged with abuse from unfair accusations. The name of the student, the reporting individual and the alleged abuser will be held in strict confidence on a need-to-know basis. An incident of abuse may be reported by the student or by an individual who witnessed the incident of abuse. An incident can be reported directly to the Office of Medical Student Programs. An incident reported to a trusted faculty member, a class officer, a member of academic administration or a friend should be reported to the Office of Medical Student Programs. A complaint of harassment may be submitted either orally or in writing to the Office of Medical Student Programs by an individual who claims to have been harassed (the complain-ant) or by a faculty advisor, a member of the administration or another person authorized by the complainant to act on his or her behalf. The complaint should be submitted within 180 days after the alleged harassment occurs. However submit- ted, the complainant's name and specific allegations must be provided for further processing to occur. If the complaint of harassment is submitted by someone other than the complainant, the individual submitting the complaint shall be informed of the policies against harassment and retaliation and shall be advised that: 1. T he complaint cannot be processed further without the complainant's specific consent and 2. T he complainant should contact the Office of Medical Student Programs if he or she wants to proceed. Procedures for Resolution of Mistreatment Allegations Reported incidents will be reviewed with the student(s) involved in the situation to determine their level of commitment and concern in pursuing a report. In every case where the complainant wants to proceed with a complaint, the Office of Medical Student Programs shall inform the complainant of the policies against harassment and retalia - tion and shall advise the complainant of the following options to promote internal resolution of a complaint: 1. Informal Resolution The Office of Medical Student Programs or its designee will attempt to resolve the complaint through informal methods, including but not limited to discussion with the accused (with or without identifying the complainant) and appropriate administrative staff; discussion with the complainant; and/ or, if all parties agree, mediation of the complaint involving the participation of the complainant, accused and appropri- ate administrators. No complaint may be terminated through informal methods without the voluntary consent of the complainant. 2. F ormal Investigation and Resolution In the event the complaint is not resolved informally and the complainant wishes to proceed, a formal investigation will be undertaken by the Office of Medical Student Programs, involving Faculty Council and the Dean of Rush Medical College. The investigation will be handled confidentially to the extent possible, but the Office of Legal Affairs shall be kept advised as necessary. Prohibition Against Retaliation This policy prohibits any individual from engaging, whether directly or indirectly, in retaliatory conduct against an individual who brings a complaint or provides information during an investigation of such a complaint. Retaliatory conduct is conduct that adversely and unjustifiably affects the terms and conditions of another's education status, quality of life or education experi-ence and that is motivated by an intent to cause harm because of the targeted individual's involvement in the filing or investi- gation of a complaint about mistreatment. Students who believe that retaliatory actions have been taken against them because they have filed a complaint or provided information related to a complaint should communicate their concerns immediately to the Office of Medical Student Programs. 59 References 1.

Acknowledgement Sections of this policy have been adapted from the teacher- learner relationship policies from the UMDNJ New Jersey Medical School, Drexel University School of Medicine and Georgetown University School of Medicine and from the Rush University Policy and Procedures Concerning Sexual and other Harassment. Special Committee on the RMC Environment (SCORE) The Special Committee on the RMC Environment (SCORE) is a student committee responsible to monitor all aspects of the learning environment at RMC and to address any concerns that arise either through routine review or a filed report. While student mistreatment is rare, any occurrence is unaccept- able and inconsistent with the RMC policy of zero tolerance of student mistreatment as described in the Rush Medical College Teacher-Learner Relationship . SCORE, the Special Committee on the RMC Environment, is charged with the review of student concerns regarding the learning environment and the develop- ment of action plans in response to episodes of alleged medical student mistreatment. SCORE also works with the RMC commu- nity to promote a positive learning environment. The committee includes students, faculty, and administration. If a student experiences or witnesses mistreatment of a student by a member of the faculty, a resident, a member of the staff, or another student, the student should alert SCORE. Although students are encouraged to identify themselves in any report, students always have the right to request that their report remain anonymous. Students who identify themselves will be contacted by SCORE for follow up and to aid in an investiga- tion. Students are encouraged to be specific in their report by including names, times, dates and a description of the event. All reports are reviewed within a few business days of submission. SCORE can be contacted in any of the ways listed below: 1. Complete the online reporting form: https://www.surveymon - key.com/s/SCORE_Reporting. Students may submit a form at anytime. It is available to all RMC students via links in the Feedback shells in Blackboard and the RMC portal. 2.

Throughout the curriculum, emphasis is placed on the preparation of physicians who will function chiefly as medical practitioners and who will be committed to the delivery of qual- ity health care to a variety of populations, including those now underserved. Because Rush seeks to educate and train physicians who will be committed to meeting society's health care needs, the Committee on Admissions seeks excellence in academic achieve - ment and values, individual goals, personal accomplishments and related experiences. The Committee looks for individuals who exhibit social and intellectual maturity, personal integrity, empa- thy, professionalism and motivation for medicine. A personal interview is a vital part of the admissions process. All interviews are conducted on-campus and are granted at the discretion of the Committee on Admissions. The following attributes, behaviors and characteristics are valued in the selection of candidates for admission. The candidate should: Display leadership abilities as demonstrated by experiences during and since their undergraduate program. Demonstrate the value of community service evidenced by ongoing engagement and experience in programs over the past three to five years. Exhibit high moral character and solid judgment as expressed in the AMCAS application and in the LORs. Embrace diversity demonstrated by involvement, participation and interaction in experiences within various cultures, settings and/or communities different from their own. Show a commitment to the field of medicine with experiences that serve people and/or patients and knowledge of medi-cine demonstrated by participation in co-curricular activities related to medicine. Show excellence in academic achievement.Additional facets of the applicants' experiences that are impor - tant to the selection include but are not limited to: Previous health care experiences and/or employment Research experience Self-reflection, insight and judgment Fluency in other languages Time spent in another career Teaching Because of the variety of undergraduate programs and experi- ences that our applicants possess, Rush Medical College no longer considers a list of courses a reasonable expression of requirements for the medical college academic program. Applicants must have completed 90 credit hours (using the AMCAS methodology) prior to matriculation from an accredited four-year degree-granting U.S. or Canadian college or uni- versity. A baccalaureate degree is not required but is strongly preferred by the Committee on Admissions. The undergraduate major of applicants is not a factor in admission decisions by the Committee on Admissions. Only US citizens and permanent residents are eligible to apply. Required Criminal Background Check As a medical school located in Illinois, Rush Medical College will enforce the Medical School Matriculant Criminal History Records Check Act, which states: a medical school located in Illinois must require that each matriculant submit to a fingerprint-based criminal history records check for violent felony convictions and any adjudication of the matriculant as a sex offender conducted by the Department of State Police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation as part of the medical school admissions process. Each year beginning January 1st, Certiphi Screening, Inc will procure a background check on applicants at the point of their first acceptance. Upon completion of this process, the report procured during the process will be released to Rush Medical College. A positive result from either the Criminal Background Check and/or the Sex Offender assessment will result in the applicant's file being presented to the Committee on Student Evaluation and Promotion (COSEP) for review. If COSEP deter - mines that there is a positive result on the Criminal Background Check and/or the Sex Offender assessment, Rush Medical College may rescind the student's acceptance to Rush Medical College since the acceptance is contingent upon the student having a clean Criminal Background Check and Sex Offender Assessment. For additional information, visit the AAMC website at www.aamc.org.61 Policy Regarding Applicant Misrepresentation Rush Medical College expects applicants to be completely truthful in every aspect of their application to medical school. An application includes the full AMCAS application, Rush Secondary Application, two letters of recommendation and all other supporting documentation. If Rush Medical College suspects that there is a misrepresentation on the applica- tion, college staff will first give the applicant a chance to explain the discrepancy. If the applicant's explanation does not adequately assuage concerns about the misrepresentation, Rush Medical College will notify AMCAS of the discrepancy in accordance with its Policies and Procedures for Investigating Reported Violations of Admission and Enrollment Standards. Rush Medical College reserves the right to revoke an interview or offer of acceptance or waitlist if a misrepresentation has occurred. Technical (Non-academic) Standards for Admission and Promotion The following technical guidelines were adopted by the Committee on Student Evaluation and Promotion and the Rush Medical College Committee on Admissions, May 2012. A candidate for the MD degree must have abilities and skills in the areas of observation; communication; motor; intellectual, conceptual, integrative and quantitative abilities, behavioral and social attributes, and ethics and professionalism as described below. Observation. Students should be able to observe demonstra- tions and experiments in the basic sciences. Students should be able to observe a patient accurately at a distance and close at hand. Observation necessitates the functional use of vision, auditory and somatic sensation. It is enhanced by the functional use of the sense of smell. Communication. Students should be able to speak and hear English and to observe patients in order to elicit information; describe changes in mood, activity and posture; and perceive nonverbal communications. Students should be able to commu- nicate effectively and sensitively with patients. Communication includes not only speech but also reading and writing. Students should be able to communicate effectively and efficiently in oral and written forms of English with all members of the health care team. Motor. Students should have sufficient motor function to elicit information from patients by palpation, auscultation, percussion and other diagnostic maneuvers. Students should be able to perform basic laboratory tests, carry out diagnostic and thera- peutic procedures, and read graphic images. Students should be able to execute motor movements required to provide general care to patients, and to either provide, or direct the provision of emergency treatment of patients. Such actions require coordina-tion of both gross and fine muscular movements, and functional use of the senses of touch and vision. Intellectual, Conceptual, Integrative and Quantitative Abilities. Students should be able to engage in problem solv- ing, the critical skill demanded of physicians, which requires the intellectual abilities of measurement, retrieval, calculation, reasoning, analysis and synthesis. In addition, students should be able to comprehend three-dimensional relationships and to understand the spatial relationships of structures and to adapt to different learning environments. Behavioral and Social Attributes. Students should pos- sess the emotional health required for full utilization of their intellectual abilities; the exercise of good judgment; the prompt completion of all responsibilities attendant to the diagnosis and care of patients; and the development of mature, sensitive and effective relationships with patients, fellow students, faculty and staff. Students should be able to tolerate physically taxing workloads and to function effectively under stress. They should be able to adapt to changing environments, to display flexibility and learn to function in the face of uncertainties inherent in the clinical problems of many patients. Compassion, integrity, concern for others, interpersonal skills, interest, and motivation are all personal qualities that are assessed during the admis-sions and education processes. Ethics and Professionalism. Students should maintain and display ethical and moral behaviors commensurate with the role of a physician in all interactions with patients, faculty, staff, students and the public. Students should understand the legal and ethical aspects of medical practice and strive to abide by these principles throughout their time in training. Requests for accommodation by individuals with a disability as defined by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 or the Americans with Disability Act will be considered on the basis of their abilities and the extent to which reasonable accommodation, if required, can be provided. The Rush University Policy for Students with Disabilities describes the process for requesting an accommoda-tion. Please refer to the RUSDAT section of this Catalog.62 Rush Medical College: Academic Program Organization The RMC curriculum is based on establishing a foundation in the basic sciences and clinical medicine through required preclinical and clinical courses and electives. Curriculum: First and Second Years Curriculum: First Year The M1 Basic Science content is integrated into seven blocks taught in sequence through the academic year. Those seven blocks are: Grading Students will receive a grade of honors, pass, fail or incomplete for each of the blocks. The Physicianship Program is graded pass/fail. Curriculum: Third and Fourth Years The curricula of the third and fourth years provide students with additional training in clinical skills, diagnosis and patient management in a variety of patient care settings. Students must take and pass Step I of the examinations offered by the United States Medical Licensing Examination/National Board of Medical Examiners (USMLE/NBME) before beginning core clerkships. Prior to the start of the third year, students participate in an intensive review of clinical skills. A minimum of 78 weeks of clinical experiences is required for graduation. The curriculum includes 50 weeks of required core clerkships in internal medicine, neurology, pediatrics, psychiatry, obstetrics/gynecology, surgery, emergency medicine, primary care and a required senior sub-internship. The remaining 28 weeks required for graduation consist of elective study in areas of special interest to each student. The choice of electives is guided by the goal of an educationally-balanced undergraduate experience. Clinical experiences primarily take place at Rush University Medical Center and the John H. Stroger Hospital of Cook County. Of the 28 weeks of required student-chosen electives, up to 12 weeks of elective study may take place at other LCME- or ACGME-accredited institutions. A maximum of eight weeks of elective rotations may be taken in a single subspecialty. Students request a schedule of required core clerkships through a lottery system. In preparation for the USMLE Step 2 Clinical Skills exam, beginning fourth year students complete the Clinical Skills Assessment with standardized patients. This experience is designed to aid in self-evaluation of one's clinical skills (commu - nication and interpersonal skills, attitudes and procedural skills).

Student Misconduct Rush Medical College's Honor Code Council and the Committee on Student Evaluation and Promotion (COSEP) are charged with investigating and adjudicating charges of student misconduct of a nonacademic nature including but not limited to viola-tion of commonly accepted ethical standards of an academic community, such as cheating and plagiarism; falsification of student records, transcripts, financial aid forms or applications; unlawful use or possession of controlled substances ; conviction of a crime deemed serious enough to render the student unfit to pursue his or her profession; or other conduct inconsistent with generally accepted standards of behavior within an academic community or the medical profession Student Honor Code and Academic Honesty Rush Medical College students affirm their commitment to the Rush University Honor code. This code is consistent with student aspirations as future physicians to uphold values of responsibil- ity, professional behavior, and honesty in dealing with academ-ics, patients and colleagues. The Honor Code sets the standards for expected behavior and professionalism at Rush Medical College. Commitment to these standards is expected of all matriculating students and repre- sents students' commitment to their future as successful physi-cians. This commitment is a shared responsibility of students, faculty, and staff in the Rush University community to ensure the highest standards of behavior, whether in the classroom or in the clinical setting. In recognition of the responsibility to uphold these standards, any student, faculty member or staff who becomes aware of or suspects a violation of the Honor Code should follow these guidelines in addressing: 1. Either approach the individual who possibly violated the Honor Code directly with regard to the particular concern in order to eliminate misunderstandings or report it to the Chair of the Honor Code Council who will investigate the incident. 2. Allegations with merit should be documented by the individual who suspected the violation via the Honor Code Alleged Violation Form, which is submitted to the Honor Code Council. The Honor Code Council will consist of eight students (two students from each class), elected in January of the M1 year, who serve 3\u00bd years, as long as the elected student remains in good academic standing. The Honor Code Council will elect one student chair by majority vote in September of each year. The Assistant Chairman of COSEP and a member of OMSP will serve as nonvoting faculty men-tors for the Honor Code Council. 3. It is the right of all individuals alleged to have violated this Honor Code to contest the accusation(s) in a meeting with the Honor Code Council. After the Honor Code Council has met with the person(s) who initially presented the concern, the individual said to have violated the Honor Code will be interviewed separately in order to document all perspectives on this issue. 4. Based on majority vote , the Honor Code Council will prepare a written statement on the validity of the charge(s) and a proposed resolution, which will then be submitted to the COSEP . A copy of this written statement will also be provided to the student who was accused of violating the Honor Code. 5. T he COSEP will verify whether appropriate procedures were followed and determine the appropriate action based on the items submitted. Please see the \"University Statement on Academic Honesty\" in the \"Academic Resources and Policies section of the catalog.65 Advisor Program All Rush Medical College students are assigned to several types of advisors throughout their academic career. At matriculation they are assigned to a transition advisor, selected from faculty and staff who teach in the first and second years. Students meet with their transition advisors throughout the first two years of medical school in group and individual settings to facilitate their adjustment to all aspects of medical school. In their third year students are assigned a clinical advisor. These advisors are clinical faculty who meet individually with student to assist with development of plans for residency specialty choice and prepar - ing for the residency match. Students are also assigned a group of Peer Advisors from the second, third, and fourth years who work with the faculty advi- sors to provide advice, a student perspective about life, ensure student success and enhance student learning. All advisors are informed of current policies, procedures and trends affecting students' participation in curricular and non-curricular aspects of medical school by the Assistant Dean, who is responsible for program planning, coordination, and evaluation. Student Research Opportunities Students are encouraged to have some research experience while they are in medical school. The opportunities range from laboratory experiences in the biomedical sciences to clinical investigation and fieldwork in epidemiology, preventive medi- cine and primary care. Such research can be carried out during summers or during the time allotted for elective experiences. Rush Medical College also offers two more formal programs for medical students to become involved in research while in medi- cal school. First-year medical students have the opportunity to enroll in the elective course, Introduction to Biomedical Research. This is a year-long course consisting of lectures, journal club and one-on- one work with a faculty mentor to develop a research proposal. The Dean's Office Summer Research Fellowships are offered on a competitive basis to students between the M-1 and M-2 years to work on research projects with Rush faculty in basic science, clinical research and community service arenas. Students accepted in the program are provided a paid position to work full-time during the summer before the M2 year on their research project. Many students continue on and participate in these projects after the summer. For students who are interested in a more in-depth research experience, a leave can be granted from the medical college curriculum to pursue an MS or PhD degree. Graduation Requirements The following are prerequisites to the granting of the degree of Doctor of Medicine by Rush University: The level of achievement required by the faculty for the degree of Doctor of Medicine (MD) must be attained in a minimum of 35 months. A minimum of 78 weeks of instruction at Rush Medical College is required for students entering at the third-year level from other medical schools. Each student's progress in each year of the Rush Medical College curriculum will be evaluated by the Committee on Student Evaluation and Promotion.

We are both pleased and honored that you have chosen to further your education at Rush and are committed to having the degree that best prepares you for a rich and fascinating career in nursing and health care. Rush is renowned for its integration of education and practice and you will have the opportunity to work with extraordinary scholars and clinicians throughout your journey in the College of Nursing. Please know that you can feel comfortable calling on me and any other member of the faculty to meet your personal learning needs. Your success is our success and every member of our faculty and staff will do what it takes to ensure, not only your timely completion of the program, but a quality degree that will groom you for health care leadership. Again, our warmest welcome to Rush University College of Nursing and the Rush University Medical Center. Sincerely, Marquis D. Foreman, PhD, RN, FAAN Acting Dean of the College of Nursing 69 Philosophy The College of Nursing philosophy expresses the beliefs of the faculty regarding the metaparadigm of nursing and nursing education. Person The faculty believes that a person is a unique being who pos- sess innate dignity and worth with the right to self determina- tion. Persons live as individuals and as members of families, communities, and national and global societies. Environment The environment includes the multiple systems in which persons interact. This environment includes personal, physical, family, community, societal, economic, cultural, and politi- cal systems. Persons influence and are influenced by their environments. Health Health is a dynamic state of well-being that interacts with personal factors and the environment. It is perceived in the context of a multisystem environment. Nursing Nursing is both a discipline and a profession. The focus of the discipline is the generation of knowledge related to persons and their environments for the purpose of maximizing the well-being of individuals, families, communities and society through health promotion, restoration and maintenance. The focus of the profession is the care of individuals, groups and communities through application of discipline-specific and discipline-related knowledge. Nurses contribute both individu- ally and collaboratively with other professionals to promote positive health outcomes. Nurses apply a professional code of ethics and professional guidelines to clinical practice and demonstrate compassion, advocacy and cultural sensitivity. Nursing Education The education of nurses is a process by which the knowledge, skills, values and culture of nursing are transmitted to the learner. The faculty believes that professional nursing educa- tion is accomplished in a university setting and in an environ-ment where nursing education, practice and research are integrated. Nursing education is built upon knowledge from the sciences, arts and humanities so students understand and value the human experience and its relationship to health. Nursing faculty members foster student growth by providing learning experiences in a variety of health care settings so students can understand the complexity of health care and learn the nursing role. The education of nurses is an interac- tive process whereby students are actively engaged learners who take responsibility for their education and practice. The curricula of the College of Nursing are designed to: 1) produce nurses who are competent, caring practitioners; work to improve clinical outcomes through evidence based practice; are life-long learners that value scholarship; are collaborative members of interprofessional teams; and are leaders in the profession; and 2) produce clinical scholars who contribute to the scientific basis of nursing practice and positively influence the profession and the health care system. Programs The College of Nursing offers graduate nursing education that allows the student to exit with one of the following degrees: Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing Science (PhD) A set of core courses (or its equivalent) is required for every student. Cognate courses representing coursework from the biological, behavioral and organizational sciences are also required by each degree. Advanced clinical specialty courses are required as determined by an area of advanced practice concentration. Master of Science in Nursing Direct Entry Master's (MSN) for Non-Nurses: Generalist Entry Master's (GEM) Clinical Nurse Leader (CNL) Program The GEM program comprehensively prepares students, in a two-year full-time curriculum, to be a graduate (MSN) registered nurse (RN) clinician with a focus in clinical leader - ship. Graduates are prepared to function at a high level in in-patient, out-patient and community settings. The GEM program gives the student a broad overview of all of the major specialties in which nurses work, as well as a variety of settings across the health care continuum. From the GEM pro- gram students may seamlessly transition to doctoral education in either a Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) specialty or the Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing Science (PhD) program.70 Students are considered for admission to the GEM program after completing baccalaureate education at another accred- ited college or university. The GEM curriculum consists of 74 trimester hours of graduate coursework in nursing and related sciences. Students will take the Clinical Nurse Leader certifica- tion examination in their last trimester, and are eligible to take the NCLEX for RN licensure upon graduation. GEM students are expected to complete the MSN requirements on a full-time basis in six terms. Transfer credit is not awarded for required coursework in which the student earned less than a \"C\" grade. Physical education and technical skill courses are not accepted for transfer credit. Courses considered for transfer credit must be at the graduate level. Required Prerequisite Courses As a profession and a discipline, nursing promotes and protects human health and well-being and is grounded in a strong liberal arts, undergraduate education that includes the arts and humanities, as well as the behavioral, social and physical sciences. Recognizing that different undergraduate majors have varying requirements, applicants will be evaluated both on their success in meeting the requirements of their undergraduate programs and on the breadth and depth of their educational preparation for entry into nursing. Nursing practice and scholarship have great application in our society, ranging from the acute care of individuals to the management and promotion of the health of whole communi- ties and even nations. The College of Nursing welcomes and is enriched by applicants from a spectrum of disciplines and professions. Physical and biological sciences* This category of requirements includes successful completion of specific physical and biological courses. The following courses are required, minimally, to meet this criterion: Anatomy** (laboratory component strongly recommended) Physiology** (laboratory component strongly recommended) Microbiology with a laboratory component** Chemistry with a laboratory component*** **Anatomy and physiology may be taken as two separate courses or as Anatomy and Physiology I and Anatomy and Physiology II. ***General chemistry, inorganic, organic or biochemistry courses with a lab are all acceptable to meet the chemistry requirementBehavioral and social sciences*: These entry requirements may be met in several ways. They can include, but are not limited to, at least one course in the behavioral sciences (e.g., introductory, developmental, abnor - mal, cognitive or experimental psychology, personality develop- ment, women's studies, criminology, gender studies, human sexuality); and at least one course in the social sciences (e.g., sociology, anthropology, economics, political science, journalism, geography, African-American studies). The humanities*: Applicants should have at least one course in the humani- ties which may include, for example, courses in the repre- sentational and performing arts as well as history, literature, philosophy, art history, communication studies, cultural and clas - sic courses, theater, music theory, dance, cinema, religion, etc. *The required prerequisites course may be taken at any accredited university or community college. **It is strongly discouraged to take anatomy, physiol- ogy, microbiology and chemistry online. All required prerequisite courses must be completed, with a grade of \"C\" or better, prior to enrolling at Rush. Science courses should be taken with a laboratory component when- ever possible. It is highly recommended to have taken human anatomy and physiology within the last three years. MSN for RNs: Clinical Nurse Leader (CNL) The master's prepared clinical nurse leader (CNL) is responsible for clinical management of comprehensive client care, for indi - viduals and clinical populations across the continuum of care, and in multiple settings. The CNL assumes leadership/account-ability for health outcomes for a specific group of clients within a unit or setting through the assimilation and application of research-based information to design, implement and evaluate plans of care. The clinical nurse leader is also responsible for the coordination and planning of care team activities and functions. Health promotion, risk reduction and improvement in point-of- care outcomes are critical elements in the role of the clinical nurse leader. Applicants to the post-licensure Clinical Nurse Leader (CNL) program must have earned a baccalaureate degree from an accredited university. The program is six terms in length and offered as a part-time program of study. The majority of the CNL program is offered on-line, but students are required to come to campus for NSG 625L: Health Assessment Across the Lifespan Lab: Specialty. This is a live, on-campus compressed (3-4 day) 71 format course. There is a clinical residency requirement that may be completed at the student's place of employment. All MSN students are expected to complete their degree requirements in no more than five years. Terminal Objectives Both the pre-licensure and post-licensure MSN programs com- prehensively prepare students to be graduate nurse clinicians with a focus in clinical leadership. To achieve quality patient (client/population/cohort of clients) outcomes, the Clinical Nurse Leader will: Deliver holistic, competent and contextually appropriate patient/family/population-centered nursing care. Synthesize scientific evidence and innovative technologies to guide nursing practice in dynamic care environments. Develop collaborative, interdisciplinary and multi-sector relationships to ensure improved health care. Demonstrate leadership behaviors within and across systems at all levels of prevention. Manage the structure and processes of the care environment, incorporating policy, fiscal and macrosystem concepts. Demonstrate professional values in nursing practice. Employ therapeutic use of self and intentional presence to protect the value of the human relationship. Graduation Requirements Direct Entry Master's (MSN) for Non-Nurses: Generalist Entry Master's (GEM) Clinical Nurse Leader (CNL) Program requires a minimum of 74 trimester hours of didactic and 1,240 clock hours of clinical instruction. Candidates must pass a comprehensive examination. Graduates are eligible to write the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses (RN Licensure examination) and sit for CNL certification. MSN for RNs: Clinical Nurse Leader (CNL) requires a mini- mum of 37 credit hours and 400 clock hours of clinical instruc- tion. Graduates are eligible to sit for CNL certification. Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) Students are considered for admission to the DNP program with one of the following areas of focus: Doctor of Nursing Practice with Clinical Specialty Certification Students enter the DNP program with a specific clinical specialty focus after completing a BSN or MSN. Students select an area of specialization in one of the following roles and populations: Nurse Practitioner: - Adult-Gerontology Acute Care (AGACNP) - Care (AGPCNP) - F amily (FNP) - Neonatal (NNP) - P ediatric Primary Care (PNP) - P ediatric Acute Care (ACPNP) - Psychiatric-Mental Health (PMHNP) Clinical Nurse Specialist: - Adult-Gerontology - - Neonatal (NCNS) - Advanced Public Health Nursing (APHN) Nurse Anesthesia (CRNA) Specific areas of concentration have RN practice requirements that must be met prior to enrollment in the clinical courses for those DNP and post-graduate certificate programs. These pro- gram specific requirements are delineated below under College Admission Requirements. All specialty areas provide the requisite didactic and clinical coursework in order to sit for certification. Course requirements vary in each area of concentration. The College reserves the right to modify course requirements in consideration of overall curricular goals and design and certification standards. Depending upon the area of specialization, most BSN-DNP options range between 62 - 69 credit hours. MSN-DNP options require a minimum 30 credit hours of coursework. Doctor of Nursing Practice: Systems Leadership This area of focus is a post-master's practice doctorate that prepares graduates for systems-level leadership and improv- ing outcomes in a variety of settings. Students considered for 72 admission have leadership experience and a MSN, or a BSN and a MBA. Students must enter this area of focus with a capstone project idea. Doctor of Nursing Practice: Leadership to Enhance Population Health Outcomes This area of focus is on the development of population-based knowledge and skills to enhance clinical health outcomes for patient aggregates, communities and populations. Students with a BSN or MSN in an advanced practice nursing specialty will be considered for admission to the Leadership to Enhance Population Health Outcomes option. Terminal Objectives The DNP degree is designed to prepare graduates to function as leaders in advanced nursing practice. Graduates will be prepared to practice in a variety of complex clinical, organizational and/ or educational systems with diverse populations and will be able to affect changes in health care through system redesign and evidence-based decision making. These roles require a central focus on clinical practice with skills in education, research and leadership. Integrate science-based theories and data-based concepts to develop, critically appraise and implement practice approaches that improve health care and health care systems. Apply organizational theories and systems thinking to improve the quality, cost-effectiveness and safety outcomes of practice decisions and initiatives. Apply effective strategies for managing the ethical dilemmas inherent in patient care, the health care organization and research. Apply knowledge of informatics to monitor and improve outcomes, programs and systems of care. Provide leadership in influencing policies on the financing, regulation and delivery of health care. Lead interprofessional teams to improve patient and popula - tion health outcomes. Function independently in an advanced nursing role to improve health outcomes in a specialty area of practice. Graduation Requirements The DNP degree requires a minimum of 62 trimester hours of post-baccalaureate or 30 trimester hours of post-master's study. All Doctor of Nursing Practice students must complete degree requirements within five years. PhD in Nursing Science Students may enter the PhD program with a BSN or a MSN degree. Non-nurses with a graduate degree in a health-related field may also apply for admission to the PhD program. The PhD graduate is prepared as clinical nurse researcher with the leadership skills necessary to serve as a senior academician and influence health care systems and policy Terminal Objectives Graduates of the PhD program develop the skills of a clinical researcher. These skills are based on the integration of knowl- edge from biological, behavioral and clinical sciences. Their clinical research skills contribute to the scientific basis of care provided to individuals across the life span and in any setting where care is provided. Graduates also have leadership skills necessary to serve as senior academicians and influence health care systems and policy. Synthesize and apply theoretical and research-based knowl - edge in the investigation of clinical phenomena Test and integrate disciplinary knowledge in models of clini- cal practice across the levels of prevention Generate and disseminate research-based clinical knowledge Analyze health care trends to influence health and social policy for diverse client populations Participate in collaborative interprofessional practice and research Assume faculty responsibilities within a senior academic environment Function as a clinical scientist Graduation Requirements Divisional graduation requirements require completion of the approved individual program of study. For MSN to PhD students, coursework for the PhD must be the equivalent of at least 55 trimester hours of graduate credit in addition to the completed dissertation. BSN to PhD students must complete at least 63 trimester hours of graduate credit in addition to the dissertation. Post-Graduate Non-Degree Certificate and RNFA Options The Post-Graduate Non-Degree Certificate is intended for nurses who already have an advanced practice graduate degree in nursing (MSN or DNP) who wish to specialize in a different clinical area. It is expected that the following courses or their 73 equivalent are completed prior to admission to the post-grad - uate certificate program: Advanced Health Assessment Across the Lifespan, Physiology and/or Pathophysiology, Advanced Pharmacology, APRN Role and Diagnostics. Review of these courses for equivalence and transfer credit will be done upon admission into the program. Post-Graduate Advanced Practice Certificate Options: Adult-Gerontology Primary Care Neonatal Pediatric Acute Care Pediatric Primary Care Psychiatric-Mental Health RN First Assistant (RNFA) Course Series The RNFA two-course series prepares graduates to function in an expanded role in the operating room. RNs engage with the perioperative client across the lifespan to provide high qual- ity care and maximize clinical outcomes. The didactic course provides requisite knowledge and clinical experience includes a preceptorship, allowing for development and mastery of affec - tive and psychomotor skills necessary to work effectively in the operating room. The practicum course solidifies knowledge and skills and immerses the RN in the RNFA role. The series empha-sizes collaboration and communication among the interprofes- sional team in the operating room.

Student Progression in the College of Nursing Student progress in the College of Nursing is reviewed and evaluated in several ways. The progressions policies estab- lished by the faculty are interpreted and applied by the stu- dent's academic advisor, the Office of Academic Affairs, and the Progressions Committee. The faculty reserves the right to request the withdrawal of any student whose conduct, physical or mental health, or performance demonstrates lack of fitness for continuance in a health profession. Any such student not voluntarily withdrawing will be dismissed from the University. Since much of the work in nursing assumes that students will achieve a progressively higher level of understanding and skill, high academic performance is expected. The individual student is responsible for acquiring knowledge inside and outside of formal classroom and clinical settings. Academic Progressions Policy Students in all graduate programs must maintain a cumulative 3.0 average in graduate coursework to remain in good aca- demic standing. If a student's cumulative GPA drops below 3.0, he or she will be placed on academic probation. A student may enroll for no more than two consecutive terms as a probationary 75 student. Students may be dismissed from the College upon failing to achieve satisfactory academic standing in the required period of time or if the student has a second probationary event. A student must achieve an \"A\" or \"B\" grade in all required clini- cal nursing courses. If a \"C\" grade is achieved in a single clinical seminar course or a single clinical practicum, the student must repeat the course prior to graduation. A student may repeat only one clinical seminar or clinical practicum in a program of study. A grade of \"F ,\" \"N,\" \"WF ,\" \"WN\" or a second \"C\" in a required clinical seminar or clinical practicum may result in dismissal from the program. An \"F ,\" \"N,\" \"WF\" or \"WN\" grade in any required course places the student on academic probation and may result in dismissal from the program. Permission may be given to retake a course at the discretion of the Progressions Committee. If permitted, a student has only one opportunity to achieve a passing grade. An \"F ,\" \"N,\" \"WF\" or \"WN\" grade in the repeated courses may result in dismissal. To be awarded a degree or certificate, a student must be in good academic standing by the completion of her or his program. Committees Faculty Senate The Faculty Senate is the senior representative and govern-ing body for the College of Nursing faculty and operates as the Committee on Committees. The Senate has eight elected members: six faculty members and two student representatives. Members of this body serve three-year terms. The Senate mem- bers elect their own chairperson annually.

Philosophy of General Education Undergraduate programs at Rush University prepare entry-level professionals for various roles in health care. The University strives to provide an environment where knowledgeable, informed and literate students are prepared to take their place, not only in the health care arena, but also as citizens of the world. The professional education builds on a solid general education, which forms the basis for life-long learning and prepares graduates to be practitioners with social consciences. Students are admitted to Rush University with general education sufficient to lay the groundwork for developing excellent writ- ten and verbal communication skills, critical thinking abilities, cultural sensitivity, high ethical standards and an inquiring mind. Students are expected to enter Rush University with foundations in communications, humanities, mathematics, physical/life sci- ences and social sciences. The professional education offered by the University completes the student's general education, resulting in a graduate who: Communicates effectively in writing and speech Demonstrates intellectual curiosity and critical thinking in the application of math and science to practice Applies ethical principles to practice Demonstrates ability to practice effectively in a diverse society Exercises/expresses his or her social conscience to positively influence health care at local to global levels. General Education Requirements Effective January 1, 2009 all entering students1 must complete the following general education requirements in order to be eligible for the Bachelor of Science degree: 115 1. These requirements do not apply to students entering the College of Health Sciences prior to Januar y 1, 2009. 2. Minimum course and credit hour requirements for the Bachelor of Science degree are listed. Most College of Health Sciences prog rams require additional prerequisite courses and/or general education courses from the areas listed above. Applicants should review the specific prerequ isite and general education requirements for program (s) for which they are applying. 3. For students completing courses on the quarter system, actual credit awarded (and required) may be less. Please check with your academic program. Academic Policies Undergraduate Enrollment in Graduate Courses With permission from the department chairperson or program director, undergraduate students may register for graduate- level courses. Credit earned in this manner may apply toward the baccalaureate degree, pending approval by the depart-ment chairperson or program director. Should an undergradu- ate student later apply for and gain admission to a graduate program at Rush University, the student may request that graduate credit previously earned be applied toward the master's degree. A Petition to Transfer Credit form should be completed. Forms are available from the Office of the Registrar or from the web site (www.rushu.rush.edu/registrar). Credit transferred in this manner is limited. A student must earn a minimum of 180 quarter hours to receive the Bachelor of Science degree. If a student actually earns 187 quarter hours, for example, and seven quarter hours are at the graduate level at Rush, seven quarter hours may be credited toward the master's degree. Examination Policy The examination policy is the responsibility of the individual course director who will inform students of examination requirements for that particular course. A time period at the end of the quarter is provided for examinations. This time period may be used as the course director chooses. Readmission Any student who has withdrawn from a program or has not been enrolled for one or more quarters or any dismissed student may apply for readmission by submitting an applica- tion for this purpose. Applications for re-enrollment must be received at least three months before the planned return. An interview may be required. A re-entering student must meet the conditions for re-enrollment stated in his or her dismissal or re-entry acceptance letter and all policies, requirements and course sequences in effect at the time of re-entry. Previously enrolled students may be considered as part of the pool of new applicants and are not guaranteed admission. The stu - dent will pay tuition and fees at the rates in effect at the time of re-enrollment.

A hallmark of outstanding Rush students and alumni is the desire and ability to make meaningful service contributions. Community service activities may include volunteer activities (health fairs and clinics, health education, provision of health services to at risk or disadvan - taged populations and other outreach education or clinical activities) and service on community boards, committees, work groups and other service activities that promote the health and well-being of the community and its members. Professional ser - vice may include participation in the provision of state, national or international activities to advance the quality, access and effectiveness of health care services provided by allied health professionals. Achievement of the College of Health Sciences Excellence in Service Goal is demonstrated in part through: 1. Student and faculty participation in community service activities 2. Student satisfaction with and appreciation for community service 3. Students and faculty who provide leadership and support to professional associations, boards and committees 4. Provision of community and professional continuing educa- tion to local, national and international audiences In order to support achievement of the college's service excel- lence goals and objectives, the college has developed a profes - sional and community service requirement for all CHS students as a part of their academic programs. As a requirement for program completion, each academic degree granting program will establish a minimum service requirement for each student enrolled in the program of at least sixteen (16) contact hours of approved professional or commu- nity service. Examples of activities that may be used to meet this require- ment include participation in community health fairs; community health screening and/or health services; provision of community health education; participation in approved professional service and/or continuing education activities; and assistance with the delivery of seminars, lectures, workshops and related community or professional continuing education activities. This program requirement will be required for satisfactory course completion for at least one course in the student's prescribed course of studies. As an alternative, the requirement may be listed as a graduation requirement for the program in the cata-log and program handbook. Conduct and Ethics Each student is expected to conduct himself or herself in a pro-fessional manner at all times\u2014in a manner which conforms to the ethics of the health professions and which instills confidence in the student's abilities as a health care professional. Each stu - dent is expected to conform to the professional code of ethics as outlined in his or her departmental student handbook. Irresponsible, unprofessional or unethical behavior may result in disciplinary action, which may include suspension or dismissal from the college. All clinical agency or hospital regulations are to be followed by students when undergoing clinical or other training in a facility. For additional information, students should refer to the Rush University Statement on Academic Honesty and Student Conduct and the Rush University Medical Center Code of Conduct. Scholastic Dishonesty and Cheating The College of Health Sciences will not condone cheating in any form. Allegations of cheating will be reviewed by the depart- mental Committee on Progress and Promotions. Any student found to be cheating on an examination may receive a \"0\" for the examination and will be subject to formal disciplinary action, which may include suspension or dismissal from the program. Failure to report incidents involving scholastic dishonesty on the part of another student will be considered unprofessional conduct and may also result in disciplinary action. Students should refer to the Rush University Policy on Academic Honesty and Student Conduct for further information. HIPAA and Patient Privacy Rush University students have a legal and ethical responsibility to safeguard the privacy of all patients and protect confiden- tiality and security of all health information. Protecting the confidentiality of patient information means protecting it from unauthorized use or disclosure in any format\u2014verbal, fax, writ - ten or electronic/computer. Patient confidentiality is a central obligation of patient care. Any breaches in patient confidentiality or privacy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal from the College. 117 The laboratory component of some courses may use students as simulated patients. This is particularly true for the patient evaluation, medicine and patient education components. Additionally, the sharing of personal experiences can be a rich resource in the development of students' understanding, knowledge and appreciation of disease, health care and impact on peoples' lives. Practicing the medical history and physical examination of patients places students in close contact and leads to the sharing of personal information and physical findings. Similarly students may use personal experiences in patient role-playing exercises. All shared and personal medical information and physical examination findings are to be treated with utmost confiden-tiality, the same as for any patient contact. Failure to protect the confidentiality of any information related to the activities in a course or clinical rotation may result in disciplinary action, up to and including suspension or dismissal from the College. For additional information, students should refer to the Rush University HIPAA policy and the Rush University Policy on Privacy and Confidentiality of Student Records and FERPA.

The student will have been identified as violating an established standard of professional conduct/judgment or moral/ ethical behavior, and the department chair or program director will have been notified. Step 2. The department chair or program director will meet with the individual(s) making the allegation and the student's faculty advisor to review the available information and deter - mine the veracity of the allegations. Step 3. The department chair, student and faculty advisor, whenever possible, will meet as promptly as possible after the alleged incident. The department chair will report to the student the facts and available information and will seek to authenticate or clarify the allegations where possible. If it is determined that there is no basis for the allegation, no further action will be taken. Step 4. If it is determined that there is a basis for the allegation and that further investigation is necessary, a preliminary hearing of the departmental Committee on Progress and Promotions will be convened to review the allegations and recommend a course of action. The department chair will inform the student and the dean in writing of the preliminary hearing and the following: a) Date b) Name of student c) Nature of the allegations d) Date of alleged incident/occurrence e) Professional attributes that allegedly violate standards: skill, behavior, judgment, ethical values, etc. For more information regarding the procedures for handling instances of unprofessional conduct, see the current departmen-tal student handbook, University Catalog and the College of Health Sciences Policies and Procedures for the Rush University Rules for Governance. Incidents in the Clinical Agency An incident occurring that affects patients' or staff's well-being or the patient's prescribed care will be reported to the clinical instructor or preceptor immediately. An institutional incident report will then be completed following the policy of the health care institution or hospital in which the incident occurred. A dupli-cate of the hospital incident report as well as a memorandum of explanation from the clinical instructor or preceptor will be placed in the student's clinical file and the department chair, program director or clinical director will be notified immediately. Incidents involving gross errors in judgment or practice on the part of the student will constitute grounds for dismissal from the program. Criminal Background Checks and Drug Testing Programs offered in the College of Health Sciences often require that clinical rotations, practica, internships or other learning experiences be successfully completed in hospitals and other health care facilities in order to meet program requirements. Because use of these facilities is required, students must be able to successfully complete their assigned rotations in order to fulfill the academic requirements of their program. Hospitals and other health care facilities often have policies requiring criminal background checks for employees, students and volunteers. These facilities may refuse to accept individuals for clinical, practicum or other experiential rotations based on past criminal convictions. Students should be prepared to comply with the policies and procedures at any facility where they are assigned as part of their educational program and may not request facility assignments in an effort to avoid specific requirements. Students who have certain types of information in their criminal background checks 119 may be ineligible to complete rotations in specific facilities. Students who are not allowed to participate at assigned facili-ties or who are terminated from rotations based on the results of a criminal background check will be unable to complete the program requirements for graduation and will be subject to dismissal on academic grounds. Students should also be advised that persons with certain types of criminal convictions may not be eligible for state licensure and/or national registry or certification. In addition, many employers perform criminal background checks and may not hire individuals with certain types of criminal convictions. Drug Testing Hospitals and other health care facilities often have policies requiring drug testing for employees, students and volunteers. Some facilities provide that students who test positive for drugs are ineligible to complete clinical, practicum or work assign- ments in that facility. Students should be prepared to comply with the policies and procedures at any assigned facility and may not request facility assignments in an effort to avoid drug screening requirements. Students who fail to report for clinical or practicum assignments or who are terminated from rotations because they violate the drug-testing or drug-use policies of the facilities will be subject to dismissal from the program. Procedures for the Implementation of an Academic Accommodation for Students with Disabilities After approval of a request for an academic accommodation by the Rush University Student Disability Assessment Team (the Team), the Director of Academic and Student Affairs (the Director) in the College of Health Sciences will be notified regarding the granted accommodation. The Director will sched-ule a meeting with the student to discuss the accommodation and to identify any special circumstances that may need to be considered with regard to its implementation. The student will sign a release allowing the Director to communicate with indi-viduals in the student's program on a need-to-know basis about the accommodation and to discuss its purpose and rationale. The Director will coordinate the implementation of the accom- modation. Accommodation arrangements will be made by the department. Students are responsible for aids or assistance of a personal nature such as wheelchairs, hearing aids, computers and attendants for services to be used at home or on campus. The student with a disability is responsible for contacting the Director if he or she feels that the approved accommodations are not being implemented as recommended. The Director will meet with the student at least once each aca-demic year to evaluate the effectiveness of the accommodation; the resulting academic outcomes; and the need to continue, modify or expand the accommodation. The student will meet with the Director at a time that is mutually agreeable for the purpose of completing this evaluation. The Director may consult with faculty or other appropriate individuals to obtain informa-tion that will be helpful in evaluating the success of student accommodations. Any requests for changes to the student accommodation resulting from this meeting will need to be submitted by the student to the Team for further consideration and a decision regarding approval. Student Government A Student Government Association exists for the students enrolled in the College of Health Sciences. Student representa-tives will be elected by the student body in such a manner as to provide appropriate representation for all students in the College of Health Sciences. Release of Student Information Students must sign a release requesting enrollment verification, verification of degree, recommendations, letters of reference or release of other student information. For a \"Letter of Degree or Enrollment Verification,\" the student should use the form provided by the Office of the Registrar (see: http://www.rushu.rush.edu/registrar/forms.html). The Office of the Registrar is the only authorized office at Rush University to release enrollment or degree verification information. For recommendations or letters of reference, a release form is required for personally identifiable information from a student's education record given out by the College of Health Sciences (CHS) faculty. This form is available at: http://www.rushu.rush.edu/registrar/forms.html. (Please note: The College of Health Sciences requires that all recommendations or letters of refer - ence\u2014even if they are based upon the recommender's personal observation or knowledge\u2014have a release form on file before the person writing the recommendation can release the recom- mendation or letter of reference.) Student grades will not be posted and cannot be given out over the telephone or via email. For additional information, students should refer to the Rush University Policy on Privacy and Confidentiality of Student Records and FERPA. 120 Student Academic Appeal and Grievance Procedures The College of Health Sciences student appeals and griev- ance procedures provide a mechanism whereby any student may obtain a review of a complaint of unfair treatment. The student appeals procedures shall not be used to question a rule, procedure or policy established by an authorized faculty or administrative body. Rather it shall be used to provide due process for those who believe that a rule, procedure or policy has been applied in an unfair or inequitable manner, or that there has been unfair or improper treatment by a person or persons. Students who are appealing an academic decision that could result in a dismissal from the university may be allowed to continue to progress in the program until the issue is resolved. If the academic decision is upheld and the student is dismissed from the university they will be withdrawn from their current classes. This withdrawal will be backdated to before the begin - ning of the quarter and the student will receive 100 percent tuition reimbursement for that quarter. A student wishing to appeal an academic decision should follow the process summarized below, in the sequence indicated. Step 1. In the academic community, the responsibility for course development, course delivery and the assessment of student achievement rests primarily with each course instructor. Any student who has a complaint of inappropriate treatment related to a course should first seek to resolve it informally with the course instructor. If the course instructor is the department chairperson or if the complaint does not pertain to a specific course, the student should seek resolution with the department chairperson at the outset. 1. A student with such a complaint must request reconsider a- tion, in writing, of the application of a rule, procedure or policy, or unfair or improper treatment within five working days following the incident that forms the basis for the com-plaint (e.g., five days after grades are posted). 2. T he instructor will meet with the student (or speak with the student via telephone for those students who are unable to come to the instructor's office, if so requested by the stu- dent). The instructor will notify the student in writing of his or her decision regarding the complaint within five working days following the meeting or discussion. Step 2. If resolution is not achieved informally, as described in Step 1, the student should seek resolution with the chairperson of the department in which the course is offered within five working days following notification by the instructor of his or her decision. 1. T he chairperson will meet with the student (or speak with the student for those students unable to come to the chairper - son's office if so requested by the student) following receipt of the student's request for resolution to discuss the problem or complaint. 2. T he chairperson will notify the student of his or her decision in writing following the meeting or discussion. Step 3. If the issue was not resolved in Step 2, the student may submit a written appeal, describing the nature of the student's complaint and reasons for seeking an appeal to the student progress and promotion committee of the department within five working days following notification by the department chairperson of his or her decision. 1. T he student may appear before the committee in person, make an oral statement and answer questions from the com-mittee. The student will not be allowed to be present during committee deliberations. 2. T he committee may request that the course instructor or faculty member named in the grievance appear before the committee to make an oral statement and answer questions. The instructor or faculty member named in the grievance may not be present during committee deliberations. 3. F ollowing review of information provided, the committee will notify the student of its decision. Step 4. If the issue was not resolved to the student's satisfac-tion in Step 3 the student may submit a written request seeking a hearing to the Dean within five working days of receiving the department progress and promotion committee decision. The written request should include a description of the complaint and the reason the student is seeking an appeal. 1. T he Dean will meet with the student following receipt of the written request from the student for a hearing. 2. F ollowing the meeting with the student, the Dean may render a decision or choose to appoint a panel to investigate the grievance and make a recommendation to the Dean. 3. F ollowing review of the information provided and any recom - mendations from the panel, should one be appointed, the Dean will then notify the student of his or her decision. The decision of the Dean shall be final. 121 Committees The senior administrative and policy body of the College of Health Sciences is the Chairs Council.

The Combined MS/Dietetic Internship program students shall complete the internship requirements within 24 months and the MS degree within five years from matriculation. Registered Dietitians enrolled in the MS Degree for Registered Dietitians shall complete degree requirements within five years from matriculation. Clinical Nutrition: Research Activities All students will complete a master's thesis. Faculty members of the Department of Clinical Nutrition are involved in basic and applied clinical nutrition and management research. Faculty and students present at professional meetings and publish in peer reviewed journals. A list of faculty and student research presentations and publications can be found at the Clinical Nutrition website at www.rushu.rush.edu/nutrition Clinical Nutrition: Service Activities The practitioner-teacher model is evident in the fully integrated operational and academic facilities/staff, providing unique opportunities for the merging of theory and practice within one institution. Two departments jointly administer the combined MS/Dietetic Internship program. The Department of Food and Nutrition Services at Rush University Medical Center provides the internship or supervised practice experience. The didactic component of the Master of Science degree is provided by the Department of Clinical Nutrition at Rush University. In addi-tion to the academic program, the Department of Food and Nutrition Services provides nutrition services to the hospital and to the outpatient area, operates three foodservice units within the Medical Center and provides leadership in nutrition support in critical care. Students in both programs are required to complete 16 hours of community or professional service during the program. Students meet this requirement in a variety of ways including assisting at health fairs; volunteering at the local food pantry; and assisting at local, state and national professional associa - tion meetings.Communication Disorders and Sciences: Philosophy The underlying basis for the graduate degree programs in audiol- ogy and speech-language pathology is the practitioner-teacher model, whereby students learn from faculty who take on dual roles as academicians and practitioners. This approach to profes- sional education helps to bridge the gap that can exist between classroom teaching and clinical service delivery. Students learn in an environment where teaching, research and patient care are wholly integrated. The faculty at Rush participate fully in the clini- cal process in addition to teaching and research. Students receive outstanding clinical education experiences with diverse patients who present a full range of communicative disorders. Department faculty is supplemented by the expertise of physicians, scientists and other health care professionals within the Medical Center. The audiology and speech-language pathology programs are accred-ited by the Council on Academic Accreditation of the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA). The programs in audiology and speech-language pathology are based on the philosophy that professional education is optimized by drawing upon the patients, staff and other resources of an academic medical center. The resources at Rush University enrich and enhance faculty and student research and scholarship, and they provide unique opportunities for multidisciplinary collabora-tions. The clinical skills of Rush students are fostered and devel- oped through didactic courses, clinical observation and instruction, and supervision by practitioner-teachers. The department faculty is supplemented by the expertise of physicians, scientists and other health care practitioners within the medical center. The goals of the academic programs in audiology and speech-language pathology are to generate and disseminate new knowl-edge in the communication disorders and sciences and to prepare graduates who: Synthesize contemporary knowledge of speech and hearing science and apply it in the assessment and management of a broad spectrum of communication disorders Implement evidence-based protocols for the evaluation and treatment of individuals with communication disorders Utilize and contribute to new knowledge in the professions and discipline Function as professional-level speech-language pathologists or audiologists in health care and other settings Are eligible for clinical certification from the American-Speech- Language-Hearing Association Are eligible for state licensure within the profession 128 Mission Statement of the Department of Communication Disorders and Sciences The Department of Communication Disorders and Sciences at Rush University Medical Center will provide outstanding gradu- ate education in audiology and speech-language pathology, superior patient care, excellence in research and scholarship, and commitment to service to diverse communities. Vision Statement The Department of Communication Disorders and Sciences will be recognized as the clinical center and graduate education program of choice in the state of Illinois and among the very best in the United States. Professional Credentialing Rush programs in communication disorders and sciences offer the academic and clinical education background necessary to begin the ASHA clinical fellowship year (speech-language pathology) and to meet requirements for certification in audiol-ogy and speech-language pathology.

Communication Disorders and Sciences: Academic Policies The Academic Resources and Policies section of this catalog contains Rush University academic policies. Academic Progression Academic probation is assigned to a student who earns a quarterly academic grade point average (GPA) between 2.5 and 2.99 (A = 4.0), and/or whose cumulative academic GPA falls between 2.5 and 2.99 at any time. A remediation plan to address probation will be determined by the student and the student's academic advisor and documented. A student must earn a quarterly and cumulative academic GPA of 3.0 or greater at the end of the quarter during which the student is on academic probation or be placed again on academic probation. A student who incurs academic probation for the third time will be dismissed from the program, even if the cumulative academic GPA is 3.0 or greater. A student who earns a grade of \"D\" or less in a required course must repeat that course or an approved equivalent. In a repeated course, the new grade will replace the earlier grade in the cumulative academic GPA. Failure to receive a grade of \"C\" or better in a repeated course will result in dismissal from the program. A student who earns a grade of \"D\" or less in two or more required courses, regardless of the grade earned in a repeated course and regardless of the cumulative academic GPA, will be dismissed from the program. 130 A student who earns a quarterly academic GPA of less than 2.5 at any point during his or her course of study will be dismissed from the program. A student who fails to meet the stated criteria for the compre- hensive examination will be dismissed from the program. A cumulative academic GPA of 3.0 or greater is required for graduation. Clinical Progression Clinical probation is assigned to a student who earns a grade of \"C\" or less in a clinical practicum, internship or externship. Although the clinical contact hours may be used to meet CFCC (ASHA) certification requirements, the student is required to repeat the clinical education course before progressing further in the clinical sequence. A remediation plan to address clini- cal probation will be determined by the student, the student's academic advisor and the clinical education manager and will be documented. Failure to achieve a grade of \"B\" or higher in any subsequent clinical education course will result in dismissal from the program. The faculty reserves the right to request the withdrawal of any student whose conduct or performance demonstrates lack of fitness for continuance in a health profession. Any such student not voluntarily withdrawing will be dismissed from the program. Interrupted Program Any student who wishes or needs to interrupt their program must fulfill the following requirements: Meet with their academic advisor and the Program Director to work out a plan of action before leaving the program. Complete all degree requirements within four years (master's program) and eight years (doctoral program) of the beginning of the first quarter in which the full-time student is enrolled in the department. Follow all appropriate leave of absence/withdrawal procedures and policies as defined by Rush University. Academic Appeal and Grievance See the CDS Student Manual for the policy on academic appeal and grievance and for other policies. The department follows procedures outlined in the College of Health Sciences Student Academic Appeal and Grievance Procedures. Communication Disorders and Sciences: Speech-Language Pathology Curriculum Thesis Track Thesis students may de-select up to 8 credit hours of select coursework, shown in italics below. De-selected courses may be audited; audited courses will appear on the student's transcript. The selection of the courses to remove from a student's program of study is done with the approval of the student's advisor, tak- ing into account the individual's undergraduate background and graduate needs and experiences. Enrollment in practicum may be reduced in the winter and spring terms of the second year. These practicum experiences will be scheduled either on campus or at select external sites to facilitate completion of the thesis. The decision to reduce time in practicum for one or both quarters is made in consultation with a student's advisor and the clinical education manager. Students who reduce their practicum hours must be in frequent contact with the clinical education manager throughout their academic programs to monitor that the requisite contact hours needed for graduation are being attained.

Graduation Requirements The requirements for the Master of Science degree in speech- language pathology and the Doctor of Audiology degree include a cumulative academic GPA of 3.0 or greater and successful completion of the comprehensive examination. Audiology students also must complete their Investigative Project; thesis students must successfully complete the thesis process. All master's degree requirements must be completed within 48 months from the beginning of the first quarter in which a full-time student is enrolled in the program. Requirements for the doctoral degree must be completed within eight years of the beginning of the first quarter in which a full-time student is enrolled. Students must complete the number of quarter hours required by the program. Refer to the Department of Communication Disorders and Sciences Student Manual for additional discussion about graduation and degree progression. Educational Activities The Department of Communication Disorders and Sciences provides professional education and training in speech-language pathology and audiology. Its programs are notable in that the education of speech-language pathologists and audiologists are enhanced by the opportunities, resources and facilities provided by a world-class academic medical center. In addition to didactic and clinical activities, students and faculty participate in journal clubs, rounds and student/faculty development. Students and faculty benefit from presentations by distinguished guests who share research and clinical expertise in audiology or speech- language pathology. Special seminars and presentations on various health care topics are available to students throughout Rush University Medical Center. Faculty members are involved in the education of residents and students in Rush Medical College. Faculty members participate in grand rounds for various medical specialties and provide in-service programs on campus for staff at Rush University Medical Center and at the Johnston R. Bowman Health Center. Research Activities Faculty members are involved in collaborative and transla-tional research in the areas of audiology, hearing science and speech-language pathology. Projects include cochlear implant processing, working memory and communication, adult speech disorders, dysphagia, neurogenic communication disorders, language and literacy in children, quality of life and hearing aids, aging and hearing loss and many other topics related to human communication. Faculty members publish in professional journals and present at international, national and state meet-ings. Summaries of faculty research and professional activities are available online at the Department's Web site. Students are encouraged to participate in the research process, including development of hypotheses, data collection and presentation or publication of results. Thesis The faculty's commitment to research and the belief that an appreciation of scientific endeavors is critical to the clinical process provide the basis for an optional thesis. Many students in graduate school choose to do a thesis, thereby gaining valu-able research experience. A thesis project is databased and may be an original or replication study. Often students present the results of their research at a professional meeting or publish results in a professional journal. The thesis project is optional in the speech-language pathology curriculum, and students are encouraged to consider choosing this option. Students explor - ing the thesis option must have a minimum GPA of 3.4 at the end of their first term of enrollment. Audiology students have the opportunity to complete a thesis in lieu of the Investigative Project. The complete thesis policy is found in the Student Manual for the Department of Communication Disorders and Sciences. Investigative Project Students enrolled in the Doctor of Audiology program complete the Investigative Project during the third year of the curriculum. The objectives of the Investigative Project are to synthesize a body of literature related to a specific topic in audiology, to cultivate professional writing skills, to acquire didactic skills for dissemination of professional information and to develop organizational and verbal tools needed for professional pre- sentations. Ordinarily, the investigative project includes two options: 1) Evidence-based Practice Systematic Review or 2) 142 Experimental Project. A complete description of the Investigative Project is found in the Student Manual for the Department of Communication Disorders and Sciences. Students are expected to submit the completed project for presentation at a state or national professional meeting or for publication. Service Activities The faculty provides a full range of diagnostic and therapeu-tic services to a large clinical population, both inpatients and outpatients. In addition, faculty and students participate in community and professional activities on the local, national and international level. Students and faculty participate in health fairs, screenings and other service activities throughout the year. Faculty provides leadership, editorial and committee service to state and national scientific and professional associations.

If a student earns grades lower than \"C\" or their cumulative GPA falls below a 2.0, the student may not be permitted to register for subsequent courses and may be subject to dismissal from the program. Students who withdraw or who have been dismissed from the program must reapply and will be considered on the same basis as a new applicant. Students requesting readmission must submit a letter to the College of Admissions. Academic Probation During the program, if a student's performance is unsatisfac- tory (GPA less than 2.0 or a letter grade of less than \"C\"), he or she may not be permitted to register for subsequent classes. The student will be subject to dismissal from the program. If the student wishes to reenter the program, he or she must reapply and will be considered on the same basis as any new applicant. Students who voluntarily withdraw from the program, either passing or failing, have no guarantee of reinstatement to the program. Students requesting readmission to the program should submit a letter to that effect to the Committee on Progress and Promotion for Imaging Sciences. Clinical Work Students must maintain a cumulative GPA in the program of at least 2.0 unless otherwise described in a given course syllabus, the minimum satisfactory grade for course credit is 75% (a letter grade of \"C\"), and all stipulated segments of a course must be passed by this standard. Students must demonstrate proficiency in all clinical skills presented in order to pass clinical courses. For all clinical courses, the final exam must be passed at the designated cut score and a grade of \"C\" or better must be maintained in order to successfully complete each Clinical Practice to continue in the program. Grievance Policy \u2014 Student Appeals Normal communication regarding course or program policy should be first directed to the instructor assigned to the course or clinical section involved. In the event that the student is unable to satisfy his or her inquiry or request at that level, the matter should be referred to either the clinical director (in the case of clinical practice) or the department chair (in the case of academic coursework or policy). In the event that the matter in question cannot be resolved at that level, it should be directed to the Committee on Progress and Promotions for Imaging Sciences. This committee will either resolve the matter in ques- tion to the student's satisfaction or instruct the student on available mechanisms for appeal as described in the University Catalog and University Student Handbook. Comprehensive Examination At the end of the program, the student will complete an end- of-program competency assessment examination; as a part of IS-471, Clinical Practicum IV is required to successfully complete IS-471, as well as meet graduation and program completion requirements (see Graduation Requirements). Students who do not successfully complete the examination will receive an Incomplete (\"I\") for IS-471 and will retake the examination prior to the beginning of the next quarter. Those failing the examina- tion twice will be enrolled in IS-471 as a directed Independent Study during the next quarter for remediation. Those failing the examination on the third attempt will be subject to dismissal from the program. Those students may reapply to the program (see Procedures for Readmission).

Successfully complete a comprehensive end-of-progr am competency assessment Medical Laboratory Science: Philosophy The contribution of medical laboratory sciences to patient care and to the health delivery system is primarily one of diagnostic services. The increasing number and wide range of diagnostic tests performed by medical laboratory scientists requires frequent adaptation to new laboratory methodologies and instrumenta- tion. Medicine requires today's medical laboratory scientist to be a highly qualified professional who is willing and able to expand and extend his or her theoretical knowledge and technical skills. Today's professional medical laboratory scientist must develop technical expertise as well as teaching and administrative com - petence. He or she must be able to adapt to rapid changes in the field while maintaining an optimal level of performance. As a member of the health care team, the medical laboratory scientist must have a basic understanding of the role of other health practitioners to function effectively and to provide the best possible care. Although work in medical laboratory science often does not place the practitioner in direct contact with the patient, the medical laboratory scientist must maintain compassion and empathy and accept the patient's welfare as the highest priority. Medical Laboratory Science: Program Overview The Department of Medical Laboratory Science currently offers two degree programs: the Bachelor of Science, major in Medical Laboratory Science and Master of Science, major in Medical Laboratory Science or major in Clinical Laboratory Management.

Medical Laboratory Science Pre-professional Program The pre-professional curriculum for the Medical Laboratory Science program is taken at an associated college or other accredited college or university and requires two to three years of study, depending upon the college. These years are devoted to preparing the scientific foundation upon which the practice of medical laboratory science can be built. The first year empha- sizes courses in biological, physical and behavioral sciences, with options in the humanities. The succeeding years are used to increase depth in the sciences as they relate more specifically to health fields and to enhance personal experience through a broad choice of electives in the humanities. Specific course offer - ings and requirements may vary from campus to campus due to curriculum offerings, scheduling and course content. Required pre-requisite courses are completed before a student comes to Rush and are listed above. Professional Program Students integrate the theory of medical science with the prac-tice of medical laboratory procedures, learning basic theory and skills in hematology, clinical chemistry, immunology, immunohe- matology, molecular techniques and clinical microbiology in the first year, and go on to more advanced courses in those areas in the second year along with courses in management, education and research to prepare students for supervisory, teaching and research positions. Students apply basic concepts learned in the first year of the program as they rotate through the laboratories of Rush University Medical Center and affiliated hospitals. Currently, 171 affiliate hospitals include the University of Chicago Medicine, Northwestern Memorial Hospital, Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago and the University of Illinois Hospital and Health Sciences System. It is the policy of the Rush University Department of Medical Laboratory Science that all students admitted into the program and who complete all first-year didactic courses will be guaranteed an opportunity to complete the clinical practicum at one of our affiliated hospitals.Graduates are eligible to take the Medical Laboratory Scientist certification examination given by the American Society of Clinical Pathology; upon passing this examination, they become certified as Medical Laboratory Scientists, MLS (ASCP). Students are not eligible to take the national certification examina- tions until all degree requirements are met.

The director determines the course schedule with students and monitors their progress. The faculty reserves the right to request the withdrawal of any student whose conduct, health or performance is unsuitable for a health profession. Any such student not voluntarily withdrawing will be dismissed from the University. Only grades of A, B and C in required courses may fulfill degree requirements. Students will be considered in good standing at Rush University unless placed on academic 180 probation. Academic probation is assigned to a student who earns a quarterly GPA between 2.0 or 2.99 inclusive or whose cumulative grade point average falls below a 3.0. Full-time students placed on probation must earn a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or greater by the end of the next two consecutive quarters. A student who earns a quarterly grade point average below 2.0 will be dismissed from the University. A student who earns a grade of D or F in a required course must repeat the course. Failure to earn a grade of C or better in a repeated course will result in dismissal from the University. In a repeated course, the new grade will replace the earlier D or F grade in the cumula- tive GPA. A student who earns a grade of D or F in two or more required courses will also be dismissed from the University. Students placed on academic probation will be notified by letter from the department chairperson following a meeting of the Student Progress Review Committee. The letter will explain why the student was put on academic probation and the specific requirements the student must meet to re-establish good standing. Full-Time and Part-Time Enrollment Although the faculty recommends full-time enrollment to maxi- mize the opportunities available to students, part-time enroll- ment for all or part of the program may be arranged.

Medical Physics: Graduation Requirements Master of Science in Medical Physics The program requires a cumulative grade point average of 3.0 or greater to graduate. All degree requirements must be completed within five calendar years from the beginning of the first quarter in which the student is enrolled in the program. The minimum number of quarter hours required for graduation is 80. This requirement is fulfilled by registration in required courses plus elective courses. Each student must develop and carry out a research project that culminates in writing a thesis. At the end of the first year, the student must take and pass a qualifying examination based on selected basic principles of physics, therapeutic and imaging physics, radiation protection, transfer function analysis and current topics in medical physics. The examination will include both written and oral components. Passing this examination qualifies the student to continue work toward the master's degree. Defense of the thesis will be the final examination. The faculty members will determine whether the student will be granted a second and last opportunity. Upon such recommendation, a second examination may be scheduled within nine months of the initial examination. Medical Physics: Educational Activities In addition to providing educational and research experiences for students in the master's program, the medical physics faculty members, most of whom hold joint faculty appointments in Rush Medical College, teach medical students and other students and residents. Medical Physics: Research Activities Study of basic mechanisms by which radiation transfers energy to biological and chemical materials Development of new techniques for directing and measuring various radiations used in the detection, diagnosis and treat- ment of cancer Application of radioactive tracers to diagnosis and to the study of metabolic processes Optimization of physical parameters for diagnostic medical imaging including radiography, computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and radionuclide imaging Optimization of treatment plans for cancer radiotherapy Incorporation of biological models in radiation treatment planning Radiation beam modulation and image guidance applications in radiation therapy Rush University annually issues a report that summarizes research projects of the entire faculty. Medical Physics: Service Activities Most faculty members are practitioner-teachers who provide patient care services through Rush University Medical Center. Students have the opportunity to participate in clinical physics services under the supervision of faculty members.181 Medical Physics: Professional Certification The Medical Physics program provides the academic prepara- tion for certification as a radiological medical physicist by the American Board of Radiology. Occupational Therapy: Mission and Philosophy The mission of the Department of Occupational Therapy is consistent with that of Rush University Medical Center and that of Rush University. The Department of Occupational Therapy embraces the Medical Center's commitment to the practitioner-teacher-investigator model, which integrates patient care, education and research. The Department supports evidence- based practice and outcome-based research in order to provide excellence in health care. The faculty of the graduate program in occupational therapy emphasizes an educational approach, which integrates occu - pational therapy and didactic material with clinical application and practice. The faculty members are practitioners, teachers and investigators, a combination that infuses the curriculum with a contemporary and scholarly perspective. Graduate courses are designed to build on past knowledge and experiences, as well as to encourage active learning. The philosophy is based on adult learning theories and the belief that the learner is active in the process of learning. Throughout the curriculum the student is engaged in constructive and reflective learning opportuni- ties. The purpose of this educational philosophy is to allow the student maximum opportunity for the highest levels of integra-tion of content and understanding of rationale for instruction. This philosophy is fostered through such concurrent sequencing of theory and clinically based experience that the student is able to relate to either or both environments depending upon which best facilitates the learning process. The early and continuous collaboration between the theoretical and the clinical learn-ing environments allows for the development of a collegiality between faculty and students. Through such relationships, the student's personal growth and opportunities for independent thinking are fostered. Concern for the student as an individual, mirrored in the relationship with faculty, provides the student with a variety of individualized learning options and experiences within diversified work environments.Occupational Therapy: Program Overview Professional Description The Department of Occupational Therapy offers a graduate program that prepares the student for unique contributions to the field of occupational therapy. This professional level program is designed for individuals with baccalaureate degrees in other fields who are seeking to become occupational therapists at the graduate level. Educational Orientation The professional graduate program at Rush University is designed for the student who has acquired a variety of life experiences through previous educational, vocational and avo- cational activities. The program values the incorporation of these life experiences into the educational activities of the program. The educational approach utilized in the program that best addresses these spheres is based on theories of adult learning. By basing the program on adult learning theories, it is possible to build on the students' past, connect it to their activities of the present and predict a future of competent, capable responses to the needs of the profession. The program is designed to enable the student to learn not only the content and theories of occu-pational therapy, but also the process of utilizing the multiple resources of the learning environment, including teachers and peers. A series of carefully designed learning experiences, occur - ring within and outside the classroom, promote independence in conjunction with collegial interaction, problem solving and clinical reasoning, and analysis and synthesis of information. The graduate emerges as a competent therapist who has main- tained initial curiosity and has added to it through increased ability for creative thinking. Because of experiences in self- directed learning and in self-identification of needs, the gradu- ate is able to be responsible and responsive to the needs of the profession. The graduate is expected to be a life-long learner capable of maintaining professional integrity when faced with challenges and complexities of contemporary health care. Professional Orientation Since the Rush graduate will be prepared to work in a variety of traditional and nontraditional settings, their practice base is the result of broad experiences within the many arenas of occupa- tional therapy. The graduates have the ability to add increasing amounts of depth and validation to their treatment programs as a result of their involvement and experiences with problem-solv- ing approaches to therapy. Given the combination of breadth and depth of knowledge and experience related to occupational therapy treatment, the primary strength of Rush University 182 graduates will be their ability to function as highly resourceful practitioners. As in the past, and for the foreseeable future, the role of the practitioner is the core of all occupational therapy. The practitioner who is able to base treatment on established fact, use internal and external resources, and engage in clinical reasoning and problem solving is the practitioner who will contribute to the credibility and viability of the profession. It is this type of practitioner who is expected to be the product of the Rush program. The graduates of the program are able to enter the clinical arena competently and confidently, applying their clinical skills and expanding upon those skills as individual situations require. This continuous process of assessment and expansion contrib-utes to the personal and professional growth vital to occupa- tional therapists. The role of the clinician, as it is understood in this context, incorporates other major roles of the therapist. As the Rush program is designed, the students have the oppor - tunity to explore the functions of the therapist as an educator, researcher and manager from the practitioner's perspective. The involvement of the student in these other roles is another major strength of the program. The additional roles of educator, manager and researcher cannot be separated from the practitio - ner's role.

All degree requirements including fieldwork must be completed within 36 months for full-time students and 51 months for part-time students from matriculation into the pro-gram. A minimum of 117 quarter hours is required for graduation. Occupational Therapy: Research Activities Members of the department are increasingly involved in iden-tifying research projects in occupational therapy. The students participate in faculty-supervised, evidence-based clinical-outcome studies, which may be carried out in one of Rush University Medical Center's occupational therapy clinics. Occupational Therapy: Service Activities The faculty are outstanding practitioners/teachers/investigators involved in widely recognized professional and scholarly activities. They provide a full range of assessment and therapeutic services for a variety of populations. Within the Medical Center there are more than 30 dedicated occupational therapy practitioners work-ing with pediatric, adult and geriatric patients in both inpatient and outpatient settings. In addition, faculty and clinicians are committed to serving with professional and community organiza-tions. Students participate with faculty and clinicians in health fairs and service activities throughout the year. Students have an opportunity to join the Student Occupational Therapy Association (SOTA), a service-based organization. Perfusion Technology: Philosophy The Department of Perfusion Technology provides students with both the scientific knowledge as well as the clinical experience in order to make them effective and successful perfusion technolo- gists. In the challenging, expanding profession of perfusion tech-nology, today's perfusion technologist must be able to meet the daily demands of the operating room, adapt to new technologies and uses for the extracorporeal circuit and be part of a profes- sion growing beyond its traditional roles in cardiovascular surgery which now encompasses other surgical and nonsurgical special- ties requiring the use of extracorporeal circuits, support devices or blood salvaging capabilities. Perfusion Technology: Program Overview The Department of Perfusion Technology offers two degree programs; the Bachelor of Science with a major in Perfusion Technology, and the Master of Science with a major in Perfusion Technology. The Master of Science degree is intended for those whose baccalaureate degree is in a field other than perfu-sion technology. Those entering the Master of Science degree program achieve entry-level competency in perfusion technol-ogy as well as acquire additional skills in educational methods, management and research. This technical medical specialty has become increasingly impor - tant in the health care field. The perfusion technologist serves primarily as part of the cardiovascular surgical team, operat- ing the heart-lung machine during open heart surgery. The perfusion technologist is also responsible for other life-support equipment, such as intra-aortic balloon pumps and ventricular assist devices. In addition to cardiovascular surgery, the perfu-sion technologist may also provide veno-venous bypass for liver transplantation, isolated limb or organ chemotherapy perfusion, cardiopulmonary bypass supported cardiac catheterization procedures, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and blood salvaging for orthopedic or general surgery procedures. Perfusion Technology: Admission Requirements Bachelor of Science Program A minimum of 60 semester or 90 quarter hours of liberal arts and sciences must be completed prior to enrolling.

Perfusion Technology: Academic Policies The Department of Perfusion Technology requires full-time enrollment beginning with the fall quarter of the junior year and continuing through the spring quarter of the senior year, a total of seven consecutive quarters of classroom work and clinical experience. Academic Progression High academic performance in required course is expected. Only grades of A, B or C may fulfill degree requirements in all required courses. Students will be considered to be in good standing unless placed on academic probation. Academic probation is assigned to any undergraduate student who earns a quarterly grade point average (GPA) below 2.5 (A = 4.0) or for gradu - ate students who earn a quarterly GPA below 3.0 (A = 4.0). Students placed on probation have two quarters in which to regain the status of good standing. Failure to do so will result in dismissal from the University. As most courses are offered only once each year, students who receive a grade of F may have to defer enrollment until the course is offered again. A grade of F in a course that is a prerequisite to another required course may also prevent a student from continuing to progress in the normal sequence. The Department's Advisory Committee must approve any exception to these policies.

The Master of Science in Research Administration (MSRA) Program will provide a unique online graduate education experience for current and future research administration professionals in all areas of research administra - tion. Students in the program will work with faculty and scien-tists to learn research methods, data analysis, and descriptive and inferential statistics in order to develop an understanding of how principal investigators design and perform research. As part of the program, students must complete a practicum experience and an investigational research project in their chosen area of specialization to be submitted for publication and/or formally presented at an appropriate professional meeting, thus further advancing the profession of research administration. As a leadership program, the MSRA will provide graduates with the core competencies needed for practice as a research man-ager and provide the foundation needed to assume professional leadership roles in research administration. Interaction with faculty, a practicum in research administration and a research paper are key elements to the program. The result is an outstanding education in research administration and a sense of personal growth toward becoming a leader in the research administration profession. The Research Administration Program is designed to offer the student planned learning experiences and provide the knowl- edge and skills will culminate in advancing in the research administration profession. Outcomes Graduates of the program will be prepared to function as lead - ers in the research administration profession. Standards Upon completion of the program, all students will dem- onstrate the ability to comprehend and apply information relevant to the management of research administration. Upon completion of the program, all students will be familiar with all areas of research administration, and demonstrate proficiency in academic research methods and publish their findings in an academic research administration journal. Upon completion of the program, all students will demon - strate personal behaviors consistent with professional and employer expectations for a leader in the research adminis- tration profession. In addition to these competency goals, the program seeks to: Provide a unique online graduate education experience for current and future research administration professionals in all areas of research administration. Provide students experience with research methods, data analysis and descriptive and inferential statistics in order to develop an understanding of how principal investigators design and perform research. Provide students with the tools to complete an investiga - tional research project in their chosen area of specialization to be submitted for publication and/or formally presented at an appropriate professional meeting. Provide students with the core competencies needed for practice as a research manager and provide the foundation needed to assume professional leadership roles in research administration. Research Administration: Program Overview Online Program The MSRA program will provide a unique online graduate edu- cation experience for current and future research administration professionals in all areas of research administration. Students in the program will work with faculty and scientists to learn research methods, data analysis and descriptive and inferential statistics in order to develop an understanding of how princi- pal investigators design and perform research. As part of the program, students must complete an investigational research project in their chosen area of specialization to be submitted for publication and/or formally presented at an appropriate professional meeting, thus further advancing the profession of research administration. Practicum Requirement As a part of the prescribed plan of study, students must choose an area of concentration in order to complete the practicum series. The overall aim of practicum courses is to introduce stu- dents to the roles and responsibilities in the following research administrative offices: sponsored projects, clinical trials manage - ment, research finance, research compliance, research integrity, and intellectual property and technology transfer.195 The Profession The profession of research administration is an integral part of administration at universities and research institutes. The practice of the profession includes obtaining and overseeing external dollars for the institution, helping institutions comply with federal and nonfederal sponsor regulation, and develop- ing partnerships and collaborative ventures with other research organization. Research administrators represent their institu- tions in diverse matters related to grants and contracts as well as maintain the policies and procedures of their institution. The research administrator serves the faculty, the institution and the sponsoring agencies through an effective management system. The sponsored research community often needs an advocate who will work toward improving and stimulating the institu-tional climate for these activities. As such, research administra - tors are often challenged to articulate the value of sponsored activity in an environment where it has not traditionally been emphasized. Research administrators also take on the role of policy developer when institutional policies and procedures may need adjustment to comply with sponsor requirements. At some institutions research administrators assume the role of facilitating the development of a climate more conducive to the research enterprise without compromising the teaching and public service missions of the institution. The Program The program will require a minimum of 46 quarter credit hours (13 courses) of academic coursework taken at the graduate level. All didactic courses will be completed using the Rush University Learning Management System (RU-Learning) for Web-based instruction. The program may be completed in approximately 12 to 18 months of full-time enrollment or taken on a part-time basis over a longer period. Students who desire to complete additional elective courses either offered at Rush University or at another regionally accredited college or univer - sity may request to do so, and these electives may be incorpo- rated into the student's program plan with the permission of the student's academic advisor. The objectives of the program are to: Prepare competent advanced-level research administrators for practice Prepare leaders who are able to plan, develop and deliver high-quality, cost-effective research administration services Provide training in specific research administration areas Develop individuals who can formulate appropriate ques- tions, organize and test hypotheses and apply research results to the practice of research administration Through the research project, students will increase their knowledge within the discipline, promote interdisciplinary col- laboration and advance the science and practice of research administration by providing a link between basic science research, clinical research and management practice. As a part of the prescribed plan of study, students must choose an area of concentration in order to complete the practicum series. The overall aim of practicum courses is to introduce students to the roles and responsibilities in the following research administrative offices: sponsored projects, clinical trials management, research finance, research compliance, research integrity, and intellectual property and technology transfer. Following the initial practicum experience, which is designed to introduce students to work- ing in each of these areas, students may then choose one of these areas for a second concentrated practicum experience: grants administration, project management, budget and fiscal management, compliance and audit, or intellectual property and technology transfer. Research Administration: Admission Requirements General Education Requirements Prospective students must have a bachelor's degree or the equivalent from an U.S.-accredited college or university.

Submission of an application for admission should be made to the Office of College Admission Services with all official transcripts, NBRC RRT certificate and a personal interview at least 30 days prior to the first day of the quarter in which the individual desires to begin classes. General education and professional prerequisites must be completed prior to graduation. All other program poli-cies and procedures apply. Introduction Individuals may have acquired academic credit in respiratory care courses from other schools and universities. Some individu-als may acquire knowledge through experience and on the job training. When such persons apply for admission into the pro- gram, an attempt is made to grant academic credit for equiva - lent educational courses, equivalent knowledge acquired from experience and/or successful completion of the National Board for Respiratory Care's certification and registry examinations. All students graduating from the Respiratory Care Program must meet the same standards for graduation; the awarding of advanced standing does not signify a lesser-quality educa-tion than that offered through regular coursework. What it does, however, is attempt to exempt the student from those areas of the formal program where the student already has the knowledge and expertise in those skills that would be offered. The program has identified the minimum competencies that a respiratory therapist must have in order to provide safe, high-quality patient care. The identification of these competencies is a complex task and a great deal of care must be taken to ensure a standard of excellence. The following policies and procedures are designed to ensure that those individuals who receive advanced standing are qualified to do so, and that the screening process adheres to University as well as departmental policies at all times. To allow individuals who are not qualified to receive advanced standing is not in the student's or the program's best interest. 200 Definition Advanced standing is defined as a special and individually deter - mined status granted to a student in a formal educational set - ting, who has already gained through other sources or through nonacademic experiences, knowledge, skills and professional attitudes taught in the program courses. Purpose of Advanced Standing Procedures The purpose of the advanced standing procedures is to recog- nize and give formal educational credit for knowledge and/or ability gained through previous training or experience. Methods of Granting Advanced Standing Advanced standing can be awarded through transfer credit. Advanced standing can be awarded through the passing of an equivalency examination covering a certain area of knowledge. (An equivalency examination is an instrument or means by which a student accepted into the Respiratory Care Program can demonstrate mastery of a knowledge area, content area or skill and thus be exempted from a course in the program which teaches that area or skill.) Advanced standing can be awarded as credit for successful completion of national certification (CRT/CPFT) or registry examinations (RRT/RPFT). Eligibility for Advanced Standing Transfer students (who have been accepted into the Rush University Respiratory Care Program) may receive a transfer credit for equivalent courses within the Respiratory Care Program curriculum. Credentialed students (RRT, CRT, CPFT, RPFT) who have been accepted into the Rush University Respiratory Care Program may receive transfer credit and will also be eligible to take equivalency examinations in certain courses. Policy for Transfer Students Students who have completed coursework at other approved respiratory care programs may petition to have these courses transfer in lieu of specific coursework in the Rush University program. Students must submit a transcript of their courses from the program and a copy of the course syllabus for each course in which they desire transfer credit. The syllabus must contain the following: course objectives, lecture outlines, course content, evaluation procedures and related information. These courses will be evaluated on an individual basis for content and total contact hours and credit hours. The Department reserves the right to test the proficiency of any student in coursework transferred from other respiratory care programs and the right to disallow such transfer credit in such coursework in cases which the student cannot demonstrate accept- able proficiency. All transfer credit is subject to the approval of the Committee on Progress and Promotions for Respiratory Care. The student must also have a minimum grade of \"C\" (2.0) for each course being transferred. A student cannot receive transfer credit for any respiratory care coursework if he or she left the previous program due to academic probation, suspension or exclusion. All University policies regarding transfer credit must be satisfied. Policy for Individuals Who Hold the CRT or RRT Credential Advanced standing is available to individuals who have suc- cessfully completed the National Board for Respiratory Care's Respiratory Therapy Certification (CRT) or Respiratory Therapy Registry (RRT).

Each professional course in the program serves as the prerequisite for the subsequent course. Consequently, professional courses must be taken in sequence. Withdrawing or failure to successfully complete a profes- sional course with a letter grade of \"C\" or better may result in the student being placed on the three-year track, given a leave of absence (LOA) and academic probation or dismissed from the program after review by the Committee on Progress and Promotions. Students readmitted to the program at times other than the fall quarter of the second year will pick up the course sequence as prescribed by the Chair/Program Director or Committee on Progress and Promotions for Respiratory Care. Standards of Performance for Respiratory Care and Major Field-Related Courses 90-100 = A 80-89 = B75-79 = C70-74 = DBelow 70 = FUnless otherwise described in a given course syllabus, the mini- mum satisfactory grade for course credit is a letter grade of \"C,\" and all stipulated segments of a course must be passed by this standard. Students must demonstrate proficiency in all clinical skills presented in order to pass clinical courses. For all clinical courses, the final exam must be passed at the designated cut score AND a grade of \"C\" or better must be maintained in order to successfully complete each clinical course to continue in the program. Students are expected to maintain an overall GPA in the pro- gram of at least 2.0. Failure of the student to maintain a cumulative GPA of at least 2.0 will subject the student to a review and may result in the student being placed on probation, given a LOA, or dismissed from the program after review by the Committee on Progress and Promotions. If dismissed and the student wishes to reenter the program, he or she must reapply and will be considered on the same basis as any new applicant. Students who voluntarily withdraw from the program either passing or failing have no guarantee of reinstatement to the program. Students requesting readmission 209 to the program should submit a letter to that effect to the Committee on Progress and Promotion for Respiratory Care. Students readmitted to the program will pick up the course sequence as prescribed by the Chair/Program Director or Committee on Progress and Promotions for Respiratory Care. The three-year track option may be used to remediate students that fail to earn at least a grade of \"C\" in each respiratory care course or maintain an overall GPA of at least 2.0. While on this three-year track withdrawing or failure to complete a respira- tory care professional course with a letter grade of \"C\" or better may result in the student being placed on academic probation, given a LOA or dismissed from the program after review by the Committee on Progress and Promotions. Clinical Final Examinations All students are required to pass the clinical final examination after completing the Clinical course to continue in the program. In the event a student fails the clinical final examination, the student is allowed to make ONE more attempt to pass. In the event the student passes the clinical final exam on the second attempt the student will continue in the program. The grade earned on the first attempt will be used to calculate the final clinical grade. In the event the student does NOT pass the clini- cal final exam on the second attempt the student will be placed in remediation. The student will be given a third attempt to pass the final by the end of the next quarter. In the event the stu- dents does not pass on the third attempt the student will earn an \"F\" in the clinical course and may be suspended or released from the program. Comprehensive End-of-Program Competency Assessment Examination Before graduating, the student will complete the written registry examination (WRRT) and clinical simulation examination (CSE). The examination will be taken during the spring session of the second year as a part of RC-432, Clinical Seminar III. The exami-nation fee is approximately $390.00. A passing score and suc- cessful achievement of the registry (RRT) credential is required to successfully complete RC-432, as well as meet gradua- tion and program completion requirements (see Graduation Requirements). Students who do not successfully complete the RRT examination will receive an Incomplete (\"I\") for RC-432 and will retake the examination. Those failing the examination twice may be enrolled in RC-432 as a directed Independent Study during the summer quarter for remediation. Those fail- ing the examination after multiple attempts will be subject to dismissal from the program. Those students may reapply to the program (see Procedures for Readmission).Conduct and Ethics Each student is expected to conduct oneself at all times in a dignified manner. This manner conforms to the ethics of the profession and instills patient confidence in one's abilities as a health care practitioner. Each student is expected to conform to the professional code of ethics as outlined in this handbook and policies outlined in the University catalog. Irresponsible, unprofessional or unethical behavior as determined by the instructor or failure to follow the instructions of a clinical instructor during clinical practice may result in dismissal from the program. All hospital regulations are to be followed by students when undergoing clinical training in a facility. Scholastic Dishonesty and Cheating The Department will not condone cheating in any form. Plagiarizing or copying others writing or work is considered cheating. Any allegations of cheating will be reviewed by the Committee on Progress and Promotions for Respiratory Care and if merited, dealt with in a strict manner, including immediate dismissal from the program. Any student found to be cheating on an examination, test, quiz or assignment will automatically receive a \"0\" for the grade and will be subject to dismissal from the program at the discretion of the Committee on Progress and Promotions for Respiratory Care. Failure to report incidents involving scholastic dishonesty on the part of another student will be considered unprofessional conduct on the part of the student and may result in disciplinary action. Examination Administration All examinations given by the department will be monitored by faculty or staff at all times. Students will be seated in such a manner as to minimize the opportunity for observation of other students' examination papers. No breaks will be allowed once an examination period has begun, and students may not leave the room during an exam until they are finished taking the examina- tion, except in the event of an emergency, which will be judged by the faculty or staff monitoring the exam on a case by case basis. If a student turns in an examination without answering all ques- tions, he or she will NOT be given an opportunity to finish the examination after leaving the room. Only marks made on the Scantron sheet will be used to compute a grade on all Scantron-graded examinations. Even if a student marks the answer correctly on his or her examination, but does not mark it correctly on the Scantron, only the Scantron answer will be used to compute the grade, not the answer marked on the examination.210 Programmable calculators will NOT be allowed during examinations. Examination Review At the discretion of the course instructor, during review of any examination given within the curriculum, no other papers or books will be allowed on the student's desk. No writing imple- ments of any kind will be allowed. NO note taking or recording of any kind will be permitted. This includes written note-taking, and/or recording with audiotape, videotape or any other form of electronic or mechanical recording.

Goals The primary goal of the program is to prepare competent entry-level vascular technologists in the cognitive (knowledge), psychomotor (skills) and affective (behavior) competencies nec- essary to perform vascular ultrasound examinations. A secondary goal is to offer a broader understanding of the profession to the students through basic education in laboratory management, professional practice and research areas. Vascular Ultrasound and Technology: Overview Description of the Profession The vascular sonographer plays a vital role in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with disorders of arteries and veins. These include atherosclerosis that may result in strokes or gangrene of the extremities, blood clots in veins that may break off and travel to the lungs and possibly cause death, aneurysms that may burst and many other pathologies of the circulatory system. A vascular sonographer is responsible for taking the patient's history; performing the appropriate test using high-tech, nonin- vasive equipment such as ultrasound; documenting and analyz - ing the data and images; and preparing a preliminary report for the physician to interpret. The sonographer has extensive direct interaction with patients, physicians, coworkers and other hospital personnel. The work requires physical, intellectual and communication skills. Program Description Students in the Department of Vascular Ultrasound and Technology are taught by vascular sonographers and physicians who are experienced practitioner-teachers in the field. The basic program is full-time and consists of 21 months (seven quar - ters) of study. The first three quarters consist of nine months of classroom, student laboratory work and observation of patient examinations. The second-year students perform the vascular examinations learned during first year on patients under the direction of credentialed and experienced vascular sonographers at two or more vascular laboratories during the year. The clinical sites include the university hospitals in Chicago as well as some community hospitals and out-of-state sites.

Our faculty includes a wide range of highly accomplished and nationally impactful researchers and educators. Thank you for your interest in our College and we look forward to working with you in advanc - ing your professional career goals. James L. Mulshine, MD Professor, Dean of The Graduate College (Acting), Associate Provost of Research, Vice President, Research 219 The Graduate College: Mission, Vision and Philosophy Mission The mission of The Graduate College of Rush University is to promote and assure excellence in research education and mentoring programs responsible for training outstanding and diverse candidates in the basic and clinical sciences. At Rush, the translation of bench research to the clinic is the primary focus of all divisions. Using the practitioner-teacher model, faculty work side by side with the students in an effort to cure disease and bring the newest possible treatments to the patients. The College promotes cooperative efforts in achieving high-quality educational and research programs to prepare students for suc- cessful careers and lifelong professional development. Vision Basic and clinical scientist graduates of The Graduate College will become leaders in their respective research fields, secure leadership positions in academia and/or industry, compete suc- cessfully for extramural grants and train the next generation of research scientists. Philosophy The Graduate College was originally established to provide opportunities for students to work with selected members of the University faculty to earn doctoral degrees in the sciences basic to health care. Students underwent highly individual-ized programs that maximized the students' opportunities for self-realization and the faculties' opportunities for sharing their scholarly development, expertise and experiences on a per - sonal basis. This goal is still a major emphasis of The Graduate College during the research training years, whereas there is a more common framework taught in the period preceding the mentored research experience. Thus, most basic science students now take an introductory core curriculum. This contributes to significant interaction among the students across divisions while providing a common knowledge base to enter the research phase of their specific programs. It also serves to create a feel of critical mass in divisions that only matriculate a few students each year. The addition of master's programs in Clinical Research and Biotechnology have expanded the course offerings by the College and address the expanding need for clinical scien- tists and highly trained technical staff, respectively, needed to advance science in the 21st century. Therefore, the organiza- tional pattern still allows a high degree of individualized faculty and student participation in the educational processes of the College consistent with the teacher-practitioner model while providing a more encompassing umbrella structure within the College that creates greater similarity than differences across the divisions and programs. The Graduate College: Organization To facilitate its educational mission, the College is organized into divisions; each division represents a separate discipline and each is related to its parent academic department. Currently, the College has the following divisions: Anatomy and Cell Biology Behavioral Sciences (Inactive) Biochemistry Biomechanics Health Sciences Immunology/Microbiology Medical Physics Pharmacology Neuroscience Nursing Science Molecular Biophysics and Physiology The primary goal of each division is to provide excellent gradu- ate education in the sciences basic to medicine. The divisions of the College are flexible and responsive to the changing needs and experiences in their disciplines. To that end, divisions are headed by directors who serve for definite terms of appointment and whose re-appointments are subject to periodic review. Each division reports through its director to the Dean of The Graduate College who is a member of The Graduate College Council. The Graduate College Council is the senior representative body of the college. Its membership includes all division directors, an elected faculty member from each division and three students from different divisions elected by the students annually. Only the elected members and students are allowed to vote. The Dean or his/her designee serves as the chair of the council. The council is responsible for setting policies for the admission of students; the formulation and adoption of general operating policies, standards and procedures of the college; the appoint- ment of The Graduate College faculty; and the approval of those recommended for degrees. Although the Dean and the Council maintain significant oversight of programs in The Graduate College, the divisions also establish policies and procedures, in sync with the policies and procedures of the College and the University, for their students consistent with their goals. The 220 Graduate College Council periodically reviews divisional policies and procedures. The faculty of The Graduate College is drawn from the faculty of the other colleges of Rush University who hold the same rank in the Graduate College as in their primary colleges. No faculty member has a primary appointment in The Graduate College Programs In addition to divisional programs, The Graduate College over - sees two additional programs. These programs are Master of Science in Clinical Research Biotechnology Neither of these programs resides in a division, both are admin- istered out of the Dean's office and both are overseen by The Graduate College Council. Faculty members from several divi- sions participate in the education of students in these programs. The Graduate College: Admission Requirements The faculty of The Graduate College encourages diversity among the student population and therefore seeks to admit persons from various backgrounds. The Graduate College uses the following guidelines to evaluate candidates for admission. Individual divisions within the college may have additional requirements and criteria for admission. Applicants are encour - aged to first check with the division of interest. The College's requirements are as follows: 1. Deadline for applications: Priority deadline is May 1 for all research two-year MS and basic sciences PhD students; how- ever, all F-1 visa holders are encouraged to apply by March 15. For all other programs, application must be completed by July 1 and all supporting documents must be received by August 1. (Some programs may have earlier deadlines. Please check with the individual program director early in the application process.) 2. Application requirements: a. All students must complete an application to the Gr aduate College online. b. A minimum of three letters of recommendation are required and a minimum of two should come from aca-demic sources. c. An interview may be requiredd. Students must have scores submitted for the GRE, or an equivalent test (e.g., MCAT, DAT, PCAT or other equiva-lent exam in the sciences). Although no specific score on these exams is required, students scoring above the 50th percentile are strongly encouraged to apply. GRE is waived for applicants with a PhD degree in Basic Science or a professional degree in Health Sciences (e.g., MD, DO, DDS, PharmD). e. Students with a GP A of 3.0 or better on a 4.0-point scale are strongly encouraged to apply. f. Please submit an official tr anscript from each college or University attended. All transcripts must be received in an original sealed envelope from the institution. Scanned items can be used for review and preliminary admission decisions; however, official documents will be required for final admission decision. Formal course by course grade/ diploma certification by ECE or WES is required of all students who have completed their last degree outside of the US. g. Applicants whose native language is other than English and who do not hold an equivalent of a U.S. Bachelor's degree from an institution at which English is the lan- guage of instruction, must submit scores from TOEFL or IELTS. Recommended scores are as follows: TOEFL 620 (paper based); 260 (computer based); with a minimum of 84, with subscores of Reading 19, Listening 17, Speaking 20 and Writing 21, OR IELTS 6.5, with subscores of 6.0 for all four subscores. The Graduate College: Core Curriculum The Graduate College curriculum is designed to enhance interac - tion among students from all the programs while at the same time provide the basic knowledge base the faculty have deemed necessary to become successful in science. The Graduate College curriculum runs for two consecutive semesters (fall and spring) and provides introductory training in molecular genetics, genom- ics and protein biology, cell biology, tissue biology and cell signaling, as well as provides a comprehensive and systematic overview of physiology and pharmacology. Students will also learn basic theories underlying modern scientific technique. In addition, the student will take courses in ethics, scientific writ- ing and basic statistics. These courses will be supplemented by advanced courses offered by the individual divisions. The following courses comprise The Graduate College Core (GCC) curriculum: 221 GCC-501 Molecular ransport and Signaling GCC-503 Functional Cell Biology GCC-504 Functional T issue Biology GCC-505 T echniques in Biomedical Sciences GCC-506 Research Ethics GCC-507 Biomedical Statistics GCC-508 Writing Practicum GCC-511 Readings in Molecular Biology GCC-512 Readings in Cellular Biochemistry GCC-513 Readings in Functional Cell Biology GCC-514 Readings in Functional T issue Biology GCC-520 Introduction to Physiology and Pharmacology I GCC-521 Introduction to Physiology and Pharmacology II GCC-546 Principles of Biostatistics I GCC-547 Principles of Biostatistics II GCC-551 Ethics in Biomedical Research and the IRB GCC-593 Introduction to Grantsmanship GCC-620 Introduction to T eaching In addition to these requirements, full-time doctor of philosophy (PhD) candidates in The Graduate College must attend a mini- mum of four ethics seminars per year provided by the Office of Research Integrity following their first year of classes. Failure to attend the required number of lectures or equivalent will delay graduation. The Graduate College: MS and PhD Degrees The Graduate College prepares students for the Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy degrees. The Doctor of Philosophy is awarded in recognition of high achievement in a particular field of scientific research as evidenced by submission of a dissertation that demonstrates the power of independent investigation and contributes to the body of existing knowl- edge. An undergraduate record of scholastic excellence is an important background for The Graduate College experience. The Graduate College also provides excellent research and train - ing opportunities for advanced medical students who want to take time out of their medical school studies to enroll in The Graduate College in an MS or PhD program. The process of application review includes a search for evidence of creativity and scholarly potential in the applicant. Non-degree students are not admitted with advanced degree objectives and are ineligible to become candidates for advanced degrees. Upon approval by a course director and appropriate registration, any individual may audit a course. In all cases, a student considering application for admission should first establish contact with the director of his or her choice of program to determine divisional/ program requirements. The student must meet all of the require-ments for progress and graduation in the graduate studies pro - gram. In this regard, individualized studies will be programmed to meet the student's need in achieving essential knowledge in preparation for these requirements. Doctor of Philosophy The degree of Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) is the highest degree conferred by Rush University. The PhD is restricted to those scholars who have demonstrated superior ability in a recognized academic discipline. While each division has identified require-ments, the PhD degree is not awarded following the completion of any specific number of formal courses nor on the basis of miscellaneous course studies and research. The entire PhD pro- gram must be integrated and highly research oriented. It should culminate in a work of literary and scholarly merit, which is indicative of the candidate's ability to conduct original research in a recognized specialty (generally in the form of a first-author manuscript). PhD programs are directed by selected faculty who work closely with graduate students. In practice, each program is composed of formal courses, guided individual study in a chosen field or discipline, study in such cognate subjects as may be required by the candidate's advisory committee and original research that serves as the basis of a required scholarly dissertation. Admission to Candidacy Admission to candidacy is evidence that the doctoral student has successfully completed all preliminary coursework and is prepared to move into his or her intensive research experience. Depending upon the divisional requirements, these exams will test accumulated knowledge, scientific reasoning and the ability to develop hypotheses and test them with appropriate designs. Admission to candidacy is a demonstration of confidence that the student will successfully accomplish the remaining require- ments of the program. Students who fail to achieve admission to candidacy, but have otherwise completed all other pre- requisites, will be granted a terminal master's degree. 222 Dissertation A doctoral student must complete a dissertation. This document is developed through faculty-guided independent research proj- ects. Review of the dissertation will follow the sequence of steps described in the manual, \"Preparation of Theses and Doctoral Dissertations.\" Copies of this manual are available in each graduate division and in the Library of Rush University Medical Center. The dissertation must be original and cannot have been used to meet the requirement of any other degree, either at Rush University or any other university. Each student will have a Dissertation Committee whose role it is to assure that the student's dissertation is of high quality and meets the standards of the division, the College and the University for originality, contribution to the field and scholarly presentation. The Committee is also to assure that the student is making satisfactory progress toward completion of the degree. The dissertation committee is chosen by the student in conjunc-tion with the student's primary advisor and should consist of at least five total members. The primary advisor must be a member of the Graduate College. At least one member of the commit- tee should be from outside of the division, and preferably from outside of the institution. Once the committee convenes, it will choose a chairperson who cannot be the student's primary advi - sor. The chairperson will oversee the scheduling and activities of the committee. At or near the completion of the dissertation, each student will share, by means of a public presentation with the aca - demic community at large, the knowledge that the student has developed. Students are responsible for posting announcements (at least two weeks prior to the presentation) on institutional bulletin boards and e-mailing all faculty and students of the Graduate College the title of the dissertation, the student's name, and the location, date and time of the public presenta- tion. This public presentation must precede the final approval of the dissertation by the Dissertation Committee. Upon completion of the public presentation, the student will meet with the dissertation committee to review the presenta- tion, the dissertation document and the student's preparedness to enter the scientific community. A majority of members of the committee must sign the dissertation certifying the completion of all requirements for the doctor of philosophy degree. Master of Science The Master of Science degree is offered in many divisions and programs. This degree is designed to offer students an inter - mediate step in a career path, provide research experience to supplement their primary professional path or provide supple-mentary training for other reasons. The College offers two types of MS degrees: 1) the research MS is a thesis-requiring program that traditionally takes two years to complete; and 2) a non-research MS that is a consequence of either a scholarly endeavor (e.g., writing a review paper) or the successful comple - tion of a series of classes and laboratory skills (i.e., the MS in Biotechnology). Thesis The research MS degree requires publication of a scientific thesis that reflects the research experience of the student. This thesis may or may not reflect original work, although original work that is published in peer-reviewed journals is always a goal. The student together with the advisor will form a thesis committee comprised of thee members: the advisor (who must be a mem - ber of The Graduate College) and two readers. The advisor will work with the student to develop a research project that can be completed within the framework of the program. The readers will assure the quality of the document. Upon completion of the thesis, the student will present the findings in a public forum open to the University. The members of the committee that includes the student's advisor must sign off on the thesis, certify - ing the completion of all requirements for the MS degree. The Graduate College: Academic Policies The Graduate College adopts college-wide policies and proce-dures and reviews division-specific regulations. Students follow the college and divisional policies in effect at the time of initial matriculation in The Graduate College. However, The Graduate College reserves the right to make substantive changes in its programs after the student's matriculation. Students will be informed in writing by the division director of any changes made during their tenure in the program. Students re-entering the col- lege after an absence will be guided by policies and procedures in effect at the time of re-entry. Examination Policy The examination policy is the responsibility of the individual course director, who will inform students of examination require - ments for that particular course. A period at the end of the semester is provided for examinations. This period may be used as the course director chooses. Pass/No Pass Grades Each division identifies all courses required of its students. Required courses are usually taken for letter grade and not 223 under the pass/no pass (P/N) option. Research hours are gener - ally graded using the P/N option. However, a division may opt to provide a letter grade for research classes (under 600) for mas - ter's students. The grading policy for post-candidacy research hours (over 600) for doctoral students is P/N. Good Academic Standing To remain in good academic standing, students must maintain a cumulative grade point average of 3.0 and meet the require- ments of his or her division. A student must be in good aca- demic standing to be admitted to candidacy and to graduate. Students failing to maintain a GPA of 3.0 will be notified by the Dean in writing that their student status has been changed to \"on probation.\" Students who fail to remediate their deficien- cies within one academic year or are placed on probationary status a third time, are subject to dismissal by The Graduate College. Academic Difficulty Each division has policies and procedures regarding students who fail to maintain good academic standing. While the respon- sibilities of informing students of their academic problems and of establishing conditions for regaining good academic standing reside within the divisions, The Graduate College Council moni- tors the progress and promotion of all students and gives final approval to award students' degrees. Dismissal Each division establishes grounds for dismissal beyond the minimal criteria established by The Graduate College. Should a division recommend the dismissal of a student, the director will forward such recommendation to The Graduate College Council for final action. Letters of dismissal come from the Dean. Appeal of a dismissal action begins within the appropriate division. Full-time Enrollment Full-time enrollment is required of all Graduate College students with the exception of the Clinical Research students and students within the divisions of Nursing and Health Sciences. Full-time students must register for at least 12 semester hours for the Fall and Spring Semesters and for 9 credit hours for the Summer term of the first year; 10 semester hours thereafter per term.. Students must obtain written permission from the division director for exceptions to this policy. Students receiving a mas- ter's degree from The Graduate College as a full-time student must be enrolled for a minimum of two semesters and the sum- mer term; part-time students earning a master's degree must be enrolled a minimum of two semesters per academic year. The minimum requirement for graduation from the college is 53 hours. At the time of graduation, the student must be enrolled in the College. The maximum time allowed for enrollment for a full-time master's degree is four years starting the first semester of official enrollment and for the PhD degree is five years. Residency Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) candidates are expected to meet all requirements for graduation within five enrolled academic years in The Graduate College (excluding leaves of absence [see below]). This period begins with the semester in which the student formally matriculates. A student exceeding that time limitation must submit to the Graduate Council, in writing, a request to extend their candidacy beyond that time period. This request must identify the reasons for the extension and provide a written plan with reasonable deadlines for completion. This document will be co-signed by the student's advisor and division director. The council will then vote whether to accept the exten- sion or not (passed by simple majority). The student's advisor will then provide an update on the student's progress after six months. One year after the extension is granted, the student is expected to complete all requirements. A second request may be made by the student's advisor and division director, but only will be accepted through a two-thirds majority of the voting members present at a formal hearing of the Graduate College Council. Within one year of that second request, the student must complete all requirements for the PhD degree or face dis-missal. Alternatively, the student may be awarded a MS degree upon the recommendation of the student's graduate division. Readmission Any student who has withdrawn from the University or any dismissed student may apply for readmission by submitting an application for this purpose to the Graduate College admis- sion office. An interview may be required. A re-entering student must meet the conditions for re-enrollment stated in his or her dismissal or re-entry acceptance letter and all policies, require - ments and course sequence in effect at the time of re-entry. The student will pay tuition and fees at the rates in effect at the time of re-enrollment. Application deadlines may vary by division. Academic Progression The Graduate Division, in concert with the rules of the College and Rush University, develops specific regulations governing the process that results in final awarding of the degree. While such regulations differ slightly from one division to another, The Graduate College Council reviews each division's program and regulations for approval. In all cases, graduate divisions 224 are required to be explicit and clear about regulations that will affect the candidate. This must be stringently observed in divisional regulations concerning selection of principal advisors, advisory committees, and a plan of study. Similarly, divisions will be explicit and clear concerning academic policies and proce-dures surrounding qualifying, preliminary and final examinations when they are required. The divisions are also responsible for providing the candidate with the support needed to plan and conduct the dissertation research. At the same time, a major responsibility of the student is to become familiar with the regulations and expectations of his or her chosen division. These regulations and expectations are included in this Catalog within the sections devoted to each divisional program and are also included within program publications. The student is responsible for understanding the regulations, and monitoring changes that may occur during their tenure in the program. Student Academic Appeals Policy Any student of The Graduate College may appeal a final course grade, failure on a preliminary or comprehensive examination, or failure of the thesis/dissertation that results in his or her academic probation or dismissal from the University. A student may also appeal an unreasonable delay in his or her graduation from the University. No other issues may be appealed through this process. The process for filing an appeal is maintained by each division. The student may request a copy of the Division Appeal Process from the Division Director. This process will be completed within one semester. If a resolution cannot be achieved at the Division level, the following procedure must be followed. At any step in the process, the student may withdraw the appeal by written notification to the program director with a copy to the Dean. In the event of a dismissal decision, a student may continue to enroll until the appeal process is completed or the student withdraws the appeal. Step 1: If the student wishes to appeal the decision beyond the Division, within two weeks of receiving a decision from the Division, the student will submit a written statement to the Dean requesting consideration of his or her case by an advisory panel. The student must provide the following in the written statement. Course number and grade being appealed or other cause for probation or dismissal, i.e., failure of preliminary/comprehen - sive examination or thesis/dissertation Action being requested Justification for the request An outline of the efforts and actions already taken to obtain consideration of the request The student will send copies of this communication to the Division Director and the Department Chairperson. In addition, if a course grade is being appealed, the student will send a copy to the course director. If the evaluation of a thesis or dissertation is being appealed, the student will send a copy to the chair - person of the thesis/dissertation committee. The Advisory Panel will be The Graduate College Council. Its Chairperson will be appointed by the Dean from among the members. The Division Director of the student's division and any other member who is evaluating the student's academic status will not vote. Step 2: Within two weeks after notification to the Dean, the Chairperson of the Advisory Panel will arrange a meeting of the Advisory Panel. It will submit a written recommendation to the Dean. Step 3: Within two weeks following receipt of the advisory panel's recommendation and upon discussion with the student and with others as appropriate, the Dean shall reach a final decision and notify each party of the decision. The decision reached by the Dean is final. The issues discussed and the outcomes of all meetings in this appeal process are documented. This record-keeping is the responsibility of a faculty member who is to be designated at each meeting. Copies of the documentation should be distrib - uted to the individuals present at a meeting, to the Division Director, the Dean and to the student's academic file. Rush University Academic Policies The Academic Resources and Policies section of this catalog contains additional Rush University academic policies. The Graduate College: Committees The Graduate College Council The Graduate College Council is the senior representative body of the college. Its membership includes all division directors, an elected faculty member from each division and three students from different divisions elected by the students annually. Only the elected members and students are allowed to vote. The Dean serves as the chair of the council. The council is responsi- ble for setting policies for the admission of students; the formu- lation and adoption of general operating policies, standards and procedures of the college; the appointment of Graduate College faculty; and the approval of those recommended for degrees.225 The Graduate College: Academic Programs Anatomy and Cell Biology (MS and PhD) Biochemistry (MS and PhD) Biomechanics (MS and PhD) Biotechnology (MS) Clinical Research (MS) Health Sciences (PhD)Immunology/Microbiology (MS and PhD) Medical Physics (MS and PhD) Molecular Biophysics and Physiology (PhD)Neuroscience (PhD)Nursing Science (PhD) Pharmacology (MS and PhD) 226 Anatomy and Cell Biology: Philosophy The Division of Anatomy and Cell Biology offers study both at the master's (MS) and doctoral (PhD) levels. The master's degree requires a thesis on a laboratory-based research project. The programs are intended for students interested in research and in acquisition of strong foundations in functional human anatomy and tissue biology. The principal, although not exclusive, focus of research in the department is on the biology of skeletal disease, repair and regeneration. This work is founded in strong interdisciplinary alliances associated with the Rush Arthritis and Orthopedics Institute. This consortium includes the Department of Biochemistry with its focus on cartilage and connective tissue research, the Department of Orthopedic Surgery which sponsors research on surgical and therapeutic interventions and sup- ports Rush's gait and biomechanics laboratory, and the Section of Rheumatology that hosts ongoing studies on arthritis and inflammatory connective tissue disease. The scope of this work, with its underlying orientation to skeletal and joint disease, provides an excellent forum for graduate study. A premium is placed on critical thinking and communica- tion skills that can help students translate new ideas into effec- tive research questions and lines of investigation. These skills are central to the production of effective grants and publications and to their future roles as scientists and educators. Exploration of structure-function relationships is an exploding frontier for the contemporary anatomist in the medical research setting. Anatomists, as most scientists, are reinventing themselves and their fields in the study of basic disease processes. Extraordinary capabilities of new imaging technology and partnerships with other scientists put structural biologists into the mainstream of mapping molecular processes into three-dimensional space of cells, tissues and organs. This collaborative environment, both in education and research, is a great source of intellectual and personal enrichment. Anatomy and Cell Biology: Admission Requirements Applicants are encouraged to complete their application files by April 1, preceding the intended date of admission since the course cycle begins in the fall semester. Applications, however, will be considered on a rolling basis for applicants to the MS or PhD degree program who are enrolled in Rush Medical College or other individuals eligible for advanced standing, e.g., in post-professional master's work. Rush Medical College students must go on a leave of absence from the Medical College while pursuing an MS or PhD degree in The Graduate College and will reenter Rush Medical College upon graduation from The Graduate College.The Division of Anatomy and Cell Biology seeks students whose backgrounds demonstrate motivation toward research and teach- ing as well as a capacity for independent study. Consideration is given to the student's area of interest with respect to the exper - tise of individual faculty. Preferences for majors in biological sciences should include labo- ratory experience as well as coursework experience in anatomy, physiology, cell and molecular biology, and embryology/develop-mental biology. Students with backgrounds supporting interests in biomechanics or kinesiology should contact the Program Director. Acceptable academic and test performances (GPA/GRE/MCAT/ TOEFL) are described in The Graduate College guidelines. Specific divisional admission requirements may be waived at the discre-tion of the Division of Anatomy and Cell Biology's Graduate Advisory Committee, thus giving the student advanced standing in either the master's or doctoral programs. Anatomy and Cell Biology: Academic Policies The Division is bound by academic policies of the University and The Graduate College. Assessment of Progress The student's progress will be assessed continuously based upon performance in the courses taken and upon evaluations by the Division of Anatomy and Cell Biology's Graduate Advisory Committee. Good academic standing necessary for graduation requires maintenance of a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 3.0. Students who fail to earn at least \"B\" grades in courses within the division, or whose overall GPA falls below 3.0, are placed on probationary status for review of their progress by the Graduate Advisory Committee. Pending this review, any student on probation may be recommended for a remedial action or for dismissal from the program. An outline of these specific academic policies and grievance mechanisms is accessible on the depart- mental Web site; a printed version may be obtained from the Graduate Program Director. Graduate College/Rush University Academic Policies Academic policies specific to The Graduate College are located earlier in this catalog. In addition, the Academic Resources and Policies section of this catalog contains Rush University academic policies. Anatomy and Cell Biology: Curriculum Doctoral Degree in Anatomy and Cell Biology The first- and second-year curricula are devoted to anatomy coursework and complementary electives selected from cell and 227 molecular biology, physiology, biochemistry, pharmacology, immu- nology, neuroscience, biostatistics and ethics in research. Methods and special topics courses during the first year help the student select and work more closely with his or her research advisor and identify project lines for dissertation research. Participation in the departmental journal club is expected each semester. This is primarily a research-based degree, but doctoral students are also encouraged to serve as instructional assistants in the core anatomy courses to improve their comfort level in working with students and anticipating future roles in teaching. Admission to degree can-didacy for dedication to dissertation research is contingent upon successful completion of: 1) coursework requirements, 2) a written comprehensive examination and 3) a dissertation proposal to be presented to the student's dissertation committee for approval. Master's Degree in Anatomy and Cell Biology The master's degree is a research-based degree requiring a thesis based on laboratory or experimental work of limited scope. There is some flexibility in selecting courses to meet the master's degree requirements. The core courses that students select to meet these requirements are minimized in order to direct students' efforts to their thesis projects beginning in the first year. Completion of the full course complement and thesis research would ordinarily take two years. Core courses are based on corresponding courses in Rush Medical College, but may include a supplement for graduate students. In these sessions students are variously presented with problems, encouraged to explore material from historical or con- temporary perspectives in the literature, perform and demonstrate special dissections, and to discuss or present material on assigned topics. Weekly journal club meeting on selected topics provide an opportunity for students to discuss papers under faculty supervi-sion. These sessions expose students to methods and experimen- tal studies outside the mainstream of their laboratory setting. The journal club provides experience in critical review of literature with a focus on experimental design and presentation and inter - pretation of data. Faculty participation in these discussions helps broaden students' perspectives.

The Research Advisor must hold an appointment in the Division of Anatomy and Cell Biology. The Research Advisor assists the student in development of a dissertation/thesis pro- posal, selection of a dissertation/thesis committee and in over - sight of the dissertation research and writing. The student, in consultation with the Research Advisor and Graduate Program Director, is responsible for assuring that his or her graduate coursework satisfies requirements of both the Division and The Graduate College for completion of the degree. Thesis Requirements for Master's Students After completion of their coursework and initiation of their research, students identify a master's thesis committee (three members) and present their thesis proposal for review. The composition of the committee is governed by the Graduate College's Policy and Procedures document. This proposal is ordinarily scheduled toward the end of summer after their first year. Completion of the study, the thesis and its presentation and defense are to be completed by May in order to qualify for a June graduation. Candidacy Requirements for Doctoral Students Preliminary Examination After completing the course requirements, the student must take the preliminary examination in order to qualify for degree candidacy. This examination emphasizes the student's ability to synthesize material, to solve problems and to communicate verbally and in writing. The first part of this examination consists of a written, comprehensive examination on course material. The second part, an oral examination, is based on the student's dissertation proposal. Dissertation Upon completion of both parts of the preliminary examina- tion, the degree candidate devotes his or her time mainly to dissertation research and writing. The dissertation must be an original experimental or applied study; its format and review must comply with requirements of The Graduate College. The candidate must present the work in a University-wide forum and defend the completed dissertation before his or her research committee. This dissertation committee should be comprised of five members with at least one member from outside the division. An extramural committee member is recommended. The composition of the committee is governed by the Graduate College's Policy and Procedures document. Anatomy and Cell Biology: Advanced Placement The programs in Anatomy and Cell Biology are well-suited to medical students interested in pursuing an MS or PhD degree because of significant overlap in required coursework for these programs. Exemptions are ordinarily permitted for courses taken as medical students at Rush (or possibly other institu- tions), subject to review by the departmental Graduate Advisory Committee. The MS for medical students provides an opportunity for students to engage in research training and to fulfill the thesis requirement without significant additional coursework. The thesis research is completed in one additional year, ordinarily between the student's second and third medical school years. This training is significant for students seeking academic careers in medicine as physician-scientists but whose specialty interests require extended residency programs and post-residency fellow- ship commitments. The PhD program would typically follow a traditional 2-3-2 plan, with three years devoted to doctoral study between the medical preclinical and clinical programs. Students interested in pursuing a PhD degree should contact the Program Director to discuss the opportunities and application procedure. MS with Advanced Placement An advanced placement track is available for residents or clinical fellows who may be afforded extended time to pursue research. Students or graduates of Rush or accredited United States or Canadian medical schools are eligible for this advanced place - ment track. The Graduate Record Examination (GRE) is ordinarily required, although applicants can petition for an exemption based on their MCAT scores. Proficiency exams administered by the program may be required to validate competency in certain areas or to help set up program plans. International medical graduates will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Their eligibility is based on TOEFL and GRE scores as well as under - graduate medical records and recommendations. The advanced placement track recognizes the medical course background of 229 the applicants by exempting them from anatomy, histology and neurobiology course requirements. The emphasis is on research, laboratory-based training and project development with the completion and defense of their master's thesis. Anatomy and Cell Biology: Tuition Scholarships, Stipends and Employment Tuition Scholarships/Stipends Tuition scholarships are provided for all doctoral trainees along with stipend support equivalent to NIH guidelines and accord-ing to Graduate College's Policy and Procedures for predoctoral fellowships. No tuition forgiveness or stipends are provided to master's students. Tuition and stipend for MD students pursu- ing an MS degree are based on Graduate College's Policy and Procedures and resources available to the department and the advisor. Paid Employment Outside employment is not permitted under ordinary circum- stances. A student who desires to work or needs to work for financial or other reasons is first advised to discuss his or her sit - uation with the research advisor who can best assess potential issues that may relate to conduct of research or other degree requirements. If the student cannot resolve the situation with his or her advisor, the student may petition the Program Director to help arrive at a recommendation that is in the student's best interest. In any case, the Program Director should stand apprised of any instances of employment. Anatomy and Cell Biology: Research Activities Research in the Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology stresses the pathobiology of tissue repair and regeneration in connective tissue (especially bone and cartilage), the eye and cancer biology. Many of these studies are directed to developing modes of protection against injury or finding ways that growth factors and cytokines can promote healing in experimental models. Biomedical projects, closely allied to problems encoun-tered in the clinical setting, are enriched by collaborative work with the Departments of Orthopedic Surgery, Biochemistry and Ophthalmology and the Section of Rheumatology. Students are encouraged to perform research in cross-disciplinary areas to take advantage of opportunities in the medical environment at Rush to develop basic research problems with a disease orienta-tion. In addition to the biomedical research detailed below, faculty members have interests in the development of new educational constructs that use computers to facilitate instruc-tion and applied learning through case study work. Faculty laboratories are located in the Armour Academic Center and Jelke Building. These laboratories support a variety of projects ranging in scope from cell and tissue culture work using molecu-lar probes and biochemical methods to experimental surgery and studies on biomechanics and gait. There is ready accessibil - ity to scanning and transmission electron microscopy, a confocal microscope, mechanical testing equipment and a bioinstrumen- tation laboratory as well as opportunities in specialty labora- tories throughout the Medical Center. Most faculty members collaborate not only with other researchers at Rush, but with investigators elsewhere in the United States and abroad. As a small department, a premium is placed on close relation - ships between students and their faculty mentors for guidance in development of new projects. The department normally hosts post-doctoral MD or PhD investigators who are committed to related lines of investigation and who are valuable resources for students. Highlights of faculty research interests in the depart- ment include: Bone Biology and Orthopedics Methods of enhancing bone regeneration for improving fixation of orthopedic implants (e.g., for joint replacement) are being investigated in experimental models and in patients. These studies feature mechanisms by which bone adapts to altered mechanical stresses and to the presence of foreign materials in these devices. The role of growth factors and cytokines is being studied in these models. (Sumner, Virdi) Bone Biology and the Bone Marrow Stroma Mesenchymal stem cells in the bone marrow stroma can give rise to a number of cell lineages, including osteogenic, chondro-genic, myogenic and adipogenic. Isolation and characterization of the early progenitors has a great potential for their use in clinical situations of tissue repair and regeneration. Our research interests focus on molecular studies using gene-expression pro-filing and the role of these cells as vehicles for delivering growth factors to the site of repair. (Virdi, Sumner) Joint Pathophysiology The pathophysiologic processes that produce damage to joints and articular cartilage are being examined in experimental models. Possible approaches to protecting cartilage from dam-age and inducing cartilage repair are being studied as a means to restore articular surfaces damaged by trauma or osteoar - thritis. The role of bone in the development and progression of osteoarthritis is controversial. Several of our recent studies have suggested that bone may play a critical role. (Williams, Sumner, Thorp) 230 Movement Disorders Faculty investigator and a team of collaborators are investigat- ing: (1) Balance, gait and functional mobility deficits in neurode- generative disorders as well as identifying potential functional markers for early detection of such disorders. (2) Novel tech- nologies to measure hyperactive motion including repetitive, stereotyped movements in individuals with Fragile X Syndrome and autism as potential outcome measures in future therapeutic intervention trials. (O'Keefe) Cartilage Biology and Bone Growth The long-term goals of this research area is to understand the molecular mechanisms that govern chondrocyte maturation (hypertrophy) during skeletal development; and to identify putative therapeutic targets that regulate chondrocyte matura- tion and are therefore involved in the pathogenesis of related skeletal dysplasias and/or osteoarthritis. Current projects are focused on identification of transcriptional determinants that mediate tissue-specific mouse Protein-1) and other putative transcription fac-tors in late endochondral bone formation. (Zheng) Ocular Lens The structural basis of lens opacification (cataract), lens struc-ture/function relationships as a consequence of aging, cataract formation and ocular/systemic diseases and fiber cell elonga- tion/migration in normal lens and models of cataract are being investigated. (Al-Ghoul) Cancer Research Dissemination of cancer cells from primary tumor to distal organs (e.g., bone, lungs) is the primary cause of cancer-related deaths. A compelling and therapeutically relevant question is how cancer cells acquire a metastatic phenotype and escape from the primary tumor. Research interests focus on the under - standing the role of transcriptional regulatory networks opera-tive during cancer progression and metastasis to bone using various approaches (molecular, biochemical and imaging), and in vitro and in vivo models of cancer metastasis. (Pratap) Cancer stem cells are highly metastatic and play a key role in tumor recurrence and resistance to radiation and chemotherapy. Cross-talk between the sonic hedgehog signaling pathway, heparanase, and PI-3 kinase signaling pathway, are implicated in promoting cancer stem cell self-renewal and tumor cell inva - siveness. Studies in the Xu laboratory focus on the role of these signaling pathways in tumorigenesis and metastasis of thyroid and breast cancer and targeting these signaling pathways for cancer treatment and prevention. (Xu)Osteosarcoma is the most common malignant bone cancer in children. Current treatment includes aggressive preoperative and postoperative multidrug chemotherapy. Nonetheless, it is estimated that 30% of patients with localized disease and 80% of patients with metastatic disease at diagnosis will relapse. Recurrent tumors are thought to arise from therapy-resistant cancer cells that survive the initial treatment. Determining the molecular basis for chemotherapy resistance should allow one to more effectively target these therapy resistant cells. The tumor suppressor protein p53 is activated and triggers cell death pathways in response to DNA damaging chemotherapeutic drugs. More than 50% of cancer harbor inactivating mutations in p53, and in many cases mutations in p53 have been linked to a diminished response to chemotherapy. A long-term goal in the Maki Lab is to identify molecular mechanisms responsible for therapy resistance in osteosarcoma and other cancers, and then use this information to more effectively target resistant cells. (Maki) Biochemistry: Philosophy/Division Overview The Division of Biochemistry offers a master's (MS) and doctoral (PhD) degree with a major in biochemistry. All recipients of these degrees acquire a thorough knowledge of normal biochemical processes that take place in the human organism, leading to the development of knowledge and skills of potential benefit to health care delivery. The doctoral degree is awarded following the successful defense of a research dissertation, which demon- strates the ability of the student to perform and present original scientific work. Prior to this, the student must have completed all course requirements with a minimum average grade of \"B\" (3.0/4.0) and passed the PhD Preliminary Examination. The goals of the graduate program in the Division of Biochemistry are to provide high-quality education, practical training and research opportunities to students interested in practicing basic and applied medical biochemistry at molecular and cellular levels. The term \"medical biochemistry\" has often been applied to describe the Division's scholarly direction. The Division thus endeavors to develop those professionals who, through their research activities, will substantially improve health care delivery to the public. The program trains students in the application of chemical, physical and molecular biological methods and principles to the solution of biological problems, especially those of biomedical importance. A graduate of the biochemistry program should have the knowledge, skills, per - spectives and understanding to produce quality, self-directed sci - entific work. Since it is a time of enormous and rapid advances 231 in biochemistry and molecular biology, the knowledge and skills taught in the program are soon replaced or augmented. Thus, the Division of Biochemistry endeavors to train the student to recognize and utilize the interaction between observation, experiment and theory. Most importantly, the candidate should also demonstrate that oral, written and visual communication skills have been acquired. Biochemistry: Admission Requirements Students are admitted only in the fall semester. Applications may be submitted at any time during the year. Application review begins in early winter and the number of doctoral stipends is limited. Applications for admission to the program will be evaluated by the Graduate Program Committee of the Division of Biochemistry and, in special cases, the Graduate College Council. Applicants are encouraged to visit Rush University for an interview. Consideration for admission will include overall academic record, results of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE), letters of recommendation and especially interview results. Students must meet all Graduate College requirements. Medical students seeking an MS or PhD in Biochemistry must take a leave of absence from medical school and be formally accepted to the applicable program in The Graduate College. Transfer students with an advanced degree in science may, upon the recommendation of the Graduate Program Committee, be admitted to the graduate program in biochemistry with advanced standing. The extent of advanced credit will be deter - mined by the Graduate Program Committee on an individual basis through its credentials subcommittee. All advanced level entrants are urged to see the credentials subcommittee before matriculation. Minimum requirements for admission to the Graduate Program include a bachelor's degree in any scientific discipline with a minimum grade point average (GPA) and GRE scores as defined by The Graduate College. More specific departmental course requirements are as follows: one year of general chemistry, one year of organic chemistry, one semester or quarter of analytical chemistry or physical chemistry, one year of general biology, one year of molecular, cellular or advanced biology, mathematics through calculus and one year of physics. At least one semes- ter of biochemistry is highly recommended but not required. Students may be accepted with less than the minimum course requirements upon special action of the Graduate Program Committee, which may waive such requirements or require that the deficiency be rectified during the student's first year of graduate study.Biochemistry: Curriculum The PhD degree is a research degree conferred in recognition of proficiency in research, breadth and soundness of scholarship and a thorough acquaintance with a specific field of knowledge as determined by the faculty. To attain these goals, the curricu-lum includes the following: Graduate College \"core curriculum\" courses (GCC courses) provide a common knowledge base in molecular and cell biology for most graduate students in all divisions. A core of required biochemistry courses (BCH courses), which provide the basis for the students to pursue their own spe-cialized biochemistry research programs A variety of elective courses, which provide the students with the flexibility to tailor their coursework to their research interests or needs Initiation of research as soon as possible in the student's first academic year During the first year, the student will complete all required bio-chemistry and Graduate College Core curriculum courses. By the end of the second year, the elective course requirements should be completed. At the end of the summer term of the student's first academic year (usually at the beginning of September; the academic year begins with the fall semester), the student sits for the Preliminary Examination, which is a combination of a written examination, take-home examination and oral examination. By the end of his or her second academic year (i.e., before the fall semester of the student's third academic year begins) the student is required to submit and defend a written dis- sertation proposal before the student's Dissertation Advisory Committee. Following this, the successful student continues his or her research work, as approved by the Dissertation Advisory Committee. When the student's advisor and his or her Dissertation Advisory Committee agree that the student has completed his or her task, which is evaluated at an announced \"Permission to Write Meeting,\" he or she writes a dissertation, which is defended in a public seminar and in a separate executive session with the student's Dissertation Examination Committee. Another require- ment is that one or more manuscripts, based on the student's dissertation work, be published, accepted or submitted for publi- cation in a full-length peer-reviewed journal, with the student listed as first author. To participate in the May commencement ceremony, all requirements for the PhD degree must be met by the beginning of the month. 232 Required Formal Courses for the PhD Degree Any portion of this may be waived for advanced students on a case-by-case basis as recommended by the Credentials Subcommittee. Semester Hours Required Total credit hours required for full-time student status and for graduation are determined by The Graduate College. The student must check with the Office of the Registrar before anticipated graduation as to whether or not all formal Graduate College requirements have been met.

Credit hours not allocated to formal courses are made up by BCH-699 Biochemistry Doctoral Research for PhD students or BCH-598 Biochemistry Master Research for MS students. A student, however, should register for at least one BCH-699 or BCH-598 credit each semester even though the student may not have begun their laboratory research. A student not taking any formal courses must register for enough hours in BCH-699 of BCH-598 to be a full-time student. The 7 elective hours may be selected from other courses offered by the Division of Biochemistry or from coursework offered by other divisions, including those of other universities. Electives can be taken only after consulta-tion with the student's advisor and the Director of Graduate Education and final approval by the Director. Most required courses taken by the student must carry a letter grade (\"A,\" \"B,\" \"C\" or \"F\"); however, Master's Research, BCH-699 Biochemistry Doctoral Research and some BCH-595 Journal Club credits are taken for a pass/no pass grade. Students must obtain a grade of \"B\" or better in BCH-571, which is considered the biochemistry core course. Elective courses may be taken for a letter grade or a pass/no pass grade. Graduate students must maintain at least a \"B\" average (3.0) to remain in good academic standing in The Graduate College. The Department's seminar program and the weekly workshops are to be considered as part of a student's research experience. Attendance at seminars is mandatory throughout the entire graduate study at Rush. Attendance at the workshops is highly recommended since these sessions can greatly help a student prepare for and conduct their dissertation work. Since many of the themes presented at the workshops relate to dissertation projects, students may be queried as to their knowledge of seminar and workshop presentations at their Preliminary examination or \"Dissertation Progress Meetings.\" Suggested Program A suggested program for the PhD student is displayed herein. Please note that all required courses are to be taken in the first and second years of the student's tenure at Rush University. Electives are normally taken during the second year. A research advisor should be selected by the end of the second semester of the student's first year, or earlier. Students are expected to remain on campus during the summer term as full-time students taking BCH-699 (unless taking a formal course). The summer term provides a welcomed opportunity to do uninterrupted research work. Reasonable vacation time is permitted after con- sultation with the student's advisor and two weeks are allowed annually, according to NIH fellowship guidelines. The program of study for MS students is similar to that for the PhD students except master's students register for BCH-598 Biochemistry Master's Research instead of BCH-699. Master's students do not take a Preliminary Examination. The MS program should be completed in two years, where the first year is devoted primarily to coursework and the second year to MS research.233 Suggested Program of Study for PhD Students Year 1 HR Fall Semester BCH-581 Biochemical Methodology I 3 BCH-698 Introduction to Research 1 BCH-699 Research in Biochemistry 1 GCC-501 Molecular Biology 2 GCC-502 Cellular Biochemistry: Proteins, T ransport and Signaling 2 GCC-511 Readings in Molecular Biology 1 GCC-512 Readings in Cellular Biochemistry 1 Spring Semester BCH-571 Medical Biochemistry 3 BCH-582 Biochemical Methodology II 3 BCH-699 Research in Biochemistry 1 GCC-506 Research Ethics 1 GCC-503 Functional Cell Biology 1 GCC-513 Readings in Functional Cell Biology 1 GCC-504 Functional T issue Biology 2 GCC-514 Readings in Functional Tissue Biology 1 BCH-624 Connective Tissue Biochemistry 2 BCH-595 Journal Club 1 BCH-699 Research in Biochemistry 1 GCC-508 Writing Pr acticum 2 Select Advisor Summer Term BCH-699 Research in Biochemistry 9 Preliminary Examination Year 2 Fall Semester BCH-699 Research in Biochemistry 6 Electives 3 Spring Semester BCH-699 Research in Biochemistry 5 Electives 3 BCH-595 Journal Club 1 Dissertation Proposal Subsequent Years BCH-595 Journal Club each spring semester, any additional electives, and BCH-699 to give a total of 9 credit hours each term until a successful dissertation defense.Biochemistry: Academic Policies Statute of Limitations and Leaves of Absence A student must complete his or her PhD degree requirements within five years of matriculating to Rush in the Department of Biochemistry, excluding any leaves of absence. Extensions of this limitation may be granted under unusual circumstances on a semester-by-semester basis upon petition to the Director of Educational Programs who will act based on the advice of the Graduate Program Committee. Extramural Experience Selected students will have an opportunity to spend one semester in a basic science research laboratory in an industrial organization or another recognized research institution of higher learning in the United States or Europe. It is expected that work in the extramural laboratory will aid the student in his or her dissertation research work. The students will be selected for this experience upon written application to the Director of Graduate Education through guidelines established by the Division. Graduate College/Rush University Academic Policies Academic policies specific to The Graduate College are located earlier in this catalog. In addition, the Academic Resources and Policies section of this catalog contains Rush University academic policies. Biochemistry: Tuition Waivers/Stipends The Graduate College determines tuition for full-time graduate students; however, tuition has historically been waived for stu- dents in a PhD program. Students in an MS program pay tuition. Most PhD students receive a research scholarship (stipend), while MS students do not. The research scholarship awarded to PhD students is a privilege, which is contingent upon satisfac- tory academic progress on the part of the student. No special application for this stipend need be made; the applicant must merely indicate in his or her cover letter that such a stipend is desired. Additional financial aid, including loans, is available through the Rush University Office of Student Financial Aid. It should be noted that the student is expected to be a full-time student. Part-time jobs are highly discouraged. The advisor (who will then inform the Director of Graduate Education in writ- ing) must approve any special circumstances that necessitate a part-time job. It is intended that graduate students receive their stipends from the Division of Biochemistry until the student has passed his or her Preliminary Examination and, at the end of 234 the first academic year, has selected a permanent advisor. From that time on, it will be the obligation of the student's advisor to provide the student with financial support, including a stipend, from his or her extramural research funds as the student can now devote more time to research. The research scholarship (stipend) is awarded to students for a period of five years with the understanding that they will devote their full time to graduate study activities and that they will make satisfactory progress toward the PhD degree. \"Satisfactory progress\" includes, but is not limited to, pursuit of the prescribed didactic course program, identification of a research advisor by the end of the second semester, passing the Preliminary Examination in the fall of their second aca-demic year, presenting a research proposal by the end of the second academic year as specified by Departmental Rules and Regulations, and pursuing research activities toward the stu-dent's dissertation with due diligence and effort. The Graduate College has mandated that the PhD must be awarded within seven years following matriculation. However, the Division of Biochemistry will enforce a five-year deadline, but will allow extensions that are justified and approved by the Graduate Program Committee. Biochemistry: Research Interests Members of the Division of Biochemistry's faculty conduct a broad range of extramurally funded research activities. Many faculty members focus their research efforts on cartilage tissues, synovial joints and arthritic diseases. A strong interaction exists between practicing clinicians and members of the Division of Biochemistry, and sometimes leads to a full consolidation of research programs. The diverse interests of the faculty provide investigative expertise in the areas of connective tissue bio- chemistry, etiology of arthritis, animal models of arthritis, joint imaging, regulation of gene expression, cytokines and growth factors, signal transduction, biomechanics, tribology, muscu- loskeletal cell biology, cancer cell biology, cell membrane and lipid biochemistry and the application of clinical biochemistry to medical problems. Some of these research programs are joint efforts with other departments, giving the student an oppor - tunity to interact with investigators in other disciplines as well as with clinicians and physician scientists. The departmental laboratories are fully equipped with instrumentation required for modern research in biochemistry, tissue culture and molecular biology. MASTER OF SCIENCE IN BIOMECHANICS Biomechanics: Philosophy The Master of Science in Biomechanics program is designed to educate bioengineers in a clinical setting who will participate in the conduct of research to improve orthopedic care. Graduates of this program can collaborate with other researchers to perform high-quality, up-to-date research in orthopedic biomechanics at colleges and universities, government agencies and orthopedic- related industries. Graduates can also use this as a stepping stone towards obtaining a PhD degree in Biomechanics after gaining appreciable practical experience either in the orthopedic industry or research institutions conducting high-quality mus- culoskeletal biomechanics research. Students in the program will work with faculty and scientists from different divisions at Rush University such as division of Biomechanics, Biochemistry, Anatomy, Physiology and Molecular Biophysics to learn essential skills in research methods, data analysis and descriptive and inferential statistics applied to the biological and engineering aspects of musculoskeletal biomechanics. The program of study involves formal courses in biomechanics, biomaterials, anatomy, tissue and cell biology, research methods and biostatistics. As a part of the program, students must complete a research project that culminates in a thesis. Specific objectives of the program are to: 1) train bioengineers in the application of biomechanics to clinically related musculo- skeletal problems through \"bench to bedside and back again\" research that improves orthopedic care; 2) provide bioengineers with core competencies needed for the design and analyses of clinical biomechanical problems in the field of orthopedics; and 3) provide bioengineers the foundation that is needed to assume professional leadership roles in a variety of settings for research and design in the area of orthopedic biomechanics. The master's degree is very much a viable diploma, independent of the PhD qualification. Local industry leaders and employers have reported through interview with faculty in our Graduate College that they have a greater need for MS-prepared individu- als to work in their laboratories. Graduates of the Master's pro - gram will be qualified to work in orthopedic related industries, hospitals, government and nonprofit agencies to assist in the design of biomechanical devices and evaluate their effectiveness. MS graduates are more likely to assume positions in industry. Biomechanics: Admission Requirements Applicants must enter the program in the fall semester in order to begin the required coursework in the core curriculum. The 235 deadline for submission of applications is generally March 1. International applications can be accepted after March 1 but must take into consideration the delays associated with the necessary visa arrangements. In addition to the basic require-ments established by The Graduate College, the division has the following requirements for admission to its program: Applicants must have completed a Baccalaureate degree or higher from a regionally accredited college or university and provide official transcripts from each college or university attended. Prior degrees would most likely include physical sciences, engineering, computer science, mathematics, biol-ogy or medicine; although students with degrees from other areas and those who consider themselves to have special or unique qualities and a reasonable likelihood of success are also encouraged to apply. The Graduate College requires academic transcripts from all baccalaureate and post-baccalaureate educational experi- ences. These should provide a minimal grade point average of 3.0 overall (A = 4.0). The Graduate College requires all graduate students to take the GRE examinations; scores on these tests are considered by the admission committee. All applicants whose native language is not English are required to take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). Applicants from foreign countries must have their transcripts evaluated by an independent agency (i.e., ECE and WES). As required by the Graduate College, a clear, concise expression of the applicant's interests and goals needs to be included as an essay in their application. Identifying a par - ticular area of interest within the field of biomechanics is very helpful in identifying potential laboratories for the students. The Graduate College requires three letters of recommen - dation and it is recommended that they be from science faculty who can evaluate the character of the applicant, their academic and research performance, and their ability to think and work independently. The Division Director and the Admissions Committee evalu- ate applications. All prior academic experience and the letters of recommendation will be evaluated for an indication of the applicant's potential for success as a graduate student and future independent investigator. The statement by the applicant describing goals and motivation will be studied to determine the compatibility between the applicant's requirements and the capabilities of the graduate program. The number of faculty available to mentor the student's research limits acceptance into the master's program. Students are there- fore encouraged to apply early. Generally, students entering the master's program will not be eligible for stipends and must pay tuition. Under certain circumstances, if the faculty has sufficient funds, it may provide financial support to the extent of tuition. Biomechanics: Curriculum When the applicant enters the program, a research advisor is assigned and the student begins directed research on an active project. In the first three semesters, there is minimal research as classroom studies are emphasized. During these semesters, master's Graduate College students take the Graduate Core Curriculum (GCC) classes, required biochemistry (BCH) course and required Biomechanics (BMC) courses. The summer semes- ter is devoted to MS Thesis research. Research and advanced Biomechanics courses provide the core of the second-year studies. The master's students are involved in a directed research project. A typical course sequence is described as follows: Year 1 Fall Semester BMC 501 Statics and Dynamics 3 BMC 502 Strength & Properties of Materials 3 BMC 505 Anatomy/Musculosk eletal System 3 GCC 502 Cellular Biochemistry 2 GCC 512 Reading in Cellular Biochemistry 1 Spring Semester BMC 511 Biomechanics 3 BMC 513 Kinematics of Human Motion 3 BMC 512 Bioengineering Material 3 GCC 506 Research Ethics 1 BCH 624 Connective Tissue Biochemistry 2 Summer Semester BMC 503 Introduction to Research 1 BMC 504 Journal Club 1 BMC 521 MS T hesis 7 Year 2 Fall Semester BMC 514 Spine Biomechanics 3 GCC 546 Statistics 2 MS T hesis 7 Spring Semester BMC 521 hesis 6 GCC 508 Writing Pr acticum 2236 GCC courses are Graduate College Courses taken by master's students from a variety of different Graduate College programs. These courses provide a basic understanding in the biomedi-cal sciences and acquaint the students with the biomedical literature. BCH-prefixed courses are specific to the Division of Biochemistry. BMC-prefixed courses are specific to the Division of Biomechanics. The Division of Biomechanics reserves the right to revise courses and the student may be required to take the replacement courses. Such a requirement would not apply to students who have already taken a course. Minimal Credit Hours Required for MS Degree The MS program in Biomechanics will require a minimum of 53 semester hours of academic coursework taken at the graduate level that consists of core courses in biomechanics, strength and properties of biomaterials, basic anatomy and cellular biochem - istry (15 semester hours); research core courses in biostatistics, writing practicum, ethics and journal club and introduction to research (7 semester hours); professional track course in connective tissue biochemistry, kinematics of human motion, bioengineering material and spine biomechanics (11 semester hours); and thesis work (20 semester hours). The program may be completed in approximately 2 years of full-time study. Research Requirements (Thesis) All MS students must complete a thesis as a part of degree completion requirements. The thesis is completed through faculty-guided research. The thesis may be original or an impor - tant extension of an existing theory/principle and cannot have been used to meet the requirement of any other degree, either at Rush University or any other university. Each student will have a thesis committee whose role is to assure that the student's thesis is of high quality and meets the standards of the division, the College and the University. The thesis committee is chosen by the student in conjunction with the student's primary advisor and should consist of at least three total members to include the student's primary advisor. The primary advisor must be a member of the Graduate College. Once the committee convenes, it will choose a chairperson who cannot be the student's primary advisor. The chairperson will oversee the scheduling and activi-ties of the committee. Biomechanics: Thesis Program Progression During the summer of the first year, the student selects a research project in conjunction with a faculty mentor. The research project is designed to advance knowledge in a specific discipline and to yield a scientific publication for the student. The thesis may be original or an important extension of an existing theory/principle and cannot have been used to meet the requirement of any other degree, either at Rush University or any other university. Academic Advisor/Principal Advisor The graduate division director functions as the academic advisor to the student during the first year. The Program Director deter - mines the course schedule and monitors the student's progress. In the summer, a principal advisor or mentor is selected from the faculty of the Division of Biomechanics. The advisor then accepts the supervisory role in the development of the student as a scientific investigator. Thesis Research The advisor will work with the student to develop a research project that can be completed within the framework of the program. Each student will have a thesis committee whose role is to assure that the student's thesis is of high quality and meets the standards of the division, the College and the University. The thesis committee is chosen by the student in conjunction with the student's primary advisor and should consist of at least three total members to include the student's primary advisor. The primary advisor must be a member of the Graduate College. Once the committee convenes, it will choose a chairperson who cannot be the student's primary advisor. The chairperson will oversee the scheduling and activities of the committee. Master's Thesis A written thesis, describing work accomplished, is required to be completed by all master's students by the end of the second year. The Thesis Committee reviews the thesis. At or near the completion of the thesis, each student will share, by means of a seminar with the academic community, the knowledge that the student has developed. Students are responsible for posting announcements (at least two weeks prior to the presentation) on institutional bulletin boards and e-mailing all faculty and students of the Graduate College the title of the thesis; the student's name; and the location, date and time of the presenta- tion. This presentation must precede the final approval of the written thesis by the Thesis Committee. Following the approval of the Thesis Committee, the Program Director must certify the completion of the thesis and all requirements for the MS degree. The Director of the Library of Rush University Medical Center must then approve the formatting of thesis before its accep- tance by the Library of Rush University.237 Completion of the Degree The Office of the Registrar must be notified of impending com- pletion of the degree by submission of an Intent to Graduate form at the beginning of the final semester. Information for graduation can be found in the University Catalog. As the Thesis is reaching final form, the student should consult with the University Librarian to assure that the Thesis will be formatted correctly. Upon Thesis approval, the student completes a final checklist to assure the necessary approvals. During this time, the student will be required to have an exit interview and provide the College with feedback concerning his or her experience at Rush University. Biomechanics: Graduation Requirements The student must complete all required courses except for those waived by the Graduate Committee and have completed the minimally required course hours as detailed in the curriculum section. The student's Committee must approve the thesis and have the completed document accepted by the Graduate Program Director and the University Librarian. DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN BIOMECHANICS Biomechanics: Philosophy The PhD in Biomechanics is designed to educate bioengineers in a clinical setting to perform \"bench to bedside and back again\" research that improves orthopedic care. This program will train engineers/scientists in the application of biomechanics to clini-cally related musculoskeletal problems with the help of faculties from different divisions at Rush University such as divisions of Biomechanics, Biochemistry, Anatomy, Physiology and Molecular Biophysics. Graduates of this program will perform high quality, cutting edge research in orthopedic biomechanics at colleges and universities, government agencies, hospitals, non-profit agencies and orthopedic related industries. Students in the program will work with faculty and scientists to generate new knowledge in the field of musculoskeletal biomechanics through the application of sophisticated research methods and statistics. The program of study involves formal courses in biomechan-ics, advanced biomaterials, anatomy, bone biology, tissue and cell biology, techniques in biomedical sciences, implant design, tribology of implants, kinematics of human motion, spine biome- chanics, ethics, research methods and biostatistics. As a part of the program, students must complete a comprehensive written preliminary examination on fundamental principles related to biomechanics, design and conduct research that culminates in a dissertation, and disseminate their findings through scholarly publications and presentations. Specific objectives of the program are to: 1) train bioengineers in the application of biomechanics to clinically related musculo - skeletal problems through \"bench to bedside and back again\" research that improves orthopedic care; 2) provide bioengineers with core competencies needed to design research projects and analyze clinical biomechanical problems in the field of orthope - dics; and 3) provide bioengineers the foundation that is needed to assume professional leadership and research roles in the area of orthopedic biomechanics across a variety of settings Biomechanics: Admission Requirements Applicants must enter the program in the fall semester in order to begin the required coursework in the core curriculum. The deadline for submission of applications is generally March 1. International applications can be accepted after March 1 but must take into consideration the delays associated with the necessary visa arrangements. In addition to the basic require- ments established by The Graduate College, the division has the following requirements for admission to its program: Applicants must have completed a Baccalaureate degree or higher from a regionally accredited college or university and pro - vide official transcripts from each college or university attended. Prior degrees would most likely include physical sciences, engi- neering, computer science, mathematics, biology, or medicine; although students with degrees from other areas and those who consider themselves to have special or unique qualities and a reasonable likelihood of success are also encouraged to apply. Admission criteria include: completion of all prerequisite courses with a minimum grade of 3.0/4.0 scale; an overall cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 3.0/4.0 scale; a mini - mum combined Verbal and Quantitative score of 1000 on the Graduate Record Examination (GRE); three letters of recommen- dation from persons who are knowledgeable about the quality of the applicant's scholarly activities and/or work experience; an essay including the applicant's personal statements and future goals; and an application fee. Additional factors influencing admission to the programs include: professional work experi- ence; positions of leadership held; and communication and writing skills (as demonstrated in the personal statement essay). Specific admission requirements may be waived by the Graduate College Council. These will be addressed on a case by case basis.238 Prerequisite coursework includes (but is not limited to): General Physics and Chemistry; Algebra, Calculus, and Differential Equations; Introductory Biology and Biochemistry, Introduction to Physiological Systems; Bio-Instrumentation; Properties of Material; Fundamentals in Statistics; and Dynamics and Senior Design. The PhD program in Biomechanics will target applicants who are practicing bioengineers from industry or health profession- als and individuals with backgrounds in biology and Medical Physics. The PhD program will also be available to eligible Masters prepared junior faculty members of Rush University, providing them a mechanism for obtaining their doctoral degrees. Acceptance of transfer credit 30-45 credit hours of graduate credit may be transferred into the PhD program with approval of the Section Director for stu- dents who are directly entering into the PhD program after com- pleting a Baccalaureate degree. Graduate transfer credit may be given for graduate level courses taken at other institutions if approved by the major advisor and Section Director and if they are judged to meet divisional requirements. Courses taken outside of the United States may be considered for transfer with the approval of the Section Director. All such courses must be evaluated by the Education Credentials Evaluators (ECE) and be judged equivalent by U.S. standards. Academic credit for life experiences will not be given. The Division Director and the Admissions Committee evalu- ate applications. All prior academic experience and the letters of recommendation will be evaluated for an indication of the applicant's potential for success as a graduate student and future independent investigator. The statement by the applicant describing goals and motivation will be studied to determine the compatibility between the applicant's requirements and the capabilities of the graduate program. The number of faculty available to mentor the student's research limits acceptance into the master's program. Students are there- fore encouraged to apply early. Generally, students entering the master's program will not be eligible for stipends and must pay tuition. Under certain circumstances, if the faculty has sufficient funds, it may provide financial support to the extent of tuition.Biomechanics: Curriculum The PhD in Biomechanics will require a of minimum of 132 semester hours of academic course work taken at the graduate level and consists of core courses in biomechanics, strength and properties of biomaterials, basic anatomy and cellular biochemistry (15 semester hours); research core courses in biostatistics, writing practicum, ethics and journal club, introduc - tion to laboratories, experimental design and models of research and introduction to research (11 semester hours); professional track course in connective tissue biochemistry, kinematics of human motion, bioengineering material and spine biomechanics (11 semester hours); advanced topics such as non-linear tissue biomechanics, implant biomechanics, bone biology, advanced biomaterials and tribology of implants that will help the stu- dents to perform high quality, up-to-date research in orthopedic biomechanics (18 semester hours) and doctoral dissertation work (74 semester hours). In addition, students will be able to further their knowledge in any subject using the 3 semester hours of elective or independent study. The program may be completed in approximately 4 years of full time study. Upon matriculation the division shall provide the student with a handbook which contains information outlining: all course requirements with a year-by-year synopsis of rec- ommended courses with course numbers required grade performance for all required and elective courses requirements for qualifying exams description of the general content of the qualifying exam process for passing qualifying exams process for remediating qualifying exams selection of an advisor requirements for dissertation committee selection expectations for research work form of dissertation proposal dissertation committee process requirements for completion of degree time line for degree completion and other materials relevant to the division not covered by the Graduate College student policies239 Year 1 Fall Semester BMC 501 Statics and Dynamics 3 BMC 502 Strength & Properties of Materials 3 BMC 505 Anatomy/Musculosk eletal System 3 GCC 502 Cellular Biochemistry 2 GCC 512 Reading in Cellular Biochemistry 1 Spring Semester BMC 511 Biomechanics 3 BMC 513 Kinematics of Human Motion 3 BMC 512 Bioengineering Material 3 GCC 506 Research Ethics 1 BCH 624 Connective Tissue Biochemistry 2 Summer Semester BMC 503 Introduction to Research 1 BMC 504 Journal Club 1 BMC 631 Doctor al Dissertation 7 Year 2 Fall Semester BMC 514 Spine Biomechanics 3 BMC 611 Non Linear Tissue Mechanics 3 GCC 546 Statistics 2 GCC 505 Introduction to Labor atories 2 BTN 525 Experimental Design and Models of Research 2 Spring Semester BMC 612 Adv anced Strength of Materials 3 BMC 613 Implant Biomechanics 3 BMC 614 Bone Biology 3 BMC 615 Adv anced Biomaterials 3 GCC 508 Writing Pr acticum 2 Summer Semester BMC 616 T ribology of Implants 3 BMC 699 Elective 3 BMC 631 Doctor al Dissertation 3 Year 3 and Year 4 BMC 631 Doctor al Dissertation 64A typical course sequence is described as follows: Research Requirement Research Dissertation (PhD) (74 semester credit hours total minimum requirement) Students must choose an area of concentration in order to complete the dissertation requirements of the degree program. The overall aim of the dissertation is to make the students work on a clinically relevant topic in the following musculo- skeletal biomechanics categories: Human Motion, Implant Design and Analyses, Spine Biomechanics, Bone Mechanics, Cartilage Mechanics, Biomechanics and Biochemical Analyses of Ligaments, Tendons and Muscles. All doctoral students must complete faculty-guided independent research that culminates in a dissertation as a part of degree completion requirements. The dissertation must be original and cannot have been used to meet the requirement of any other degree, either at Rush University or any other university. Each student will have a dissertation committee whose role is to assure that the student's dissertation is of high quality and meets the standards of the division, the College and the University for originality, contribution to the field and scholarly presentation. The committee is also to assure that the student is making satisfactory progress toward completion of the degree. The dissertation committee is chosen by the student in conjunc- tion with the student's primary advisor and should consist of at least five total members that include the student's primary advisor. Two of the committee members and the primary advisor must be from the Graduate College. At least one member of the committee should be from outside of the division, and preferably from outside of the institution. Once the committee convenes, it will choose a chairperson who cannot be the student's primary advisor. The chairperson will oversee the scheduling and activi- ties of the committee. Preliminary examination The PhD seeking student is expected to attempt and pass a writ- ten and an oral examination (referred to as preliminary exami - nation) WITHIN the second year after admission to the program (summer of the 2nd year). Preliminary exam can be from course work to examine their preparedness. The preliminary examina- tion presentation format will closely follow that of the NIH grant application but excludes portions such as budget, resource statement, etc. The student is expected to provide some prelimi- nary results and, more importantly, outline his/her research plan. The prelim exam committee consists of 5 faculty (including the Advisor and the Division Director). Specific requirements for the committee include: 1) at least one faculty from outside the Division of Biomechanics; and 2) at least one faculty from 240 outside of Rush University and approved by the Divisional Graduate Program Committee (which will be formed a program oversight body). The Preliminary Examination Committee will, preferably, remain the same and become the final dissertation committee. The preliminary exam may be open to the academic community of the university. The committee must approve the research proposal. During the course of the research work, each student must, annually, present their findings in a seminar. At or near the completion of the dissertation, each student will share, by means of a seminar with the academic community, the knowledge that the student has developed and the findings obtained. Students are responsible for posting announcements (at least two weeks prior to the presentation) on institutional bulletin boards and e-mailing all faculty and students of the Graduate College the title of the dissertation, the student's name, and the location, date and time of the presentation. This presentation must precede the final approval of the written dis- sertation by the Dissertation Committee. Upon completion of the public presentation, the student will meet with the dissertation committee to review the presenta-tion, the dissertation document, and the student's preparedness to enter the scientific community. A majority of members of the committee must sign the dissertation certifying the completion of all requirements for the doctor of philosophy degree. Admission to Candidacy for PhD Admission to candidacy is evidence that the doctoral student has successfully completed all preliminary coursework and is prepared to move into his/her intensive research experience. Admission to candidacy is not completed until the student suc-cessfully defends his or her dissertation proposal. This proposal must be in the form of an R21 NIH application. Admission to candidacy is a demonstration of confidence that the student will successfully accomplish the remaining requirements of the program. Practicum, internship, Clinical or field experience requirements Internship or field experience with reputed implant manufactur - ers may help the students with their dissertation work for PhD students. Time to completion of the degree Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) candidates are expected to meet all requirements for graduation within five enrolled academic years (excluding leaves of absence). This period begins the semester in which the student formally matriculates. A student exceed-ing that time limitation must submit to the Graduate Council, in writing, a request to extend his or her candidacy beyond that time period. This request must identify the reasons for the extension and provide a written plan with reasonable deadlines for completion. This document will be co-signed by the student's advisor, section director and division director. The council will vote whether to accept the extension or not (passed by simple majority). The student's advisor will then provide an update on the student's progress after six months. One year after the extension is granted the student is expected to complete all requirements. A second request may be made by the student's advisor and section director, but will only be accepted through a two-thirds majority of the voting members present at a formal hearing of the Graduate College Council. Within one year of that second request, the student must complete all requirements for the PhD degree or face dismissal. Alternatively, the student may be awarded a MS degree upon the recommendation of the student's graduate division. Biomechanics: Academic Policies The minimum satisfactory grade for course credit is \"B\", and all stipulated segments of a course must be passed by this stan-dard. If a student earns grades lower than \"B,\" or the student's overall GPA falls below a 3.0, the student may not be permitted to register for subsequent courses or semesters without the approval of the section Committee on Progress and Promotions and the student may be subject to probation, suspension or dis - missal from the program. Students who withdraw or have been dismissed from the program may reapply and will be considered on the same basis as a new applicant. Students requesting readmission must submit a letter to that effect to the Committee on Progress and Promotions. Students are expected to attend all classes and spend the appropriate time in the lab. Outside employment is not allowed for anyone receiving a stipend because it interferes with the time and effort necessary to complete the program. Each student is expected to conduct herself or himself at all times in a dignified manner\u2014a manner which conforms to the ethics of the profession and which instills confidence in one's abilities as a working scientist. Irresponsible, unprofessional or unethical behavior, as determined by the instructor, may result in dismissal from the program. The department will not condone cheating in any form. Allegations of cheating will be reviewed by the Committee on Progress and Promotions and if merited, dealt with in a strict manner including immediate dismissal from the program.241 Any student found to be cheating on an examination will automatically receive a \"0\" for the examination and, at the discretion of the Committee on Progress and Promotions, will be subject to dismissal from the program. This Rush University Catalog details the policies regarding inclusion of minorities and those with disabilities as wells as the policies and procedures for reporting harassment. The Division of Biomechanics follows the University Policies on Academic Honesty and the University Statement on Student Conduct. Student Academic Appeals Policy Numerous checks are in place to assure the fair treatment of students. Any student of the Graduate College may appeal a final course grade or failure of the thesis that results in his or her academic probation or dismissal from the University. A student may also appeal an unreasonable delay in graduation from the University. The process for filing an appeal is maintained by each division. Graduate College/ Rush University Academic Policies Academic policies specific to The Graduate College are located earlier in this catalog. In addition, the Academic Resources and Policies section of this catalog contains Rush University academic policies.

Scanned items can be used for review and preliminary admission decisions; however, official documents will be required for final admission decision. Formal course by course grade/ diploma certification by ECE or WES is required of all students who have completed their last degree outside of the U.S. g. Applicants whose native language is other than English and who do not hold an equivalent of a U.S. Bachelor's degree from an institution at which English is the language of instruction, must submit scores from TOEFL or IELTS. Recommended scores are as follows: TOEFL 620 (paper based); 260 (computer based); minimum of 100 with equally strong subscores of Reading, Listening, Speaking and Writing, OR IELTS 6.5, with subscores of 6.0 for all four subscores. 3. Acceptance letter s: Official acceptances for students will come only from the Dean's office. No students will be accepted after August 1 unless they had been officially placed on a wait list. Specific admission requirements may be waived by The Graduate College Council. These will be addressed on a case-by-case basis. Applicants who consider themselves to have special or unique qualities that make them strong candidates for graduate educa- tion are also encouraged to apply. Research and related job experience are valued highly in the admissions process and will be taken into account. Interviews with applicants are extremely helpful and can play a significant part in the admission decision. Beyond these measures, the faculty attempts to determine the applicant's motivation and potential for advanced study and a research career in the sciences. Once The Office of College Admissions Services has received all required documents, includ-ing the application fee, the applicant's admission materials are reviewed by the Program Director and approved by the Dean. In special circumstances, the application file is sent to The Graduate College Council, where a review of the application takes place. The Office of College Admissions Services then notifies the appli- cant of the decision. Additional information and the admission application are available at http://www.rushu.rush.edu/gradcol. Biotechnology: Academic Policies Academic Standing All students who maintain a cumulative grade point average of 3.0 while completing the required course sequence with full-time enrollment will be considered to be In Good Academic Standing within the Graduate College and are eligible for graduation with the M.S. degree. Any student who fails to maintain a 3.0 grade point average will be considered to be In Academic Difficulty until the deficiency is corrected. Those requirements will be determined by the Biotechnology Program Director with the advice of the Dean and Graduate College Council. A student In Academic Difficulty is not eligible for graduation. Graduate College/Rush University Academic Policies Academic policies specific to The Graduate College are located earlier in this catalog. In addition, the Academic Resources and Policies section of this catalog contains Rush University academic policies.244 Biotechnology: Graduation Requirements The successful completion of the biotechnology curriculum with a minimum 3.0 (4.0 scale) cumulative GPA will qualify the stu - dent for graduation. No thesis or other activity is required. The Master of Science degree is conferred to biotechnology students. Clinical Research: Philosophy The Masters of Science program is designed to train health care professionals to perform and evaluated clinical research. This program is part of the Rush Graduate College. The two-year, thesis-requiring program involves one year of didactic lectures followed by a one-year, mentored clinical research experience. Both years are designed to provide the necessary skills needed to perform clinical research in the 21st century. The coursework requires self-directed experimental design and historically important clinical trials, as well as clinical research with a faculty mentor. Skills and techniques needed for epidemiology, out-comes and clinical pharmacology research are also provided. The emphasis of the program is to make available the skills needed for successful undertaking and completion of an independent clinical research project. Clinical Research: Admission Requirements This program is targeted to health care professionals with advanced degrees including MD, PhD or PharmD degrees. Students with other advanced degrees including nursing and pharmacy degrees and experience in clinical trials may also apply, however an advanced degree is not required. Many stu- dents in the program are physicians in fellowship programs at Rush and Stroger Hospitals. Students seeking admission to the Master of Science in Clinical Research program must complete an application and provide formal transcripts from all institu - tions of higher education that were previously attended. The deadline for application is generally June 15th, although excep- tions can be made. Applicants must enter the program in the fall semester, which starts early September. The majority of students applying to this program are current health professionals, and if an advanced health professional degree is documented, no entrance examination is required. If the applicant does not hold a professional degree, the GRE must be taken. If evidence of performance in the 50th percentile in national examinations (e.g., MCAT scores or DAT) is provided, the GRE requirements can be waived.Applications will be reviewed by the Program Director and students will be notified when they are accepted. Before matriculating into the program, the individual responsible for the student's time (e.g., fellowship training director) must agree that the student will be available for classroom work and IRB attendance to ensure that no conflict exists between class time and clinical responsibilities. Clinical Research: Curriculum The curriculum for the program is single track the first year and self-directed the second year. All students in the program are required to maintain a cumulative average of \"B\" or greater (or pass). Courses offered are graded in year one as either pass/no pass or with a letter grade. With the exception of the IRB modules, all classes in the first year are scheduled on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 3:30 to 6:30 p.m. Year 1 Fall Semester I GCC-551 Ethics in Biomedical Research and the IRB 2 GCC-552 Introduction to the Regulatory Process: 2 Drug Discovery and Development GCC-546 Principles of Biostatistics I 2 CRE - 597 Thesis Research 0-3 Spring Semester I CRE-557 Clinical Trials I (intro to clinical research) 2 CRE-558 Clinical Trials II 2 GCC-547 Principles of Biostatistics II PVM-553 GCC-548 Bioinformatics 1 PHR-556 T for Research 1 Summer Semester I CRE-597 T hesis Research 5-9 Year 2 Fall Semester II CRE-597 T hesis Research 5-9 CRE 559 Readings in Special P opulations 1 CRE-523 Readings in Clinical Research 1 Spring Semester II CRE-597 T hesis Research 5-9 CRE 559 Readings in Special P opulations 1 CRE-523 Readings in Clinical Research 1 Minimum of credits to graduate: 32245 Students are required to take the readings courses in the second year although students may also take other electives in topics dealing with Clinical Trials, Outcomes/Epidemiology Research or Clinical Pharmacology. Classes are tailored to the specific needs of the student and are arranged through the Program Director. The students will also meet periodically with the Program Director during the second year to monitor progress on their master's thesis research project. A trainee who fails a class or receives a no-pass in a course will have an opportunity to retake the exam or rewrite the paper to reverse the no-pass grade. A cumulative average of \"B\" or greater (pass) in required courses is needed to continue in the program. Failure to remediate the no-pass grade will automati - cally require the Program Director to review the trainee's status and officially place the trainee on academic probation for a period of one semester. The course director will develop a reme-diation plan to ensure the trainee has mastery of the subject area covered. Required courses are GCC-551, 552, 546, 593; CRE 557, 558; and PHR, 556. The second year is designed to provide an intense mentored clinical research project under a mentor's guidance and the preparation of a Master's Thesis. Students usually enroll in at least six credit hours per semester. These are typically research hours (CRE-597) or elective readings classes. The student and mentor will identify a clinical research project and will submit that project in the form of an abstract by the end of the spring semester of year 1. The student and mentor will further refine the proposal in the summer between the first and second year. Only clinical projects will be considered for this program. Basic science projects will not be appropriate for the thesis. The student is expected to complete all of the data collection by the beginning of the spring semester for submission of the thesis by the end of the spring semester of the second year. Minimum Credit Hours Required Successful completion of the clinical research program requires 32 semester hours as a minimum for graduation along with preparation and public defense of a written thesis. Students may opt to take additional hours and can enroll in mentoring intern - ships for up to 9 credit hours per semester. This option places the student in a clinical or laboratory environment 10 hours per week, performing research with a clinical research scientist, enabling a 9-credit hour per semester experience. These intern- ships should be established as part of the application process and will require the student and the mentor to come to agree- ment on the scope and duration of the internship.Clinical Research: Thesis Process After identifying a mentor, the student and mentor will begin to outline the research project during the spring and summer of the first year. This can be of the student's own design or, alternatively, a student may participate in a large multicentered trial provided permission is received in advance for publication of the subset of that data collected by the student as a thesis. Any project that involves patient-oriented research (requires IRB approval) can be submitted. By midterm of the spring semester the student will submit the project in the form of a scientific abstract (500 words) with anticipated methods, statistical analy- ses, power analysis and outcomes. The Program Director will approve the abstract. Once approved, an IRB application must be submitted immediately. The student and mentor will identify two additional readers for the thesis, who together with the mentor, will serve as the student's thesis committee. The student will then collect and analyze the data. The student will be encouraged to write a first author manu- script summarizing his or her work and submit that manuscript for review. This manuscript can then be modified to meet the University standards for thesis submission and serve as the thesis. If a manuscript is not written and submitted, the student must still present a written thesis for consideration of degree completion. All students will present their work publicly in May prior to graduation. The mentor and at least one reader must sign the completed thesis document suggesting that a majority of the committee had accepted the thesis. There are no written or oral qualifying exams for the program. Clinical Research: Academic Policies To remain in good standing, The Graduate College requires that the student has a passing (\"B\" or higher) cumulative average for all required coursework. Students are expected to attend all classes and participate in discussion. Students are also expected to participate in the various computer laboratories that are routinely held in the McCormick Educational Technology Center (METC) throughout the first year of the program. Students are expected to conduct themselves in a professional manner. This includes respecting the rights of others and being kind and courteous to students, faculty/staff and patients. Intimidation of other students and faculty/staff will not be toler - ated and is grounds for dismissal. Sexual harassment as well as harassment related to race, color, religion, sexual orientation, national origin, ancestry, age, marital or parental status, or 246 disability is prohibited. The University Bulletin details the policies regarding inclusion of minorities and those with disabilities as well as the policies and procedures for reporting harassment. The Graduate College understands that many of the students are clinicians, but it does expect for them to be on call during class time (generally 3:30 to 6:30 p.m. on Tuesdays and Thursdays). The Master of Science, major in Clinical Research, program follows the University Policies on Academic Honesty and the University Statement on Student Conduct. Student Grievance Procedure Numerous checks are in place to assure the fair treatment of students. However, if a grievance does evolve, the student should speak with the Program Director first in an attempt to resolve the problem. If this is unsuccessful or the grievance involves the Program Director, the student's grievance will be processed directly by the Graduate Student Council and those council meetings will be chaired by the Associate Dean of the College. Graduate College/Rush University Academic Policies Academic policies specific to The Graduate College are located earlier in this catalog. In addition, the Academic Resources and Policies section of this catalog contains Rush University academic policies. Clinical Research: Graduation Requirements The student must maintain a passing cumulative average for all required courses. The student's advisor and the Program Director must approve the student's thesis. The student must complete a thesis that has been accepted as meeting format requirements for a master's thesis. Clinical Research: Faculty Research Interests Because this is a multidisciplinary program, there are no identi-fied faculty members aside from those who teach in the cur - riculum. Please see the various clinical departments/sections for their respective research interests. Health Sciences (PhD) Please see the College of Health Sciences section of the catalog for the full program description. Immunology/Microbiology: Philosophy The Division of Immunology/Microbiology is committed to educating bright, creative individuals for careers in scientific investigation. The training is accomplished through faculty-led instruction in the classroom, independent self-study, laboratory rotations and intensive dissertation research under the direc- tion of a mentor and student dissertation advisory committee. It is expected that students completing the PhD program will be skilled in the scientific method, will be capable of independent critical thinking, will be skilled as life-long learners and, with additional postdoctoral training, will become leaders in their chosen field. The Division also offers a more limited educational program leading to the MS degree. Immunology/Microbiology: Admission Requirements Students who have received a Baccalaureate degree in biologi- cal sciences or a related field may apply for the master's or the doctoral program. Candidates usually enter the program in the fall semester. Applications should be submitted by February 15 and no later than June 30. Applications will be evaluated by the Departmental Admissions Committee as they are received. It is possible that applications will be closed before June 30 if the class is filled before that date. Considerations for admission will include overall academic record, the recommendations of the sponsors, results of a recent Graduate Record Examination (GRE) and the description of the applicant's own aspirations and interests. International students are also required to submit a recent result of a TOEFL test. Admission criteria to the program are consistent with the general requirements of The Graduate College. A grade point average of at least 3.0 on a 4.0 scale as well as competitive GRE and TOEFL scores are required. Minimum GRE or TOEFL scores are not assigned. In rare circumstances, students that do not fulfill these require- ments may be accepted at the discretion of the Division and the Graduate College Council. Personal interviews will be arranged for potential candidates after the preliminary review. Students will be admitted into the program at levels other than first year only under exceptional circumstances; this will require approval by the Division Director. Students may be accepted directly into a particular laboratory and will have that faculty member serve as their PhD academic/dissertation advisor, or they may be accepted at-large and will have the graduate program direc- tor initially serve as faculty advisor. The latter students will be required to fulfill a minimum of two laboratory rotations before selecting a dissertation research advisor. All student-advisor assignments must be approved by the Department Chairperson.247 Immunology/Microbiology: Curriculum (Note that the program retains the right to change these requirements in order to keep current with research and education advancements.) First Year to Completion of the Program During the first year after matriculation, students will enroll in The Graduate College Core Curriculum classes and other courses required by this Division. The schedule for these classes is: Year 1 Fall Semester I GCC-501 Molecular Biology: Genome to Proteome 2 GCC-502 Cellular Biochemistry: Proteins, 2 T ransport and Signaling GCC-511 Readings in Molecular Biology 1 GCC-512 Readings in Cellular Biochemistry 1 IMM-507 Basic Immunology I 1 IMM-520 Adv anced Readings in Immunology 1 Microbiology IMM-515 Research Seminar 1 IMM-600 Labor atory Rotations 1 Spring Semester GCC-503 Functional Cell Biology 1 GCC-504 Functional T issue Biology 2 GCC-506 Biomedical Ethics 1 GCC-513 Readings in Functional Cell Biology 1 GCC-514 Readings in Functional Tissue Biology 1 IMM-508 Basic Immunology II 1 IMM-520 Adv anced Readings in Immunology 1 Microbiology IMM-515 Research Seminar 1 IMM-600 Labor atory Rotations 1 Summer Semester IMM-615 Pre-Dissertation Research 12 (A pre-candidacy examination for doctor al candidates\u2014described below) Year 2 Fall Semester I IMM-510 Advan ced Immunology 4 IMM-515 Research Seminar 1 Readings in Immunology 1 and Microbiology IMM-615 Pre-Dissertation Research 6 Spring Semester IMM-610 Special T opics 2 IMM-515 Research Seminar 1 IMM-520 Adv anced Readings in Immunology 1 and Microbiology Summer Semester IMM-615 Pre-Dissertation Research 12 PhD students should defend a dissertation proposal to move to candidacy . Students in the PhD track must complete the requirement for a Pre-Candidacy Examination (PCE) by the end of the summer semester. The PCE consists of both a written and oral portion. The written portion is based on a research proposal submitted to an examination committee appointed by the Graduate Advisory Committee (GAC). The topic of research must be preapproved by the GAC and must be different from the proposed research for PhD dissertation. The proposal should be based on the NIH R21 grant application format and should be no more than 6 pages in length (single-spaced) excluding bibliography. The oral portion of the PCE will consist of a presentation and defense of the grant proposal and may also include basic questions in their area of interest (immunology/microbiology). Students who fail the PCE will be asked to take a comprehensive written examination in immunology and microbiology. Failing this comprehensive writ-ten examination will result in recommendation for dismissal by the GAC to the Dean of The Graduate College. Students are also expected to devote substantial time to research during the summer semester. After all core courses are completed, a student will be evaluated by the GAC for her or his performance in courses, laboratory work, motivation, etc., to determine continuation of the student in the program. This evaluation will take place before the beginning of the fall semester of the second year. Second Year to Completion of the Program: The classes required during the second year are: Before the start of the fall semester, the student will select a laboratory and advisor for their dissertation research. The student and advisor will submit a list of faculty for their Student Dissertation Advisory Committee (SDAC) for approval by the GAC. The members of the SDAC will be allowed to change with GAC approval if the project changes substantially or if the faculty is no longer appointed at Rush. The composition of the SDAC must be consistent with guidelines of the Graduate College Council. At this time, the SDAC must consist of at least five members: 248 The advisor Two faculty members from the Division of Immunology/ Microbiology. This may include a co-advisor. One faculty member from another division in T he Graduate College An additional faculty member from within or from outside of Rush University The student will prepare a dissertation proposal describing her or his plan for dissertation research and submit the proposal to his or her SDAC during the spring or summer semester of the second year. The SDAC must approve both the written document and oral defense of the document before the end of the summer semester. Preliminary data should be included, if available, but it is not necessary and the presentation/defense should not be deferred to collect such data. While it is mandatory that students complete this requirement by the end of the summer semester, students are strongly urged to complete this requirement before this deadline so that they may begin their doctoral dissertation research in earnest as soon as possible. After successful defense of the research proposal and the dissertation proposal, the student will be admitted to candidacy. If the proposal defense is failed, the SDAC may require that the proposal be rewritten and defended prior to the end of the fall semester of the third year. A failure at the second defense will result in a recommendation for dismissal from the program. Three to Five Years to Completion of the Program Students should continue to register for Special Topic (IMM-610) courses from years 2 through 4 until they have completed two special topic courses prior to graduation. In special circum- stances, students may substitute special topic courses with an elective, contingent upon permission of the Graduate Program Director. Doctoral students are expected to register for IMM-520 Advanced Readings in Immunology and Microbiology, IMM-515 Research Seminar and IMM-620 Dissertation Research each fall and spring semester. Examples of previous special topics courses include: Current Topics in Cellular Immunology\u2014From Bedside to Bench; HIV Gene Structure and Function; Signal Transduction in Lymphocytes; Vaccines; and Th2, Parasites, and Allergy. Students must also devote maximum time to research during these years. When the student and the advisor have determined that suffi- cient data have been obtained and that the project has reached an acceptable degree of completion, a data defense meeting with SDAC is held in which the student summarizes the data that will be included in the dissertation. If the SDAC approves, the student will commence writing the dissertation. Curriculum for Students in the Master's Track Students in the master's track are required to take the same first year of classes as the doctoral students. After the completion of first year, students in the master's track are required to submit a topic of research for approval by the GAC by the summer semes - ter of the first year. After approval, the student is expected to pursue full-time research in this area, while continuing to regis - ter for Research Seminar and Advanced Readings in Immunology and Microbiology. Students need to form a research committee made up of their advisor and two faculty members within The Graduate College. They are expected to summarize their findings in the format of a manuscript and defend it orally to their com- mittee members in an open defense. It is expected that the MS degree will be completed within two years of matriculation. Immunology/Microbiology: Academic Policies Five-Year-Rule Limit after Matriculation The Division of Immunology/Microbiology honors the five-year- rule limit after matriculation stated by The Graduate College. The rule states that \"Maximum enrollment for degree completion is five calendar years. Any approved leave of absence will be excluded from this time. A student may petition for an exten-sion of the overall time limit to the division director. If such an extension is granted, the student will be expected to enroll full-time for each remaining semester in residence. If a student proposes to maintain active status in The Graduate College while at another location, approval by the Division Director and The Graduate College Council will be necessary. Such a student will enroll each semester with Rush University's Office of the Registrar for zero hours of credit, and will be charged the enroll-ment fee rate in effect at that time.\" Vacation Students are entitled a total of two weeks vacation per year. The advisor must approve the vacation timing. Parental Leave Policy Parental leave will first be negotiated between student and advisor, subject to the provision that students may take up to six weeks (total) off during pregnancy and/or following the birth of a baby, with full stipend. If a student elects to take a longer period before returning to full-time graduate status, this addi- tional time will be automatically considered a leave of absence with no stipend provided. A student on paternity/maternity leave of absence is guaranteed reinstatement for up to six months after delivery.249 Conditions for Continuation in the Program If a student leaves residency in the program without completing the requirements of his or her degree, he or she may continue his or her status as a student for an additional two years, provided he or she arranges to meet SDAC every six months. Otherwise, the student will be subject to dismissal at the end of six months after leaving the program. Ethics All students are expected to keep a good and careful record of their research. Any student found falsifying, plagiarizing or misrepresenting data will be dismissed from the program. The original of all records must remain in the laboratory in which the student worked. Problems Between Advisor and Student Prior to forming the SDAC, if a problem arises between student and advisor, this problem should be discussed with the Division Director, who will then attempt to mediate and provide a rea- sonable solution to the problem. If a problem arises between a student and the advisor after the student has formed the SDAC, the student and/or the advisor should discuss the problem with the SDAC chair. If the problem is not resolved within one month, the student/advisor should discuss it with the Division Director. It is recommended that difficulties be solved at an early stage. If the informal approaches are unsuccessful, and a student and/ or advisor desires to sever their working relationship, those indi- viduals involved shall petition in writing for such change to the program director. From the date of receipt of the written request for a change, two weeks of mutual introspection time is required before any change is considered. The Division Director will make the decision whether or not to honor the student's request for transfer and will make the necessary arrangements to make the transition smoothly. An advisor change is a serious matter and should only be contemplated after all other avenues have failed. Students must also be aware that an advisor change is not automatically approved, and that the availability of an alternate advisor may be very restricted. Graduate College/Rush University Academic Policies Academic policies specific to The Graduate College are located earlier in this catalog. In addition, the Academic Resources and Policies section of this catalog contains Rush University academic policies.Immunology/Microbiology: Tuition Waivers and Assistantships Eligibility As a part of the program's intention to provide the opportunity to advance academically and develop scholarship in a reason- able period of time, students in the PhD program receive a tuition waiver and a student assistantship to allow vigorous and full-time commitment to their academic endeavors. Students in the MS program do not receive a tuition scholarship or an assistantship. Assistantships for students in the PhD program may be withheld or reduced for those students that fail to provide a full com- mitment to research and scholarly activities after passing the Pre-Candidacy Examination. This reduction will be submitted to the Graduate Advisory Council (GAC) via a recommendation by the student's advisor. The GAC may then inquire into this issue and decide on an outcome. Students in good academic/research standing are assured of their assistantship for five years by their sponsoring department or section. Assistantship support beyond five years is at the discretion of the advisor. A sixth-year student would not get an assistantship from the department, although the advisor may continue to provide one from her or his labora - tory funds. Students are accepted into the program with the understanding that they will devote their full time to learning and research. Students in the PhD degree track receiving an assistantship and tuition waiver who, for reasons other than departmental and college decisions, transfer to the MS degree track may be required, at the discretion of the GAC, to repay the cost of tuition and assistantship support provided to them. Immunology/Microbiology: Research Activities Faculty members are based in an active medical center dedi- cated to patient care; to the support of clinical, biomedical and basic biological research; and to education in allergy, basic and clinical immunology, and microbiology.

Medical Physics: Philosophy The Division of Medical Physics offers two programs of study and clinical research leading to graduate degrees: Master of Science with a major in radiological sciences or Doctor of Philosophy with medical physics as the area of interest. The faculty members of the division are active in theoretical and experimental research in medical physics and its clinical applica- tions. The faculty's diverse interests allow the division to offer a program that can satisfy students' interests and needs in several areas of medical physics: Dosimetry Imaging applied to medicine Radiation sources Physics of radiation oncology Physics of diagnostic radiology Physics of nuclear medicine Radiation protection The counterpart Department of Medical Physics in The College of Health Sciences offers a Medical Physics Residency Program. The primary purpose of this postdoctoral training program is to provide specialized research, instruction and clinical training in cancer radiation treatment-related areas of medical physics. Note For the Current Academic Year Admission of students to the PhD program in any given year is contingent on a number of factors, including availability of necessary resources, such as faculty, space and equipment, and the level of interest expressed in the applicant pool. The pro-gram's leadership has assessed these and other factors and has concluded that no new students will be admitted for the current academic year. Questions about the program and its future plans should be directed to the program director.251 Medical Physics: Admission Requirements Note For the Current Academic Year: PhD Program: The Graduate College offers a PhD degree in Medical Physics that provides a curriculum to prepare research- ers and practitioners. Admission of students to this program in any given year is contingent on a number of factors, including availability of necessary resources, such as faculty, space and equipment, and the level of interest expressed in the applicant pool. The program's leadership has assessed these and other factors and has concluded that no new students will be admit- ted for the current academic year. Questions about the program and its future plans should be directed to the program director. MS Program: The Graduate College also offers an MS degree in Radiological Sciences. Applicants to this program should have received an MD or DO degree from an accredited institu-tion and have been accepted to the medical residency program in Radiation Oncology or Diagnostic Radiology. The studies required for the MS degree may be carried out concurrently with the clinical residency program. Applicants should have obtained a letter of approval from the chair of the department in which the resident is being trained before submitting an application for admission. Medical Physics: Academic Policies Grievances The department advisory committee, at the request of a student, will resolve a grievance between the student and faculty concerning: Course grade and preliminary examination results that may result in the student's dismissal Unreasonable delay in completing the dissertation research Failure to pass final oral defense of the dissertation The student may appeal the decision of the department advisory committee to The Graduate College Council and to the dean, according to The Graduate College policies and procedures. Graduate College/Rush University Academic Policies Academic policies specific to The Graduate College are located earlier in this catalog. In addition, the Academic Resources and Policies section of this catalog contains Rush University academic policies.Medical Physics: Curriculum Master of Science, Major in Radiological Sciences Program The studies required for the master's degree may be taken con - currently with the residency program, provided prior approval is given by the chair of the department in which the resident is being trained. Full-time students should complete the Master of Science degree in one calendar year. Part-time students will require more time. Each student will submit a thesis on his or her research and will take a final examination in defense of the thesis. Medical Residents in Therapeutic Radiology The following courses are required for medical residents in therapeutic radiology: MPH-, 512, 513, 524, 525, 526, 900 and 580. The courses MPH-570, 608, 621, and 622 may be chosen as electives in the master's degree program. Medical Residents in Diagnostic Radiology and Nuclear Medicine The following courses are required for medical residents in diag- nostic radiology and nuclear medicine: MPH-, 541, 900 and 580. The courses MPH-608, 621, and 622 may be chosen as electives in the master's degree program. Other elec-tives are available at Rush University. Medical Physics Doctor of Philosophy Program The PhD program is intended to be completed in four to five years of full-time study beyond the bachelor's degree. The minimum residency requirement established by The Graduate College is two years of full-time enrollment. During the first year, the student will be committed to completing required coursework and any deficiencies. During the second and later years, required courses will be completed, and the student will be encouraged to enroll in appropriate advanced courses within The Graduate College. Ordinarily, research begins near the end of the second year, and it will continue as the primary activity throughout the third and later years. The following courses are required: MPH-601, 602, 603, 621, 625, 900 Core courses in T he Graduate College Students may choose other electives at Rush University. 252 Medical Physics: Academic Progression Master of Science Students Academic Progression The graduate program director acts as academic advisor to each new student. The director determines the course schedule with students and monitors their progress. Soon after entry, stu- dents select the area of research they wish to consider for their master's theses. Each student seeks out a faculty member of the Division of Medical Physics who will become his or her scientific advisor. The advisor and student assemble an advisory commit- tee of four members, at least two of whom are on The Graduate College faculty. The advisor serves as chair of the advisory committee. The committee is responsible for adapting continued coursework to the student's needs and for providing advice and evaluation at all stages of the graduate program. Specifically, the committee will evaluate the student's thesis proposal, thesis and performance at the thesis defense. Before beginning the specific thesis research, the student must present a detailed pro- posal, including a literature review, to the advisory committee. At that time, the student will be required to give an oral defense of the study that demonstrates his or her understanding of the study's goals and methods. When the committee is satisfied with the proposal, the student may begin the research project. Although the major advisor will closely supervise the research, it is the student's responsibility to attain the research goals. Thesis Defense The thesis is a scholarly work based on an original project. Its format and review by the advisory committee and dean must comply with the requirements of The Graduate College. Oral defense of the thesis serves as the final examination in partial completion of the requirements for the master's degree. The examining committee includes a minimum of four faculty mem- bers approved by the department advisory committee. At least two examiners, including the student's principal and associate advisors, are selected from within the division. Two examiners may be selected from outside the division, preferably though not necessarily, from outside the University. Distinguished scientists may be invited as guests of the division to examine the thesis and to participate in the final defense. Passing the final exami- nation is based upon the recommendation of the majority of the examiners. If the student fails to pass the final examination, the student may appeal to the dean of The Graduate College. Doctor of Philosophy Students Academic Progression The graduate program director functions as academic advi- sor to each new student during the first year. During this time, the director determines course schedules with students and monitors their progress. Toward the end of the first year, students take a qualifying examination covering basic physics, therapeutic and imaging physics, radiation protection, transfer function analysis and current topics discussed during the medi-cal physics seminar series. This examination includes written and oral components. Based on the results of the qualifying examination and performance in coursework, students may be permitted to continue in the program without conditions. If a student's performance is poor, he or she may either be permit- ted to continue with added requirements or dismissed from the University. During the second year, the student selects the area of research he or she wishes to consider for the PhD dis-sertation. The student should seek out a faculty member of the Division of Medical Physics who will act as the scientific advisor. The advisor and student assemble a dissertation committee of no fewer than five members, at least three of whom are on The Graduate College faculty. The department advisory committee must approve the membership of the dissertation committee. Toward the end of the second year, the student is expected to take a preliminary oral examination. This examination is given only after the student has completed all required courses and eliminated all deficiencies. At the oral examination, the student is required to: Demonstrate competency in general and clinical medical physics Demonstrate adequate knowledge in medical physics Defend the research proposal Show his or her understanding of the proposed study's goals and methods The dissertation committee conducts the oral examination. The student's level of performance on this examination determines whether he or she is admitted to candidacy for the PhD degree. Students failing to gain admission to candidacy may be retested six to twelve months after the original examination date. The student may begin and register for dissertation research after admission to candidacy. The dissertation committee meets with the student periodically to review progress and provide feed-back. The major advisor closely supervises the research, but it is the student's responsibility to attain the research goals. Dissertation The dissertation is a scholarly work based on an original project. Its format and review by the dissertation committee and dean must comply with the requirements of The Graduate College. The public presentation and oral defense of the dissertation serve as the final examination in partial completion of the requirements for the PhD degree. Distinguished scientists outside of Rush may 253 be invited as guests of the division to examine the dissertation and to participate in the final oral defense. The dissertation committee examiners recommend whether a student passes the final examination. Medical Physics: Educational Activities In addition to providing educational and research experiences for students in the graduate program, the medical physics faculty members, most of whom hold joint faculty appointments in Rush Medical College, teach medical students and other students and residents. Medical Physics: Professional Certification The Medical Physics program provides the basis for certification as a radiological physicist by the American Board of Radiology. Medical Physics: Career Opportunities Medical physics applies the concepts, methods and forces of physics to the diagnosis and treatment of human disease. Medical physicists work at the forefront of medical science, often in hospitals with or without associated academic pro- grams. They provide clinical physics services, carry out research, give direct assistance to their medical colleagues and help train future medical physicists, resident physicians, medical students and medical technologists. Medical Physics: Graduation Requirements Master of Science, Major in Radiological Sciences A minimum of 48 hours of required courses, including research, is required for the Master of Science degree with a major in radiological sciences. Of these, a minimum of 14 hours of medi - cal physics courses, excluding research, is required. A minor is not necessary in this program. Students must maintain a minimum GPA of 3.0. The maximum amount of medical physics credit acceptable for transfer from another institution is 12 semester hours. There is no foreign language requirement. The time limit for completing the program is five years. Doctor of Philosophy A minimum of 32 semester hours of medical physics courses (including research) must be completed successfully. A total of 72 semester hours of academic credit are required for the PhD degree. A maximum of 28 semester hours of transfer credit will be accepted. There is no foreign language requirement. Medical Physics: Research Activities Study of basic mechanisms by which radiation transfers energy to biological and chemical materials Development of new techniques for directing and measuring various radiations used in the detection, diagnosis and treat- ment of cancer Application of radioactive tracers to diagnosis and to the study of metabolic processes Optimization of physical parameters for diagnostic medical imaging including radiography, computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and radionuclide imaging. Optimization of treatment plans for cancer radiotherapy Incorporation of biological models in radiation treatment planning Radiation beam modulation and image guidance applications in radiation therapy Motion management in patients receiving imaging or radia - tion therapy procedures Molecular Biophysics & Physiology: Philosophy The program of the graduate Division of Molecular Biophysics and Physiology provides state-of-the-art training in the most quantitatively oriented areas of modern physiology and biophys- ics. To this end, a limited number of students are invited to join particular research laboratories as pre-doctoral fellows, and most of the training occurs in this setting. The sole goal of the faculty is excellence in research, and it expects to develop a nucleus of students who will become future leaders in the field. Molecular Biophysics & Physiology: Admission Requirements Students who desire to specialize in this program are strongly advised to obtain a broad scientific foundation, including work in the related sciences. Courses in some or all of the following fields are suggested for attainment of this objective: physics, including electronics; chemistry, including physical chemistry; mathematics, including differential equations; molecular and cell biology or cell physiology. An applicant who holds a degree from an accredited institution will be considered for admission on the basis of the following criteria: 254 1. An undergraduate record of superior quality demonstrating proficiency in quantitative science 2. A well-organized plan for graduate study and research com- patible with expertise in the division 3. Recommendations from at least three college faculty mem- bers acquainted with the character of the applicant 4. Ability to function in a program stressing an independent approach to the acquisition of knowledge 5. Other materials required by the division director The Graduate Record Examination (GRE) is strongly recom- mended but is not required. Except in unusual cases, the mini- mum prerequisites for admission will be the attainment by the applicant of a 3.0 overall average (A = 4.0) in undergraduate studies with a 3.5 average in science courses, preferably includ- ing two years of physics or engineering, inorganic and organic chemistry, physical chemistry, advanced calculus, ordinary differential equations, cell biology or cell physiology. Applicants for admission to the division will be initially evaluated by the division director and advisory committee. Considerations will include overall academic record, evidence of previous ability to successfully pursue independent studies, recommendations of the applicant's undergraduate faculty, and the description of the applicant's scientific research interests. The division director will determine whether additional supporting evidence would aid evaluation of the application and, if so, will make appropriate arrangements with the applicant to submit such evidence. Applications judged by the division director to demonstrate sat- isfactory credentials and interests compatible with the research facilities of the faculty will then be evaluated by all faculty members with expertise in the area(s) of interest of the appli-cant. Considerations in this phase will include not only academic ability but also the resources available to support research in the indicated area. An interview may be requested. Selection of applicants will be by invitation of a faculty member in the division willing and able to serve as the student's principal advisor and research sponsor after endorsement of the selection by the division director, The Graduate College Council, and the dean. In special circumstances, exceptions to this procedure may be made for students with unusual promise but with no firm commitment to a particular area of research. In such cases, the program director will serve as interim principal advisor. Finally, in the case that the division director would be the principal advisor of a student, the physiology department chairperson shall assume the duties of division director with respect to that student.Molecular Biophysics & Physiology: Curriculum Usually prior to starting the program, students will have selected a faculty member as principal advisor. All students admitted to the division will be required to enroll in the medical physiol- ogy course as soon as possible after admission and before the dissertation proposal and obtain an average grade of \"B\" or better over all semesters. The student will\u2014in the first two years\u2014enroll in courses appropriate to the student's research interests as agreed upon in consultation with the principal advi- sor and the director of the graduate program. It is anticipated that courses deemed essential to the student's graduate training by the division occasionally will not be available in the Division of Molecular Biophysics and Physiology or other divisions of The Graduate College. In this case, arrangements will be made for the student to enroll in such courses at other institutions, and performance in these courses will be required to be at the same level as for courses at Rush. In certain circumstances, a program of supervised independent study may be recommended as an alternative to particular coursework. Individual course require- ments may be exempted on the basis of a past academic record or by the successful completion of a special examination cover - ing the content of the required course. Such exemptions will not be made automatically solely on the basis of a past academic history but will be judged on an individual basis by the division director and advisory committee. Unless waived, students will enroll in eight credit hours of coursework outside the Division of Molecular Biophysics and Physiology. Course Offerings The following courses will be available, subject to demand and limitation, to students within The Graduate College: PHY-451 Physiology I PHY-452 Physiology II PHY-501 Medical Physiology IPHY-502 Medical Physiology II PHY-503 Physiology of Striated Muscle PHY-505 Introductory Membrane BiophysicsPHY-511 Graduate Physiology IPHY 512 Graduate Physiology II PHY-521 Mathematical Methods for Physiologists PHY-524 Linear Differential Equations and Transform MethodsPHY 533 Programming Numerical MethodsPHY-590 Special Topics in Physiology 255 PHY-598 Introduction to Physiology Research PHY-640 Applied Electrophysiology PHY-651 Advanced Topics in Muscle Physiology PHY-690 Research Topics in Physiology PHY-699 Dissertation Research in PhysiologyMolecular Biophysics & Physiology: Dissertation Process Dissertation Proposal Upon admission to the division, the student and his or her principal advisor will begin to make preparations for a proposal upon which the student's original research project will be based. Such preparations will include intensive study of the literature in the student's field of interest, instruction in the basic labora- tory skills necessary for professional development in the field, and any other requirements established by the principal advisor and division director in addition to the course requirements discussed above. No later than 36 months after admission, the candidate will present to his or her dissertation committee an original proposal for contribution to knowledge in his or her area of specialization. It will include an extensive review of the relevant scientific literature, a description of the technical aspects of the proposed studies, an outline of the anticipated experimental approach to the major problem of interest and a discussion of possible results and their interpretation. The student will be expected to defend both his or her proposal and general ability to achieve professional competence before this committee. The dissertation committee will have at least three members: the principal advisor; the division director; and when - ever possible, an individual outside the institution with national stature in the candidate's field of interest, selected jointly by the candidate, Principal Advisor and Division Director. In addi-tion to evaluating the content of the dissertation proposal, the outside member will have a responsibility to maintain close and frequent contact with the student and principal advisor and to advise the division director concerning the progress of the aca- demic program. Ordinarily, the Dissertation Committee will be constituted as soon as possible after admission of a student to the division. The dissertation proposal may be submitted to the faculty prior to completion of course requirements in order to enable research activity to begin, but the student will not be for - mally admitted to candidacy until this is satisfactorily completed. Candidacy Upon acceptance of the dissertation proposal, the student will be admitted to doctoral candidacy and will be expected to devote fully his or her energies to the program. All students must meet a minimum residency requirement of one calendar year, following admission to candidacy, unless the Division Director and Dean grant special exceptions. The Principal Advisor will make frequent reports to the Division Director concerning the student's progress. Should either faculty member or the candidate feel it appropriate, the Dissertation Committee can be called into session to judge the student's continued participation in the graduate program or to determine possible alterations in the area of his or her research efforts. In addition, the student and Principal Advisor will be expected to consult periodically with the other committee members, who may also request the Division Director to call formal meetings of the Dissertation Committee. Conflicts between the student and/or any members of the Dissertation Committee not resolvable by the full commit - tee may be referred to the Advisory Committee of the division or higher authority as specified in the policies and procedures of The Graduate College. The degree of Doctor of Philosophy is given in recognition of high attainment and ability in a particu- lar field of scientific research as evidenced by submission of a dissertation showing power of independent investigation and forming an actual contribution to existing knowledge. Such dissertation will be submitted to the candidate's dissertation committee for review and defended orally at least three months before the degree is granted. The dissertation committee will ordinarily request an evaluation of the candidate's disserta- tion by a scientist of national stature not affiliated with Rush University. Acceptance of the dissertation by the dissertation committee will be reviewed by The Graduate College Council and the Dean, along with the candidate's entire academic per - formance in The Graduate College. Determination of completion of all requirements will result in the Dean's recommendation that the degree be awarded. Should the candidate not have submitted a dissertation three years after admission to candi- dacy, the dissertation committee will be convened to evaluate the candidate's progress, and if proper, to suggest alteration in the program. Molecular Biophysics & Physiology: Research Activities Theoretical Descriptions of Membrane Ion Channels: Robert S. Eisenberg works on the mechanisms of selectivity and permeation in ion channels. Ion channels are proteins with a hole down their middle that control a large fraction of the functions of life. Once open, spherical ions like sodium, potas-sium, calcium and chloride move through them by electro-diffu- sion. Dr. Eisensberg applies modern theories of ionic solutions to simple models of ion channels, using a variety of mathematical 256 methods, from classical Metropolis Monte Carlo to modern methods of variational calculus, the energetic variational meth- ods used in the theory of complex fluids. These simple models have been able to reproduce the selectivity properties of the calcium channels of the heart and of the sodium channels of nerve with the same set of parameters, using the (unchanging) crystal radii of ions. Current voltage relations are just now being calculated and there are signs that at least some of the proper - ties of transporters and of (spontaneous) gating may emerge from models of this sort, without explicit structural changes. Dirk Gillespie uses theories of liquids (like density functional theory, DFT) to model ion movement. All projects have a very close relationship with experimental groups that provide data and test the models' predictions. Of particular interest are: Ryanodine receptor (RyR) and L-type calcium channels in muscle, which are involved in initiating muscle contraction, to understand how ions move through these pores (permeation) and why some kinds of ions are preferentially conducted (selectivity). The physiological consequences of these mecha-nisms (and their disruption in disease states) are also studied. Ca2 +-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) in which the Ca2+ released by one RyR opens neighboring RyRs, who in turn open other RyRs. The goal is to understand the mechanism of CICR, the mechanism for stopping CICR, and changes in CICR during disease states Understanding and developing new nonbiological nanofluidic devices, devices that move electrolytes through nanometer-sized pores in manmade materials to create current. The goal is to understand their physics and to predict new unique device properties for future applications. This lab is best suited for those with a background in physics and math who are interested in using, developing or imple- menting new modeling techniques, within an environment of collaboration with both theorists and experimentalists.

The main interest of Tom DeCoursey's laboratory over the past decade has been in two molecules that reside in the membranes of white blood cells. These are proton channels and NADPH oxidase. Both play vital roles in white blood cells when these cells kill bacteria and other microbial invaders. When NADPH oxidase does not work, white cells cannot kill many types of bacteria. Patients afflicted with hereditary chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) lack this enzyme, and if not treated often die in childhood of recurrent infections. Dr. DeCoursey's laboratory has shown that inhibiting proton channels prevents NADPH oxidase from working (DeCoursey et al, 2003, Nature 422:531-534) and that this results from the effects of proton channels on membrane potential and pH (Morgan et al, 2009, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA 106:18022-18027). They found that in human basophils, inhibiting proton channels prevents histamine release (Musset et al., 2008, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA 105:11020-11025). Others found that proton channels control sperm maturation. The DeCoursey laboratory continues to investigate roles played by proton channels in a variety of cells, such as B lymphocytes (Capasso et al, 2010, Nature Immunol. 11:265-272). They recently discovered a new proton channel gene in a dinoflagel-late, which triggers the bioluminescent flash produced by these creatures when seawater is disturbed at night (Smith et al, 2011, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA 108:18162-18168). Another focus of their current research is understanding how the proton channel works on a molecular scale. Because the proton channel gene was identified only in 2006, much work remains to be done. They design mutations to the protein, express the mutant channels in cultured cells and then record electrically from the cells to determine how the mutation affected the function of the molecule. For example, they found that the regulation of channel activity by phosphorylation occurs at a specific threonine residue in the intracellular part of the channel (Musset et al, 2010, J. Biol. Chem. 285:5117-5121). The figure shows how they believe the proton channel dimer is assembled (Musset et al, 2010, J. Physiol. 588:1435-1449). Very recently, this laboratory identified the \"selectivity filter\" of the human proton channel (the part that allows only H+ and no other ions to go through the channel) (Musset et al, 2011, Nature, 480:273-277). Viral Fusion. Viruses deposit their genetic material into cells by fusing to membranes, initiating infection. Some viruses fuse directly to plasma membranes and others are internalized into endosomes where low pH triggers fusion. In both cases, the nucleocapsid leaves the viral interior by moving through the fusion pore into cytosol. Without fusion, the virion cannot infect the cell. There are three classes of viral fusion proteins. All types of viruses that utilize class II or class III proteins initiate infection by fusing from within endosomes. Fredric Cohen's 257 laboratory has found that fusion induced by class II and class III viral proteins (but not class I) is dependent on the voltage across the target membrane [refs]. If the voltage across an endosomal membrane was pharmacologically controlled, infection may be prevented. Furthermore, the similarity in structure of all class II proteins and the similarity between all class III proteins suggests that identifying a voltage sensor for one virus of a class should readily yield the sensor for many. The Cohen laboratory has also found that viral fusion mediated by class II or class III proteins varies with redox potentials, but fusion mediated by class I proteins do not. The range of values of redox potentials within interiors of endosomes differs for different types of endosomes. Variation of redox potentials can provide an important con- trol for conformational changes of viral fusion proteins within endosomes. This has both conceptual and practical ramifications. Not all viruses within endosomes fuse and even a particular type of virus can enter cells through multiple endosomal pathways. The variation in redox potentials for endosomes of different pathways would account, at least in part, for variations in fusion and infectivity of virus within endosomes. This laboratory is pur - suing the mechanisms by which membrane potentials and redox potentials regulate fusion and are characterizing how these two cellular controls of membrane fusion interact to guide fusion. Membrane Cholesterol. Since so much of cellular biology in both health and disease is sensitive to cholesterol levels, experimentalists often measure cholesterol concentration under a wide variety of conditions. But from a physical point of view, the free energy of a system is the fundamental parameter that quantifies the tendency of a molecule to transfer from one state (or phase) to another. If each molecule is independent of all oth - ers, exhibiting zero interactions, the free energy is a function of the molecules' concentrations. But for real materials, interactions between molecules alter the tendency to exchange between states. The free energy of transfer is then a function of the molecules' \"activity,\" a thermodynamic parameter that accounts for interactions and that is an \"effective concentration.\" Determining activity allows one to infer the strength of molecu- lar interactions. Although the difference between concentration and activity is a basic textbook distinction, a convenient and reliable method to measure cholesterol activity had not been developed. Fredric Cohen's laboratory has now overcome this limitation, allowing us to thermodynamically characterize the dynamics of membrane cholesterol levels in living cells during physiological processes. This laboratory is currently investigat- ing the changes in membrane cholesterol that occur during two important biological processes: cell proliferation stimulated by activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and glucose uptake into cells as regulated by insulin. Their work demonstrates that activation of a signaling cascade leads to changes in cholesterol activity and that these changes in cho- lesterol activity negatively feedbacks on the signaling cascades, providing a mechanism for cellular homeostasis. Regulation of Intracellular Calcium: Eduardo Rios studies the workings of muscles, including skel-etal and cardiac. The goal of this laboratory is to understand the cellular function of excitation-contraction (EC) coupling in terms of fundamental mechanisms. EC coupling translates electrical changes at the cell membrane to signals coded as increase in cytosolic [Ca2 +], signals that result in muscle contraction. The mouse deploys extremely rapid calcium signals in its muscles, made possible by fast opening and closing of molecular chan- nels that allow calcium to cross the walls of its cellular stores. In a working human, this gating is also very fast. But too much calcium may have unintended consequences, as it can become a signal that literally tells cells to start dying. So, the stability and health of muscle and other cells that \"calcium-signal\" is precarious, based on delicately tuned controls that must be as good at opening as closing channels to terminate the signal. The Rios laboratory has helped define the key molecular players in these functions. They use the mouse to study Ca2 + controls, comparing their operation and mechanisms in the healthy cell and in mice that have molecular abnormalities that copy human disease. The information and implications derived from these studies may apply to similar alterations in the heart, which lead to an irregular beat and may cause sudden death. Calcium signals also rule brain function, gut movements and blood pres- sure. This laboratory's work has contributed and should continue contributing to the understanding of these functions and their diseases. Thomas Shannon is interested in ionic channels, voltage gated ionic channels, fluorescence signal detection and electrophysiol- ogy, particularly as they relate to excitation-contraction coupling in striated muscle. Dr. Shannon uses multiple biochemical and biophysical approaches to study the control of the load of calcium in the storage organelle (the sarcoplasmic reticulum) of normal and abnormal cells of the heart. He has demonstrated on beating heart cells that the load in the normal sarcoplasmic reticulum is released partially to the cytosol in the process of a heart beat. Quantitative determination of these released fractions will allow him to understand the mutual interactions of Ca load (i.e., sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca concentration) and Ca release, and thus the control of contractile force, an impor - tant determinant of cardiac ejection (blood flow) in health and disease. For instance, Dr. Shannon has also demonstrated that the SR Ca load is reduced during heart failure and his research 258 suggests that this reduction may be a critical factor in causing reduced cardiac contraction in this condition. Ongoing experi- ments are aimed at determining what causes this reduced SR Ca load. The research program led by Lothar A. Blatter focuses on the role of calcium ions for the regulation of cellular functions in the cardiovascular system. On the one hand they investigate, at the cellular and subcellular levels, through which pathways and mechanisms calcium itself is regulated in cellular compartments such as the cytosol, the nucleus, the sarcoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. On the other hand they study how specific changes in cellular calcium concentrations control functions of cardiac myocytes and vascular endothelial cells. Of particular interests in cardiac cells are the regulation of calcium during excitation-contraction coupling, i.e., the rhythmic elevations of calcium that lead to contraction with every heartbeat, and in excitation-transcription coupling where this laboratory investi- gates the sources and specific roles of calcium for the activation of transcriptions factors (such as NFAT) that are involved in pathological cardiac remodeling. They are further interested in studying the specific changes in calcium signaling that occur in the diseased heart, i.e., in cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure and arrhythmias. In vascular endothelial cells we are interested in the interplay between calcium signaling and the genera-tion of nitric oxide, an important endothelium-derived relaxing factor through which the vascular endothelium contributes to the control of blood flow and blood pressure. In both tissue types, an important area of research centers around the role of mitochondria for cardiovascular function. This research inves- tigates the contribution of mitochondria to the regulation of cytosolic calcium concentration through its capability of storing and releasing calcium ions, but also the role of calcium ions for the regulation of mitochondrial functions, including energy metabolism and ATP production, regulation of mitochondrial channels such as the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, and control of the cellular redox state and protection against oxidative stress. For the study of these signaling processes and pathways this laboratory employs a wide palette of methodolog-ical approaches, ranging from high resolution confocal imaging using a large spectrum of fluorescent probes, to electrophysiol- ogy (patch clamp and lipid bilayer single channel recordings), photolysis of caged compounds, molecular biology and bio- chemical approaches, to the use of transgenic animals Michael Fill focuses on defining the mechanisms that con- trol intracellular calcium signaling in excitable cells. They are particularly interested in the origin/control of local intracellular calcium signals generated by ryanodine receptor (RyR) channels. RyR channels are found in almost all cells and modulate cellular processes as diverse as contraction, secretion, synaptic transmis - sion and transcription. However, most of this laboratory's studies have focused on single RyR local control in mammalian striated muscle, where RyRs are found in abundance. Their research has delineated fundamental biophysical mechanisms important to normal or pathological muscle function. They generally apply a multiscale experimental approach that is best illustrated by their published works. Some recent works are listed below. Qin et al.

Neurosciences: Philosophy The Division of Neurosciences of The Graduate College offers interdisciplinary education in the field of neuroscience at the doctoral level to prepare students for careers in teaching and research. The program is one of the few in the country that emphasizes disease oriented basic neuroscience and is funded by an NIH Training Grant. The diversity of interest and exper - tise among the faculty of the division provides students with educational and research opportunities in neurophysiology, neuroanatomy, behavioral neuroscience, neuroimaging, neuro-pharmacology, neurochemistry, cell and molecular biology\u2014all of which are important for the understanding of the functions of the intact and diseased central nervous system. The resources at Rush and in the Department of Neurological Sciences allow stu- dents the unique opportunity to carry out independent research on the basic neurobiological substrates of various neurological disorders. Neurosciences: Admission Requirements Designed for students interested in teaching and interdisciplin-ary research careers in the neurosciences, the program also accepts students with an undergraduate or medical degree as well as other professional students wishing to pursue graduate study. Students are admitted for entry during the fall semester 259 of a given academic year. Applicants for admission are evalu - ated by an admissions committee chaired by the Director of the Division. Candidates are required to provide three letters of recommendation written by individuals who know them aca-demically. Consideration for admission includes the applicant's overall academic record, the quality of the recommendations, his or her motivation and ability to pursue independent studies and the description of the applicant's scientific research interests. Minimal admission criteria to the program are consistent with the general requirements of The Graduate College and include competitive scores on the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) and a grade point average of at least 3.0 on a 4.0 scale. Neurosciences: Curriculum The program is preceptor-based. The study and research sched-ule outlined below should be completed within four to five years of full-time study beyond the bachelor's degree. The program follows the minimal residence requirement established by The Graduate College. During the first two years, students are expected to complete required coursework (and any deficien- cies). First-year required courses consist of The Graduate College Core curriculum courses, the Rush Medical College Medical Neurobiology (NEU-502) course and Introduction to Physiology/Pharmacology (PHR-504). Graduate students are expected to receive a grade of at least \"B\" in these courses. In the fall term of the second year of study, all students are required to enroll in and pass a statistics and experimental design course (NEU-544). During the first two years of study, students rotate through vari- ous laboratories involved in the program and learn techniques commonly in use in neuroscience laboratories. The requirement is mastery of four techniques outside any of those used by the student in his or her research. The major required course in the second year of study is an Advanced Neuroscience Proseminar (NEU-591) taught jointly by participating faculty. A seminar format is used that encourages extensive discussion and student participation. A course titled \"Selected Topics in Neuroscience\" (NEU-690) is available to advanced students (in their third or fourth year of residence) for credit. The offerings in this course change from year to year depending on demand and interest, and the course is taught by different faculty members. In addi- tion to coursework, students are encouraged to participate in and carry out independent research in their first two years of residence. Required courses in the first two years of study are: Year 1 Cr edits Fall Semester GCC-501 Molecular Biology: Genome to Proteome 2 GCC-502 Cellular Biochemistry: Proteins, 2 T ransport and Signaling GCC-511 Readings in Molecular Biology 1 GCC-512 Readings in Cellular Biology 1 GCC-520 Introduction to Physiology/Pharmacology I 3 NEU-598 Pre-dissertation Research 1-9 Spring Semester GCC-503 Functional Cell Biology 1 GCC-504 Functional T issue Biology 2 GCC-506 Biomedical Ethics 1 GCC-513 Readings in Functional Cell Biology 1 GCC-514 Readings in Functional Tissue Biology 1 GCC-507 Medical Research Str ategies 2 GCC-508 2 NEU-598 Pre-dissertation Research 1-9 Year 2 Cr edits Fall Semester NEU-511 T echniques in Neuroscience 2 NEU-544 Statistics Academic Policies Students are required to pass a combination of written and oral comprehensive examinations toward the end of the second year and after completion of the required coursework. Students fail- ing the comprehensive examinations are given a second chance three months later. A second failure results in termination. Throughout the first two years of required coursework, students whose grade point average falls below a \"B\" (3.0) will be placed on academic probation. If a student fails to remedy this average, he or she will be asked to withdraw from the program. A student who completes the comprehensive examinations successfully is admitted to candidacy and qualifies for the doctoral dissertation proposal defense. Students choose a preceptor to supervise their research during the first year of residence. The preceptor and the student gather an advisory committee that is chaired by a core faculty member of the program and includes the preceptor and four other members, two from within the program, one from another division within the institution, and one neuroscientist from another institution. The thesis proposal should be in the format of an NIH RO1 grant application and will be defended before the advisory committee. The rest of the student's time in residence is spent on the doctoral dissertation research. Each student dissertation is evaluated by a neuroscientist from another institution who is an expert in the specific area of research. Graduate College/Rush University Academic Policies Academic policies specific to The Graduate College are located earlier in this catalog. In addition, the Academic Resources and Policies section of this catalog contains Rush University academic policies. Neurosciences: Research Activities The background and expertise of the faculty cover a broad range of fields within the neurosciences such as behavioral and cogni- tive neuroscience, neuroimaging, neurophysiology, neuroanat- omy, neuropsychopharmacology, cell and molecular biology, etc. Research among the faculty is especially strong in the follow- ing areas: transplantation and regeneration; gene therapy, the neurobiological bases of normal memory and of its dysfunction; aging; the neurobiological bases of degenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease; multiple sclerosis; and the pathophysiology of epilepsy. Thus, depending on interest, numerous interdisciplinary research areas are available to the student. Nursing Science (PhD) Please see the College of Nursing section of the catalog for the full program description.Pharmacology: Philosophy The Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) and Master of Science (MS) pro- grams offer training in pharmacology and biomedical research. The Division of Pharmacology believes that a sound training in medical pharmacology and cell biology should be integral to a pharmacology research degree and students are trained in both disciplines in the first year. A student then does research in a selected area of biomedical sciences. During the course of the research, emphasis is placed on developing the student's under - standing and communication of research. Master's students complete all coursework and research in two years and submit a thesis. Graduates of the master's program have the skills necessary to work in laboratories both in aca - demia and industry, and have a fundamentally sound knowledge of Pharmacology. The vast majority of MS graduates find job opportunities or successfully matriculate in advanced training programs within three months of graduation. For PhD students, the research in the first two years is aimed at developing a novel research proposal. PhD students continue research over the next three years and are required to complete a dissertation and publish novel scientific findings in peer-reviewed journals with at least one first author manuscript submitted by the student. The ultimate outcome of the PhD research experi-ence is the development of an independent investigator who has the necessary scientific skills and credentials to pursue a career in either an industrial or academic setting. Pharmacology: Admission Requirements Applicants must enter the program in the fall semester in order to begin the required coursework in the core curriculum. The deadline for submission of applications is generally March 1. International applications can be accepted after March 1 but must take into consideration the delays associated with the necessary visa arrangements. In addition to the basic require-ments established by The Graduate College, the division has the following requirements for admission to its program: The baccalaureate degree from an accredited college should include a background in biological, physical or quantitative sciences. Coursework in biology, cellular biology, molecular biology, physics, chemistry, organic chemistry, physical chemistry and mathematics, including calculus, is highly recommended. Upper-level biochemistry or physiology courses are also highly recommended. The Graduate College requires academic transcripts from all baccalaureate and post-baccalaureate educational 261 experiences. These should provide a minimal grade point average of 3.0 overall (A = 4.0). The pharmacology admission committee also looks for higher grades in science courses and evidence of research experience. Competition for PhD candi-dates is significantly higher. The Graduate College requires all graduate students to take the GRE examinations, and scores on these tests are considered by the admission committee. All applicants whose native language is not English are required to take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). Applicants from foreign countries must have their transcripts evaluated by an independent agency (i.e., ECE and WES). As required by T he Graduate College, a clear, concise expres - sion of the applicant's interests and goals needs to be included as an essay in their application. Identifying a particular area of interest within the field of pharmacology is very helpful in identifying potential laboratories for the students. The Graduate College requires three letters of recommenda - tion and it is recommended that they be from science faculty who can evaluate the character of the applicant, their aca-demic and research performance, and their ability to think and work independently. The Division Director and the Admissions Committee evalu- ate applications. All prior academic experience and the letters of recommendation will be evaluated for an indication of the applicant's potential for success as a graduate student and future independent investigator. The statement by the applicant describing goals and motivation will be studied to determine the compatibility between the applicant's requirements and the capabilities of the graduate program. With rare exceptions, PhD applicants will be required to appear for an interview with faculty members before admission to the program. Students applying for the master's program will meet the same set of minimum standards as those applying for the doctoral program. Students applying for the master's program are encour - aged to visit the Department, although a formal interview is not required. The number of faculty available to mentor the student's research limits acceptance into both the master's and doctoral programs. Students are therefore encouraged to apply early. Students enter - ing the master's program will not be eligible for stipends and must pay tuition. Acceptance into the doctoral program is limited by the availability of faculty and also by the availability of stipends. All accepted doctoral students receive a competitive stipend and tuition schol-arship. The stipend and tuition scholarship is renewed each year providing the student is making satisfactory progress towards the degree.Pharmacology: Curriculum When the applicant enters the program, a research advisor is assigned, and the student begins directed research on an active project. In the first two semesters, there is minimal research as classroom studies are emphasized. During these terms, both mas-ter's and doctoral Graduate College students take the Graduate Core Curriculum (GCC) classes and required pharmacology (PHR) courses. The summer term is devoted to laboratory research. Research and advanced pharmacology courses provide the core of the second-year studies. For the master's and doctoral students, the research experience differs in the second year. The master's students are involved in a directed research project, while the doctoral students are developing a novel research project. A typical course sequence is described as follows: Year 1 Cr edits Fall Semester GCC501/511* /Physiology I 3 BTN 525 Experimental Design & Models of Disease 2 Spring Semester GCC 503/513* Functional Cell Biology 1/1 GCC 504/514* (2) Functional Tissue Biology 2/1 GCC 506 Research Ethics 1 GCC 507 Biomedical Statistics 2 GCC 521 Introduction to Physiology and 3 Pharmacology II PHR 691 Seminar in Pharmacology 1 PHR 598 Research in Pharmacology 1 Summer Term PHR 598 Research in Pharmacology 9 Year 2 Fall Semester PHR 593 Introduction to Grantsmanship 1 PHR 595 Readings 1 PHR 691 Seminar in Pharmacology 1 PHR 563 Advanced Concepts in Pharmacology 3 PHR 598 Research in Pharmacology 6 Spring Semester GCC 508 Writing Practicum 2 PHR 594 Structure, Function and Pharmacology 3 of Cell Receptors PHR 595 Readings in Pharmacology 1 PHR 691 Seminar 1 PHR 598 Research in Pharmacology 5262 GCC = Graduate Core Curriculum - These classes are taken by Master's and Ph.D. students from a variety of different Graduate College Programs.

BTN = Biotechnology course- Taken with the Biotechnology students, serves as an introduction to experimental design and models of Disease PHR = Pharmacology specific courses. For doctoral students, the emphasis is on research in years three through five and a typical registration is as listed below. While registrations appear similar in years three through five, the nature and character of the research changes and the student passes through a number of steps towards completing his or her doctoral degree. * Electives may be selected from any graduate program at Rush and also may be taken through a consortium with other uni - versities. Approval of mentor is necessary. A total of 9 semester hours of elective credit is required. Electives may be taken as pass/no-pass or for a letter grade. Special topics courses or Readings courses are offered by faculty to assist the student in developing their expertise in a particular area. These courses count towards the student's elective requirements. These courses maybe developed by the faculty for a particular student to address an area of knowledge needed for their development, or can be open for a wider audience. The Division of Pharmacology reserves the right to revise courses and the student may be required to take the replacement courses. Such a requirement would not apply to students who have already taken a course.Minimal Credit Hours Required for MS and PhD Degrees Typically, the 53 credit hours accumulated in the five semesters listed above are necessary for the completion of a Master of Science (MS) degree. However, a student with advanced training in a related field may complete the MS degree by completing one year of study (36 semester hours). For example, this option is available to individuals with advanced degrees who wish to develop research skills. Such applicants have already covered many of topics in the GCC courses and may have taken medical pharmacology courses. These applicants will spend the bulk of their time on research, and take research-related courses (e.g., Medical Research Strategies, Writing Practicum, seminars and advanced pharmacology courses, etc.) provided the faculty waive didactic requirements. The doctoral degree is generally completed within five years. Advanced students entering with a master's (MS) degree in pharmacology or a doctor of medicine (MD) degree may have classes in the first two years waived based on their prior record. The degree may then be completed in a shorter time providing the student progresses through the process outlined below. The advanced student must be enrolled full-time at Rush University for at least two academic years, including one summer for a total of 63 credit hours. All MS and PhD students must be enrolled at Rush in the semester they graduate. Pharmacology: Thesis/Dissertation Program Progression Master's Program Research Overview During the summer of the first year, the student selects a research project in conjunction with a faculty mentor. The research project is designed to advance knowledge in a specific discipline and to yield a scientific publication for the student. With approval by the Program Director, a student may write a scholarly work in lieu of a research project, in which case a committee must still be formed to oversee the work and a public presentation of that work must be given. Academic Advisor/Principal Advisor The graduate division director functions as the academic advisor to the student during the first year. The Program Director deter - mines the course schedule and monitors the student's progress. In the summer, a principal advisor or mentor is selected from the faculty of the Division of Pharmacology. The advisor then accepts the supervisory role in the development of the student as a scientific investigator.Years 3 through 5 PHR-590 Special Topics in Pharmacology OR PHR 595 Readings in Pharmacology Variable OR other Elective* PHR-691 Pharmacology Seminar 1 PHR-699 Dissertation Research 8263 Thesis Research The advisor will work with the student to develop a research project that can be completed within the framework of the program. The student together with the advisor will form a thesis committee comprised of three members: the advisor (who must be a member of the Graduate College) and two readers. The readers will assure the quality of the document. In addition, the director of the Pharmacology graduate division and the chair of the Pharmacology department are ex-officio members of all thesis committees. The director of the graduate program and the chair of Pharmacology may also serve as committee members (readers) if asked, or as an advisor if mentoring the student. Master's Thesis A written thesis, describing work accomplished, is required to be completed by all master's students by the end of the second year. The Thesis Committee reviews the thesis. The thesis is presented to the University community in an open meeting at the conclusion of the training period. The thesis may or may not reflect original work. However, original work that is published in peer-reviewed journals is a goal. Upon completion of the thesis, the student will present the findings in a public forum open to the University. At least two member of the committee that includes the student's advisor must sign off on the thesis. Following the approval of the Thesis Committee, the Program Director must certify the completion of the thesis and all require - ments for the MS degree. The Director of the Library of Rush University Medical Center must then approve the formatting of thesis before its acceptance by the Library of Rush University. Completion of the Degree The Office of the Registrar must be notified of impending com- pletion of the degree by submission of an Intent to Graduate form at the beginning of the final term. As the thesis is reach- ing final form, the student should consult with the University Librarian to assure that the Thesis will be formatted correctly. Upon Thesis approval, the student completes a final checklist to assure the necessary approvals. During this time you will be required to have an exit interview and provide us with feedback concerning your experience here at Rush University. PhD Program Research Overview During the first and second years, the student selects a research project in conjunction with a faculty mentor. The student and mentor then select a committee of faculty to guide the student's research activities. This committee approves the proposed research project and determines when the student has com-pleted his or her dissertation. The research project is designed to advance knowledge in a specific discipline and to yield \"first-author\" scientific publications for the student. Research intern- ships at pharmaceutical companies may also be available to the students and are designed to enhance the research activities of the student. Academic Advisor/Principal Advisor The graduate division director functions as the academic advi- sor to the student during the first year. The director during this time determines the course schedule with the student and monitors the student's progress. Beginning in the first year, the student is expected to gain laboratory experience. This activity is intended to lead to the definition of research interests and to the selection of a principal advisor or mentor from the faculty of the Division of Pharmacology. The advisor then accepts the supervisory role in the development of the student as a scientific investigator. Qualifying Exams By the end of June of the second year, the student will be expected to take the qualifying exams. Written exams will last two full days and cover all aspects of the basic principles of pharmacology through essay questions provided by the faculty. Each exam question may be graded by multiple faculty members and reviewed by a faculty committee. Passing the comprehen- sive exam allows the student to move on to the research phase. Dissertation Research Committee After passing qualifying exams, the student and mentor select a research committee. This committee advises the student and evaluates the dissertation. The Graduate College requires that the committee includes the student's mentor/advisor and at least one other member of the Division of Pharmacology. It is also mandatory that there be one outside faculty member from either another Rush department or other institution. We require that a majority of the members of the five-member committee be faculty at Rush who are members of The Graduate College. The chair of this committee, who cannot be the student's men- tor/advisor, will be chosen at the first committee meeting and will preside at all subsequent meetings and arrange for a timely completion of the dissertation work. The dissertation commit- tee strives for consensus in all its actions. A majority vote of the committee's membership, however, is sufficient for all activities except the final approval of the dissertation. In addition to the five committee members, the Director of the Pharmacology Graduate Division, and/or the Chair of the Pharmacology Department serve as ex officio members of the committee. Ex officio members can participate in the meetings but cannot vote. However, either The Chair of Pharmacology or 264 the Division Director is eligible to be selected to the five-person committee as full members of the committee and can vote in this circumstance. Dissertation Proposal and Presentation The student will propose a publication-grade research project. The research project will include a review of relevant literature, a Specific Aims section that includes clear research goals, a Significance section that includes an evaluation of the poten- tial impact of the project, an Innovation section that includes a discussion of how this proposal departs from the literature and offers a new conceptualizations or methods. The Approach section then details Preliminary Data and proposed experi-ments and methods. A detailed bibliography over all sections is required. The Specific Aims, Significance, Innovation and Approach sections will take the form of an NIH grant application (R-21). The students should follow the NIH grant application guidelines in completing the proposal. The dissertation proposal must be presented at a department seminar and approved by the student's committee. It forms the basis for the student's con- tinued research. The dissertation committee must meet at least twice before the student is considered for graduation. Upon completion of all experiments agreed to by the dissertation com- mittee, the student will present the dissertation to the University in written form (approved by the Director of the Library of Rush University Medical Center) and present the work in a public one- hour lecture attended by the dissertation committee and faculty of the University. The dissertation committee then meets in closed session to approve the dissertation. Typically the meeting immediately follows the public lecture. In line with the rules and procedures of The Graduate College, the committee strives for a consensus, but the dissertation can be approved over the objec-tions of a single committee member. However, if two committee members disapprove the dissertation, then it is not approved. The awarding of the PhD degree requires the demonstration of a capability for independent research and a contribution to scientific knowledge. Completion of the Degree The Office of the Registrar must be notified of impend- ing completion of the degree by submission of an Intent to Graduate form at the beginning of the final term. As the Dissertation is reaching final form, the student should consult with the University Librarian to assure that the Dissertation will be formatted correctly. Upon Dissertation approval, the student completes a final checklist to assure the necessary approvals. During this time the student will be required to have an exit interview and provide the College with feedback concerning his or her experience at Rush University.Pharmacology: Academic Policies To remain in good standing, The Graduate College requires that a student maintain an overall \"B\" average. It is also expected that all grades in required pharmacology courses will be \"B\" or better. Required courses must be taken for a letter grade while other courses may be taken as pass/no pass. Students are expected to attend all classes and spend the appropriate time in the lab. All outside employment is strongly discouraged as it interferes with the time and effort necessary to complete the program. Students are expected to conduct themselves in a professional manner. This includes respecting the rights of others and being kind and courteous to students, faculty/staff and patients. Intimidation of other students and faculty/staff will not be toler - ated and is grounds for dismissal. Sexual harassment as well as harassment related to race, color, religion, sexual orienta- tion, national origin, ancestry, age, marital or parental status, or disability is prohibited. The Rush University Catalog details the policies regarding inclusion of minorities and those with disabilities as wells as the policies and procedures for reporting harassment. Students working with laboratory animals must follow IACUC guidelines and will be subject to disciplinary action in the case of abuse. The Division of Pharmacology follows the University Policies on Academic Honesty and the University Statement on Student Conduct. Students are expected to abide by the Graduate College Honor Code. Student Grievance Procedure Numerous checks are in place to assure the fair treatment of students. For example, a faculty committee reviews the compre- hensive exams. Likewise, the chair of the advisory committee is intended to be a student advocate who must ensure the timely graduation of the student. In addition, a plan for resolving any grievance involving a graduate student in this division is in place. These written procedures are available in the pharmacol- ogy student/faculty handbook and the office of the director. Graduate College/Rush University Academic Policies Academic policies specific to The Graduate College are located earlier in this catalog. In addition, the Academic Resources and Policies section of this catalog contains Rush University academic policies.265 Pharmacology: Doctoral Tuition Scholarship and Stipends All accepted doctoral students receive an assistantship ($25,500 for the 2013-2014 academic year) and a tuition scholarship. The assistantship and tuition scholarship are renewed each year providing the student is making satisfactory progress towards the degree and is not on academic probation. MS students are enrolled on a full-time basis and pay tuition. Pharmacology: Graduation Requirements The student must complete all required courses except for those waived by the Graduate committee and have completed the minimally required course hours as detailed in the curriculum section. For both the master's degree and the doctoral degree, the student's committee must approve the thesis or disserta- tion, respectively, and have the completed document accepted by the Graduate Program Director and the University Librarian. In addition to these requirements, all PhD candidates will be required to attend at least four ethics seminars a year following completion of their first academic year in order to ensure ongo- ing training. Pharmacology: Faculty Research Interests Dr. Animesh Burea is working to establish an early detec- tion tool for ovarian cancer targeting tumor associated neo-angiogenesis, Because it is difficult to study in humans, research is using laying hens\u2014the only widely available spontaneous model of ovarian cancer. Focus is on developing an early detec- tion method based on noninvasive contrast enhanced targeted ultrasound imaging in combination with circulatory and cellular markers of tumor associated neo-angiogenesis. Dr. Xiu-Ti Hu investigates the cellular mechanism of cocaine withdrawal, which is associated with the chronic cocaine-induced neuroadaptations in voltage-gated ion channel function and signaling in the mesocorticolimbic system (as known as the reward pathway), particularly in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) Dr. Judith Luborsky examines immune responses in ovarian autoimmune disease and ovarian cancer in humans and in an animal model with a focus on early events and early detec-tion. Dr. Luborsky is also Director of the Rush Proteomics Core Research Facility. Dr. Hazel Lum investigates mechanisms of inflammatory injury of vascular endothelium, leading to increased permeability and leukocyte extravasation. Specific projects include study of pro-inflammatory lipids such as lysophospholipids and their receptors, signaling intermediates (i.e., Rho GTPases, PKC) and remodeling of endothelial junctional complexes. Dr. Celeste Napier examines changes in the adult mammalian brain that alter motivative behaviors, including those associated with drug addiction. Behavior, electrophysiological and bio-chemical approaches are used in rodent models of the human addict to ascertain neuronal substrates that are altered during this disorder. Dr. Dan Predescu performs research in vascular biology with emphasis on endothelial heterogeneity cellular signaling, signaling to and from cytoskeleton, inter-endothelial commu- nications and endothelial interaction with themselves and with their surroundings. His special interest is on the development and adequate usage of molecular methods, particularly the one related to gene expression and gene activity control. Dr. Sandra Predescu uses cell and molecular biology approaches, imaging techniques and animal models to under - stand the cellular and molecular mechanisms of transendothelial exchanges between the blood plasma and the interstitial fluid in normal and pathological states. Emphasis is on the role of intersectin proteins in regulating caveolae endocytosis and transcytosis in the lung microvasculature, the signaling events that regulate endothelial cell survival, growth and proliferation, vesicular trafficking and actin cytoskeletal remodeling. Dr. John Somberg is interested in cardiovascular pharmacol- ogy with specific interest in drugs that affect the rapid potas- sium channel (IKr). His interests also include chiral separation of drugs and how this affects drug action and the role of the nervous system in facilitating cardiac arrhythmias.
