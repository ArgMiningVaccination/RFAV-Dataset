The Bamford Action Plan (2009-2011) is driving much-nee ded change in how we care for people affected by me ntal health or intellectual disabilities. One in six of our population has a mental health need at any one time, and it is estimated that between 1-2% of our population, t hat is around 24, 000 people, have an intellectual disability. In addition, there are many others who have or will develop dementia in the future. Our highly committed staff who deliver health and s ocial care services have expertise and skills that must be supported by the best up-to-date knowledge. Throug h research, new knowledge is created. But it is no w recognised that, for a variety of reasons, essentia l knowledge does not always reach the people who mo st need to use it. The knowledge can vary from better understanding of the causes of poor mental health or intellectual disabilities through to evidence on wh ich services bring about the greatest improvements to the lives of people or their carers. To bring together this knowledge we have commissioned five Research R eviews. Each Review was written by a team of experts in aca demia, clinical services and care who have collecte d the most up-to-date evidence from research done locally or globally. All of the review teams were based i n Northern Ireland so we know that the Reviews are re levant to our local situation. The quality of each Review has also been assured through input from experts wh o are based in other parts of the UK or internation ally. The priority areas addressed by the Reviews are: Children & Young People including early interventio ns, the needs of looked-after children and the development of resilience; Patient Outcomes including the measurement of recov ery and the capture of patient feedback; Intellectual Disability including the management of challenging behaviours; Psychological Therapies including how to embed thes e in services for children and adults across the lifespan and including those with intellectual disa bility and severe mental health problems; Primary Care including aspects important to the pre vention, recognition and management of mental health in the community. As well as providing accessible knowledge and infor mation, each Review has highlighted gaps in our knowledge. We will commission new research project s aiming to fill those gaps. My final acknowledgement is of contributions made b y local people, patients and their carers who assis ted in the selection of the priority areas covered by the Reviews and provided extremely helpful feedback to the review teams. Some of those people also serve thro ugh their membership of our Bamford Monitoring Grou p. I dedicate these Reviews to the people who are affe cted by mental health or intellectual disabilities. I urge our health and social care staff, education professiona ls, members of voluntary organisations and others t o use these Reviews so that all members of our community may receive the best possible support to live their lives with dignity. Edwin Poots MLA Minister for Health, Social Services and Public Saf ety 1 Executive Summary Introduction The prioritisation of primary care in the Bamford I mplementation Plan recognises the centrality of primary care to mental health service provision. P rimary care has a crucial role to play in ensuring continuity of care for individuals with mental heal th disorders. Given its position as the first point of contact for individuals with mental health disorder s and the gatekeeper to additional and more specialised mental health services and treatments, it is imperative that primary care functions effectively in the recognition and management of me ntal health disorders as well as engaging in preventative interventions. The current review und ertook a focused search of the literature pertaining to primary care and mental health with t he aim of addressing the overall research question: What aspects of primary care are effectiv e in the prevention, recognition and management of mental health issues across the lifes pan; for whom do they work, in what circumstances and why? The full report is presented in six sections which focus on: (A) contextual evidence relating to the current challenge presented by mental health in Nor thern Ireland; (B) the overall methodological approach to the review; (C) key principles of an id eal service model and sub-questions to be addressed; (D) synthesis of review level evidence; (E) comparison of review level evidence with sub- questions and key principles of an ideal model; and (F) concluding comments. Key Findings and Recommendations As outlined in the report, the research team evalua ted literature which indicated guidelines and standards of best practice for the effective provis ion of mental health services in primary care. This process informed the development of key principles of an ideal service model and research sub- questions. In order to address the overall research question and these sub-questions, review level evidence was compared with the identified ideal model. The key findings and recommendation are presented below. Depression and Anxiety Depression, anxiety disorders and mixed anxiety and depression are very common conditions, and consequently take up a considerable proportion of t he working time of primary care practitioners. There is good evidence for the efficacy and effecti veness of a number of interventions for these conditions at the primary care level, though indivi duals who present with more severe symptoms or who fail to respond to treatment ought to be referr ed on to secondary care services. Interventions with an established evidence base whi ch can be implemented at a primary care level include: Guided self-help for individuals with mild depressi on or sub-threshold depression. CCBT (especially Beating the Blues) and CBT to reduce symptoms of depression Structured group physical activity programmes. 2 Mental Health and the Northern Ireland conflict Increased GP awareness of prevalent mental health i ssues associated with the Troubles is required. Stigma There is a need for the development of strategies w hich reduce stigma associated with mental disorders with the aim of increasing treatme nt seeking behaviours. Screening The use of MH screening devices should be more wide ly considered, especially at the commencement of a treatment intervention for a ment al health condition in order to establish a baseline for the condition, for the pur pose of monitoring and to establish the effectiveness of the intervention. Within primary care settings, the use of depression screening questionnaires requires a substantial organisational system to support manage ment and for the purpose of follow-up. Suicide and self-harm Both historic and recent history should be consider ed in the assessment of all patients to identify suicidal risk and determine appropriate in tervention. GPs must give consideration to the link between sui cidal behaviour and other mental health issues when considering referral to the appropriate agency. Specifically, increased training in suicide awarene ss would help GPs decipher those symptoms that could mask suicide ideation in the in dividual. Booster training would ensure that GPs are kept awa re of trends in suicidality which may direct treatment of the individual within a primary care setting and beyond. GPs should be notified of trend changes within a gi ven geographic area, to augment screening for suicidal ideation. Support should be provided to primary practitioners to ensure that preconceptions of suicidal behaviour are appropriately addressed, to optimize both patient care and good practice. A multi-component approach to suicide prevention sh ould be considered in all primary presentations involving the treatment of suicide id eation or behaviour. Targeted prevention strategies should address chara cteristics such as age, physical health and social disadvantage unique to different groups in society. Screening for suicide ideation should be carried ou t by trained primary care professionals using validated instruments such as the Suicide Probability Scale. GPs should be regularly updated on the outcomes of research on the effectiveness of primary treatment for patients at risk of suicide. 3 GAD There is a need for an evaluation of the effectiven ess of the role of the GP in delivering treatments to reduce the symptoms of GAD. The effectiveness of guided self-help groups for an xiety disorders should be further evaluated for their effectiveness as an interventio n in primary care. Cost-effectiveness evaluation of low and high inten sity psychological interventions for people with GAD or mixed anxiety disorders should b e conducted. More research is needed into the available skills i n primary care teams, and appropriate tools for use to improve detection and treatment of GAD within primary care settings. Research studies that compare and contrast the effe ctiveness of different models of care for GAD is recommended and should include consideration of the co-morbidity with physical and mental health problems. More research is needed into the relevant impact of low intensity psychosocial therapies on GAD and mixed anxiety disorders, particularly focus ing on primary care settings; and in particular to explore the further potential of CCBT . Alcohol dependency and mental health A comprehensive primary care assessment should be p rovided for individuals at risk of alcohol abuse or dependence disorders. This should include the use of a tool to measure alcohol dependence (such as the AUDIT, SADQ or the Leeds Dependence Questionnaire). In addition, the person's historical and recent histor y of alcohol use should be examined along with the physical and mental health problems associ ated with alcohol use. Finally, the social and economic implications of alcohol abuse and depe ndence should be explored. Primary care practitioners should provide informati on on sensible drinking and interventions to reduce alcohol-related harm to individuals at ri sk of developing alcohol abuse disorders. People who meet the criteria for alcohol abuse diso rder or alcohol dependence disorder should be referred to specialists for care planned treatment. Individuals with alcohol abuse and dependence diso rders should be assessed for comorbid mental disorders, prior to, and throughout treatmen t. Individuals with comorbid mental disorders that do not improve following 3-4 weeks a bstinence from alcohol should receive treatment or referral for that mental disorder. Risk management plans should be in place for people who abuse, or are dependent upon alcohol, and are suicidal. These individuals should be referred to a psychiatrist for assessment and treatment. Prevention Further research should be undertaken into the effe ctiveness of primary care led preventive work with high risk children and young people (e.g. children with chronic illness). 4 There should be an increase in encouraging resilien ce among primary school children as a means of reducing the risk of suicide. This work sh ould be evaluated longitudinally. A trial should be established comparing health outc omes of children and adolescents screened for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) with a non-screened population. Targeted screening and preventive interventions sho uld be undertaken with looked after and accommodated young people, young people in juve nile detention facilities, and children of depressed parents. A study evaluating the effect iveness of psychotherapeutic interventions in the primary care setting on young people with a mental health problem, including the cost effectiveness of such interventi ons should be undertaken. Healthcare professionals in primary care should be trained to detect symptoms of depression, and to assess children and young people who may be at risk of depression. Children and young people with moderate to severe d epression should be offered, as a first- line treatment, a specific psychological therapy su ch as individual cognitive behavioural therapy [CBT], interpersonal therapy or shorter-ter m family therapy; it is suggested that this should be of at least 3 months' duration. Older people Routine health checks for older people should incor porate screening for depression. In view of the evidence supporting the benefits of PST and CBT in reducing depressive symptoms among older people, these services should be more widely available. More work is needed to standardise approaches to th e measurement of mental health outcomes. Dementia Consideration should be given to the wider use of n on-pharmacological interventions (music therapy, hand massage and physical activity/exercis e) for managing the symptoms of dementia within primary care. Routine health checks for older people should incor porate screening for dementia. Primary care clinicians should select a screening t ool (e.g. MMSE) and familiarise themselves with it to become more efficient in screening for d ementia. Primary health care staff should consider referring people who show signs of mild cognitive impairment for assessment by memory assessment serv ices to aid early identification of dementia. 5 In middle age and among older people, vascular and other modifiable risk factors for dementia should be reviewed, and if appropriate, tr eated. In view of the benefits of group support for famili es and carers, this service should be more widely available. More evidence is needed on the recognition and mana gement of mental health disorders in older people. There is a need for the increased use of carer/fami ly group support in the management of dementia. Schizophrenia and other psychotic illnesses There is a distinct need for evidence on early iden tification processes for psychosis and schizophrenia. Primary care practitioners have a key role to play in improving the care of individuals with schizophrenia and other psychotic illnesses. Whilst there is good evidence for the efficacy and effectiveness of early intervention programmes, suc h programmes are not widely available. There is no evidence as to which measures would improve the detection of prodromal symptoms and early phase psychotic illness in primary care. The management of established schizophrenia in prim ary care does have an established evidence base. Primary care practitioners ought to: Routinely monitor for other coexisting mental healt h problems, for example depression, particularly in the early phases of treatment. Monitor the physical health of people with schizoph renia at least once a year. Offer cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) to all pe ople with schizophrenia. Primary care practitioners can play a key role in e nsuring the needs of carers are met, in part through interventions at the primary care level, an d in part through onward referral to specialist services. Primary care practitioners ought to: Offer a carer's assessment and family intervention to all families of people with schizophrenia, including written and verbal informa tion on schizophrenia and its management. Provide information about local carer and family su pport groups and voluntary organisations. Assess the needs of any children in the family, inc luding young carers. 6 Miscellaneous Given the available effectiveness evidence, there i s support for the development of 'case management' and 'collaborative care' models for the management of mental health disorders in primary care. There is support for the development of individuali sed prevention strategies for PND. GPs and 'high risk' groups should be furnished with information detailing the risk factors associated with mental health disorders. Given the clear associations between mental illness and poor physical health, it is imperative that primary care professionals recognize physical healthcare needs in their approach to the management of treatment for individuals with mental health problems. 7 SECTION A Contextual information on the prevalence of mental health disorders among the Northern Ireland population 8 Introduction The prevalence of mental health problems and the ne ed for a strategic national framework for the development and improvement of mental health servic es in Northern Ireland was notably acknowledged and endorsed in the recent Bamford Rev iew of Mental Health and Learning Disability. Following an assessment of current mental health ne eds, the review states that a new strategic framework requires better information on mental hea lth and service needs and that a holistic and comprehensive approach to service provision and men tal health practice is necessary (Bamford, 2005). Given the position of primary care as the first point of contact for individuals with mental health needs, and the GPs' role in identifying pote ntial disorders and ensuring continuity of care, it is essential that practitioners and planners are furni shed with a reliable evidence base which details the levels and profile of mental needs in the commu nity. Furthermore any evaluation of effectiveness of primary care services in the preve ntion, recognition and management of mental health disorders must consider the levels of need, risk factors and profile of service use among the population as well as important contextual factors which impact upon and interact with these phenomena. Since the publication of the Bamford Reports, the P sychology Research Institute at the University of Ulster has completed the Northern Ireland Study of Health and Stress (NISHS). This study provides the first nationally representative estimates of me ntal health disorders among the Northern Ireland population based on validated diagnostic criteria. This chapter provides a summary of the current profile of mental health in Northern Ireland, drawi ng primarily on information from the NISHS. Relevant information is also drawn from a number of additional sources with the aim of giving a broad overview of mental health among various sub-p opulations. The Northern Ireland Study of Health and Stress (NI SHS) The NISHS, a recently completed epidemiology study of mental health in Northern Ireland, reveals substantial levels of mental ill health among the a dult population and associated challenges facing the primary care sector. The NISHS is a study of th e World Mental Health Survey Initiative which is a collaboration of 28 identical national studies arou nd the world. The NISHS provides the first epidemiological estimates of the rates of mental he alth disorders among the Northern Ireland adult population based on validated DSM-IV (APA, 1994) di agnostic criteria. The NISHS is a representative household survey of 4340 English speaking adults, 1 8 years and older in Northern Ireland. Participants were selected from a multi-stage, clus tered, area probability sample of households. Face-to-face interviews were undertaken between Feb ruary 2004 and August 2008 by professional interviewers from two research companies (Research Evaluation Services and Ipsos MORI). The response rate was 68.4%. The survey instrument used in the NISHS, as in all the WMH studies, was the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WMH-CIDI). This is a widely used, comprehensive, standardised instrument for the assessment of mood, anxiety, imp ulse-control and substance use disorders in keeping with the criteria for mental health as set out in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and the International Statis tical Classification of Diseases (ICD). The NISHS data provides information on the prevalence and cor relates of mental health disorders, the level of treatment and unmet need and treatment adequacy. The prevalence of mental health disorders among adu lts in Northern Ireland The lifetime prevalence of broad DSM-IV disorder ca tegories (as estimated in the NISHS) for the overall sample is presented in Table 1 (Bunting et al, pending). Disorders considered incl ude anxiety (panic disorder, generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) , social phobia, specific phobia, agoraphobia, 9 posttraumatic stress disorders and separation anxie ty; mood (major depressive disorder (MDD), dysthymia and bi-polar disorder; impulse-control (o ppositional defiant disorder (ODD), conduct disorder, attention deficit disorder (ADD) and inte rmittent explosive disorder (IED); and finally substance disorder (alcohol abuse/dependence and dr ug abuse/dependence). The extent of the public health burden posed by mental health disorde r is reflected in the overall estimate that 39.1% of the population have had at least one mental heal th disorder during their lifetime. Twenty two percent of the sample had two or more disorders whi le 12.5% had three or more. The most prevalent disorder category was anxiety disorders ( 22.6%) followed by mood disorders (18.8%), substance disorders (14.1%) and impulse-control dis orders (8.6%). Table 1. Lifetime prevalence for part 1 and part 2 samples o f DSM-IV disorders Total Lifetime Prevalence Total 12-month Prevalenc e Disorder N % SE N % SE Any anxiety 604 22.6 1.2 366 14.6 1.0 Any mood 900 18.8 0.8 466 9.6 0.8 Any impulse 196 8.6 0.7 70 3.4 0.6 Any substance 295 14.1 1 68 3.5 0.5 Any disorder 951 39.1 1.7 548 23.1 1.4 2+ disorders 570 22.0 1.2 122 4.9 0.5 3+ disorders 338 12.5 0.8 124 4.5 0.5 Examination of these rates of mental health disorde rs with comparable figures from other WMH Survey Initiative studies reveal that Northern Irel and has one of the highest rates of mental disorder in the world. The overall prevalence of any disorde r (39.1%) is the third highest estimate when compared with 17 other WMH studies (Kessler et al. 2008). Leavey et al. (2009) have also highlighted the evidence that there may be up to 30% higher lev els of mental health problems in Northern Ireland compared to the rest of the UK and that the high levels of violence and deprivation appear to be important factors in this. Table 1 also presents 12-month prevalence estimates for the aforementioned disorder categories (Bunting et al, under review) among the NI adult po pulation, that is, the percentage of the population who met the criteria for a disorder with in each of the four broad categories in the 12- months prior to the interview. As outlined in one of the earliest Bamford Review documents (2005), strategic planning for effective mental health serv ice provision must be grounded on detailed population based information on mental health needs . These figures provide this vital evidence-base and are ultimately the closest estimation to the cu rrent level of mental ill health in the population and indicate the numbers of individuals with potent ially unmet needs. Almost one quarter of the adult population (23.1%) met the criteria for at le ast one mental health disorder in the previous 12- months. This is the second highest estimate among c ompleted WMH studies (Kessler et al. 2008). The most prevalent type of disorder was once again anxiety, followed by mood, substance and impulse-control disorders. These elevated rates of mental health disorders in Northern Ireland have significant economic implications for individuals, families, the NHS, go vernment and wider society. A recent report by the Northern Ireland Association for Mental Health (NIA MH) and Sainsbury Centre for Mental Health (SCMH) estimated that the economic costs of mental health disorders (which include direct care as well as lost productivity and quality of life) were nearly \u00a33 billion in 2002/03 (NIAMH and SCMH, 2004). 10 Prevalence of mental health disorders among young people One notable limitation of the NISHS is its focus on the general adult population (individuals aged 18 and over). Figures detailing the age-at-onset of va rious disorder types (which will be presented later ) highlight that many disorders first develop in youn ger age-groups (particularly impulse-control, substance disorders and various anxiety disorders). These findings underline the need for targeting prevention, health promotion and intervention strat egies among younger age-cohorts (Bunting et al, pending). The prevalence and recent trends of suici de and self-harm pose a particularly pertinent challenge to mental health services in Northern Ire land. The rise in suicide in Northern Ireland between the years of 1995 and 2005 is now a matter of record (DHSSPSNI 2005; Samaritans 2005). Within this period there was a 27% increase in suic ide in Northern Ireland (Samaritans, 2007). The Bamford Report on child and adolescent mental healt h recognises the established link between childhood disorders in adulthood and stresses the p otential adverse social costs of poor provision of childhood mental health services (Bamford, 2006a). As indicated in this report, there is a distinct lack of epidemiological information on the rates of mental disorders among young people in NI. A British study however suggests that around one fift h of young people will at some point have a diagnosable mental health disorder (Target and Fona ghy, 1996; cited in Bamford, 2006a). Given higher levels of social deprivation (Bamford 2006b), the ongoing impact of 30-40 years of civil conflict (Ferry et al, 2008) and the elevated level s of adult mental ill health (Bunting et al, under review), it is possible that morbidity levels among young people in Northern Ireland are higher than this 20% figure. Given the simultaneous review comm issioned, which focuses on children and young people, it is assumed that much of the evidence on mental health issues among this cohort will be considered in that report. This report however will incorporate evidence on children and young people specifically from a primary care perspective . Prevalence of mental health disorders among older p eople Despite increased recognition of our ageing populat ion, little is known about the prevalence of mental ill health and the factors influencing the m ental health of older people. The National Service Framework for Older People (Department of Health, 2 001) recommended that older people experiencing mental health problems (including thos e living in care homes) should have access to treatment and support. The need for detailed infor mation on mental health morbidity and the impact of variations in the access to and use of in dividual services have also been identified as key research priorities in the Bamford Review (2007). Estimates from the previously mentioned NISHS offer the first national representative estimates o f mental health disorders and suggest that around 22% of those aged 65 years and over have had at le ast one mental health disorder at some point their life. Once again this figure represents the p revalence among the non-institutionalised population which excludes older individuals living in care homes who represent a particularly vulnerable group. Depression constitutes one of the most important psychiatric p roblems found in later life, both in terms of its substantial preval ence and its negative impact on quality of life. Prevalence estimates vary considerably depending on the assessment methodology used and the definition of depression, but it is estimated to af fect up to 40% of older people who live in care homes (Mozley et al., 2004; Heath, 2006). In addition to depression, dementia constitutes a f urther substantial public health concern among the older population. The most recent 'Dementia 20 10' report commissioned by the Alzheimer's Research Trust estimated that 1.3% of the UK popula tion suffer from Dementia (Health Economics 11 Research Centre, 2010). Northern Ireland specific f igures, which were produced in a previous report by the Alzheimer's Society (Kings College London an d London School of Economics, 2007) suggested that there are 16,000 people with dementia in North ern Ireland with this figure set to increase to 20,500 by 2017 and to over 47,000 by 2051. This rep resents a percentage increase of 30% and 200% respectively. Given these projected increases, it i s imperative that adequate provision for the prevention, recognition and management of dementia in primary care is made. The additional mental health impact of the Northern Ireland 'Troubles' Given the backdrop of over three decades of civil c onflict, Primary Care faces additional complexity in providing effective services for individuals who have mental health needs associated with their experience of conflict. An extensive body of litera ture has emerged in relation to the number of incidents experienced during the political violence and more recently numerous studies have examined the psychological impact of 'Troubles-rela ted' trauma. Ferry et al (under review) have examined the epidem iology of psychological trauma, PTSD and other trauma related disorders in the Northern Ireland ad ult population. Estimates suggest that approximately 60% of the population have experience d a traumatic event during their lifetime, while 40% of the population have experienced an event ass ociated with conflict. The study reveals that 8.5% of the population met the criteria for PTSD du ring their lifetime while 5.1% (one in 20) met the criteria for PTSD in the previous 12 months. Among those who experienced a conflict related event, over 16% met the criteria for PTSD, highlighting th e additional impact of the Troubles. While PTSD is a unique disorder in that it must be preceded and l inked to a qualifying traumatic experience, it is recognised that a range of other mental health diso rders may develop as a result of trauma. Ferry and colleagues (2008 and under review) further show that the experience of conflict related trauma is significantly associated with a range of other d isorders including GAD, panic attacks, phobias, depression and substance disorders and indeed a wid e range of chronic physical conditions. This complex range of outcomes linked to traumatic event s emphasises the need for primary care practitioners to be aware of and adequately trained in recognising symptoms associated with the experience of psychological trauma. Age-at-onset estimates for mental health disorders and socio-demographic risk factors The Bamford Report outlining a strategic framework for adult mental health services identifies the need for improved GP training in the area of mental health with an estimated 50% of GPs having received no formal psychiatric training (Foy 2004 i n Bamford 2006b). This poses a potential problem in the identification and appropriate management of mental health disorders. While the risks of mental ill health will ultimately vary depending on individual circumstances, information on likely age-at-onset and socio-demographic risk factors pro vides a useful profile for practitioners in primary care in helping to identify individuals with mental health service needs. The NISHS provides estimates of the average age-at- onset for a range of mental health disorders. In terms of broad disorder categories, the age-of-onse t was on average much earlier for anxiety disorders (14 years) and impulse-control disorders (13 years) compared with mood disorders (32 years) and substance use disorders (21 years). Disorders generally had similar distribution charac teristics with other disorders in their category. F or example the median age of onset for all mood, impul se-control and substance disorders occurred 12 within a narrow range (31-36 years for mood disorde rs, 8-17 for impulse control disorders and 19-28 for substance disorders). Anxiety disorders on the other hand displayed a more varied age-of-onset distribution. While specific phobia and social phob ia had a young median age of onset (8 years and 14 years respectively), the corresponding age of on set for panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder was much higher (33 years, 35 years and 33 years respectively). As previously indicated, information on individual characteristics that are likely to be associated wi th mental health disorders may provide a useful refere nce for service providers in primary care in the prevention, identification and management of mental health disorders and indeed in targeting prevention strategies. Bunting et al (pending) exam ined socio-demographic risk factors in relation to a range of mental health disorders, again using dat a from the NISHS. While women were significantly more likely to have anxiety and mood disorders, men had significantly greater odds of having impulse-contro l and substance disorders. Age at interview was also significantly associated with having a disorde r in each category with an overall trend of decreasing odds as age increased. Individuals who w ere separated, divorced or widowed were twice as likely to have anxiety, mood and substance disor ders. Having a low or low-average income was associated with significantly elevated odds of havi ng anxiety, impulse-control and substance disorders. The prevalence and delays in treatment seeking for mental health problems in Northern Ireland Given their role as gatekeeper for more specialist mental health services and treatments, GPs and other primary care practitioners play a vital role in identifying mental health problems and ensuring continuity of care. In addition to the need for wid espread training, primary care faces another complex challenge in the large percentage of indivi duals with mental health treatment needs who do not seek help or who delay seeking help for many years. The NISHS for example suggests that just 41% of ind ividuals with an anxiety disorder in the 12- months previous to the interview, visited their GP or family doctor in the same time period. The corresponding figure for individuals with any mood disorder was 52%. Taking into account all mental health disorders, which include substance and impul se-control disorders, the relevant figure was 36% (Bunting et al, under review). Analyses on duration of delays in treatment followi ng initial onset of these disorder categories reveal a varied pattern. While individuals with a m ood disorder seek treatment within two years of initial onset on average, those with anxiety and su bstance disorders wait an average of 22 years and 15 years respectively before making contact with an y service provider. These findings may be viewed as surprising given that Northern Ireland has open and free access to primary care services through the NHS. They however draw attention to the specif ic challenge faced not only by primary care but among families, communities and the wider society i n promoting awareness of mental health issues and encouraging individuals with treatment needs to seek help promptly following initial onset. Summary In summary, the aforementioned evidence provides a profile of mental health among the population in Northern Ireland. Mental health disorders in NI are highly prevalent, lying at the upper end of prevalence estimates from other countries around th e world. Age-at-onset information suggests that young children and adolescents should be the m ain priority for policy and interventions. While 13 prevention, identification and management strategie s for mental health should be tailored to individual needs, evidence presented herein provide s a useful reference for primary care practitioners in identifying characteristics typica lly associated with mental health problems. In the light of evidence on the level of unmet treatment n eed and substantial delays in treatment for some disorders, targeted strategies are required that en courage early treatment seeking following initial onset of disorders. 14 References American Psychiatry Association.

This review will examine ways of making primary care services more accessible to all people with mental health issues, particularly those who, for cultural, geographical or other reasons, may tr y to manage alone. As children, young people and people with learning disabilities are specifically targeted in other priority areas, the proposed revi ew will pay particular attention to adults and older p eople with mental health issues. Reflecting the emergence of more context-specific a nd naturalistic methods of evaluation research, the science of systematic review has evolved in rec ent years, and there is increasing recognition of alternative approaches to evidence synthesis in the academic literature (Mays et al, 2005). As outlined in the original proposal, the approach tak en for the identification and evaluation of literature drew upon 'Realist Synthesis' methodolog y. Given the timescale, a full realist synthesis was not possible. In a review of methods for rapid review, Watt et al (2008) concluded that rather than developing a formalised methodology by which t o conduct rapid reviews, agencies should work toward increasing the transparency of the methods u sed for each review. The adoption of an adapted realist synthesis should enable such transp arency to be achieved. Realist synthesis (Pawson, 2006) was developed as a method of studying complex interventions in response to the perceived limitations of traditiona l systematic review methodology which, it is argued, follows a highly specified and intentionall y inflexible methodology, with the aim of assuring high reliability. A realist review in contrast, fo llows a more heterogeneous and iterative process, which is less amenable to prescription but which ne eds to be equally rigorous, and to provide a clear audit trail of the review to see how decisions were made, evidence sought, sifted and assessed, and findings accumulated and synthesised. With its ins istence that context is critical and that agents interact with and adapt to policies and interventio ns, realist synthesis is sensitive to diversity and change in programme delivery and development. In d oing so, it steers away from issuing misleading 'pass/fail' verdicts on complex interventions and a way from failed 'one-size-fits-all' ways of responding to problems (Pawson, 2006). As a relatively new approach to evidence review, pu blished examples of realist synthesis are rare. Examples from the health-related literature include a review by Greenhalgh et al. (2007) that sought to understand the efficacy of school feeding progra mmes. In this example the authors set out to examine studies from a Cochrane review, using reali st synthesis. Through this process, in contrast to simply finding out whether feeding programmes worke d, they were able to determine what it was about school feeding programmes that made them work . Greenhalgh et al. (2004) also used some principles of realist synthesis in a meta-narrative review of the diffusions of innovation literature. This resulted in a theoretical framework that repre sents the multiple factors and interactions that might arise in particular contexts and settings, wh ich may determine the success or failure of innovation adoption. McCormack and colleagues (McCo rmack et al. 2006; McCormack et al. 2007 a, b, c, d) also conducted an extensive realist synthe sis, which critically evaluated the evidence base underpinning approaches to practice development. Wh ilst only a handful of realist syntheses have been published, there has been sufficient work comp leted to underpin the development of a framework for their conduct. Given the structure of the National Health Service in Northern Ireland, which positions primary care as the gatekeeper for more specialist mental health services and treatment, the team felt that a realist approach was ideally suited to the current review. Furthermore, in contrast to a systematic review, a realist approach offers a methodology whi ch is sensitive to other specific human (e.g. family) or social (e.g. community/organisational) s ystems relevant to Northern Ireland, as well as the enduring legacy of the 'Troubles'. Similar to the r eview of school feeding programmes by Greenhalgh 18 et al (2007), rather than trying to answer the glob al question 'are primary health care services effective in the delivery of mental health services ?', a realist approach is concerned with understanding what it is about primary health care approaches that work, for specific groups of people, when, why and how? It was also envisaged t hat this approach is more appropriate for the current rapid review, given the intention to genera te research questions for further investigation. The purpose of the current review is therefore to a nswer the following key question: \"What aspects of primary care are effective in the prevention, re cognition and management of mental health issues across the lifespan; for whom do they work, in what circumstances and why?\" Overview of Specific Steps in the Review Process The following steps indicate the specific process a dopted by the research team in the completion of the current rapid review, highlighting how the proc ess was guided by realist synthesis principals. 1. Identification of the question: Based on the key question (above) the review team identified a series of 'sub-questions' that ultimately shaped th e literature search strategies. These questions were identified by an examination of standards of b est practice for the prevention, recognition and management of mental health services in primary car e. Specifically, formulation of the research question(s) was informed by guidance and standards from the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE). Given the direct association of this review with the Bamford Review of Mental Health and Learning Disability, development of the research question(s) also drew on the Mental Health Promotion Report (Bamford 2006) which outlin ed the key role of primary care in 'promotion of mental health and well-being for all in the popu lation at large'. These standards and guidelines were collated and reviewed by the research team and key themes were identified which formed the basis of sub-questions to be addressed. The identif ied sub-questions arising from this process are presented in Section C. 2. Clarification of the purpose(s) of the review : Following identification of the research questio ns to be addressed, the team met to discuss and clarify t he overall aim and purpose of the review. Consistent with the Bamford reports, the review inc ludes the prevention of mental health problems through education and health promotion initiatives in primary care; screening tools and strategies for the early detection of mental health problems a cross the lifespan, including recognition of com- morbid physical and mental health problems; the eff ectiveness of interventions (e.g. psychological therapies, counselling, medication and other initia tives, e.g. Beating the Blues) for managing common mental health problems in primary care: conc eptual models and evidence base; effective use of primary care in the early detection and mana gement of suicide risk; promoting equity in service provision across rural and urban areas; eff ective collaboration with statutory, voluntary and independent organisations with an interest in menta l health issues; developing 'quality standards' for making primary care mental health services more accessible to service users across the lifespan; best practice in service provision for older people with mental health problems including dementia; initiatives for supporting families and carers incl uding information, advice and respite; and value fo r money: clinical and cost effectiveness of service d elivery. 3. Development and articulation of the programme th eories : As previously indicated, realist synthesis is informed by theory and the current rev iew was ultimately driven by the theories that underpin the prevention, recognition and management of primary care mental health. Articulation of the programme theories was informed by the outco mes of the aforementioned steps. The team evaluated and collated the information on standards and guidelines for mental health services in primary care and initially devised a 'long list' of programme theories. These theories were grouped and categorised with respect to specific sub-popula tions (e.g. general population, older people), 19 disorder types (e.g. depression, anxiety, substance use, self-harm and suicide) and cross-cutting issues relevant to primary care services in Norther n Ireland (e.g. services in rural areas, supporting families and carers). Finally, based on the theorie s relating to these specific groupings and categories, the team articulated a statement which outlined the ' ideal model' for primary care services in Northern Ireland. This ideal model and theories upon which it is based was used to design an evaluative framework for review evidence. Specif ically identification, collation, analysis and evaluation of the literature were framed according to this ideal model and programme theories. A summary of the key theories identified from standar ds and guidelines and statement of the ideal model is presented in section C. 4. Search for the evidence: The search for relevant literature pertaining to mental health and primary care adopted a 'review of reviews' approach . The method used for this review of reviews was a modified version of the Systematic Rapid Evid ence Assessment (SERA) methods developed by the EPPI-Centre (see Caird et al 2010 for more deta il). More details of the methods employed are outlined in Section D. Initial search terms were fr amed from the theories and research questions developed in steps 1-3 and an extensive and systema tic search was conducted to identify the relevant literature. Searches were conducted using electronic databases (e.g. British Nursing Index, Pubmed, The Cochrane Library). In addition these da tabases were supplemented with searches of a number of relevant websites (e.g. Department of Hea lth, ESRC, Kings Fund, NHS). Full citation searches using Google Scholar and Scopus were condu cted on all key papers. Email requests for information were sent to key informants). In the fi rst instance a variety of permutations and combinations of the following search terms were use d: 'Mental Health AND Primary Care' AND 'Guidelines OR Quality Standards'. Additional free text searches w ere carried out to identify reviews on specific topics including prevention of suicide, provision o f services in rural areas and support for families and carers. All the retrieved studies were stored on a shared folder and details including main keywords were entered into the Endnote bibliographi c software package for ease of management. 5. Appraisal of the evidence: Data found in the searches were appraised using t he review question and sub-questions as a guide. Located papers were screened for relevance before inclusion using the previously derived theories and questions as a framework for analysis. Two reviewers independently assessed titles and abstracts identif ied through searching against the inclusion criteri a (outlined in Section D). Where no abstract was avai lable from bibliographic database records, an attempt was made to retrieve the full paper. Follo wing the initial screening and categorisation, a second screen for relevance was conducted by a sing le reviewer who looked in more detail at the abstract and text to assess the review process, tra nsparency of the review, methods for synthesis, and extent of results reported, relevant outcomes a nd relevant population. 6. Extraction of the results : The framework used by Caird et al (2010) was used to extract and record information from each review paying attention to: t he focus of the review, type of review, type and numbers of included studies, country of origin, fin dings of review and year of publication. In addition, a template was devised based on steps 1-3 into which the results of evidence appraisal were inserted. 7. Synthesis of the findings : The data from all templates were reviewed and ke y findings extracted. Both confirmatory and contradictory findings were s ought. These key findings in terms of prevention, recognition and management of mental he alth disorders in primary care are presented in Section D of this report. Following extraction a nd synthesis of results, the research team evaluate d findings in relation to the overall research questi on, key theories and ideal model. Discussion of thi s evaluative process is presented in Section E with t he ultimate aim of determining: \"What aspects of 20 primary care are effective in the prevention, recog nition and management of mental health issues across the lifespan; for whom do they work, in what circumstances and why?\" The stated purpose of this approach to literature r eview (based on Realist Synthesis) is to provide usable conclusions. We therefore anticipate that th is report provides clear guidance concerning further research needed into the conduct of primary mental health care interventions. A series of conclusions and recommendations have therefore been included in Section F, and within the Executive Summary. 21 References Bamford Review of Mental Health and Learning Disabi lity (N.I.).

Informed in the first instance by the aforementioned broad research question, the researc h team initially undertook a review of recognised standards and guidelines of good practic e in the prevention, recognition and management of mental health disorders in primary ca re. The research team also augmented information from these guidelines and standards, wi th relevant information from studies and reports which focused on primary care services with in the Northern Ireland context. Specifically the team examined guidance from the following sources o f information: NICE Clinical Guideline 16 on Self-harm (National C ollaborating Centre for Mental Health (NCCMH, 2004). NICE Clinical Guideline 26 on PTSD (NCCMH, 2005). NICE Clinical Guideline 42 on Dementia (NCCMH, 2011 ). NICE Clinical Guideline 90 on Depression (NCCMH, 20 09).

Research questions derived from standards and guida nce Following extraction of relevant information from t he numerous sources listed above, the research team collated, evaluated and summarised the key asp ects with the aim of deriving a list of sub- questions to be addressed in the review. The follow ing research questions were identified: 1. What does the evidence tell us about the effectiven ess of assessment services/processes in primary care? 24 2. What circumstances help or hinder the effectiveness of assessment services/processes and what are the implications of this/these on targeted and accurate diagnosis? 3. What evidence is there of the effectiveness of prim ary care services building on and working with other services to ensure continuity of care ac ross all phases of care and service delivery? 4. To what extent is partnership working in facilitati ng service user/carer wishes, decisions and treatment options evident and what effect does such working have on service user outcome? 5. How effective are existing health promoting strateg ies used in primary care and how do these strategies help to reduce the impact of psych iatric conditions on individuals, families and communities? 6. What evidence is there that GPs are adequately trai ned for assessing, diagnosing and planning treatment/treating people with mental heal th needs? Key principles of an ideal primary care mental heal th service for adults In accordance with the key principals that underpin a realist synthesis approach, this review is theor y driven. Explicitly, the review evidence relating to prevention, recognition and management of mental health in primary care will be compared with key theories and principles of good practice. In addition to the sub-questions derived from review o f the aforementioned guidance and standards, the team sought to identify key theories of good practice in primary care. Following extrac tion of relevant data from these sources, the team summaris ed information under the key themes of: assessment, diagnosis, care co-ordination, carers, person-centred care, prevention and training. Informed directly by these summaries, the following principles of an ideal primary care mental health service and an overall statement of the ideal primary care mental health service model are proposed: 1. Primary care services should provide comprehensive targeted assessments based on standardised criteria that are focused on maximisin g treatment options and minimising risks. 2. Mental health diagnoses should be based on comprehe nsive assessment that has followed standardised criteria. 3. Primary care services should build on and work with the local authority community services, with colleagues in secondary specialised services, and services in the non-statutory sector, in order to ensure continuity of care across all phase s of care and service delivery. 4. Primary care teams should work in partnership with carers. 5. Services for adults with mental health needs should work with service users and others significant to them in a way that ensures their wis hes, decisions and treatment options are facilitated in an atmosphere of trust and respect. 6. Opportunities for mental health promotion should be taken and integrated into the role functions of all members of the primary health care team. 25 7. Primary healthcare professionals should have the ap propriate training to assess and treat adults with mental health needs. 8. GPs should be aware that mental health disorders co mmonly co-exist with both physical disorders and other mental disorders, and they shou ld be competent in recognising and assessing these possible associations. Statement of the Ideal Model Primary care mental health services should be provi ded from the basis of a comprehensive assessment that leads to the making of specific dia gnoses. Resulting care provision should be integrated with community services, extend the work of secondary care and be delivered in a person-centred way, in partnership with carers and others who are significant in the life of the person with mental health needs. Health promoting strategies should be utilised wherever possible and primary care staff should be appropriately trai ned in meeting the needs of service users with a variety of mental health needs and psychiatric diso rders. 26 References Bamford Review of Mental Health and Learning Disabi lity (N.I.).

Background and context The prioritisation of primary care in the Bamford I mplementation Plan recognises the centrality of primary care to mental health service provision. As part of a more holistic approach to evidence synthesis in mental health, the University of Ulste r team was commissioned to explore the role of primary care work in the prevention, recognition an d management of mental health issues across the lifespan. Using a realist synthesis approach th e review team also questioned for whom does it work, in what circumstances and why? As part of this research project, Deirdre Fullerton and Elizabeth Burtney from Insights Health and Social Research joined the partnership to conduct a rapid evidence review with the following aim: To synthesize the available review level evidence o n the effectiveness of primary care in the prevention, recognition and management of mental he alth issues across the lifespan. Specifically, review level evidence has been assemb led in the following (sometimes overlapping) areas: Mental health promotion and prevention of mental il l health within primary care settings Early detection of mental health with specific focus on child/youn g people and older people Effective use of primary care for the early detection and management of suicide risk interventions for managing common mental health pro blems in primary care The effectiveness of different models/interventions for managing common mental health problems in primary care Effective collaboration with statutory, voluntary and independent organisa tions with an interest in mental health issues Initiatives for supporting families and carers including information, advice and respite In addition to presenting the most recent of eviden ce on effectiveness of different screening and interventions, this review presents contextual revi ew level information and relevant guidance and standards emerging from this evidence (e.g. NICE gu idelines, SIGN guidance). 31 1.2 Research approach The approach taken for the review of reviews was a modified version of the Systematic Rapid Evidence Assessment (SERA) methods developed by the EPPI-Centre (see Caird et al 2010 for more detail 1). While not a pure systematic review the process i ncludes the features of such a review in the identification, critical appraisal, selection, and data extraction procedures in order to limit bias a t all stages. 1.2.1 Research parameters The limited time scale of the project and the large body of research literature meant the scope of the review of reviews had to be limited in the foll owing ways: 1. Only systematic reviews were considered for inclusi on, making this a review of reviews or a 'meta-review' 2. Following discussion with the wider research team, the research was specifically focused on a number of selected areas 3. A flexible search strategy using free text words wa s developed which employed a limited rather than exhaustive range of search terms 4. The search for grey literature included searches of key websites. 1.2.2 Review definitions The following definitions were employed for the pur poses of this review of reviews. Mental Health The WHO definition of mental health has been employ ed. It states that mental health is not just the absence of a mental disorder but a state of well-be ing in which individuals realise their potential, c an cope with normal stresses of life and can work prod uctively and fruitfully, and make a contribution to community. It is related to the promotion of wel l-being, the prevention of mental ill health and treatment and rehabilitation of people affected by mental ill health. Primary Care Primary care is the first point of contact for a pa tient with a healthcare provider and for this repor t includes general practitioners, practice nurse and pharmacist. While recognizing increasing access through self-referrals to CMH teams in some areas, the predominant model is through health professional referrals, and as such self-referral a ccess is not included in this definition of primary care. Systematic review A study was considered to be a systematic review if it presented a defined search strategy and explicit inclusion criteria. 1 Caird J, Rees R, Kavanagh J, Sutcliffe K, Oliver K, Dickson K, Woodman J, Barnett-Page E, Thomas J (20 10) The socioeconomic value of nursing and midwifery: a rap id systematic review of reviews .

Similar to systematic reviews a review of reviews uses a defined search strategy and explicit inclusion criteria. 1.2.3 Search strategy The focus of this research was to identify review-l evel evidence for collation and synthesis. A systematic search of the literature was conducted t o identify relevant papers. The criteria and definitions for the search are outlined in Table 1 below.

This review excluded reports on pharmacologic treat ments/care. Due to time limitations a cut-off date for searchin g was established. Located papers were screened for relevance before i nclusion. Two reviewers independently assessed titles and abstracts identified through se arching against the inclusion criteria. Where no abstract was available from bibliographic database records, an attempt was made to retrieve the full paper. Following the initial screening and categorisation, a second screen for relevance was conducted by a single reviewer who looked in more detail at the ab stract and text to assess the review process, transparency of the review, methods for synthesis, extent of results reported, relevant outcomes and relevant population. From this second screen pa pers were excluded if the review: Did not report on effectiveness of approaches/model s/interventions Was not systematic Focused on developing countries Fell outside topic parameters as outlined above Was not reporting on interventions delivered within our definition of primary care Focused on pharmacological treatment of care. Focused on significant learning or developmental di sability (as this topic was being covered in another study within the same funding stream) Focused on drug abuse/addiction. The review did exa mine the evidence on alcohol abuse. 1.4 Quality assessment Only reviews meeting a minimum quality threshold we re considered for further synthesis. A quality assessment tool used by Fullerton and Burtney (20102) was employed to assess the quality of relevant reviews: Use of a comprehensive search strategy Use of explicit inclusion criteria Included a quality assessment of included studies Conducted a synthesis of findings. 2 Fullerton D and Burtney E (2010) An overview of the effectiveness of sexual health i mprovement interventions. Report to Health Scotland, Edinburgh. http://www.healthscotland.com/documents/4622.aspx 35 Two reviewers compared findings and conducted quali ty assessment separately. The searches identified 300 papers with relevance t o mental health interventions within primary care settings of which 125 were systematic reviews conducted since 2000. Given the breadth of the review, the volume of rev iews and the time available to conduct the review (16 weeks), the most recent reviews of high quality were used as core sources for the evidence supported by earlier reviews. 1.4.1 Breakdown of Reviews by Topic Some reviews were broad based exploring aspects of a condition (e.g. depression) across the lifespan. Other reviews were focused by both condit ion and population (e.g. depression and chronic illness). As a result some reviews are included in more than one section. Children and Young People: Review of Reviews n=1 Adults: Review of Reviews n=2 Systema tic Reviews 10 Depression in Older Adults: Systematic Reviews n=5 General Anxiety Disorder: Review of Reviews n=1 Sys tematic Reviews n=2 Psychosis and Schizophrenia: Review of Reviews n=1 Systematic Reviews n= 2 PTSD: Systematic Reviews n=7 Alcohol Systematic reviews Chronic Systematic reviews Dementia: papers (2000-2011) n=125 Included n=76 Review of reviews n=6 Systematic reviews n=70 Excluded from Effectiveness review n=49 (Some included in context section) 36 Suicide prevention: Review of Reviews n=1 Systemati c Reviews n=10 1.5 Data extraction The framework used by Caird et al (2010) was used t o extract and record information from the core reviews paying attention to Focus of the review Type of review Type and numbers of included studies Country of origin Year of publication. Given the wide focus of this review describing diff erent conditions and interventions, the key findings from the included reviews are presented in a narrative synthesis within the body of the review rather than in table format. 1.6 Guidelines and standards A different strategy was used to identify guideline s or standards. Electronic databases were searched with the following keywords (guidelines OR standard s) AND (mental health OR primary care) AND services. Web-based searches were conducted using G oogle Scholar and the following websites were searched: National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) http://www.nice.org.uk/ Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) http://www.sign.ac.uk/ 1.7 Synthesis The findings from reviews within each topic were gr ouped and presented using the following headings: Background Prevention Screening and identification Different approaches to treatment within primary ca re (excluding pharmacological treatments) Support for families and carers (where relevant) Cost effectiveness Guidelines Gaps in evidence The individual syntheses for this rapid review ofte n needed to call upon findings from more than one review. As a result, the syntheses are presented in narrative format. 1.8 Presentation of Findings The findings from the review are grouped to reflect mental health across the lifespan focusing on population groupings (e.g. pregnant women, children and young people, general population and older people) and conditions: depression (across th e lifespan), anxiety disorders, psychosis/schizophrenia, alcohol dependency, chroni c illness, and dementia and suicide prevention. For ease of access references to the cited papers a re provided at the end of each section. 37 1.9 Limitations of this review As with any research, there are limitations to this review. The report aims to present an overview of the key messages emerging from national and interna tional review-level evidence on the effectiveness of mental health interventions within primary care settings. Given the scope of this task and the rapid nature of the review (short time scale), the most appropriate research approach to synthesise the effectiveness evidence was to rely o n evidence presented by systematic reviews. While this approach permits a rapid assessment of t he available evidence across a range of topics and populations, its reliance on secondary analysis of material has limitations. Some of the evidence has been highly processed, which means it is not al ways possible to present details on interventions or to draw out clear messages for practice as this would require revisiting the primary studies. A reliance on reviews as the main source of evidenc e can result in an over-emphasis on evidence from research conducted outside the UK (e.g. USA an d Australia), which makes it difficult to generalise the characteristics of effective interve ntions to a Northern Irish setting with a different healthcare system. To address this limitation wher e possible we draw on UK research to provide examples of interventions. In addition, while the systematic reviews themselve s were assessed for quality, authors have adopted different inclusion criteria and critical a ppraisal procedures (e.g. some authors only include RCTs whereas others include quasi-experimental desi gns). Similarly, the variety of measures used to judge th e success of individual interventions made it difficult to draw conclusive evidence on the effect iveness of a given approach. While primary studies often report on one or more outcomes, not all this information is presented at review level. This lack of consistency of reporting outcomes in review-leve l evidence means that it is not always possible to assess the effectiveness of a given approach across specific outcomes. While every attempt was made to include the most re cent reviews, there is a time lag between studies being published and their incorporation in a systematic review. This means that many of the reviews included studies conducted since 2000, but not all of the most recent primary studies have been included. It was not possible within the avail able timescales to include primary studies conducted since the most recent review. In summary, the data presented in this evidence rev iew are only a partial answer to the ' what works ' question with respect to the mental health interv entions delivered within primary care settings. Other research approaches that might answ er some of the practice based questions concerning mental health interventions in Northern Ireland include: Survey or mapping study of practice Case studies detailing 'promising practice' in the delivery of mental health interventions in primary care Evaluations of local implementation of effective ap proaches from elsewhere (i.e. transferability to local context) Studies of users' (and carers') views and experienc es of service delivery. As such this review of reviews forms one part of th e evidence of mental health interventions within primary care that will be presented alongside more contextual research within a realist synthesis in order to examine the questions ' are primary health care services effective in the d elivery of mental health services ?', What is it about primary health care approaches tha t works, for specific groups of people, when, why and how ? 38 References for Section 1: Children and Young People Caird J, Rees R, Kavanagh J, Sutcliffe K, Oliver K, Dickson K, Woodman J, Barnett-Page E, Thomas J (2010) The socioeconomic value of nursing and midwi fery: a rapid systematic review of reviews.

Insufficient Evidence On the effectiveness of exercise for children in tr eatment for anxiety and depression On cost effectiveness of mental health intervention s with children/young people in primary care settings 2.1.1 Background Roughly half of all lifetime mental disorders in mo st studies are reported to start by the mid-teens and three quarters by the mid-20s. Later onsets are mostly secondary conditions. Severe disorders are typically preceded by less severe disorders tha t are seldom brought to clinical attention (Kessler et al 2007). Prevalence studies have revealed high rates of oppo sitional disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and emotional disorders among child ren aged between 3 and 5 years. Between 6% and 8% of children of this age have moderate or sev ere disorders and a further 10% have mild disorders. In addition, a relatively small number o f children are first identified as showing less common disorders such as autism (about 3-4 per 10,0 00) or autistic spectrum disorders (about 15 per 10,000). There is a high level of predictabilit y of later conduct disorder in young children who show oppositional disorder or ADHD or a combination of these. Many of these children also become depressed later. Behavioural problems associated wi th learning disability and pervasive developmental disorder show a strong continuity fro m childhood to adult life (Royal College of Psychiatrists, 2002). The middle school years (6-10 years) and early adol escence (11-14 years) are characterised by high rates of conduct and emotional disorders (around 10 -15% of the population are at risk), with adult- type depressive disorders beginning to make an appe arance (around 1-2%). Most depressive disorders in middle childhood and early adolescence are comorbid with anxiety states or, slightly less commonly, with conduct disorder. Although the rate of suicide is very low before 14 years, 41 attempted suicide begins to occur around 11-12 year s and rapidly increases in frequency in the early and mid-teens (see section on suicide for further i nformation). Given the high prevalence of mental health problems in young people, the fact that the 12-26 year age range represents the peak period for onset of m ental disorders across the lifespan (Moon, Meyer & Grau, 1999; Patton, 1996 cited by WHO 2004) , and evidence that early detection and treatment of depression and psychosis improves out comes (Kupfer, Frank & Perel, 1989; Loebel et al., 1992 cited by WHO 2004), the WHO (2004) repor t suggests that population-based, indicated prevention and early intervention strategies may pr ovide valuable opportunities to minimize the considerable burden of these disorders. Chronic physical conditions among young people have been found to be associated with a slightly elevated risk for self-harm, suicidal thinking, and attempted suicide; and chronic mental conditions are associated with an increased risk for all 3 out comes (Barnes et al 2010). Co-occurring chronic physical and mental conditions are associated with an increased risk for self-harm and suicidal ideation that is similar to the risk in chronic men tal conditions and with an attempted suicide risk i n excess of that predicted by the chronic mental heal th conditions alone (see section on Chronic illness for further information). Children of parents with depression and related dif ficulties have a substantially higher rate of depression than their counterparts in homes with no mental illness (Weissman et al 1997; Weissman et al 2006; O'Connell et al 2009). Screening for pa rental mental disorders, such as depression, PTSD, domestic violence, and substance use, is key to des igning interventions to reduce children's risk and has been recommended for primary care (Whitaker 200 6 cited by McConnell et al 2009). Despite the prevalence and adverse outcomes of expe riencing mental health problems during adolescence and young adulthood, young people are o ften reluctant to seek help for mental health problems and are the least likely of all age groups to receive appropriate mental health care. Authors (NCCMH & BPS 2005) have noted that there is no clear-cut consistency in how depressed children and young people present to healthcare ser vices. The clinical picture varies in ways that ar e poorly understood, with different levels of severit y, personal impairment and developmental age. For example, cognitive features of worthlessness, s elf-criticism and poor attention increase in adolescence; and somatic features, such as aches an d pains, tend to be more prominent in children (Ryan et al ., 1987; Goodyer & ., 2003 cited by NCCMH & BPS 2005). 2.1.2 Prevention Primary prevention can be sub-divided into universa l, selective and indicated prevention (Gordon, 1983). Universal prevention measures are those regarded as desirabl e for everyone, and the decision to implement them is taken if their benefi ts clearly outweigh the costs and risks of implementing them (e.g. seatbelts, encouragement of safe drinking, reduction of cigarette smoking, healthy eating and exercise). Selective prevention measures are agreed to be appropriate w hen an individual is a member of a subgroup of the population (e.g. age, gender o r occupation) whose risk of becoming ill is above average. Examples of selection prevention mea sures are good antenatal and perinatal care in pregnant women or inoculation for health ca re workers. 42 Indicated prevention measures are undertaken for groups at h igh risk, such as for schizophrenia when a genetic susceptibility is stro ngly suspected, or for groups that have experienced severe, clearly defined, emotional stre ss, such as children exposed to disasters or violence. Much of the universal preventive activities to redu ce psychiatric disorders tend to take place in the early years and involve health visitors and other m embers of the PCT working in partnership with other service providers such as Surestart programme s and early years educators. The Royal College of Psychiatrists (2002) recommended that such profe ssionals need training to acquire skills in identifying young children at risk due to the paren ting they are receiving, or because of the presence of early signs of behaviour disorders. Access to ad vice from child mental health services through secondary care professionals and the possibility of referral to such services should exist. Other prevention work with children and young peopl e takes place in school and community settings and includes work with parents, school based interv entions, youth development approaches and one to one counselling. (See parallel stream of wor k by MacDonald and colleagues for more information on such approaches). Reviews have examined the evidence on the effective ness of preventive interventions to reduce depression in children and young people (Horowitz a nd Garber, 2006; Merry et al 2004; Merry and Spence 2006; Cuijpers et al., 2008). The available evidence is mixed. Some benefit has been reported for preventive interventions for reducing depressiv e symptoms in children and adolescents, with small to modest effect sizes (Horowitz and Garber, 2006; Jan\u00e9-Llopis et al., 2003). Recent meta- analyses have concluded that interventions to preve nt depression can reduce both the number of new cases in adolescents (Cuijpers et al., 2008) an d depressive symptomatology among children and youth (Horowitz and Garber, 2006). In a review that included seven trials targeting adolescents, Cuijpers and colleagues (2008) reported that preven tive interventions for adolescents can reduce the incidence of depressive disorders by 23 percent . They caution, however, that since the follow-up period in most studies did not exceed two years, th e projects may have delayed onset rather than incidence. Both meta-analyses showed slightly highe r effect sizes for selective and indicated interventions, although the number of universal int erventions was very small. Merry and Spence (2007) highlighted several promisi ng approaches, but many of the studies reviewed failed attempts to replicate results in re al-world school and primary care settings, had limited follow-up periods, and suffered from method ological flaws. Merry and Spence concluded that there was no clear evidence that depression pr evention is effective and implementation of depression prevention programmes would be premature on the available evidence. However, given the positive findings in some studies, and the cost of depressive disorder, Merry and Spence recommended further research and pointed to the imp ortance of addressing wider social issues, as well as improving on the narrower interventions foc used on individual protective and risk factors. As young people with chronic physical and mental he alth problems are at increased risk of suicide, preventive work with this group is recommended (Bar nes et al 2010). Currently there is no review level evidence for this population group (see Secti ons on Suicide and Chronic Illness for further information). Larun et al (2006) examined the effects of exercise interventions in reducing or preventing anxiety or depression in children and young people up to 20 ye ars of age. The review found a small effect in favour of exercise in reducing depression and anxie ty scores in the general population of children and adolescents; however, the small number of studi es included and the clinical diversity of participants, interventions and methods of measurem ent limited the ability to draw conclusions. 43 2.1.3 Screening and Identification The American Academy of Pediatrics (Cheung et al 20 07) recommended that primary care professionals ask adolescents questions about depre ssion, suicidal thoughts, and other risk factors associated with suicide during routine well-child c hecks and other visits as needed. Williams et al (2009) assessed the health effects o f routine primary care screening for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) among children and adoles cents ages 7 to 18 years, including evaluating the accuracy of screening tests and the risks and benefits of treatment with psycho therapy and/or SSRIs. They found no trials comparing health outcom es in screened and unscreened populations. In terms of accuracy of screening instruments they loc ated six studies conducted in primary care or school settings reporting sensitivity of 73 to 100 percent and specificity of 65 to 94 percent. Three studies included participants less than 12 years ol d and yielded sensitivities of 53 to 90 percent and specificities of 49 to 96 percent. Williams et al concluded that although no trials of screening for pediatric MDD were identified, limited available da ta suggested that primary care feasible screening tools may be accurate in identifying depressed adol escents, and treatment can improve depression outcomes. Treating depressed young people with SSRI s may be associated with a small increased risk of suicidality and therefore should only be conside red if judicious clinical monitoring is possible. Specific treatment should be based on the individua l's needs and mental health treatment guidelines. No review has examined the effectiveness of screeni ng among children of parents with depression or mental illness. However, in their broader review Merry and Spence (2006) identified two studies examining the impact of screening among children of parents with depression. For example, Beardslee et al (2003) reported on a promising sele ctive intervention focusing on the offspring of parents with mood disorder. The study compared two active interventions: one in a group lecture format conducted by the principal investigator over two sessions with parents only, and the other a 6-11 session clinician-led psycho-educational inter vention with individual families geared at decreasing children's self-blame and encouraging pa rents to facilitate their child's resilience. They found a number of benefits from both interventions but with a better response from the clinician- facilitated programme. However, as there was no con trol group, it is not possible to draw conclusions regarding efficacy. In a second study , Clarke et al (2001) focused on young people aged 13-18 years whose parents had been treated for depr ession and who had elevated symptoms of depression that fell short of depressive disorder. They randomised participants to a group based 'Coping with Stress' programme or to usual care. Fo llow-up analysis showed a significant reduction in the incidence of major depressive episodes (9.3% in the intervention group vs. 28.8% in the control group at 12 months) with some indication th at this effect decreased over the subsequent 12 months. A reduction in depressive symptoms was most ly seen in self-rating scales immediately after intervention and the Hamilton Depression Rating Sca les did not differ between groups at any time point. Merry and Spence (2004) noted that while screening for depression at school may be a practical possibility, identifying young people at risk becau se of parental depression, as was performed in the second study by Clarke et al., is more problematic. As most adult depression is untreated many of their offspring would be missed. Even identifying a dults having treatment and offering intervention to their offspring would tax most health-care deliv ery services. Attendance and uptake of programmes by the at-risk group would also be probl ematic. Children with a long lasting physical illness are t wice as likely to suffer from emotional problems or disturbed behaviour. This is especially true of phy sical illnesses that involve the brain, such as 44 epilepsy and cerebral palsy (Royal College of Psych iatrists, 2004). No reviews were identified with a specific focus on the effectiveness of screening fo r this population of children/young people. O'Connell et al (2009) concluded that primary care settings offer an important opportunity for screening to detect risks and early symptoms of men tal, emotional, and behavioural problems among young people. They noted that some groups of young people, such as Looked After and Accommodated young people, young people in juvenile detention facilities, and children of depressed parents, are known to have a greatly elev ated risk for poorer mental health outcomes, and recommend that targeted screening or in some ca ses full assessment of individuals in these groups to identify potential preventive interventio ns or treatment. 2.1.4 Treatment There is limited evidence on the treatment and mana gement of child/adolescent mental health problems in primary care (Bower et al, 2001; Merry and Spence 2007; Merry et al 2004; Stein et al 2006; Williams et al 2009). Where evidence has been synthesised the focus is on depression. For example, Stein et al (2006) examined the evidence f or the treatment of depression in primary care settings, focusing on evidence concerning psychosoc ial, educational, and/or supportive intervention strategies. They located 37 studies relevant to tre ating adolescent depression in primary care settings, of which only 4 studies directly examined the impact of primary care-delivered psychosocial interventions for adolescent depressio n. Each of these studies was conducted in a \"real-world\" primary care setting, either in a prim ary care health clinic or in a school-based general health clinic. The evaluations compared treatment a s usual (TAU) with more optimal intervention methods, usually as delivered by primary care staff rather than research staff. Each study evaluated a different intervention. One examined the effectiv eness of an IPT modified for depressed adolescents. The second study invited young patient s to complete a general health questionnaire and followed up with consultation with the practice nurse. The third evaluated a quality improvement initiative that included teams of exper ts at each site, as well as care managers who supported primary care teams with patient evaluatio n, education, evidence-based psychosocial treatment, medication when desired, and linkage wit h specialty mental health services. Care managers were psychotherapists with masters level o r doctoral degrees in mental health or nursing. Care managers followed up with patients over the 6- month intervention period, coordinated care with the primary care team, and delivered the manua lised cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) treatment. The fourth trial evaluated a 5-9 session CBT program with depressed adolescents. These studies suggest that such psychotherapeutic treatme nt can be effective in the treatment of depression in young people within primary care sett ings, but given the diversity of the interventions and low number of studies further research is requi red. Williams et al (2009) located 10 fair or good-quali ty RCTs which evaluated the short-term efficacy of psychotherapy among 757 children or adolescents age d 9 to 18 years. Most psychotherapy trials demonstrated an improvement in depression symptoms based on the proportion achieving remission, change in mean depression score, or impr oved global functioning. Treatment with SSRIs was associated with a small increased risk of suici dality (RD 1 percent, 95 percent CI 0, 2). Suicidal ity includes suicidal ideation, preparatory acts, or at tempts. No suicide deaths have occurred in controlled trials of SSRIs. (See section 2.3 for fu rther information on treatment of depression with adult population) There are no systematic reviews on primary care tre atment and management of other conditions (e.g. PTSD, GAD, Psychosis). 45 2.1.5 Cost Effectiveness There are no reviews on the cost effectiveness of p rimary care led interventions with children/young people. 2.1.6 Standards and Guidelines The National Service Framework (England), Standard 9 states: \"All staff working directly with children and young people should have sufficient kn owledge, training and support to promote psychological wellbeing of children, young people a nd their families.\" The NICE (2005) guidelines on the identification, t reatment and management of depression in children and young people present recommendations a cross different levels of services. Recommendations relevant to primary care tend to si t within Tier 1 which includes GPs, paediatricians, health visitors, school nurses, soc ial workers, teachers, juvenile justice workers, voluntary agencies and social services. Assessment When assessing a child or young person with depress ion, healthcare professionals should routinely consider, and record in the patient's notes, potent ial comorbidities, and the social, educational and family context for the patient and family members, including the quality of interpersonal relationships, both between the patient and other f amily members and with their friends and peers. Treatment considerations Psychological therapies used in the treatment of c hildren and young people should be provided by therapists who are also trained child and adolescen t mental healthcare professionals. Comorbid diagnoses and developmental, social and e ducational problems should be assessed and managed, either in sequence or in parallel, with th e treatment for depression. Where appropriate this should be done through consultation and allian ce with a wider network of education and social care. Attention should be paid to the possible need for parents' own psychiatric problems (particularly depression) to be treated in parallel, if the child or young person's mental health is to improve. If such a need is identified, then a plan for obtainin g such treatment should be made, bearing in mind the availability of adult mental health provision a nd other service Screening Healthcare professionals in primary care should be trained to detect symptoms of depression, and to assess children and young people who may be at risk of depression. Training should include the evaluation of recent and past psychosocial risk fac tors, such as age, gender, family discord, bullying , physical, sexual or emotional abuse, comorbid disor ders, including drug and alcohol use, and a history of parental depression; the natural history of single loss events; the importance of multiple risk factors; ethnic and cultural factors; and fact ors known to be associated with a high risk of depression and other health problems, such as homel essness, refugee status and living in institutional settings. 2.1.7 Gaps in Research There is a need for review level evidence on the ef fectiveness of primary care led preventive work with high risk children and young people (e.g. children with chronic illness). 46 References for Section 2: Children and Young People Barnes, A.

Targeted home-visits provided by professionals (hea lth visitor) as a treatment for depression Exercise as a treatment for postnatal depresson (sm all number of studies) but best used as adjunct rather than a replacement therapy. Insufficient evidence to support or reject: The implementation of antenatal and postnatal class es, early postpartum follow-up, continuity of care models, psychological debriefing in hospital and interpersonal psychotherapy as an approach to preventing mental health problems. The use of psycho-social assessments to identify wo men showing early signs of depression during the antenatal period. Background Antenatal and postnatal mental health problems asso ciated with pregnancy, childbirth and the first post-natal year are recognised as a major public he alth issue, with as many as 15% of childbearing women likely to develop a new episode of major or m inor depression in the interval between conception and the first three postpartum months (G avin 2005 cited by Austin et al 2008). Disorders arising in the perinatal period include minor and m ajor depression, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, a nd puerperal psychoses. Co-morbid disorders are common in this population and mental illness is oft en complicated by issues of drug and alcohol abuse and domestic violence (Austin et al 2008). While a high proportion of women can suffer from tr ansient 'postnatal blues' for the first few days the rate of more serious postnatal depressive (PND) disorders is in the region of 10-15%. These often last several months and have been shown to ha ve a deleterious effect on the mother's capacity to care for her baby. This is marked espec ially by irritability and lack of responsiveness to the baby's signals for attention. Puerperal psychos es occur in about 2 per 1000 women. There is a raised risk of recurrence with subsequent births. There is now considerable evidence to show that PND has a substantial impact on the mother and her partner, the family, mother-baby interactions a nd the longer-term emotional and cognitive development of the baby, especially when depression occurs in the first year of life. Unfortunately, less than 50% of cases of PND are identified by pri mary healthcare professionals in routine clinical 49 practice (Hewitt CE, Gilbody SM et al. 2009). The e conomic costs of post-natal depression are conservatively estimated at \u00a345m for England and Wa les. This includes additional health and social care costs, but does not include indirect costs to society, such as lost productivity due to a mother' s reduced ability to return to work or to work at ful l capacity (Knapp and Mc Daid 2011). The Royal College of Psychiatrists states that prof essional intervention to prevent mental health problems and psychiatric disorders during the anten atal, perinatal and postnatal stage, calls for an unusually high level of multi-disciplinary cooperat ion and communication. Midwives, obstetricians, health visitors, GPs, and counsellors from voluntar y organisations such as the National Childbirth Trust or HomeStart may all identify early signs of mental ill-health. Usually it will be possible to d eal with the underlying problems at primary care level involving these professionals or voluntary workers, but there also needs to be easily accessib le back-up from adult and child mental health services as well as social services. 2.2.1 Prevention A report from The Royal College of Psychiatrists (2 002) outlines the importance of regular antenatal examinations with continuity of care to prevent dep ression during and after pregnancy. Sympathetic handling of anxiety with prompt feedback of informa tion concerning the progress of the pregnancy, especially after the ultrasound investigation or a complication of the pregnancy, will reduce unnecessary worry and the rate of anxiety states. Only one systematic review (Dennis 2005) has explor ed the effectiveness of different approaches to prevention with this population. This review found no clear evidence to recommend the implementation of antenatal and postnatal classes, early postpartum follow-up, continuity of care models, psychological debriefing in hospital and in terpersonal psychotherapy as an approach to preventing mental health problems. However, the rev iew found emerging evidence to support the provision of professional support (from midwives or health visitors) provided postnatally. Although one well-designed trial suggested that intensive ho me visits by nurses with at risk mothers were protective during the first six weeks postpartum, t he benefit was not maintained to 16 weeks. It is noteworthy that the 16-week assessment coincided wi th a decrease from weekly to monthly visits. Results from another trial showed that flexible, in dividualized postpartum care by midwives that incorporated assessment tools also had a preventive effect. 2.2.2 Identification of mental health problems In their evidence review for the NICE guidance, Der mott et al (2006) advise caution in the use of the term 'postnatal depression' as it can be misused to include any mental illness occurring postnatally and may result in other serious illnesses failing t o be identified. Common misconceptions about depression in the postnatal period include the view that symptoms and effects are less severe than those for depression at other times, and that they are entirely due to hormonal changes that will soon pass. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Dis orders criteria specify that for depression in the postnatal period, onset is within 4 weeks after bir th. However, there is general agreement that onset can occur any time within the first year (SIGN 2002 ; Dennis and Hodnett 2007). Specific risk factors for postnatal depression include a family history o f depression, a previous depressive episode and a traumatic delivery. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) is a brief, reliable screening questionnaire for depressive states in the postnatal period, and its routine use by trained health visitors is 50 recommended by the Royal College of Psychiatrists ( RCP 2002). Although the EPDS has been widely used in a variety of settings and in a number of co untries for over 20 years, there is a lack of evidence about the optimum timing and frequency of screening, and about its effectiveness as a first step in improving outcomes for women screened in pr imary care (Shakespeare 2001). While some have questioned its use in routine clinical care, o thers have advocated screening as being the best approach to improving detection and treatment of af fected women. Identification of the early signs of puerperal psyc hosis should lead to immediate psychiatric referral (RCP 2002). A recent systematic review of different methods used to identify PND Hewitt et al. (2009) found 14 identification strategies that have been validated among women during pregnancy or the postnatal period (specific tools: EPDS, Post partum Depression Screening Scale, Pregnancy Risk Questionnaire, and Predictive Index; generic depres sion identification strategies: the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), General Health Question naire (GHQ), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Hopkins Symptom Checklist, Hamilton Rating S cale for Depression (HAMD), Scale, Symptom Checklist-90-R, Raskin, a nd Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale). In a recent Cochrane review Austin et al. (2008) ex plored the effectiveness of antenatal psychosocial assessments. Psychosocial assessment programmes are designed to identify women who show early symptoms of distress, and/or have psychosocial risk factors known to be associated with clinical onset of mental health problems (including PND). Un iversal psychosocial assessment is a relatively new and still controversial undertaking within the maternity setting. Austin et al. found only two RCTs evaluating this approach to assessment (one in the maternity setting and the second comparing different providers). While the research findings indicated a trend in a raised level of clinician awareness for \"high level\" risk factors i n postnatal women, Austin et al. were unable to comment on the efficacy of antenatal psychosocial a ssessment in the public health context. 2.2.4 Non-Pharmacological Treatments Reviews have examined three different approaches fo r the prevention/treatment of postnatal depression that can be implemented by the primary h ealth care team. These include: Psychotherapies - psychosocial and psychological interventions includ e psychoeducational cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), in terpersonal psychotherapy (IPT), psychodynamic therapy, and non-directive counsellin g Supportive Programmes - delivered via telephone, home or clinic visits, or individual or group sessions in the postpartum period by a health professional or lay person Prescription of exercise Psychotherapies Five reviews have evaluated antenatal and/or postna tal therapist-led psychological interventions for postnatal et al., 2 004; Matthey 2004; Ogrodniczuk et al., 2003, Dennis and Hodnett, 2007). The most recent review u ndertaken by Dennis and Hodnett (2007) found that compared to usual care, psychosocial and psych ological interventions are effective treatments for postpartum depression. However, the methodologi cal quality of the included studies was not strong. Four trials evaluated the effect of CBT on postpartum depressive symptomatology, and beneficial effects were found. These results are co nsistent with a previous meta-analysis (Dobson 51 1989) which found CBT to be an effective treatment option for depression in general and for postnatal depression. However, Dennis and Hodnett n ote that considerable time, commitment and cost is required from CBT participants and approxim ately 10% to 40% fail to complete full treatment. Dennis and Hodnett included one trial which examine d the beneficial effects of IPT in decreasing depressive symptomatology, and one trial which eval uated the effect of psychodynamic therapy on the treatment of postpartum depression. Both found beneficial effects. Thus, Dennis and Hodnett concluded that structured CBT, IPT, and psychodynam ic therapy hold promise as effective treatment options but due to methodological weaknesses in the included studies definite conclusions cannot be reached for the effectiveness of these different treatment approaches. Supportive Therapies - Homevisits Dennis (Dennis 2005) examined the evidence on the e ffectiveness of psycho-social interventions to prevent and treat postnatal depression. The review found that women who received a preventive intervention were statistically overall just as lik ely to experience postnatal depression as those who received standard care. However, she found that int erventions that target at risk women, are individually based, or initiated postnatally are mo re likely to be beneficial. In addition there was a positive trend related to continuity of care (one t rial) and a clear beneficial effect with home visit s provided by a health professional (two trials). Within the primary care team, health visitors are w ell placed to identify mothers suffering from postnatal depression and to provide preventative sc reening and early interventions. Knapp et al (2011) reviewed the evidence from a number of UK tr ials of interventions provided by health visitors. These studies found that women who receiv ed the intervention delivered by health visitors were more likely to recover fully after 3 months. T argeted ante-natal intervention with high-risk groups was shown to reduce the average time mothers spent in a depressed state; and a combination of screening and psychologically inform ed sessions with health visitors was clinically effective 6 and 12 months after childbirth. The big gest direct costs of the interventions were associated with training (estimated at \u00a31,400 per h ealth visitor), plus the additional time spent by health visitors with mothers for screening and coun selling. In their review of postnatal support on health and wellbeing Shaw et al (2006) found that when women at high risk for postpartum depression or fam ily dysfunction were targeted for intervention, either nurse visits combined with case conferencing or a less intensive peer support programme improved maternal mental health outcomes. . Exercise Daley et al. (2009) examined the evidence for effec tiveness of exercise as a treatment option for post-natal depression (PND). This review included 5 studies (4 RCTs and 1 quasi-RCT) that looked at the effects of exercise, exercise plus social care, compared to no exercise and usual care, or no exercise and social support. Given the small number of studies with some methodological weaknesses, the findings are limited, but the revie w authors conclude that there is some support for exercise as a means of treating postnatal depressio n. However, the authors suggest this approach should be used as an adjunct to usual treatments ra ther than a replacement. 2.2.5 Cost Effectiveness In their recent cost effectiveness analysis Paulden et al. (2009) concluded that formal identification methods for postnatal depression do not seem to rep resent value for money for the NHS. The major 52 determinant of cost effectiveness seems to be the p otential additional costs of managing women incorrectly diagnosed as depressed. In terms of treatment, Knapp and McDaid (2011). est imate that when quality of life benefits to women are incorporated, the health visiting interve ntion provides a positive net benefit with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of arou nd \u00a34,500 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). 2.2.6 Guidelines The most recent NICE (2007) guidance on the identi fication and treatment of PND on antenatal and postnatal depression recommend At a woman's first contact with primary care (usual ly at 4 to 6 weeks and 3 to 4 months), healthcare professionals (including midwives, obste tricians, health visitors and GPs) should ask two questions to identify possible depression ( 1) During the past month, have you often been bothered by feeling down, depressed or hopeles s? (2) During the past month, have you often been bothered by having little interest or pl easure in doing things? A third question should be considered if the woman answers 'yes' to either of the initial questions. (3) Is this something you feel you need or want help with? (the Whooley Depression Screen) A woman has the right to be fully informed about al l aspects of her treatment and make decisions in partnership with her healthcare profes sional. If a woman is pregnant or breast feeding, her docto r should discuss with her the risks of taking or not taking medication to treat her illnes s at every stage, to help her come to a decision. Women requiring psychological treatment should be s een normally within 1 month of initial assessment, and no longer than 3 months afterwards. If a women does not have a specific mental illness but is feeling down or anxious, she should be offered support from professionals, voluntary or ganisations or other services to help manage her feelings during pregnancy or after birth . Healthcare professionals should assess and address the needs of the woman's partner and family members, including the welfare of the infant and other dependent children and adults. There should be clearly specified care pathways so that all primary and secondary healthcare professionals involved in the care of women in the antenatal and postnatal periods are aware how to access appropriate assessment and trea tment. Managed clinical networks should be established acr oss the whole country, to ensure access to perinatal expertise. This should include a speci alist multidisciplinary perinatal service in each locality, which provides direct services, cons ultation and advice to maternity services, other mental health services and community services and pathways of care for service users. However, a recent study by Paulden et al. (2009) on the cost effectiveness of screening concluded that routine screening (using the Whooley questions recommended by NICE guidance) for postnatal depression does not seem to represent value for mon ey for the NHS. 53 2.2.7 Gaps in evidence Evidence surrounding clinical and cost-effectivenes s of methods to identify PND is lacking (Hewitt et al. 2009). Further research should aim to identify the optimal identification strategy, in terms of ke y psychometric properties for postnatal populations. There is a need for research evaluating psychosocia l interventions which should include self-help groups (i.e., groups not facilitated by a health pr ofessional) to extend the testing of lay support models with mild to moderately depressed women (Den nis & Hodnett 2007). Future evaluations of group interventions should in clude measures that assess group dynamics, social comparisons, and the provision of peer (moth er-to-mother) support to determine the salutary components of support groups (Dennis & Hodnett 2007 ). Future research should consider the role the partne r plays in the prevention of or recovery from postpartum depression (Dennis & Hodnett 2007). Important postpartum treatment barriers such as sti gma, transport, childcare, and availability of services and high attrition rates found in some gro ups or clinic-based postpartum depression treatment studies suggest, the need for the evaluat ion of novel treatment modalities, including those provided via telephone or Internet (Dennis an d Hodnett 2007). 54 References for Section 2.2: Pregnant Women and New Mothers Austin MP, Lumley J (2003) \"Antenatal screening Priest SR., al.

This has led to some writers arguing that it is best to consider the sym ptoms of depression as occurring on a continuum of severity (Lewinsohn 2000). In parallel, the pers istence of symptoms and presence of other symptoms, degree of functionality and social impair ment all need to be considered when thinking about depression. Mild : Depression is described as mild when it has a neg ative but limited effect on daily life, for example, difficulty concentrating or motivating oneself to do the things normally enjoyed. Moderate : More of the symptoms are present in moderate depr ession than in mild depression and they are usually more obvious. There may be a clear reduction in functioning at home and in the workplace. Severe, sometimes known as clinical or major depres sion: Severe depression significantly interferes with an individual's ability to cope wit h their daily life - eating, sleeping and many other everyday activities seem impossible tasks whi ch can be life threatening as a person may be unable to look after themselves. There is al so a high risk of suicide. Some people may experience only one episode but several episode s in a lifetime are more common. In some circumstances a person's inability to function can lead to hospitalisation. Depression can often co-exist with anxiety leading to three possible diagnoses: (1) depression; (2) anxiety; (3) mixed depression and anxiety. In addit ion, people with severe depression may also develop psychotic symptoms making it difficult to d istinguish between depression and other forms of mental illness where psychosis is an important s ymptom, e.g. schizophrenia. Estimate prevalence of a depressive episode among 1 6-74 year olds in the UK (2000) was 2.6%. This rose to 11.4% higher for 'mixed depression and anxi ety' (Singleton 2001). Internationally, rates are consistently higher for females compared with males , estimated at between 1.5 and 2.5 times higher in women (Waraich 2004), although most UK survey fo und this was only marked for a depressive episode in those under 35 years, whereas for mixed anxiety and depression it was across the range (Singleton 2001). There is no single predictor of depression but vari ous studies have suggested the following factors are important: biochemical, genetics, environment, hormonal status, lifestyle, medication, long-term illness, trauma, socio economic situation (National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health 2010). It should be noted that depression is also more pro minent in patients with chronic illness: coronary heart disease (CHD), diabetes, Parkinson's Disease etc. For example, estimates suggest around 20% of patients with CHD will also suffer from depressi on (Tylee A. & Dickens C. 2011). Management of depression and treatments in people with chronic il lness should take careful account of other health professionals, medication and treatments involved ( see section on Patients with Chronic Illness for further information). As well as the personal and social consequences of depression there are also negative economic effects. Depression is associated with sickness abs ence and prevents many people seeking, maintaining or returning to employment. 58 2.3.1 Prevention The most recent review (van der Waerden et al 2011) narrowed the target population for prevention down to women from low socio economic backgrounds g iven the presence of a number of risk factors for depression. They identified 14 studies (reported in 18 papers) with the aim of investigating overall efficacy and moderators of in terventions targeted at reducing depressive symptoms in this population. It should be noted tha t women at risk of postnatal depression were included in this review and studies from high-incom e and lower-income countries were not distinguished between. Interventions included the offer of PST, CTB, IPT, and more commonly psycho-education and social support either at group or individual level. The au thors concluded that mental health benefits could be gained among disadvantaged women through interve ntions aimed at preventing major depression. In particular, they offered support for targeted psychosocial interventions, and interventions that included both individual and com munity components. 2.3.2 Identification Available research indicates that a significant pro portion of people with depression are not recognized when they attend primary care (Williams et al. 1995; Mitchell et al. 2009 cited by (National Collaborating Center for Mental Health 20 10). Mitchell and colleagues (2009) suggest that while GPs are able to rule out depression in most p eople who are not depressed with some accuracy, difficulty arises in diagnosing depressio n in all true cases. This may be focused on those with mild rather than moderate or severe depression (Kessler et al. 2003 in (National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health 2010)). Given this evidence, NICE guidelines (National Coll aborating Centre for Mental Health 2010) on depression and other mental health issues concluded that screening for depression should only be undertaken for high-risk population rather than gen eral population screening. High-risk groups identified included people with a history of depres sion, significant physical illness causing disabili ty, or other mental health problems e.g. dementia. This is now part of routine clinical work for GPs. As part of a stepped-care approach to depression, N ICE (2010) recommend two initial screening questions (Whooley questions) for high-risk populat ions before proceeding to further assessment. During the last month, have you often been bothered by feeling down, depressed or hopeless? During the last month, have you often been bothered by having little interest or pleasure in doing things? A 'yes' answer to either question warrants referral for further assessment by a trained mental health professional. A number of validated tools are available for asses sment of depression (e.g. Beck Depression Inventory, Patient Health Questionnaire, General He alth Questionnaire, Self-Rated Depression Scale, Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale ). The Geriatric Depression Scale is specifically for older people and there are additional scales de vised for people from Black and Ethnic Minorities (e.g. Amritsar Depression Inventory, Caribbean Cult ure-Specific Screen for emotional distress). A review of screening tools conducted as part of th e large-scale review developed by the NCCMH and the Royal College of Psychiatrists (National Co llaborating Centre for Mental Health 2010) 59 suggested the available data supports ongoing use o f the Whooley questions as first stage of case identification. However, given the lack of specific ity, people with positive responses would benefit from a more detailed clinical assessment. There was no one tool identified as most effective. Scales varied a great deal in terms of targeted population , number of items and scoring systems. Some scales had better specificity but not as much sensi tivity (e.g. Patient Health Questionnaire-9), while others had specific scales for older people (e.g. G eriatric Depression Scale). For specific tools for minority populations, there was insufficient data t o draw firm conclusions. Screening for depression and anxiety With the introduction, in 1996, of the United Kingd om general practice contract quality and outcomes framework (QOF), there has been an incenti ve for GPs to obtain measures of the severity of depression at the start of treatment for all dia gnosed cases. The intention behind this procedure is to improve the targeting of treatment interventi on in keeping with NICE guidelines. The use of screening information has been extensively examined at least in terms of diagnostic accuracy, and for the identification of new cases. Such screening devices could also be used for the purpose of monitoring the course of a condition, and for an ex amination of the effectiveness of an intervention, or to detect relapse cases. Most such studies have looked at the test sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity is defined in terms of the proportion o f true cases that are correctly identified; while specificity, on the other hand, is viewed as the pr oportion of true negative cases that are correctly identified. The use of such screening instruments within a wide r context has yet to receive common acceptance among GPs (Dowrick et al 2009). According to Dowri ck et al \"General Practitioners considered their practical wisdom and clinical judgement ('pronesis' ) to be more important than objective assessments and were concerned that the assessment reduced the human element of the consultation.\" Patients, on the other hand, were m ore positive about the using of screening devices, regarding them as a useful supplement to medical ju dgement, and as part of a fuller assessment of their problems. In a BMJ summary article on the NICE guidelines rel ating to depression and anxiety Pilling et al (2011) provided, for the consideration of GPs, ques tions that might be asked of patients where these conditions were suspected. In terms of depression they suggested that consideration should be given to the asking the following questions. During the past month, have you often been bothered by feeling down, depressed, or hopeless? During the past month have you often been bothered by having little interest or pleasure in doing things? Where a person responds positively to one or both q uestions, a further assessment may be put in place; and this may involve the use of more in dept h screening devices, such as the patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9) or the hospital anxiety and d epression scale (HADS). In a study, using these questions, the sensitivity was reported as 96% (Arroll et al, 2003). In other words, few true cases of depression were missed. O n the other hand, among those not seen as suffering from depression 57% were correctly identi fied. In a later study Arroll et al (2005) evaluate d these questions when presented in a verbal rather t han in the written form. Under these circumstances sensitivity was 97%, which is much hi gher than has frequently been reported (Nease, Malouin., 2003) and with a specificity of 67% both questions were endorsed. The number of false positives for every true positive when only one que stion was asked was 5 to 1. In this study (Arroll et al, 2003) the chance of missing someone who was depressed would have been 0.3% among those with a negative test. \"This is common in screening studies, which are in essence a diagnostic test 60 performed in a 'low prevalence' setting. This is not a major concern with depression, as further clarification can be obtained by asking more questi ons (the reference standard) or referral to another health professional.\" In a follow, up study Arroll, Goodyear, Smith et al (2005) and colleagues added an additional question \"is this something with which you today wo uld like help? \"With three possible responses: \"no,\" \"yes, but not today,\" or \"yes.\" A positive r esponse was taken as a \"yes\" or \"yes, but not today\". A response to: (a) either of the screening questions (b) the help question alone or (c) eithe r screening question plus the help question was taken as a positive answer. A patient with a negative response to the help question had around a 1% chanc e of being depressed. Those who screened positive on the help question alone had a sensitivi ty value of 75% and a specificity of 94%. For the two screening questions alone the sensitivity was 9 6%, and this was also the value for either screening question plus the help question. The re spective specificity values were 78% and 89%. The addition of the help question has led to an imp rovement in the number of correctly classified negative cases. Based on these and related evidenc e Arroll et al., (2005) suggested that these questions should be presented to all new patients a nd to those patients whom the doctor has not seen in the past two years. Anxiety is frequently comorbid with depression, and consideration to this possibility should be considered (Pilling et al 2011). For the screening of anxiety Pilling et al (2011) suggest the use of the two or seven item general anxiety disorder scale. Generalized anxiety disorder scales (GAD-2 and GAD- 7) GAD-2 (short screening) Over the past two weeks how often have you been bot hered by the following problems: 1. Feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge? 2. Being unable to stop or control worrying? GAD-7(seven item) This comprises the two questions above plus the fol lowing questions. Over the past two weeks, how often have you been bo thered by the following problems: 3. Worrying too much about different things? 4. Trouble relaxing? 5. Being so restless that it is hard to sit still? 6. Becoming easily annoyed or irritable? 7. Feeling afraid as if something awful might happen? Scoring for both scales, for each question: not at all=0; several days=1; more than half the days=2; nearly every day=3 61 The use of such measures may improve the recognitio n of mental health disorders. Currently, under a voluntary annual incentive programme among GPs in England, the use of screening devices for depression is encouraged. At present no such incen tive scheme is in place for anxiety. Pilling et al ., (2011) observe that while the NICE guidelines \"prov ides clear advice about the criteria on which to base referrals for various psychological treatments , but access to such treatment remain limited, and clinicians may be over-using medication, particular ly in milder disorders.\" This, they go on to point out, indicates the importance of supporting evidenc e based psychological interventions, such as the Improving Access to Psychological Therapists progra mme in order to comply with treatments in line with NICE guidelines. The use and evaluation of such screening instrument s however, is not without problems. The issue of calibration across tests can lead to very differ ent classifications. For example Kendrick et al., (2009), in an analysis of medical records within 38 general practice sites in England, examined responses to the 9 item patient health questionnair e (PHQ-9), the hospital anxiety and depression scale and the Beck depression inventory. In the UK GPs are encouraged through an incentive system to obtain screening information before commencing o n an intervention for depression. Under these circumstances they noted that 79.1% of patients who had completed screening information using either the PHQ-9 or the HADS received a prescriptio n for an antidepressant, and that 22.8% were referred to a specialist. However, they noted an i nconsistency in the classification of moderate and severe depression cases depending on the measure us ed, suggesting a need for a change in threshold scores. Thombs et al., (2011) in a systematic review of scr eening for depression suggest that many of the previous studies which set out to evaluate screenin g measures for depression have rarely excluded already diagnosed patients. The inclusion of such individuals, within the calculations, is likely to result in inflated accuracy levels when compared to when the instrument would be used to identify new cases in clinical practice. They suggest that this information should be more available in the review literature. 2.3.4 Treatment A range of therapies are available for treatment of depression, some of which might be offered in secondary rather than primary care. However, the ma jority of patients with depression are cared for in primary care (NICE 2011). This section focuses o n psychosocial therapies and does not include the use of antidepressants which is outside the scope o f this evidence review. These can be divided into low and high intensity tr eatments and are recommended depending on the severity of the depressive symptoms experienced by patients. Low-intensity psychological interventions for sub threshold depr essive symptoms or mild depression: Individual guided self-help Psychosocial education Computerised cognitive behaviour therapy (CCBT) Exercise 62 Counselling (may also be used for high intensity in terventions) Psychodynamic psychotherapy (may also be used for h igh intensity interventions) Problem solving therapy (PST) Antidepressants if symptoms persisted for long peri od of time. High intensity psychological interventions for people with moderat e-to-severe depression and include: Group or individual CBT IPT Behavioural activation (BA) Couples therapy Antidepressants if a history of moderate or severe depression. Many of the studies published in the literature con sidered the effectiveness of treatments rather than the delivery setting so it is difficult to ext rapolate findings for effectiveness in primary care . However, depending on the skills mix of staff emplo yed by the practice, interventions and treatments could well be available in primary care settings. Therefore all are reported below. Where reference is made to use in primary care, this is h ighlighted. Self-help Self-help is defined as a self-administered interve ntion, which makes use of books, other self-help manuals, computerised information etc. derived from an evidence-based intervention. A healthcare professional can introduce, monitor and review outc omes of the treatment. The NCCMH (2010) examined sixteen trials that compa red standard care and wait list controls with: individual guided self-help self-help with frequent support self-help with minimum duration support (no more th an 2 hours in total) group guided self-help self-help with support by mail. Overall, the evidence indicates that guided self-he lp has a beneficial effect in people with both mild depression and sub-threshold depression. In particu lar, the evidence would support individual guided self-help with support of minimum duration w hen compared with a waiting list control group. Further, SIGN (2010) concluded that self-hel p was more effective when based on CBT or behavioural principles. Psychoeducation Psychoeducation is an approach that uses structured forms of patient information to learn more about mental health. It can take various forms, for example, groups, brochures, books, single consultation. 63 Donker et al. (2009) reviewed five papers reporting on four studies of psycho-education. They argued that while there is a lack of evidence for t he effectiveness of psycho-education, brief passive psychoeducation interventions for depression can re duce symptoms. In this respect, they argue that it should be considered as an alternative treatment given the low cost and immediacy of access. This could be offered through primary care or community models, although the quality of the intervention should be considered before implementa tion. CCBT Increasing use of technology has led to other treat ment avenues being explored. One increasingly popular option is computerised cognitive behavioura l therapy (CCBT) that is the use of computers to deliver a structured programme of care, based on th e principles as treatment provided by a CBT therapist. Mostly CCBT is offered as part of a step ped-care programme and developed to treat a range of depression and / or anxiety disorders. The NCCMH (2010) and SIGN (2010) included a health technology assessment review which had identified ten studies of CCBT and reported consist ent evidence of reduction in depressive symptoms. This was particularly when compared with a non-active control group as no clinical effects were noted when compared with an active con trol. In particular, 'Beating the Blues' was identified as effective and cost effective when com pared with treatment as usual. Exercise and depression The effectiveness of exercise as a method of preven ting and treating depression has been the subject of research for many decades. \"Exercise on prescription\" schemes have become increasingly popular in the UK (Biddle et al., 1994 in NCCMH 201 0). Several theories for the effect of exercise on mood have been posed: The positive feedback from other people develops an increase sense of self-worth Activity may act as a distraction from negative tho ughts Mastery of a new skill could help boost confidence Social contact with others may have a positive effe ct Activity may have physiological effects (e.g. chang e in endorphin and monoamine levels) The studies included in reviews incorporate individ ual and group exercise as well as a range of different aerobic and non-aerobic activities. NCCMH (2010) included 25 RCTs, which compared physi cal activity against control groups (no exercise, waiting list, psychotherapy, pharmacother apy, combination treatments). Overall, physical activity was more effective at reducing depressive symptoms among people with mild and subthreshold depression than a no physical activity control group, and in particular, support for group-based physical activity was reported. However , the effect was reduced at follow up, indicating short-term benefits. There was insufficient evidence available on physic al activity compared with antidepressants, psychosocial or psychological interventions. SIGN ( 2010) drew similar conclusions on the effects of exercise on depression, but also pointed out the qu ality of the evidence was mixed and was difficult to condense given the range and intensity of exerci se considered through the trials. Other reviews echo the conclusions drawn by NCCMH and SIGN (Lawlo r DA 2001; Mead GE, Morley W et al. 2009). 64 Counselling Counselling is a process that gives an individual a n opportunity to explore and clarify ways of living more resourcefully and with a greater sense of well -being. Overall the evidence for counselling is very limited and complicated by the different thera peutic models adopted in the studies. In studies available to NCCMH (2010), no difference was noted between usual care and usual care with counselling, and there was insufficient evidence to comment on CBT compared with counselling. This was a finding supported by SIGN (2010). However, Cape et al (2010) in a comparison of treat ments for anxiety, depression and mixed anxiety and depression, considered the value of counselling in primary care. From the meta-analysis (n=8) they found small effects for the use of counselling to reduce the symptoms of depression, and mixed anxiety and depression, when used in primary care. Psychodynamic psychotherapy This is a model where patients are given an opportu nity to explore feelings and conscious and unconscious conflicts originating in the past, with a technical focus of interpreting and working through conflicts. Ten studies focused on short-term psychodynamic psy chotherapy were reported in NCHMM (2010) but the overall dataset was weak and characterized by a number of contradictory findings. There is some limited evidence for the benefits of short-ter m psychodynamic psychotherapy in populations with sub-threshold symptoms over waiting list or us ual care controls, but inconsistent findings when compared with antidepressants. Problem solving therapy (PST) PST is a discrete, time-limited, structured psychol ogical intervention focused on learning to cope with specific problem areas, to break them down int o manageable tasks, problem solve and develop coping behaviours for the problems. PST is a brief intervention which was specifically developed for use in primary care (Bower 2002). The NCCMH (2010) only included 2 studies in this ar ea but concluded that while there were no significant differences noted between problem-solvi ng and other therapies, there was insufficient data available to draw robust conclusions on availa ble evidence. However, SIGN, found evidence that PST was more eff ective than control groups and cited a well- conducted meta-analysis (Cuijpers et al. 2007 in SI GN 2010) which identified 13 studies for inclusion using placebo and TAU controls. The authors conclud ed that PST was an effective treatment for depression, it had varying effects on depression bu t more work is needed to determine optimum effectiveness. Cape et al. (2010) however considered the effective ness of PST specifically delivered through primary care on anxiety, depression and mixed anxiety and depre ssion. They found some limited support (n=12) for the effect of PST on depression and mixed anxiety and depression. It should be noted that therapies tend to be shorter when delive red through primary compared to secondary care. One review (Huibers MJ, Beurskens A et al. 2007) re ported solely on psychosocial interventions delivered in primary care. Other reviews report on the intervention rather than the delivery venue, but this was a specific parameter for inclusion cri teria for the authors. They identified 10 studies a nd concluded that there was evidence that PST delivere d by GPs had an impact on major depression. 65 However, they also pointed out the limited evidence base and need for more work to be conducted in primary care as the delivery venue. Cognitive Behavioural Therapies (CBT) When RCTs were compared by NCCMH (2010) they found evidence to support the effectiveness of CBT in reducing depressive symptoms. In particular, CBT were broadly equivalent to antidepressants, but at longer-term follow up, CBT was more effectiv e, and people who had CBT were less likely to relapse into depression compared with those who had previously been treated with antidepressants. When compared with other therapies designed for dep ression (IPT, behavioural activation, psychotherapy), there was insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions about relative efficacy of different treatments. The review also identified th ree studies that compared CBT in primary care to usual care, but there were no significant differenc es noted. However, the results are difficult to interpret as patients under GP care may have been u sing antidepressants. Cape et al. (2010) considered therapies in primary care and found evidence to support the use of CBT for treatment of anxiety, depression and mixed anxiety and depression. Results indicated CBT was an effective therapy for use with all three gro ups. However, it was significantly more effective for use with patients suffering from symptoms of an xiety compared with other groups when delivered through primary care. In their recent systematic review, SIGN (2010) cons idered CBT as a treatment for depression against usual care or waiting list controls. It was deemed at least as effective as antidepressant medication, and in follow up studies had lasting effects up to two years. Although very limited, there was some support for individual rather than group CBT with f ewer symptoms at follow up reported by those in receipt of individual CBT. There was some compariso n of CBT against other therapies and it found to be as least as effective as psychodynamic therapy a nd interpersonal therapy (SIGN 2010). Moulding et al (2007) examined 8 studies (6 RCTs) o f GP provision of psychological therapies. Interestingly 5 of the studies were conducted in th e UK. They concluded that there was inconclusive evidence for the effectiveness of CBT delivered by GPs. Interpersonal therapy Interpersonal therapy (IPT) is a structured psychol ogical intervention that: works to identify effects of interpersonal conflict s, role transition, grief and loss etc and effects on current symptoms; and seeks to reduce symptoms by learning to cope or res olve problem areas. Fourteen studies reported by the NCCMH (2010) compa ring IPT to (a) usual GP care (including medication), (b) antidepressants, and (c) IPT plus antidepressants. While the numbers of studies were small, some significant differences in treatme nt were recorded. There was a difference noted between usual care and IPT, with a reduction in sel f-reported symptoms of depression for the intervention group. In addition, there was a differ ence noted in the intervention group who were offered IPT alongside antidepressants compared with those taking antidepressants with no psychological therapy, although no significant diff erences were noted between those offered IPT alone and those on antidepressants alone. There was also some support for the use of IPT to prevent relapse of depression. 66 SIGN (2010) considered a systematic review of 9 stu dies and concluded that IPT was more effective than placebo, and similar in effectiveness to antid epressants and to CBT in patients with depression. There was some limited evidence for CBT as more eff ective than IPT for patients with severe depression in terms of symptom reduction, although no information was available for longer-term follow up. The latest systematic review not included in the re view of reviews above (Cuijpers 2011) examined 38 studies of IPT against various controls. Their c onclusions reflected other findings. IPT has value as a therapy but no significant differences were noted between IPT and other interventions available. While it was less effective than pharmacotherapy, t he combination of IPT and drugs appeared to have more impact on relapse prevention than drugs t herapy alone. Moulding et al (2007) examined 8 studies (6 RCTs) o f GP provision of psychological therapies. Interestingly five of the studies were conducted in the UK. They concluded that there was inconclusive evidence for the effectiveness of IPT delivered by GPs. Behavioural activation Behavioural activation is a discrete, time-limited, structured psychological intervention where therapist and patient: Work together to identify effects of behaviour on s ymptoms, feelings, states and problem areas Seek to reduce symptoms and behaviour through behav ioural tasks related to avoidance, graded exposure, initiating positively reinforced b ehaviours. Six studies compared behavioural activation with pl acebo, antidepressants, and other psychological interventions. NCCMH (2010) indicated that there wa s insufficient evidence to draw substantive conclusions with regard to the relative efficacy of behavioural activation. SIGN (2010) also reviewed the area and concluded th at from a review of 16 studies, behavioural activation was effective in reducing depressive sym ptoms compared with usual care or waiting list control. In comparison to other treatments, specifi cally cognitive therapy, it was as effective. Couples therapy Couples therapy is a time-limited psychological int ervention where: the intervention aims to help participants understa nd their interactions on each other to change nature of interventions to develop a more supportive and less conflictual relationship. In total NCCMH (2010) identified six RCT studies th at compared couples therapy with waiting list controls, CBT and IPT. There were differences in re ported depressive symptoms between those receiving couples therapy and on waiting list. Howe ver, there was no difference noted with other therapies or insufficient evidence to draw conclusi ons. Again SIGN (2010) reviewed the evidence and identif ied a further systematic review of marital therapy for depression. A variety of control compar isons (CBT, IPT, drug therapy, combination 67 therapies, and waiting list) led to no firm conclus ion on the effectiveness of couples therapy compared with other treatments. Peer support A recent review has considered the impact of peer s upport on depressive symptoms. This community-based approach is of interest for primary care, given the limited resources available and the growing emphasis on partnership working. Pfieff er and colleagues (2011) found that results from 9 RCTs indicated that peer support interventions im proved depression symptoms more than TAU, and had some limited evidence that effects might be comparable to group CBT. Support for this approach as an effective component for the treatmen t of depression, particularly given the low-cost of such an approach, was found. As with other treat ments, the evidence base was limited and the authors made research recommendations for more work in this area to fully explore the impact of peer support and understand further the mechanisms involved in making it effective. 2.3.5 GPs role Moulding et al (2007) conducted a broad review of m ental health management and treatment focusing on the Australian healthcare system. Nonet heless, they reviewed international literature on the role of GPs in delivering more complex psycholo gical strategies and they felt there was: Good evidence that GPs delivery of PST was more eff ective than usual treatment and equivalent to treatment by antidepressant medicatio n, but unclear to what extent results are applicable to real world settings Inconclusive evidence for the effectiveness of GP d elivered CBT or IPT. Cuijpers et al (2009) conducted a meta-analysis of 15 RCT studies in which the use of psychological therapies in primary care was compared to use in ot her settings. Seven studies included participants who had been referred by the GP, while six identifi ed participants from general screening tools administered in the waiting room. They concluded ps ychological treatment of depression is effective in primary care patients, and when referred for tre atment by their GP (rather than identified through general screening), no lower in effect size than other settings. 2.3.5 Cost effectiveness There was limited evidence available for cost effec tiveness of different interventions for the treatment of depression. One study looked at the co st effectiveness of CCBT packages and they were judged to be cost effective when compared to standa rd care or TAU in the treatment of subthreshold, and mild to moderate depressive sympt oms (Kaltenthaler 2008). One intervention in particular was drawn out as effective and cost effe ctive Beating the Blues when compared with TAU. Some limited evidence was available for CBT but the evidence base is very weak. The one study available indicated that group CBT was more costly than standard clinical treatment, but that for individuals resistant to standard treatment, adjunc tive CBT was more costly but more effective than clinical treatment alone (NCCMH 2010). Schulberg and colleagues (2002) did examine the cos t effectiveness of providing psychotherapy in primary care, but at the time there was limited evi dence available, and authors were unable to draw any conclusions about cost effectiveness or otherwi se of treatment in primary care settings. 68 There was no review level evidence of cost effectiv eness identified for other interventions outlined above. 2.3.6 Guidelines As stated above, the evidence presented in the lite rature was focused on the treatment rather than the setting, so it is difficult to extrapolate spec ifically for primary care. The same is true for two sets of health service guidelines. There are two recent sets of UK guidance: SIGN (201 0) produced guidelines on Non-pharmaceutical management of depression in adults: A national clin ical guideline, and made a series of recommendations. They found a body of evidence directly applicable t o the target population and a consistency of evidence to support: Behavioural activation as a treatment option for pa tients with depression Individual CBT as a treatment option for people wit h depression Interpersonal therapy as a treatment option for peo ple with depression Guided self-help based on CBT or behavioural princi ples as a treatment option In the context of self-help, computerised CBT as an option. There was a slightly weaker but still consistent bo dy of evidence to support: Problem solving therapy Short term psychodynamic psychotherapy Structured exercise. There was insufficient consistent evidence on which to base a recommendation for counselling as an effective treatment for depression. NICE (NCCMH, 2010) issued guidelines for practition ers in England and promoted a person centred approach to treatment and care, taking into conside ration individual needs and preferences. Delivery of treatment should be agreed with patient s and again a recommendation for a stepped care approach to intervention taken. With regard to specific interventions, like SIGN, N ICE recommend the use of the following psychosocial therapies for treatment of patients wi th subthreshold or mild to moderate depression: Individual guided self-help based on the principles of CBT Computerized CBT Structured group physical activity programme 69 For people with moderate depression: Group-based CBT or individual CBT for patients who decline group-based CBT, or for whom it is not appropriate, or where a group is not available Behavioural couples therapy for people who have a r egular partner and where the relationship may contribute to the development or maintenance of depression, or where involving the partner is considered to be of potential therapeuti c benefit. They also include a range of recommendations around drug treatments which are outside the scope of this current research in terms of evidence prese ntation but useful in this section for completeness of information. Antidepressants should not be routi nely prescribed for patients with subthreshold symptoms or mild depression in patients with a chro nic health problem, as the risk-benefit ratio is poor. Rather consider for patients with: Subthreshold depressive symptoms that have continue d for a long period of time or persists after other interventions Mild depression that complicates care of a physical health problem A history of moderate to severe depression. In terms of delivery of care, a stepped care approa ch is recommended, but for those with moderate to severe depression and a chronic health problem w hose depression has not responded to other treatments, collaborative care should be considered . 2.3.7 Gaps in the Available Evidence There are a number of research gaps identified thro ugh the evidence and apparent from information presented above. Primarily there is a need for more evidence on the efficacy of psychosocial interventions delivered in primary care, or certain ly more attention paid to the specific contribution of primary care in the identification and treatment of depression. While evidence supports some treatments, e.g. CBT, more research is required on others e.g. counselling, PST, couples therapy to determine the impact. In addition, comparative studies are required to identify the strengths and added value of individual treatments when compared to each other. There is also a need for more information on the co st effectiveness of programmes, delivered through various settings e.g. primary care, mental health workers, secondary care. Finally, local research documenting current approac hes to the treatment of depression adopted by primary care teams across Northern Ireland would be useful in determining the next steps for moving forward in this area. In the conclusion to their 2006 paper, Gunn et al n ote: \"System level interventions implemented in the USA, with patients willing to take anti-depress ant medication, lead to a modest increase in recovery from depression. Whether or not such syst ems of care are cost-effective in the long-term is unresolved. The relevance of these intervention s to countries that have stronger primary care 70 systems (e.g. UK, Netherlands, Canada, Australia, N Z) is not known. It is inappropriate to assume that these types of interventions can be 'transplan ted' to a different health care setting with the same effect as observed in the USA\". This study ex amined 11 clinical trials, ten of which took place in America. They examined these studies using CONS ORT reporting criteria, pointing to the many limitations in much of the reported research, and c alling for more research to be undertaken outside the USA. This paper points to the paucity of knowl edge on which much of our treatment for depression within primary care system is based. 71 References for Section 2.3: Depression Arroll, B., Khin, N., Kerse, N.

While they can e xist in isolation, they more commonly occur with other anxiety and depressive disorders. According to Brown and colleagues (2001) the key fe ature of GAD is excessive anxiety and worry occurring over a 6 month period. Patients find it d ifficult to control the anxiety and worry and the condition can be accompanied by other symptoms e.g. fatigue, concentration, irritability and disturbed sleep patterns. It is often co-morbid wit h depression with estimates of 45% suffering both, making accurate diagnosis more difficult (Wittchen 2002). GAD can also co-occur with physical conditions e.g. arthritis and may mimic some (e.g. hyperthyroidism) and due to the somatic symptoms of anxiety, people presenting in primary care may report somatic or sleep problems rather than ps ychological symptoms of anxiety (National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health 2011). A large part of the economic cost of anxiety disord ers is attributable to non-medical psychiatric treatment. In addition to increased visits to prima ry care professionals, people with GAD often have 75 more consultations with hospital specialists given the somatic symptoms of the illness (Wittchen 2002). The most recent figures suggest that the estimated proportion of people in England with GAD is 4.4%. As with depression, GAD is more common in wom en, between 1.5 and 2.5 times higher than in men (McManus 2009). 2.4.2 Prevention There was no review level evidence identified for t he prevention of initial onset of GAD, although there is a growing body of primary studies looking at sub-threshold GAD and early signs of worrying. However, there is some evidence relating to relapse prevention as part of overall assessment of the effectiveness of treatments available to help peopl e with GAD. The emphasis on relapse is important as GAD can be described as a chronic, relapsing con dition where recurrence of illness is common, even if the short-term impact of treatment has been positive (National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health 2011). 2.4.3 Identification According to various writers ((Wittchen 2002), reco gnition of GAD in primary care is poor resulting in a high proportion of people receiving inappropriate or no treatment. In a recent survey (McManus 2009) only 33% of patients with GAD reported receiv ing treatment. One reason given is the lack of effective communication skills on the part of some GPs who are unable to pinpoint the nature of the illness (NICE 2011). Populations at increased risk of developing GAD sho uld be considered for assessment and screening. They include people with: Chronic physical health problems Other anxiety and depressive disorders Tendency for alcohol misuse. Source: (National Collaborating Centre for Mental H ealth 2011) NICE (2011) conducted a systematic review of assess ment tools for anxiety symptoms. They concluded that with regard to ultra brief instrumen ts (1-3 items) the GAD-2 was the most diagnostically accurate for use in primary care. GA D-2 consists of the following questions: Over the last two weeks, how often have you been bo thered by the following problems: 1. Feeling nervous, anxious or on edge? 2. Not being able to stop or control worrying? With regard to longer instruments (4-12 items), the GAD -7 had the best diagnostic accuracy in primary care. This instrument included the two ques tions above, as well as further information on worrying too much about different things, relaxatio n, restlessness, irritability and fear. 76 2.4.4 Treatment In 2011, the NCCMH reviewed evidence around general anxiety disorder (GAD) and mixed disorders, including panic disorders. Self-help While non-facilitated self-help was found to have m oderate effects on outcomes measured compared to non-active control groups, there was in sufficient evidence available on non-guided self- help to draw any conclusions as to the effectivenes s or non-effectiveness of this approach. However, the advantage of this approach is the low cost, whi ch was taken into consideration when recommendations were made (see below). Guided self-help (e.g. computer assisted self-help) again demonstrated moderate effects on outcome measures against waiting list controls. How ever, the quality was mixed and small, again making it difficult to make firm conclusions withou t the need for more evidence. One study (Titov 2009) did find significant impact on anxiety, worry and depression when comparing CCBT with a waiting list control group and a significant improv ement in remission and response. However, this was based on one trial, which constitutes insuffici ent evidence for the purposes of this review. CCBT The most recent review indicated some evidence favo uring CCBT when compared with controls for improving panic severity and depression scores. Ini tial evidence also shows CCBT is comparable to face-to-face CBT. However, there is no CCBT package currently available in the NHS and the evidence is limited therefore more work is needed to develop the potential of this route for the treatment of anxiety and depression. Psychosocial education Again the evidence identified was limited but did n ote a small effect on outcomes measures when targeted at mixed anxiety populations. However, it is not possible to make further comment as there is a general lack of information regarding this app roach. CBT As described above, CBT is a working collaboration between therapist and patient to devise a shared plan to achieve specific goals. 21 primary RCTs wer e examined by NCCMH (2011), which compared CBT to waiting list controls and other therapies (a pplied relaxation, psychodynamic therapy, non- directive therapy). When compared to non-active wai ting list controls, CBT trials showed a statistical significant improvement in non-remission and clinic al-rated anxiety scores. Comparisons to other treatments were difficult to comment on, given qual ity and size of evidence base. No substantive differences could be found between CBT and applied relaxation, although there was some evidence to support CBT over psychodynamic therapies. Some e vidence does exist to support CBT over non- directive therapy, but difficulties with the studie s make this again difficult to conclude with certai nty. More research is required in this area. Applied relaxation Applied relaxation was developed for treatment of p hobias but has wider application to anxiety disorders. It focuses on applying muscular relaxati on in situations that evoke feelings of anxiety and worry. There are various elements to the approach, described in more detail elsewhere, but incorporate progressive muscle relaxation, release only relaxation, cue-controlled relaxation, rapid relaxation, applied relaxation. NCCMH (2011) report on four trials which compared a pplied relaxation to waiting list controls and 77 non-directive therapy. Significant differences were noted between those receiving therapy and non- active groups, but less difference was noted betwee n applied relaxation and non-directive therapy. Psychodynamic therapy Again as described above, this approach allows the exploration of feelings and conflicts with a focus on interpretation and working through conflicts. On ly two studies were identified through the NCCMH (2011) review comparing this approach to an a ctive comparator and non-directive therapy. No real differences were noted but the evidence bas e is small and difficult to make recommendations on the basis of two studies. Role of GP There is no review level information on the effecti veness of the GP in delivering treatments to reduce the symptoms of GAD. However, Moulding et al (2007) did find some emerging support for the use of guided self-help for anxiety disorders. This should be investigated further . 2.4.5 Cost effectiveness No reviews were identified that provided cost effec tiveness evidence for low or high intensity psychological interventions for people with GAD or mixed anxiety disorders that were considered relevant to the UK healthcare system. 2.4.6 Guidance NICE guidance on the management and treatment of GA D was issued in 2011 to practitioners in primary, secondary and community care. This guidanc e recommends early identification of GAD with particular attention to specific groups of higher r isk individuals. Following initial detection, treat ment should be offered using a stepped care approach in consultation with the patient, taking their views and needs into consideration. Low intensity psychol ogical interventions recommended include: Individual non-facilitated self-help Individual guided self-help Psycho-educational groups For those where symptoms do not respond to low inte nsity interventions, practitioners should consider offering high intensity psychological inte rventions or drug treatment. High intensity interventions recommended include: CBT Applied relaxation therapy. Although this review does not cover drug treatments , it is worth pointing out that NICE specifically states that primary care practitioners should not o ffer antipsychotic drugs for the treatment of GAD. If no improvements or response to treatment is note d at this stage, practitioners are advised to consider referral to specialist services, particula rly if the person is at risk of self-harm, or suici de, or have other comorbid problems. 78 2.4.7 Support for families and carers There is guidance (NCCMH 2011) rather than evidence for supporting families and carers involved in supporting a person with GAD. Practitioners are ask ed to consider: Their mental and physical health needs Providing information and signposting to other serv ices Offering written and verbal information on manageme nt of GAD including their role in supporting the patient Providing information about crisis management and s teps to get help. 2.4.8 Gaps in evidence One criticism is the lack of early identification w ithin primary care, possibly linked to the skills o f practitioners. More information is needed on the av ailable skills in primary care teams, and appropriate tools for use to improve detection and improvement treatment of GAD within primary care settings. More evidence on the most appropriate model of care for GAD is recommended. It is complicated by the co- presentation of physical symptoms and often co-morbidity with physical and mental health problems. However, evidence currently is US-based a nd difficult to translate to a UK situation. There is an acute need for more evidence on the rel evant impact of low intensity psychosocial therapies on GAD and mixed anxiety disorders, parti cularly focusing on primary care settings; and in particular to explore the further potential of CCBT which has some supporting but limited evidence. 79 References for Section 2.4: GAD Brown, TA., O'Leary, TA., Barlow, DH.

Th e onset of psychosis is usually preceded by a period of non- psychotic symptoms, known as prodromal symptoms. The symptoms of full-blown schizophrenia include hallucinations, delusions, disordered thinking, and emotional withdrawal. There is some e vidence that a delay in receiving adequate treatment reduces the chances or the extent of reco very. The first few years after onset can be particularly upsetting and chaotic, and there is a higher risk of suicide (Hawton et al. 2005). It is estimated that each year in England 15,763 pe ople exhibit early (prodromal) symptoms before the onset of full psychosis (McCrone et al 2009 in Knapp and McDaid 2011). Progression of the disease is associated with higher costs to public s ervices (including health, social care, and crimina l justice), lost employment, and greatly diminished q uality of life for the patient and their family. I n 2008 analysis estimated the average annual direct c osts per average patient with schizophrenia at \u00a310,605, and total costs (including lost employment ) at \u00a319,078. The corresponding costs for bipolar disorder and related conditions were \u00a31,424 and \u00a34, 568. Total costs for these conditions combined were estimated at \u00a33.9bn for services and \u00a39.2bn fo r services and lost employment. Schizophrenia is commonly associated with a number of other conditions, such as depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, personalit y disorder and substance misuse (NICE 2009). 81 2.5.2 Detection of Early Symptoms of Psychosis There are no systematic reviews on the effectivenes s of early detection of early symptoms within primary care. Early intervention services aim to identify the ear ly symptoms of psychosis, reduce the risk of transition to full psychosis and shorten the durati on of untreated psychosis for those who do develop it. Such services include the provision of sessions of cognitive behavioural therapy, psychotropic medication, and contact with psychiatr ists; this contrasts with usual treatment which typically consists of GP and counsellor contacts. Early intervention in schizophrenia has two element s that are distinct from standard care: early detection and phase-specific treatment. Both elemen ts may be offered as supplements to standard care, or may be provided through a specialised earl y intervention team. Early intervention is now well established as a therapeutic approach in Ameri ca, Europe and Australasia, but it is unclear how far early detection, phase-specific treatments, and the use of early intervention teams are underpinned by evidence of effectiveness. In broad terms, early intervention has two objectiv es: the first is to prevent the onset of schizophrenia in people with prodromal symptoms; th e second is to provide effective treatment to people in the early stages of schizophrenia, with t he goal of reducing the ultimate severity of the illness. Two reviews have examined the effectiveness of earl y intervention services. In the most recent review of early intervention services Bird et al (2 010) identified 4 RCTs which showed benefits including reduced likelihood of relapse compared wi th standard care, reduced hospital admissions, and reduced psychosis symptoms. These effects were observable by the end of treatment. In a earlier review (Marshall and Rathbone, 2006) t o evaluate the effects of (a) early detection (b) phase-specific treatments and (c) specialised early intervention teams in the treatment of people with prodromal symptoms or first episode psychosis identified seven studies, most of which were underpowered, thus providing insufficient data to d raw any definitive conclusions. Bird et al (2010) also examined the evidence of the effectiveness of CBT compared to standard care. They identified 4 RCTs (n=620). CBT interventions f ound a reduction in positive symptoms compared with usual care after 2-year post-treatment follow- up. Negative symptoms also showed an improvement at 2-year follow-up only, but there was no difference in rates of hospital admission or relapse between patients undergoing CBT and those r eceiving usual care. It is interesting that the benefits of CBT were not immediately apparent but b ecame manifest over a 2-year follow-up period. There is no review level evidence available on the cost-effectiveness of EI. A number of primary studies exist. For example an Australian study (Mih alopoulos et al 2009) concluded that early intervention services can deliver a higher recovery rate at one-third the cost of standard public mental health services (but further research is req uired). In the UK McCrone et al (2011) summarise the availa ble cost effectiveness evidence on early detection. They found some evidence that such servi ces can reduce the rate of transition to full psychosis (Valmaggia et al. 2009). Using data from the Lambeth Early Onset service McCrone et al (2010) prepared a model to estimate the cost effect iveness of EI. They estimated that EI results in 82 substantially reduced costs of lost employment (bas ed on estimated employment rates of 36% and 27% for EI and standard care). Using a mini mum wage rate the average savings are \u00a32087 in addition to healthcare savings. Reduced costs based on suicide (assumed to occur fo r 1.3% of EI patients and 4% of standard care patients). The estimated annual savin g in suicide costs due to EI is \u00a3957 per person. The long-term economic impact of EI depends on what happens to readmission rates after a patient is discharged from the EI team. If the read mission rates remain constant, then the expected savings over eight years are \u00a336,632. If r ates converge immediately after EI team discharge the figure is \u00a317,427. Finally, if the ra tes converge gradually the expected savings are \u00a327,029. However, early detection services for psychosis are not routinely provided and provision is currently very limited (McCrone et al in Knapp and McDaid, 20 11). 2.5.3 Management of Schizophrenia within Primary Ca re There are no systematic reviews on the effectivenes s of PC in management and treatment of schizophrenia. Much of the treatment of schizophrenia occurs withi n secondary care. Many patients present in the first instance to a primary care provider. Within the primary care system, a patient with suspected schizophrenia is generally referred for assessment by a specialist mental health service. The decision to refer for same-day assessment or urgent assessme nt within a few days is determined by the risk of harm to themselves and to other people. For people judged not to be at immediate risk of ha rm to themselves or others , the GP can urgently refer for specialist assessment to: The early intervention service if available, or The community mental health service (CMHS) if an ea rly intervention service is not available. In many areas, the CMHS is the gateway t o the more specialized teams, including crisis resolution or home treatment teams (the only team available out of hours) and acute day hospital. For people with schizophrenia who relapse: GPs are advised to manage the person according to t heir care plan if this is available. If a care plan is not available, refer the person to spe cialist mental health services. The urgency of this referral depends on an assessment of the ri sk that the person will harm themselves or others. Good practice suggests that primary care should arr ange a routine annual review of all people with schizophrenia. This should include a review of the person's Continuity of primary and secondary care services. Physical health. Mental health. Social needs. 83 The NICE (2009) guidelines recommend that GPs and o ther primary healthcare professionals should monitor the physical health of people with schizoph renia at least once a year. 2.5.4 Support for Families and Carers Carers, relatives and friends of people with schizo phrenia are important both in the process of assessment and engagement, and in the long-term suc cessful delivery of effective treatments (NICE 2009). Family intervention has a well-established e vidence base from the last 30 years, and proven efficacy in reducing relapse rates in schizophrenia . Bird et al (2010) found 4 RCTS of family intervention for the early identification of sympto ms. The intervention reduced risk of relapse and hospital admission combined, compared with standard care; but this effect was not observed with relapse and hospital admission as single end points . People with schizophrenia are more likely to experi ence a relapse within family groups when there are high levels of expressed emotion (hostility, cr iticism or over involvement) within the family, compared to families who tend to be less expressive of their emotions (Pharoah et al 2010). There are several psychosocial interventions available in volving education, support and management to reduce expressed emotion within families. In a rece nt Cochrane Review Pharoah et al compared the effects of family psychosocial interventions in com munity settings for the care of people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like illnesses. They concluded that family intervention may reduce the number of relapse events and hospitalization an d also seems to improve general social impairment and the levels of expressed emotion with in the family. They did not find data to suggest that family intervention either prevents or promote s suicide. The authors note that the treatment effects of these trials may be overestimated due to the poor methodological quality and further data from more robust studies would provide greater conf idence in these findings. 2.5.6 Cost Effectiveness McCrone et al (2011) investigated whether investmen ts in specialist early detection services can be cost-saving in terms of health care services, crimi nal justice services, suicide, homicide and lost employment for a one-year cohort of patients. The m odel is based on the early detection service that is provided by Outreach and Support in South L ondon (OASIS). The target group is young people aged 15 to 35 years old in the general population w ith prodromal symptoms of psychosis. The model assumes that transition from prodromal symptoms to full psychosis occurs for 20% of patients compared to 35% under standard care. McCrone et al estimate that compared to standard care, early detection services for patients with prodroma l symptoms of schizophrenia are cost-saving overall, and also cost-saving from the perspective of the NHS from year 2. 2.4.7 Guidance The NICE (2009) guidelines for the management of sc hizophrenia in primary care recommend that GPs take time to build supportive and empathic rela tionships as an essential part of care. Assessment NICE (2009) recommends that people with schizophren ia receive a comprehensive multidisciplinary assessment, including a psychiatric, psychological and physical health assessment. The assessment should also address the following: accommodation, culture and ethnicity, economic status, occupation and education (including employment and functional activity), prescribed and non-84 prescribed drug history, quality of life, respon sibility for children, risk of harm to self and oth ers, sexual health and social networks. Treatment within Primary Care In the care of people with schizophrenia NICE (2009 ) recommends that GPs Routinely monitor for other coexisting conditions, including depression and anxiety, particularly in the early phases of treatment. Should monitor the physical health of people with s chizophrenia at least once a year. Primary care should develop and use practice case r egisters to monitor the physical and mental health of people with schizophrenia in prima ry care. Offer cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) to all pe ople with schizophrenia. This can be started either during the acute phase or later, inc luding in inpatient settings. Should consider offering arts therapies to all peop le with schizophrenia, particularly for the alleviation of negative symptoms. This can be start ed either during the acute phase or later, including in inpatient settings. Should not routinely offer counselling and supporti ve psychotherapy (as specific interventions) to people with schizophrenia. Howeve r, these should take service user preferences into account, especially if other more efficacious psychological treatments, such as CBT, family intervention and arts therapies, are not available locally. Do not routinely offer social skills training (as a specific intervention) to people with schizophrenia. When a person with an established diagnosis of schi zophrenia presents with a suspected relapse, primary healthcare professionals should refer to th e crisis section of the care plan. Consider referra l to the key clinician or care coordinator identified in the crisis plan. For a person with schizophrenia being cared for in primary care, consider referral to secondary care again if there is: poor response to treatment, non -adherence to medication, intolerable side effects from medication, comorbid substance misuse or risk to self or others. When re-referring people with schizophrenia to ment al health services, take account of service user and carer requests, especially for: review of the s ide effects of existing treatments and psychologica l treatments or other interventions. Support for Carers When working with carers of people with schizophren ia NICE (2009) recommend that GPs: Offer family intervention to all families of people with schizophrenia who live with or are in close contact with the service user. This can be st arted either during the acute phase or later, including in inpatient settings provide written and verbal information on schizophr enia and its management, including how families and carers can help through all phases of treatment offer them a carer's assessment 85 provide information about local carer and family su pport groups and voluntary organisations, and help carers to access these negotiate confidentiality and information sharing b etween the service user and their carers, if appropriate assess the needs of any children in the family, inc luding young carers 2.4.8 Research Gaps Further evidence is needed on the impact of differe nt models of early detection services and the role of primary care in the management of psychosis and schizophrenia. . 86 References Section 2.4: Psychosis and Schizophrenia Bird V, Premkumar P, Kendall T, et al (2010).

It is not usually associated with more common upsetting events (e.g. divorce, loss of job etc). P TSD can affect all ages and around 25-30% of people who have experienced a traumatic event may go on to develop PTSD. Symptoms of PSTD concentrate on re-experiencing asp ects of the event in distressing way e.g. flashbacks, nightmares, repetitive images, other se nsory impressions of the event. Other symptoms experienced include hyperarousal and emotional numb ing. According to NICE (2005), people with PTSD often try to push memories of the event out of their mind. Alternatively some might obsess about questions that prevent them from coming to te rms with the event e.g. why did it happen to them etc. Symptoms may develop following the event however, f or some, the symptoms may be delayed and sufferers may not seek help for symptoms until year s after the event. In addition, assessment can face significant challenges as many avoid talking a bout the problems even when presenting with associated complaints. The Northern Ireland Study of Health and Stress, a large epidemiological study of mental health in Northern Ireland, revealed that 8.5% of the populat ion met prescribed criteria for lifetime PTSD, the highest among comparable international estimates (F erry et al. 2008). Further, individuals with PTSD were significantly more likely to have a range of c o-morbid mental health disorders, highlighting the extent of the public health burden associated with psychological trauma. Findings from international studies indicate: 88 The majority of people will experience at least one traumatic event in their lifetime Intentional acts of violence are more likely to res ult in PTSD than accidents or disasters Men tend to experience more traumatic events than w omen, but the events have a higher impact on women Women are more likely to develop PTSD than men. Source: NCCMH 2005 2.5.2 Identification Treatment of PTSD can only take place once the diso rder is identified. Certain groups of people are more at risk of PTSD: Victims of violent crime Members of the armed forces, emergency services and prison service Victims of war, terrorism and refugees Survivors of accidents and disasters Women following traumatic childbirth Individuals diagnosed with life-threatening illness . Various well-validated assessment tools exist for s creening purposes and one review was identified to explore their relative effectiveness (Brewin 200 5). The author identified 13 available tools, and concluded that the questionnaires with greatest pot ential for use in primary care were the Trauma Screening Questionnaire (10 items) and the SPAN (4 items). Since the publication of this review, the PTSD-8 has been validated and has potential for use in primary care. Regardless of the tool, the NCCMH (2005) advocate their use by trained professi onals in the broader context of physical, psychological, and social needs as well as a risk a ssessment. For the vast majority of people, opportunities for recognition come as part of contact with primary care (NICE 2005). The challenge for practitioners i s that PTSD may present with a range of symptoms. In adults, this is more commonly in the f orm of vivid, distressing memories or flashback. However, symptoms can include depression, drug or a lcohol misuse, anger etc. so primary care practitioners need to handle with care and ask ques tions in a sensitive manner. NICE (2005) recommend that primary care practitioners should be aware of traumas associated with PTSD e.g. assault, road traffic accidents, domestic violence etc. For repeat attendees with unexplained physical symptoms, questions about recent or ongoing trauma should be considered. 2.5.3 Prevention One review of prevention was identified. Rose et al . (2002) conducted a review of 15 trials to consider the preventative impact of individual debr iefing sessions following traumatic events. They found no evidence to support the effectiveness of t his approach in prevention onset of PTSD. They concluded compulsory debriefing of victims should c ease and a more appropriate response would be 'screen and treat'. 89 2.5.4 Treatment Treatment for therapy Exposure Stress inoculation therapy (SIT) Hypnotherapy . Seven reviews were identified that looked at effect iveness of treatments for PTSD. There is support that interventions provide improvement in symptoms for sufferers of PTSD (Benish et al. 2008; Bradley et al. 2005) although a lack of evidence to support combined pharmacotherapy and psychological therapies (Hetrick et al. 2010). However, there is no review of treatment of PTSD in specifically primary care settings. The reviews do not specify setting but rather focus on treatment of condition. Comparison of treatments Benish et al. (2008) reviewed 15 studies of direct comparisons between different approaches to treating PTSD. Treatments included hypnotherapy, ps ychodynamic therapy, CBT, EMDR, stress inoculation and exposure. They found efficacy of ps ychotherapy in reducing symptoms of PTSD but no differences between approaches. Mendes et al. (2 008) drew the same conclusions having compared CBT with other therapies. No implications for primary care were noted. Bisson et al. (2007) compared findings from 33 stud ies and found support for individual and group trauma-focused CBT, EMDR and stress management comp ared with TAU or waiting list controls. They did identify some evidence to suggest trauma-f ocused CBT and EMDR was more effective than stress management although there was considerable h eterogeneity between the comparisons with potential publication bias indicating caution when interpreting results. Bradley and colleagues (2005) reviewed 26 control s tudies of different approaches including exposure, CBT, EMDR and combination treatments. Whi le the authors noted limitations to the studies in terms of quality and internal validity, they found evidence to support the use of psychotherapies in reducing the symptoms of PTSD. N o implications for primary care were noted. CBT CBT has been described above in detail but specific ally for sufferers of PTSD there are three options for CTB therapies including trauma-focused CBT, str ess management, group CBT. Kroner et al. (2008) compared 5 RCTS of trauma-focu sed CBT over supportive counselling and found evidence to suggest that CBT was more effective tha n counselling for sufferers of PTSD. NCCMH (2005) report evidence supporting trauma-focused CB T over waiting list controls on severity of PTSD 90 self reported and clinician reported symptoms, and some evidence of impact on depression and anxiety symptoms. The available evidence was too limited to support o r reject stress management or group CBT as a suitable therapy for PTSD (NCCMH 2005). EMDR The evidence based for EMDR points to some evidence for reduction in symptoms by patients who had undergone EMDR compared with waiting list contr ols, and some limited evidence of positive impact on associated depression and anxiety symptom s (NCCMH 2005). There is little evidence comparing different therap ies, and not enough to draw robust conclusions about relative effectiveness. 2.5.5 Cost effectiveness There was some limited cost effectiveness evidence to support CBT at 12 weeks although recognition that faster recoveries by earlier treat ment may have intangible benefits for those suffering initial PTSD symptoms and prevent the con dition becoming chronic. More information is needed on early vs. late interventions studies befo re a full assessment can be made (NCCMH 2005). 2.5.6 Guidance NICE (2005) recommends that a course of trauma-focu sed CBT or EMDR should be offered to those with severe PTSD symptoms in the first month after the event. However, these would be operated through an outpatients' clinic. In primary care, sufferers presenting here should b e managed by GPs who should take responsibility for initial assessment and co-ordination of care. I n the processes, patient preferences should be an important determinant of treatment choice and suffi cient information given to make an informed choice. Primary care teams should be aware of the traumas a ssociated with the development of PTSD in order to recognise presentation in primary care. Th is includes probing for patients with unexplained physical symptoms who are repeat attendees. Primary care teams should consider asking specific questions about re-experiencing, or hyperarousal as a means of determining diagnosis. Support for families and carers NICE (2005) suggest that families and carers have a central role in supporting people with PTSD but primary care practitioners should be aware that fam ilies may also need support themselves, and this should be provided if necessary. Families should al so be provided with information on the condition and how to cope in a crisis situation, local self-h elp and support groups and encouragement to participate in groups if appropriate. 2.5.7 Research Gaps Currently treatment focuses on working with profess ionals and there is little information available on self-help or computerized approaches to treatmen t of PTSD. This could be one area for further exploration with a particular focus on delivery thr ough primary care. 91 References for Section 2.5: Imel, Z., Wampold, tive efficacy of bona fide psychotherapies for post - traumatic stress disorder: A meta-analysis of direc t comparisons.\" Clinical Psychology Review 746-758.

Older Adults Comparisons: treatments specifically aimed at reducing mental he alth problems in older people Studies: 5 systematic reviews Good evidence to support: the use of CBT to reduce symptoms of depression spe cifically in older people although there were some doubts over efficacy for p atients who had suffered from a stroke Limited evidence to support: for PST as an effective treatment for depressive sy mptoms in older people although the evidence has limitations; psychodynamic therapy and reminiscence as technique s for work with older people; longer term rather than brief or short term interve ntions; home-based interventions. Insufficient evidence to support or reject: interpersonal therapy for use with older people; exercise for use with older people but the evidence was conflicting; the role of primary care in service delivery. 2.8.1 Background Ageing is also associated with an increased prevale nce of mental disorders. Most older people have good mental health, but older people are more likel y to experience events that affect emotional well-being, such as bereavement or disability. The Department of Health in England estimates that approximately 40% of older people seeing their GP, 50% of older people in general hospitals, and 60% of care home residents, have a mental health pr oblem. (National Institute for Mental Health in England 2005). Common mental disorders are strongly associated with physical disability; over a third (37%) of people interviewed in this age group had difficulty with one or more common daily tasks, such as personal care, housework and getting out and about (Evans et al 2003b). Other major risk factors include disability, cognitive deficits , loss of social networks and low social support, a nd negative life events (Ell 2007). 93 Depression is the most common psychiatric disorder in later life. A recent large population study suggested prevalence in older people stood at 8.7% and rose to 9.7%, and it is comorbid with dementia (Iliffe 2007). Individuals living in care homes represent a particularly vulnerable group in terms of depression. Prevalence estimates vary cons iderably depending on the assessment methodology used and the definition of depression, but it is estimated to affect up to 40% of older people who live in care homes (Mozley et al., 2004. ). Co-morbidity of depression with other diseases is also common and medical illness increases the ri sk of suicide in among older people (Ell 2007). Evidence supports the need to address mental health problems, especially depression, in the elderly. Some authors suggest routine patient education, scr eening and evaluation in older adults with risk factors to help with early identification (Ell 2007 ). Iliffe (2007) writes that the role of primary care in identification, treatment and management of mental health problems in older people is an import ant role that is growing with the evidence for effectiveness of complex interventions. 2.8.1 Identification Ell (2007) and earlier Ahururu-Driscoll and colleag ues (2004) argued that there was poor recognition of psychiatric illness, specifically depression, in older people by GPs and health care workers generally, potentially linked to the following fact ors: denial of problems and symptoms by older person; insidious nature of onset can impede recognition; co-morbidity; tolerance of unusual behaviours in remote and rural areas; acceptance of cognitive decline in older people; lack of trained staff with expertise in early detec tion and prevention of mental health problems. Others argue that even if depression is recognized, it is often left untreated with only a small minority receiving treatment or referral (Iliffe 20 07). 2.8.3 Management Ahururu-Driscoll et al. (2004) in their review conc luded that there was limited material available for primary care based geriatric services making it dif ficult to draw strong conclusions about effectiveness. Bruce et al. (2005) reviewed commun ity and home-based approaches to the management of mental health disorders in older peop le. They included 12 studies in the review that included interventions like PST delivered by social workers, development of shared protocol of care, shared care treatment led by primary care, nurse le d management, multidisciplinary outreach team managed by case manager, and training for care-give rs. There was considerable variation in the approach to management in the home or community and in some studies primary care took the lead; in other studies, other professionals took th e lead. They concluded that despite the heterogeneity, there was some support for home-base d mental health services for older adults who have limited access to traditional practice-based m odels. Some of the more rigorous studies were associated with a reduction in psychiatric symptoms but more work is needed to standardise approaches to measure mental health outcomes and ch aracterise the intervention. 94 While treatments for depression are the same as for general population adults, a number of reviews were identified that specifically focused on older people. Psychotherapy Treatments Despite a number of reviews supporting psychotherap y for the treatment of depression however, there are few that examine efficacy in older people specifically. CBT A review by Wilson et al. (2008) identified five tr ials with older people and found evidence to support CBT over waiting list controls. Frazer and colleagues (2005) looked at a range of approaches to treating depression in older people. They identi fied 5 RCTs of CBT with older people and, reflecting findings above, found there were benefit s in terms of reducing depressive symptoms. However, they found one study to suggest that peopl e suffering from a stroke did not benefit from CBT. PST The review by Frazer et al. (2005) also identified four RCTs looking at the impact of PST and while three of the four found a positive change in depres sive symptoms in older people, one of the studies did not. Nonetheless, authors concluded that there was some support for the use of PST with older people. Other psychotherapies In terms of other therapies, Frazer et al. (2005) f ound support for psychodynamic psychotherapy, reminiscence and life review (techniques to remembe r past events in life), but insufficient evidence to comment on IPT as an effective therapy for older people. Exercise Frazer et al. (2005) identified tentative support f or exercise as a treatment for depression in older people. However, the Task Force on Community Preven tive Services 1 found insufficient evidence available to determine the effectiveness of exercis e interventions on reducing depression. It should be noted the studies reviewed did find improved sco res on depression symptom scales, but none of the studies reported results for depressed subjects so it is unclear whether or not clinically significant changes could be expected in these popu lations. 2.8.4 The Role of Primary Care Most recently, Kang-Yi and Gellis (2010) examined t he heart disease management for older people literature with a specific focus on depression. The y argue that many of the key features of heart disease management interventions overlap with inter ventions aimed at people with sub-threshold or mild to moderate depression (e.g. exercise progr ammes). They examined both home-based and outpatient interventions covering a range of format s (e.g. education, exercise, counselling, tele- healthcare). The authors concluded that there was s upport for a reduction in depressive symptoms when the interventions were longer-term rather than brief or short-term, included physical activity and were home-based interventions. The role of prim ary care was not extrapolated in this work but it is assumed they would have a key role to play in management of both heart disease and depression (see section on Chronic Illness for furt her information). 95 References Section 2.8: Older People Ahururu-Driscoll, A., Rasmussen, R., Day.

Alcohol Dependency and Mental Health Note As the purpose of this rapid review is to describe the effectiveness of mental health interventions delivered within primary care settings we have not conducted searches for reviews on the effectiveness of different treatments for alcohol o r drug dependency. Given the short timeframe available for the rapid review we have focused atte ntion on the review level evidence on approaches available to primary care staff to identify mental health needs of patients presenting with alcohol/drug problems. For much of this section we rely on the most recent review level evidence (NCCMH 2011) and national guidelines. 3.1 Background Alcohol dependence and harmful alcohol use are reco gnised as mental health disorders by the World Health Organization (WHO, 1992). Evidence from the recent NISHS estimates that 13% o f the Northern Ireland population met the criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence at some po int in their life (Bunting et al, pending) while almost 3% met the criteria in that last 12-months ( Bunting et al, under review). Alcohol use is strongly associated with a wide range of mental hea lth problems (National Co-ordinating Centre for Mental Health 2011). Depression, anxiety, drug misu se, nicotine dependence, and self-harm are commonly associated with excessive alcohol consumpt ion. Ferry et al (2008) for example estimate that 23% of individuals with lifetime major depress ive disorder also meet the criteria for alcohol abuse. Up to 41% of suicides are attributable to al cohol and 23% of people who engage in deliberate self-harm are alcohol dependent (Merrill et al., 19 92; Demirbas et al., 2003 cited by NCMH 2011). Psychiatric co-morbidity is common among problem dr inkers - up to ten per cent for severe mental illnesses, up to 50 per cent for personality disord ers and up to 80 per cent for neurotic disorders. I t is likely to make treatment more challenging and of lo nger duration (Raistrick et al 2006). Mental health problems which co-exist with alcohol misuse can have a significant impact on the treatment and long-term outcome of the alcohol related proble m. Poor mental health and social problems are associat ed with binge drinking and prolonged and excessive drinking. Both forms of alcohol misuse ar e associated with enhanced risk of physical harm (alcohol poisoning, liver disease, cancer, stroke, premature mortality, accidental injury) which may impact on mental health and social harm (physical a nd sexual assault, including intimate partner violence, and anti-social behaviour) (Cabinet Offic e, 2004 cited by Friedli et al 2008). A key debate concerns the extent to which alcohol m isuse precedes, or is a consequence of, mental health problems such as anxiety and depression. In their review of the evidence on mental health improvement Friedli et al (2008) conclude that the evidence is mixed and equivocal on the relationship between alcohol use and poor mental he alth and it is unclear whether a reduction in alcohol consumption at a population level would red uce incidence of depression and anxiety. They conclude that there is a clear relationship between alcohol abuse and social functioning and factors that influence mental health e.g. violence, intimat e partner violence and sexual abuse of children. The UK Cabinet Office recently estimated that the c ost of alcohol to society was \u00a325.1 billion per annum (Department of Health, 2007). A report by the DoH estimated an annual cost of \u00a32.7 billion attributable to alcohol harm to the NHS in England (Department of Health, 2008a cited by NCHM 2011). 97 In Northern Ireland the cost to society of alcohol misuse is estimated to be \u00a3679.8million within a range of \u00a3500.8million and \u00a3884.4million (DHSSPSNI 2010). In 2010 5,846 people were treated for addiction. Over half (57%) were being treated for a lcohol problems while a fifth (22%) were treated for drug misuse and a fifth (21% ) were treated for both alcohol and drug use (Blee 2011). 3.2 Prevention Primary care services in Northern Ireland face a pa rticular challenge in the prevention and treatment of alcohol abuse given the substantial delays in tr eatment seeking among those with the disorder. The NISHS suggests that those with alcohol abuse wa it on average 16 years before seeking any treatment. Furthermore, just 24% of those with 12-m onth alcohol abuse sought treatment in the 12 months previous to the interview (Bunting et al, un der review). Effective strategies to reduce alcohol-related harm require a combination of measures, covering both population-level approaches (such as price inc reases and advertising controls) and interventions aimed at individuals (NICE 2010). Evidence indicates that brief interventions in prim ary care settings achieve an average 12.3% reduction in alcohol consumption per individual (Ka ner et al 2007). However, this is a short-term effect and evidence about its duration is less clea r cut. 3.3 Screening and Identification Alcohol Dependency The NCCMH (2011) review for the development of the NICE (2011) guidelines on the diagnosis, assessment and management of harmful drinking and a lcohol dependence identified three tools to measure alcohol dependence. These were the AUDIT (B abor et al., 2001); the SADQ (Stockwell et al., 1979); and the Leeds Dependence Questionnaire (LDQ) (Raistrick et al., 1994). The AUDIT is predominantly used for opportunistic screening purp oses in nontreatment seeking populations (for example, primary care). The AUDIT score categories described relate to adults. Professional judgement as to whether to revise scores downwards should be considered for; women (including those who are or planning to become pregnant), youn g people (under 18 years), people aged 65 years or over, and those with significant mental he alth problems (O'Hare et al., 2006 cited by NCCMH 2011). NCCMH (2011) note that it is important to recognise that the use of individual assessment tools alone, does not constitute a comprehensive assessme nt. In addition to a historical and recent history of drinking, the associated physical and mental hea lth problems and the impact on health and social and economic problems should also be assessed. Models of Care: Alcohol In 2007 the Department of Health in England publish ed best practice guidance for the management and treatment of alcohol misuse (ModCAM). This gui dance described a four tier approach. Tier 1 interventions include identification of alcohol mi suse; provision of information on sensible drinking; simple brief interventions to re duce alcohol related harm; and referral of those with alcohol dependence or harm for more inte nsive interventions. These can be delivered by a wide range of staff in various setti ngs, including accident and emergency departments, primary care, acute hospitals, mental health services, criminal justice services and social services. 98 Tier 2 interventions include open-access facilities and o utreach that provide: alcohol-specific advice, information and support; extended brief int erventions; and triage assessment and referral of those with more serious alcohol-related problems for care planned treatment. Care planned treatment refers to the process of planning and re viewing care within the context of structured alcohol treatment, and this i s located within Tier 3. If staff have the appropriate competencies to deliver Tier 2 interven tions, these can be delivered by the same range of agencies as Tier 1 interventions. Tier 3 interventions include the provision of community-b ased specialist alcohol misuse assessment, and alcohol treatment that is coordinat ed and planned (see below). These include comprehensive assessment, structured psycho logical interventions or pharmacological interventions which aim to prevent relapse, community-based assisted alcohol withdrawal, day programmes and specialist a lcohol liaison provided to for example, acute hospitals by specialist staff. Interventions are usually provided by staff working in specialist alcohol treatment agencies both NHS and non-statutory (although the latter are often funded by the NHS to provide these interventi ons). Important exceptions to this are GPs who may provide more specialised interventions within a Direct Enhanced Services contract (NHS Employers, 2008). Interventions provi ded by GPs often involve assisted alcohol withdrawal in the community or prescribing medication for relapse prevention. As with interventions in other tiers, staff need to ha ve the relevant competence to be able to provide them safely and effectively. Tier 4 interventions include the provision of residential , specialised alcohol treatments that are planned and coordinated, to ensure continuity o f care and aftercare. These interventions include comprehensive assessment, inpatient assiste d alcohol withdrawal and structured psychosocial interventions provided in a residentia l setting, including residential rehabilitation. Tier 4 interventions are usually pr ovided by specialist alcohol inpatient or residential rehabilitation units. However, assisted alcohol withdrawal is often provided in other residential settings, including acute hospita ls, mental health inpatient services, police custody and prisons, delivered by medical and other staff whose primary role is not specialist alcohol treatment. 3.4 Cost Effectiveness An inexpensive intervention in primary care combine s universal screening by GPs of all patients, followed by a 5-minute advice session for those who screen positive. The total cost of the intervention averaged over all those screened is \u00a31 7.41 per head in 2009/10 prices (Purshouse et al 2009 cited in Aslam et al 2011). Using a model to analyse the cost and benefits of G Ps using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) to screen a representative sample of 1 ,000 adults attending their next GP consultation, followed by 5 minutes of advice for those identifie d as hazardous or harmful drinkers, Aslam et al (2011) conclude that such low-cost interventions in primary care offer good value for money in reducing alcohol-related harm. However, Aslam et al note that the main constraint on national implementation is one of scale; options to consider include targeted approaches (e. g. focusing on young males), screening people only when they change GP rather than at next consul tation, or using practice nurses rather than GPs to provide the screening and/or follow-up advice. 99 3.5 Guidance NICE has issued three guidance documents on identif ication and treatment of alcohol misuse (NICE 2011, NICE 2010a; NICE 2010b). The recent NICE (2011) guidance on the alcohol misu se Assess comorbid mental health problems as part of a ny comprehensive assessment, and throughout care for the alcohol misuse, because man y comorbid problems (though not all) will improve with treatment for alcohol misuse. Use the assessment of comorbid mental health problems to inform the development of the ov erall care plan. For service users whose comorbid mental health prob lems do not significantly improve after abstinence from alcohol (typically after 3-4 weeks) , consider providing or referring for specific treatment (see the relevant NICE guideline for the particular disorder). Refer people who misuse alcohol and have a signific ant comorbid mental health disorder, and those assessed to be at high risk of suicide, to a psychiatrist to make sure that effective assessment, treatment and risk-manag ement plans are in place. For the treatment of comorbid mental health disorde rs refer to the relevant NICE guideline for the particular disorder, and: Service users who have been dependent on alcohol wi ll need to be abstinent, or have very significantly reduced their drinking, to benefit fr om psychological interventions for comorbid mental health disorders. NICE (2007) has issued additional guidance on drug misuse which recommends that in settings such as primary care, general hospitals and emergency de partments consider asking people about recent drug use if they have symptoms that suggest the pos sibility of drug misuse, such as: acute chest pain in a young person acute psychosis mood and sleep disorders In terms of treatment the NICE (2007) guidance reco mmends opportunistic brief interventions focused on motivation should be offered to people i n limited contact with drug services (for example, those attending a needle and syringe excha nge or primary care settings) if concerns about drug misuse are identified by the service user or s taff member. These interventions should: normally consist of two sessions each lasting 10-45 minutes explore ambivalence about drug use and possible tre atment, with the aim of increasing motivation to change behaviour, and provide non-jud gemental feedback. Staff should routinely provide people who misuse dr ugs with information about self-help groups. These groups should normally be based on 12-step pr inciples; for example, Narcotics Anonymous and Cocaine Anonymous Consider facilitating initial contact, for example by making the appointment, arranging transport and accompanying the person to the first session. 100 Formal Psychosocial Interventions Behavioural couples therapy Consider behavioural couples therapy for people who are in close contact with a non-drug-misusing partner and who present for treatment of stimulant or opioid misuse, including those who continue to use illicit drugs while receiving opioid mainten ance treatment or after completing opioid detoxification. Cognitive behavioural therapy and psychodynamic the rapy Consider evidence-based psychological treatments (i n particular, cognitive behavioural therapy [CBT]) for comorbid depression and anxiety disorders in li ne with existing NICE guidance for people who: misuse cannabis or stimulants have achieved abstinence or are stabilised on opioi d maintenance treatment. Do not routinely offer CBT and psychodynamic therap y focused on the treatment of drug misuse to people who misuse cannabis or stimulants or those r eceiving opioid maintenance treatment. Other treatments include: Opioid Detoxification including pharmacological tre atment. Support for families and Carers NICE guidance (2007) on the support for families an d carers includes Discuss with families and carers the impact of drug misuse on themselves and other familymembers, including children. o Offer an assessment of their personal, social and m ental health needs. o Give advice and written information on the impact o f drug misuse. Where the needs of families and carers have been id entified: o offer guided self-help (usually a single session wi th written material provided) o inform them about support groups - for example, sel f-help groups specifically for families and carers - and facilitate contact. If families and carers continue to have significant problems, consider offering individual family meetings (normally at least five weekly sess ions). These should: o provide information and education about drug misuse o help to identify sources of stress related to drug misuse o promote effective coping behaviours. 101 References Section 3: Alcohol and Mental Health Aslam R, Knapp M, Parsonage M, Vela J (2011) Screen ing and brief intervention in primary care for alcohol misuse in Knapp et al (2011) Mental health promotion and mental illness prevention: The economic case.

Patients with Chronic Illness 4.1 Background Patients with chronic conditions such as coronary h eart disease, cancer, diabetes, COPD and neurological/brain disorders such as stroke, MS, Pa rkinson Disease and epilepsy can also experience an increased risk of developing major depression co mpared to people who do not have a chronic disease (Guthrie et al 2011; Evans et al (2005); Ka ton 2003 cited by Louch 2009). Chronic disease is typically associated with pain, fatigue, and disabi lity, and is considered to be a permanent stressor affecting processes of cognitive appraisal and copi ng, and to have a significant impact on daily functioning, quality of life and survival (Nagyova et al 2005; Covic et al 2003). The recent No Health without Mental Health policy document from England (Dept of Health 2011) has also prioritised the mental health needs of pat ients with chronic illness. In order to achieve the aims of better diagnosis and treatment of mental he alth problems for those with long-term physical conditions, and getting identification and treatmen t of anxiety or depression for those with medically unexplained symptoms No Health Without Mental Health makes a number of recommendations with relevance to primary care. The se recommendations covering 5 themes: awareness, liaison mental health services, engaging patients and carers, re-organisation, commissioning and quality standards, and training. The awareness theme includes the need for national guidelines abo ut medical conditions to include specific advice about the detection and tre atment of mental health problems associated with medical conditions. Screening for d epression in specific long term conditions in primary care should be continued and extended un der the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF), and people with learning disabilit ies and people with severe mental illness should receive relevant annual physical hea lth checks. Under Liaison Mental Health Services they recommend that liaison services should includ e specified and appropriate provision for older peopl e, as well as children and young people. In the theme Engaging patients and carers they recommend that information and education should be developed and provided in appropriate way s for patients, carers and the public to develop community awareness of the psychological as pects of physical conditions, and that patients should be better informed about, and invol ved in, decisions about their treatment, discharge and self-care. Similar to national guidel ines they recommend that patients be involved in designing and improving mental health s ervices from general hospitals and primary care settings, through audit, research and training. In re-organisation, commissioning and quality standard s they recommend that liaison mental health services should be commissioned and r eviewed against agreed specific service standards, to ensure they provide effective, eviden ce based interventions to treat mental health problems in the general hospital, and that a ll care pathways for delivering physical healthcare should have a mental health component. T here should be a counterpart pathway for commissioning practice to ensure the services a re in place to deliver this. Within training it is recommended that all health practitioners sho uld have training in mental health. The curricula of all doctors in trai ning and the continuing professional development of qualified doctors should reflect the relationship between mental and physical health, both in general and in specific co nditions. 104 The evidence for the English strategy No Health Without Mental Health (Guthrie et al 2011) provides an overview of the research evidence on the relatio nship between mental health and physical health. The report is primarily concerned with ment al health problems that are associated with, or arise from, physical illness, and the general inter face between mental and physical health, and presents the evidence on a range of conditions incl uding CHD, cancer, diabetes, COPD and neurological disorders such as stroke and epilepsy. The report pays particular attention to the needs of children/young people and older people with chro nic illness. Poor mental health is also a risk factor for poor p hysical health. For example Guthrie et al (2011) present evidence from systematic reviews on risk fa ctors associated with increased risk of people with depression developing CHD (Barth et al 2004; R ugulis 2003; Wulsin and Singal 2003 Cited in Guthrie et al 2011). Depression also increases the risk of adverse outcomes among those who already have CHD (Barth et al 2004). Mortality and morbidity are increased among those with CHD and health-related quality of life is worse (Carney et al 2002; Wulsin and Singal 2003). However, Guthrie et al (2011) point out the available eviden ce is weak as many studies do not control adequately for potential confounding factors and th ere is evidence of publication bias. In their practice guidance for the treatment of dep ression in patients with chronic health disease, Tylee and Dickens (2011) report that there is suffi cient evidence that depression is a risk factor for CHD, depression worsens cardiac prognosis, and co-m orbid depression is improved by medication and psychological treatments. However, there was in sufficient evidence to make judgments on the cost effectiveness of different screening or treatm ents for patients with CHD. The majority of patients with physical and mental h ealth problems are managed in primary care, and GPs play a vital role in the detection and treatmen t of psychological problems in those who are physically unwell (Guthrie et al 2011). Since the introduction of the Quality Outcomes Fram ework (QOF), GPs receive a financial incentive to perform regular health checks on CHD patients th at include screening for depression. However, Guthrie et al note that despite this screening, the majority of depressed CHD patients do not receive adequate treatment for their depression. This may b e due to prioritisation of physical health problems, perceived lack of expertise among GPs, or reluctance by patients to engage in mental health services. The review level evidence on the effectiveness of d ifferent screening/treatment approaches to date has been assembled by chronic health condition. Thi s rapid review only identified one systematic review (Thombs et al 2008) on effectiveness of scre ening and treatment, although more detailed searches may uncover further relevant reviews. Som e of the broader reviews on different models of care (e.g. Pignone et al 2002; Gilbody et al 2006) also include some evidence statements with relevance to patients with chronic illness. Aside from the association of mental health disorde rs with more serious chronic physical health conditions, other studies point to the wider physic al health care needs of individuals with mental ill health. Mental health disorders are often accompani ed by lack of exercise and poor diet and eating habits, which have an adverse effect on physical he alth, and in turn can exacerbate mental health morbidity. Furthermore, individuals with a given me ntal health disorder often engage in unhelpful coping strategies such as smoking and drug and alco hol misuse, which again exacerbate both physical and mental ill health (HM Government, 2011 ). 105 4.2 Screening In their review of screening for depression in pati ents with cardiovascular disease (CVD) Thombs et al (2008) found that depression screening tools are reasonably accurate in patients with CVD, but there are few examples of screening tools or screen ing tool thresholds with demonstrated accuracy in more than one sample of patients with CVD. They found evidence that depression treatment in patients with CVD improves depression, but the effe cts on depression are modest with only minimal benefit compared with usual care or placebo. There was no evidence that depression treatment reduces cardiovascular events. No studies have exam ined whether screening for depression in patients with CVD improves access to depression car e or outcomes. Thombs et al note that in primary care settings, th e use of depression screening questionnaires without substantial organisational systems to suppo rt management and follow-up provides little or no benefit. Their review did not find evidence for or against the recommendations that depression be evaluated or that screening for depression be co nsidered as part of standard care in patients with CVD. There was insufficient research assessing the potential harms related to screening or treatment. They concluded that the adoption of depr ession screening in cardiovascular care settings would likely be unduly resource intensive and would not be likely to benefit patients in the absence of significant changes in current models of care. 4.3 Treatment The NICE (2009) guidance recommends that treatment and management of depression in adults with chronic depression follows the principle of st epped care, where the intensity of treatment varies depending on the severity of the symptoms (s ee Section 7 on Models of care for further details) A review of systematic reviews (Ouwens et al 2005) demonstrates that integrated care programmes generally have positive health outcomes (but this r eview did not include mental health as an outcome). The most commonly used components of inte grated care programmes include: self- management support, patient education, case managem ent, multidisciplinary patient care team, and clinical feedback/reminders/education. Authors caution that inconsistent definitions of interventions and outcomes are prevalent throughout the literature and, if ignored, can lead to inappropriate conclusions about the intervention. Collaborative care has important characteristics fo r an integrated care model for mental health and is used for depression management. It is a multifac eted organisational intervention based on chronic disease management principles that involves a great er role of nonmedical specialists (e.g. nurse practitioners or case managers) working with mental health specialists and other clinicians to provide optimal disease management and treatment fo llow-up. It organises care around a patient, using a care-manager to give less costly, qualitati ve good and effective care. In a stepped-care arrangement, the intensity or complexity of care is stepped-up only when proven necessary. Patients are first offered an intervention that, while likel y to be effective, is relatively easy to implement and carries relatively low cost or side effects. If the effect turns out to be insufficient, treatment is stepped up to a more complex, costly or taxing (in terms of side effects) level. The aim is to ensure that all eligible patients have access to appropria te care, while reserving the most complex treatments for those that have been shown not to be nefit from more simple treatment. Collaborative care as a model of integrated care ha s been proposed as a potential solution to management barriers that may improve both short- an d longer-term depression outcomes (Pignone et al 2002). 106 A recent meta-analysis by Gilbody et al (2006) on t he effectiveness of collaborative care for the management of depression found only modest effects at 6-months and up to 5-years follow-up. However, one study in this review found that collab orative care was cost-effective for patients with depression and diabetes when total health service c osts were considered. (See Section 2 on further information on the effect iveness of different treatments for depression) One of the key objectives outlined by the IAPT repo rt 'No health without mental health' was for more people with mental health problems to have goo d physical health (HM government, 2011). Given the clear associations between mental illness and poor physical health, it is imperative that primary care professionals recognize physical healt hcare needs in their approach to the management of treatment for individuals with mental health problems. A recent report by the Royal College of Psychiatrists, 'Physical health in menta l health' (RCP, 2009) points to guidance from the National Institute for Mental Health in England (20 04) which highlights the need for regular and appropriate health checks in primary care for patie nts in contact with psychiatric services. The repor t also alludes to an available training package for G P educators which focuses on the physical health care of psychiatric patients. 4.4 Cost Effectiveness There is no review level evidence on the cost effec tiveness of screening for or treatment of depression in patients with chronic illness. A numb er of primary studies exist. As noted above, one study included in the Gilbody et al (2006) review f ound that collaborative care was cost-effective for patients with depression and diabetes when total he alth service costs were considered. It has been estimated that introducing collaborativ e care to patients with diabetes nationally has the potential to save the NHS and social care around \u00a33 .4 million in four years, with a further \u00a311.7 million of benefits to individuals from improved pr oductivity (HMH 2011). 4.5 Guidelines NICE (2009) makes recommendations on the identifica tion, treatment and management of depression in adults aged 18 years and older who al so have a chronic physical health problem (such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes, or a musculoske letal, respiratory or neurological disorder). The guidelines recommend assessing a patient with a chronic physical health problem who may have depression, by conducting a comprehensive assessmen t that does not rely simply on a symptom count but takes into account both the degree of fun ctional impairment and/or disability associated with the possible depression and the duration of th e episode. Treatment and care should take into account patient s' needs and preferences. Good communication between practitioners and patients is essential. It should be supported by evidence- based written information tailored to the patient's needs. If the patient agrees, families and carers should have the opportunity to be involved in decis ions about treatment and care, and should also be given the information and support they need. In terms of treatment, NICE (2009) recommends that for patients with persistent subthreshold depressive symptoms or mild to moderate depression and a chronic physical health problem, and for patients with subthreshold depressive symptoms that complicate the care of the chronic physical 107 health problem, practitioners should consider offer ing one or more of the following interventions, guided by the patient's preference: a structured group physical activity programme; a group-based peer support (self-help) programme; individual guided self-help on principles behavioural therapy (CBT); computerised cognitive behavioural therapy (CCBT). 4.6 Research Gaps The research evidence on the effectiveness of scree ning/treatment of depression for patients with chronic illness is currently presente d by condition (e.g. CVD); further systematic reviews are required to present the evid ence across all conditions with a focus on primary care 108 References for Section 4: Patients with Chronic Ill ness Barth J et al.

Suicidal behaviour comprises both suicide and acts of self-harm that do not have a fa tal outcome. Many terms are used to refer to the latter, including attempted suicide, suicide attemp t, (deliberate) self-harm and parasuicide. Non- fatal self-harm may be subdivided into behaviour wh ich was intended to result in death (high suicidal intent) and behaviour with mixed/ambivalen t or no suicidal intent (McLean et al 2008). Last year in Northern Ireland 313 deaths were regis tered as suicide (Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency). During the period from 1999-2009 a total of 2,258 deaths were registered as suicide. The number of male suicides has increased steadily over recent years. The female suicide rate has remained relatively constant over the same period. It is estimated that around 81% of working age adul ts in England come into contact with a GP at least once a year (Bermingham et al 2011). Luoma et al (2002) found that the majority of individuals who died as a result of suicide had made contact wi th primary care providers in the preceding months. Patients with a psychiatric illness have a higher rate of consultation prior to suicide. 111 A recent study in the UK by Pearson et al (2009) fo und that 91% of patients with psychiatric illness who died by suicide had consulted their GP in the y ear before death but only a minority (just over a quarter) of GPs reported concerns about their patie nt's safety at the final consultation and only a sixth thought that the suicide could have been prev ented. However, GPs and mental health services were not always in agreement about the level of ris k present at final consultation. Despite the patterns of consultations with GPs of t hose at risk of suicide, there remains much debate about how much of a reduction in suicide rates can be achieved in primary care by improved detection of those at risk (Church et al 2006). A GP, or other primary care worker, may be the only health care practitioner in contact with an individual who may be contemplating suicide. Theref ore, they will have an important role in detection of risk factors and appropriate managemen t. High-risk groups include: Males (especially young men under the age of 35 yea rs) People who have been discharged from inpatient psyc hiatric services within past 4 weeks People with a history of self-harm People with alcohol and/or drug problems People with a family history of suicide Sentenced and remand prisoners and ex-prisoners rec ently released into the community People with serious physical illnesses Certain occupational groups - unskilled occupations , doctors, nurses, vets, farmers People from ethnic groups - women born in Sri Lanka , India and East Africa Divorced people Women before and after childbirth Older people People with mental health problems, especially depr ession, schizophrenia and personality disorders (many may not be in contact with secondar y mental health services, especially people with depression) People recently bereaved Source: Church et al (2006 ) Across the lifespan there are specific populations at higher risk of suicide. Young people for example have been identified as an at risk population. Alth ough the rate of suicide is very low before 14 years, attempted suicide begins to occur around 11- 12 years and rapidly increases in frequency in the early and mid-teens. Research from Australia suggests that while many suicidal young people (15-34 years) seek general medical care in the mont h preceding their suicidal behaviour (Pfaff et al., 1999), fewer than half of GPs in a US study report routinely screening their patients for suicide ris k (Frankenfield et al., 2000). 112 Men appear to be at greater risk of suicide (Meltze r et al. 1996 cited by Taylor et al 2007). Males tend not to present to primary care providers and a s such pose a particular challenge for preventive work within this setting. Suicide is associated with a complex array of facto rs such as mental illness, social isolation, a previous suicide attempt, physical illness, substan ce abuse and access to a means of suicide (Beautrais, 2000). Of the reviews identified on the subject of suicide prevention 5 focused on identifying risk and protective factors (Crowley et al 2004, Beautrais 2003, Beautrais et al 2005; Hawton et al 2007; McLean et al 2008). Risk and pro tective factors or determinants of suicide and suicidal behaviour can occur at the individual, psy chosocial and societal levels. Recently attention has been directed to protective role of resilience. Resilience is the capability of individuals and systems (families, groups, and communities) to cope successfully in the face of significant adversity or suicide risk, and is considered a useful way of identifying protective factors. A greater understanding of both risk and protective factors w ill contribute to the development of more timely and effective intervention. Mc Lean and colleagues (2008) present an analysis of the most recent research on risk and protective factors and have id entified a number of research gaps and priorities on this topic. 5.2 Prevention Three reviews (Beautrais et al 2007, Mann et al 200 5, Leitner et al 2008) have examined the evidence on the effectiveness of suicide prevention including work within primary care. Mann et al (2005) and Leitner et al (2008) conducted a systema tic review using transparent review procedures, while the review by Beautrais et al (2007) is weake r without details of search strategy, inclusion/exclusion criteria and quality assessment procedures etc. However, Beautrais et al (2007) used a four-fold classification to grade the suicid e prevention initiatives based on an evidence hierarchy: Initiatives with strong evidence of effe ctiveness (evaluated using RCTs with consistent findings), Initiatives that appear promising (evide nce of effectiveness exists not consistent enough t o classify the findings as strong); Initiatives for w hich no evidence of effectiveness exists but which may be beneficial in suicide prevention; and Initiatives for which ev idence of harmful effects exist. (Concerns have been raised regarding their safety a nd there is reason to believe that they may risk increasing (rather than decreasing) rates of suicid al behaviour). Research with GPs in Australia found that many felt ill-equipped to prevent or identify suicide risk i n their patients (Pfaff et al 2001). It has been argu ed that increasing GPs knowledge and skills to identify and manage patients who may be at risk of suicide could prevent some suicides (Hawgood et al 2008). It may also make GPs feel more prepare d and proactive when they encounter patients' vague and inscrutable, often somatic, symptoms that could mask suicide ideation (Mann et al. 2005). Training programmes can raise awareness of suicide among health professionals, develop understanding of the risk factors and warning signs , enable identification of vulnerable individuals and increase confidence in handling cases (e.g. lea rning to provide appropriate referral where needed). In their review of the evidence Beautrais et al (20 07) classified training for general practitioners a s having strong evidence of effectiveness. They concl uded that providing medical practitioners in primary care with training to enable them to better recognise and treat depression has been shown to result in improved treatment of patients with de pression and in lower suicide rates (Bruce et al . 2004). They also concluded that quality improvemen t initiatives, collaborative care programmes and nurse case management programmes in primary care se ttings have been shown to improve identification and management of depression (e.g. G ilbody et al 2003) (For further information on 113 this approach please see section on Models of Care) . Beautrais et al argue that this approach also needs to be extended to enhance physician detection and treatment of, not only depression, but other mental illnesses, including substance use dis orders, which increase risk of suicidal behaviour. These conclusions concur with Mann et al's findings which found that GP education/training increased the number of diagnosed and treated depre ssed patients with accompanying reductions in suicide. They noted that booster programmes appear necessary. They recommend that education programmes targeting primary care physicians should include instruction on use of antidepressants. However, in a more recent review by Leitner et al ( 2008) the findings on GP training are mixed. Leitner et al found three studies specifically on t raining GPs to recognise and treat depression or other mental ill health. None of these studies (Rut z & Walinder 1992, Owens et al 2004, Alexopoulos et al 2005) reported any change in outcomes for sui cidal behaviour or ideation either with or without the support of statistical analysis. They f ound three evaluations of more broadly based GP and nurse training initiatives, based on encouragin g staff to follow a care management approach. One of these studies reported statistically signifi cant reductions in suicidal ideation (Bruce et al 2004); one provided narrative support of a reductio n in suicides (Rutz 2001); but the third (Nutting et al 2005) failed to find any change in suicidal i deation as a consequence of the intervention (STORM). A further study (Morriss et al 2005) on br ief educational intervention for a range of health professionals (but primarily GP practice staff) fai led to find any significant reductions in completed suicide. Church et al (2006) also comment on the limited rob ust research evidence into effective suicide prevention training programmes in mental health. Th ey refer to the research from Sweden that found education for GPs helped to reduce numbers of suicide (Rutz et al, 1992; Rihmer et al, 1993). The programme focused on the recognition and treatm ent of depression. Several outcome measures were assessed, including antidepressant and anxioly tic prescribing, referrals for psychiatric consultation, psychiatric inpatient treatment, sick leave for depression, and suicides. Positive resul ts were found for the programme, although the findings were the subject of some debate. When half of the GPs who had received the training left the a rea the suicide rate subsequently increased, indicating the need for regular training to sustain the positive effects. In England on the STORM project (Appleby et al 2000 , Nutting et al 2005) training has been delivered to frontline staff in primary care, A&E settings an d in community settings to prevent suicide. Recent research from Scotland (Greisbach et al 2008) indic ates that GPs who go on the suicide prevention training (ASIST) course had a 20% greater chance of identifying those at risk of suicidal behaviour in the year following training 3. This is an interesting result, but at this stage requires substantial external validation. Practice Guidelines Leitner et al (2008) found one RCT (Bennewith et al 2002) evaluating a general practice based intervention whereby GPs were given management guid elines for good practice in respect of self- harm and subsequently proactively offered clients w ith self-harming behaviour the opportunity for a consultation. This study failed to find any signifi cant differences between the intervention and non- intervention groups on any of the three outcome mea sures evaluated (repeat episodes of self-harm, the number of repeat episodes and time to first rep etition). Similarly, another study in England (Thompson et al 2000) failed to demonstrate an incr ease in detection of depression or in patient recovery rates following guideline education within a practice based setting. 3 Dolev et al (2008) prepared a review of suicide pr evention training for the Scottish Government as part of the ASIST training evaluation in Scotlan d. http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/05/191 60110/0 114 Multi-Component Approaches Woods et al (2010) point to the emerging evidence o f multi-component approaches to suicide prevention. As the causes of self-harm and suicida l behaviour are wide ranging and complex (McLean et al 2008), multi-component interventions offer the opportunity to address a variety of risk factors at one time, and at varying levels (e. g. individual, community and societal). For instanc e, interventions that combine school and community edu cation initiatives with training for health professionals and gatekeepers, and emotional suppor t for those in need have been successful in reducing rates of suicide (Hegel et al 2009; Knox e t al 2003). Woods et al provide an example of a programme in Germany that combined four elements to address depression: training for health professionals; a media and public information campa ign; training for gatekeepers such as police, carers and teachers; and support for depressed peop le and their families, including the distribution of emergency cards for individuals at high risk of attempting suicide. Over the intervention period and during the following year, levels of suicidal a cts decreased by over 30% (Hegel et al 2009). Prevention Work with Children and Young People Much of the prevention work with children and young people tends to be delivered in the school and community based settings. Currently no systema tic review has assembled the evidence on suicide prevention work with young people with a sp ecific focus on the role of primary care. In their broader review of the evidence Leitner et al (2008) found 10 studies of suicide prevention programmes directed to children aged 0-15 years. Th e programmes were delivered through a range of approaches and across different settings. Leitne r et al (2008) conclude on the basis of the available literature that there no evidence to info rm a targeted prevention strategy aimed at reducing suicide in children. There is limited evid ence that some interventions, including pharmaceutical, psychotherapeutic, behavioural and staff or parent training initiatives may be effective in reducing attempted suicide, self-harm and, in particular, suicidal ideation. But the smal l number of studies, combined with the diverse modes of intervention evaluated, fails to provide a consistent body of evidence that suggests any clear way forward for intervention with children. Another review on the topic of youth suicide preven tion (Crowley et al 2004) found two systematic reviews (Hider, 1998; Gunnell, 1994) which suggest that it is possible to predict young people at higher risk of suicide, but they found only one sma ll evaluation study which investigated the effectiveness of education of GPs on risk factors. However, Crowley et al also conclude that the apparent potential for GPs in identifying and manag ing at-risk youth remains unproven and further evaluative research is required. Leitner et al found 17 studies of suicide preventio n programmes directed to young adults (aged 16- 25). This body of evidence, although greater in num ber and generally more positive in outcome than the evidence for children and young people, provide s no greater evidence to support a targeted intervention strategy. Where there was some eviden ce of effectiveness it is not clear from the review which parts of this programme delivered the effectiveness. Prevention work with Older People Only one primary care based study (Bruce et al 2004 ) was identified in the reviews with a focus on older people. This study found a reduction in suici dal ideation following the introduction of improved treatment guidelines for the care of older people in primary care settings. Leitner et al (2008) also included two studies (Barak et al 2006, De et al 1995) that reported positive outcomes in relation to a reduction in completed suicide among older people. Barak et al 2006 focused on treatment with SSRIs and reported reductions in att empted suicide as a result of intervention. De et al (1996) reported on a community-based interventio n involving telephone support services aiming 115 to maintain contact and offer elderly people home a ssistance (for issues unrelated to suicidal behaviour). 5.3 Identification As discussed in the previous sections, health profe ssionals can be trained in the use of screening tools to aid identification of at-risk individuals. These tools consist of a short series of questions that enquire about risk factors for suicide such as depr ession, substance use, thoughts of death, self- harm, suicidal ideation and past suicide attempts. Answers to the questions are scored, with overall scores providing an indication of risk. Screening t ools can reliably identify people at risk of suicid e, but they also have the potential to falsely classif y people as at-risk, creating an additional burden on health care staff (Gaynes et al 2004). There have b een inconsistent results around their effectiveness in reducing risks of suicide, with outcomes largely dependent on the aftercare and support offered through referral. The Canadian Task Force on Preventative Health Care (MacMillan et al 2004) found some evidence that screening adults in the general population for depression within primary care settings which have integrated programmes for feedback and treatme nt was potentially useful. However, there was insufficient evidence to recommend for or again st screening adults in the general population for depression within primary care settings where effec tive follow up and treatment are not available. As suicide is closely associated with depression, s creening for depression is often a focus of suicide prevention in primary care settings. The US Prevent ive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recently recommended that adolescents (12-18 years of age) b e screened for major depressive disorder when adequate systems are in place to ensure accura te diagnosis, treatment and follow-up (Williams et al. 2009). A USPSTF review of studies of depression screening in adults in primary health care settings found a 10% to 47% increase in rates of detection and diagn osis of depression with the use of screening tools (Pignone et al 2002). The review does not report on suicide behaviour. The 2004 USPSTF review of evidence on screening for suicide risk (Gaynes et a l 2004), as opposed to depression, found no published studies in English evaluating the effecti veness of screening for suicide risk in primary car e. In their systematic review on suicide prevention Ma nn et al (2005) conclude that although screening programs have reported some success in identifying individuals with known risk factors for suicide, particularly among high school and college student populations, further consideration needs to be given to determining the cost-effectiveness of scre ening general populations vs. identified at-risk populations for reducing suicide rates, the predict ive validity and reliability of specific screening instruments, and the appropriateness of standard su icide screening instruments across different cultures. A recent review (Horowitz et al 2009) examined the research evidence on suicide screening in schools, primary care and emergency departments. Th is review was restricted to papers published between 2007-2009 as previous reviews covered paper s published before 2007 (Pe\u00f1a et al 2006; Wintersteen et al 2007). Horowitz et al (2009) repo rt on two evaluations of screening tools in primary care. For example Zuckerbrot et al (2006a) found that instituting a universal depression screen in pediatric practices was feasible and acce ptable in three primary care practices using the CDS Guidelines for Adolescent Depression in Primary Care (GLAD-PC). Gaynes et al (2006) tested the Symptom Driven Diagn ostic System for Primary Care and found the one item (thoughts of death) had 100% sensitivity a nd 81% specificity for detection of patients with a plan to commit suicide (Gaynes et al 2006). Such a single item test could prove useful in detecting 116 at-risk patients who could undergo further evaluati on of risk factors. (See section on depression for further information on screening for depression in general population.) Repetition of self-harm is a major risk factor for suicide. Suicidal intent at the time of self-harm i s associated with risk of future suicide but currentl y there is no method identifying the individuals who self-harm and are at greatest risk of completin g suicide (National Public Health Service for Wales, 2007). 5.4 Treatment There is no review level evidence focusing on the e ffectiveness of primary care delivered treatment approaches for patients at risk of suicide. There are, however, a number of reviews (Mann et al 2005; Leitner et al 2008) on the topic of suicide p revention that present the available evidence on th e effectiveness of different treatments with some evi dence with relevance to primary care. Much of the treatment with people who are at risk o f suicide or who attempted suicide is delivered within secondary care. Mann et al (2005) examined the evidence on the effectiveness of psychotherapy as a treatment to prevent suicide. Th ey concluded that psychotherapy alone or in combination with some antidepressants can be an effective treatment for depression, for suicidal ideation, for suicide attempts in borderline personality disorder, and for preventing new attempts after a suicide attempt. They note that more resear ch is required on the effectiveness of combinations of psychotherapeutic and pharmacologic interventions for short-and long-term outcomes for suicidal patients. As the review does not identify the sett ings of the treatment it is not possible to describe the effectiveness of this trea tment approach within primary care settings. There is evidence that alcohol problems are more pr evalent in people with depression than in the general population and this group may be at greater risk of suicide than those with depression alone (Sullivan et al 2005). The evidence concerning the effect of alcohol on the course of depression is equivocal although it is associated with a worse de pression course and an increased risk of relapse and less likelihood of recovery. However antidepres sants can be effective in this group (see section on alcohol misuse for further information). People with physical illnesses, particularly cancer , neurological disorders, renal disease and chronic pain, are at greater risk of suicide than the gener al population. Policies and programmes that improve awareness, recognition and treatment of psy chiatric illness, mental distress and suicidal ideation and behaviour in people with physical illn ess may reduce this risk (National Public Health Service for Wales, 2007). (See section on Chronic Illness for further details). Mann et al (2005) also notes that many psychiatric disorders, including depression, are chronic and recurrent and compliance with maintenance medicatio n is often poor. They found that interventions for depression provided by primary care physicians are more effective when a case manager follows up with patients who miss appointments or need pres cription renewals. While pharmacological treatments have not been incl uded in this rapid review it is noteworthy that Leitner et al (2008) note that one of the most prom inent modes of intervention currently used for suicidal behaviour and ideation is pharmaceutical i ntervention. They warn that it is important that clinicians recognise that the evidence base for thi s approach is equivocal. 5.5 Cost effectiveness 117 There is no review level evidence on the cost effec tiveness of primary care led suicide prevention work. The economic impacts of suicide are profound, altho ugh comparatively few studies have sought to quantify these costs. Mc Daid et al (2011) estimate that the average cost per completed suicide for those of working age only in England is \u00a31.67m (at 2009 prices). This includes intangible costs (loss of life to the individual and the pain and suffering o f relatives), as well as lost output (both waged an d unwaged), police time and funerals. There are also costs to the public purse from recurrent non-fatal suicide events; these are more difficult to estimat e, and will vary by means of suicide attempt. They estimate the economic benefits from delaying comple ted suicide to be \u00a366,797 per year per person of working age. McDaid et al examined the cost effectiveness of GP intervention to reduce suicide. They estimate that the cost of providing CBT to prevent suicide i n the first year (course of 10 sessions) is about \u00a3400. Further ongoing pharmaceutical and psychologi cal therapy is estimated to cost \u00a31,182 a year (2009 prices). The cost of suicide prevention train ing for GPs, based on the Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training (ASIST) course is \u00a3200 . 5.6 Guidelines The National Standards Framework (NSF) for Mental H ealth specifies that primary care staff should be able to assess and manage depression and the ris k of suicide. NICE guidelines for people with depression (2010) r ecommend that if someone identified as having depression is assessed to be at risk of suicide, pr imary care practitioners should consider: toxicity in overdose where an antidepressant is pre scribed and when determining the quantity supplied at any one time; where necessary, implement strategies to limit the amount of drug available the use of additional support such as more frequent direct or telephone contacts referral to specialist mental health services. As previously stated people with drug and alcohol p roblems are at greater risk of suicide and self- harm than the general population. Effective managem ent of these problems may reduce this risk although currently there is little direct evidence of this (National Public Health Service Wales 2007) . The British Association for Psychopharmacology has developed guidelines for the treatment of substance misuse, addiction and co morbidity with p sychiatric disorders. The primary focus of these guidelines is on pharmacological management (Lingfo rd-Hughes et al 2004). 5.7 Gaps in evidence base There is a need for systematic reviews on the effectiveness of screening for suicide risk in primary care setting on the role of the primary care team in the prevent ion and identification of patients at risk of suicide. Such a review should consider the evide nce on the effectiveness of different approaches to changing professional practice (e.g. training V guidelines etc). on the evidence of partnership working across diffe rent settings to prevent suicide. on the cost effectiveness of primary care led suici de prevention 118 on the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of prim ary care based interventions with higher risk groups such as young people, men, farmers, and olde r people 119 References for Section 5: Suicide and Self-Harm Ref erences Alexopoulos, G.

Psycho-educ ational programmes improved psychological wellbeing and depression, and educati onal programmes significantly improved the outcome variable on burden Limited evidence to support: Promising interventions include Animal-Assisted The rapy, Aromatherapy, Behaviour Management, Cognitive Stimulation, Environmental Ma nipulation, Light Therapy, Reality Orientation, Reminiscence Therapy, MSS, TENS, Valid ation Therapy - but the available evidence is weak and conflicting. Further robust re search is required. No evidence to support: The effectiveness of interventions to prevent demen tia but there is some evidence to indicate that health promotion/prevention messages targeting cardiovascular risk by modifying lifestyle may indirectly reduce risk of v ascular dementia There is no review level evidence on the beneficial effect of acupuncture and counseling. 6.1 Background Dementia is an acquired syndrome of decline in memo ry and at least one other cognitive domain, such as language, visuo-spatial, or executive funct ion, sufficient to interfere with social or occupational functioning in an alert person. People with dementia are at an increased risk of physical health problems and become increasingly dependent o n health and social care services and on other people. Multiple diseases can cause the dementia syndrome ( hereafter, dementia). Alzheimer's disease and cerebrovascular ischemia (vascular dementia) are th e two most common causes; some cases involve both of these etiologies (Boustani et al 2003). The three common subtypes of dementia that GPs are likely to encounter are Alzheimer's disease (40%), vascular dementia with or without Alzheimer features (25%) and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (25%) (Iliffe et al 2009a). 124 Dementia has an insidious onset, and slow progressi on. People may take 12-18 months from the first appearance of symptoms to when they first pre sent to their general practitioner (GP). It can take a similar length of time for the diagnosis to be made (Iliffe et al 2009a) The prognosis depends on the cause of the dementia, and varies from person to person since the course of the condition and pattern of symptoms var ies. Some people with dementia live for many years, but on average people live for about 5 years from when symptoms were first recognized and about 3.5 years from the time of diagnosis. Early-o nset dementia tends to progress more rapidly (Iliffe et al 2009b). As it develops, dementia results in increasingly se vere loss of memory or other cognitive functions, and psychological and behavioural problems can be d ifficult to manage. Almost all people with dementia eventually develop one or more psychologic al or behavioural problems, which include language difficulties, disorientation, psychiatric symptoms (such as apathy, depression, psychosis), and personality and behavioural changes (including aggression, sleep disturbance, sexual apathy, or, rarely, disinhibited sexual behaviour). Changes in personality and/or mood and may lead GPs to make an initial, erroneous diagnosis of depression, although depression may coexist alongside dementia. Family carers often present their concern s to the GP before the person themselves attends with their symptoms (Bamford et al., 2007a) . Dementia causes a high burden of suffering for pati ents, their families, and society (Boustani et al 2003; Luengo-Fernandez et al., 2010). For patients, it leads to increased dependency and complicates other comorbid conditions. For families , it leads to anxiety, depression, and increased time spent caring for a loved one. 6.2 Prevention Although many approaches have been suggested, there is no known way to prevent dementia, except possibly for vascular dementia, when it is r easonable to expect that risk can be reduced by maintaining a healthy lifestyle and by intervention s targeting cardiovascular risk (MeRec 2007). Middle aged and older people should be reviewed for vascular and other modifiable risk factors for dementia (e.g. smoking, excessive alcohol consumpti on, obesity, diabetes, hypertension and raised cholesterol) and treated where appropriate. 6.3 Identification and Screening in Primary Care Holsinger et al (2007) reviewed the evidence of the accuracy of screening for dementia among over 60s in primary care. They identified 29 studies ass essing 25 screening instruments. They concluded that screening tests to identify dementia in older people in primary care settings vary in diagnostic accuracy and administration time. While no single i nstrument is ideal for all settings, Holsinger et al concluded that clinicians should select one prim ary tool and familiarise themselves with it to become more efficient in screening for dementia. In an earlier review Harvan et al (2006) evaluated the available evidence on screening methods for dementia to determine the most accurate and efficie nt tools for use in primary care. Their review identified 20 relevant studies. They concluded tha t the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) has high sensitivity and specificity in outpatients old er than 65 years when age- and education-specific cut-offs are used. The clock drawing test has lower sensitivity and specificity when used alone; however, in combination with the MMSE, its sensitiv ity is higher than that of the MMSE while specificity is slightly lower. Subjective memory co mplaints contribute diagnostic information; 125 however, objective memory performance is a stronger predictor of future dementia. All measures are subject to influence by age, education, and oth er physical factors. Despite the availability of screening tools, dement ia is probably under-diagnosed and under treated with an estimated 50% of primary care patients over 65 not diagnosed by their primary care physicians. Iliffe et al (2009c) suggest this probl em of under-diagnosis is probably not due to lack o f diagnostic skills, but the interaction of case-comp lexity, pressure on time and the negative effects o f reimbursement systems. Koch et al (2010) conducted a systematic review to explore the barriers to dementia diagnosis within primary care. They located 11 studies (six qualitat ive, three quantitative, and two with mixed methodologies). Six themes emerged powerfully from the research that can be grouped into doctor factors, patient or societal factors, and system fa ctors. Doctor factors consist of barriers such as diagnostic uncertainty or insufficient knowledge or experience, as well as disclosing the diagnosis, stigma attached to dementia, and therapeutic nihili sm. Patient or societal factors included stigma, as well as delayed presentation which could be because of stigma, but also because of many other reasons. Finally the systems factors included time constraints and lack of support (which were the most often-identified factors), as well as financia l or remuneration issues. 4 Koch et al conclude that additional research on routine screening in primary care to bolster the current evidence, use of nurses as evaluators of cognition, and utilization of specialists is needed. 6.4 Non-Pharmacological Treatments There are between 12 and 20 people with dementia on an average GP list. People with dementia often need specific information and support, and th eir GP plays a vital role in enabling them to manage their condition (Alzheimher's Society, 2008) In most cases, dementia is progressive and incurabl e, and interventions are used to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life of patients an d their carers. Deterioration in cognitive symptoms is a core symptom of dementia, and this ha s been the major target of drug trials in dementia. However, changes in functional ability (a ctivities of daily living), disturbances in behavio ur and mood, and comorbid emotional disorders are also important and can have considerable effects on the quality of life of patients and their carers . Hulme et al (2010) conducted a review of reviews on the effectiveness of non-pharmacological treatment for patients with dementia. They judged 2 5 of the 33 located reviews to be of high or good quality. The evidence from the reviews sugges ts three different interventions effective for people with dementia: music or music therapy, hand massage or gentle touch and physical activity or exercise. However even for these interventions t he evidence is mixed or limited. For example, within music or music therapy methodological limita tions were highlighted that included weak study designs and small sample numbers but the positive e ffects were consistent across the studies. In respect of massage or touch therapies, although the reviews suggest that they do work in reducing agitation in the short term and can help with eatin g there was no conclusive evidence that massage reduces wandering, anxiety or aggressiveness. Hulme et al note that the interventions included in each of the categories, whilst placed in generic ca tegories (such as music therapy or massage and touch) are diverse. 4 It is noteworthy that none of the UK studies were conducted after the introduction of the Quality and Outcomes Framework which attaches remuneration for the creation and maintenance of a database of patie nts with dementia. 126 Hulme et al included a category of interventions th at 'might work' (due to differing quality of evidence). These included AAT, Aromatherapy, Behavi our Management, Cognitive Stimulation, Environmental Manipulation, Light Therapy, Reality Orientation, Reminiscence Therapy, MSS, TENS, and Validation Therapy. The lack of firm evidence a rose for a number of reasons including conflicting results and weakness in study design. Such interven tions might be useful in managing symptoms of dementia but the evidence is not strong enough to s upport their use. Hulme et al note that some of this category of interventions in this group form t he backbone of coping/prevention strategies outlined in dementia organisations' websites. There was no evidence to suggest beneficial effects for only two interventions, acupuncture and counselling. Only one paper attempted to explore th e use of acupuncture but no studies met their criteria (Peng et al., 2007). 6.5 Support for Carers In general support for carers tends to fall into th ree categories (1) work with families as a whole which including interventions drawing on family the rapy models, or services provided in the home by, say, family support workers (2) Educational pro grammes - including training and psycho- educational interventions and (3) Breaks from carin g including day care, in-home respite care, institutional respite and mixed respite services. In a recent review of reviews, Parker et al (2010) included five reviews focused on interventions for carers of people with dementia or (Cooke, 2001; Pus ey,2001; Peacock, 2003; National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health, 2007; Cooper, 2007) and t wo reviews which focused on carers of stroke victims or frail elderly relatives (Stoltz 2004, Vi ctor 2009). Two reviews focused on psychosocial interventions (Cooke, 2001; Pusey, 2001). The remaining five each encompassed a diverse range of interventions (Peacock, 2003; Stoltz, 2004; NCCMH, 2007; Cooper, 2007; Victor, 2009). Evidence about carers' mental health was a common outcome reported in the included reviews. For exam ple, Peacock (2003) identified three RCTs which reported findings about the impact of interventions on carers' levels of depression. Only one (an education programme) reported positive findings in relation to depression in carers. The other two trials showed no effect on overall psychological we ll-being, including depression and strain, from education interventions or from case management. Si milarly, Pusey (2001) also reviewed psychosocial interventions and identified over 20 s tudies that examined outcomes relating to depression. Half of the eight identified RCTs or co ntrolled studies reported a positive effect of the intervention; half did not. Victor (2009) identified 16 studies looking at a ra nge of carer' support workers' in health and social care, or the voluntary sector. These were people wh o specialised in working with carers and included GP-based carer support workers; South Asia n advocacy workers; mental health specialist carer support workers; support workers for carers o f people with dementia; support nurse work with carers of people with lung cancer; and stroke specialist support workers. Parker et al (2010) report that there was some evidence to suggest that this type of intervention contributed to carers' improved psychological well-being but the evidence was relatively weak and in studies where the research design was stronger, the findings of impro vements in carer wellbeing were less convincing. Two studies examining the outcomes of GP-based heal th interventions for carers suggested that this form of support could also deliver better outcomes in terms of carers' emotional well-being. A more recent systematic review and meta-analysis o f group support for carers/family of patients with dementia (Chien et al. 2011) found some benefi ts of this approach. The meta-analysis of 30 studies found group support had a positive impact o n caregivers' psychological well-being, 127 depression, and social outcomes (with a moderate ef fect size but the pooled effect size in burden was small). The review found that the use of theore tical models, and length and intensity of group sessions had a signicant impact on the effect size s for psychological wellbeing and depression. For example, psycho-educational groups showed a signic antly higher effect in the outcome variables for psychological well-being and depression. Both e ducational and psycho-educational groups demonstrated signicant positive effects in the out come variable of burden, but the educational group appeared to be more effective in this regard. This finding suggests that educational groups can provide immediate information and advice on caregiv ing skills, ways of self-adjustment, handling and legal issues and thereby facilitate caregivers' access to available resources that can reduce thei r burden in patient care quickly. Psycho-educational groups not only provide practical information on patient care, but also focus on caregivers' psychol ogical and emotional status as well as establishing a social, supportive network, and are more effectiv e at improving caregivers' psychological well- being and depression. 6.6 Cost Effectiveness No review level evidence was identified on the cost effectiveness of primary care support for families/carers' of patients with dementia. A recent study undertaken by the Health Economics R esearch Centre at the University of Oxford (Luengo-Fernandez et al., 2010) estimated that Over 820,000 people in the UK live with Alzheimer's and other dementias. Dementia costs the UK economy \u00a323 billion per year: more than cancer and heart disease combined. Dementia research is severely underfunded, receivin g 12 times less support than cancer research. In their recent review of reviews, Parker et al (20 10) identified two reviews which focused on cost- effectiveness. However, both reviews focused on the cost effectiveness of respite-care rather than specific support interventions for carers. They no te that where there is evidence of effectiveness there is rarely evidence of costs, whether to healt h and social care services or to carers and familie s themselves. 6.7 Guidelines Screening The most recent NICE-SCIE (2007) guidelines on deme ntia recommend that General population screening for dementia should no t be undertaken. In middle-aged and older people, vascular and other modifiable risk factors for dementia should be reviewed and, if appropriate, treated. Healthcare professionals working with people likely to have a genetic cause for their dementia should offer to refer them and their unaff ected relatives for genetic counselling. Regional genetic services should provide genetic c ounselling to people who are likely to have a genetic cause for their dementia and their u naffected relatives. 128 If a genetic cause for dementia is not suspected, i ncluding late-onset dementia, genotyping should not be undertaken for clinical purposes. Preventive measures The National Institute for Health and Clinical Exce llence - Social Care Institute for Excellence (NICE - SCIE) (2007) guidelines recommend the following. For the secondary prevention of dementia, vascular and other modifiable risk factors should be reviewed in people with dementia, and if appropr iate, treated The following interventions should not be prescribe d as specific treatments for the primary prevention of dementia: o statins o hormone replacement therapy o vitamin E o non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Early identification of dementia The NICE-SCIE (2007) guidelines on dementia recomme nd that Primary healthcare staff should consider referring people who show signs of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) for assessment by memory assessmen t services to aid early identification of dementia, because more than 50% of people with M CI later develop dementia. Those undertaking health checks as part of health f acilitation for people with learning disabilities should be aware of the increased risk of dementia in this group. Those undertaking health checks for other high-risk group s, for example those who have had a stroke and those with neurological conditions such as Parkinson's disease, should also be aware of the possibility of dementia. Memory assessment services that identify people wit h MCI (including those without memory impairment, which may be absent in the earli er stages of non-Alzheimer's dementias) should offer follow-up to monitor cognit ive decline and other signs of possible dementia in order to plan care at an early stage. Assessment The NICE-SCIE (2007) guidelines recommend that diag nosis of dementia should be made only after a comprehensive assessment, which should include: his tory taking, cognitive and mental state examination, physical examination and other appropr iate investigations and a review of medication in order to identify drugs that may adversely affec t cognitive functioning. People who are assessed for the possibility of dementia should be asked if they wish to know the diagnosis and with whom this should be shared. Clinical cognitive assessment in those with suspect ed dementia should include examination of attention and concentration, orientation, short and long-term memory, praxis, language and executive function. As part of this assessment, for mal cognitive testing should be undertaken using a standardised instrument such as the Mini Mental Sta te Examination (MMSE) or the 6-item Cognitive Impairment Test (6-CIT) or the General Practitioner Assessment of Cognition (GPCOG) or the 7- Minute Screen. Those interpreting the scores of suc h tests should take full account of other factors known to affect performance, including educational level, skills, prior level of functioning and 129 attainment, language, and any sensory impairments, psychiatric illness or physical/neurological problems. Formal neuropsychological testing should form part of the assessment in cases of mild or questionable dementia. At the time of diagnosis of dementia, and at regula r intervals subsequently, assessment should be made for medical comorbidities and key psychiatric features associated with dementia, including depression and psychosis, to ensure optimal managem ent of coexisting conditions. 6.8 Research Gaps Reviews of cost effectiveness of primary care scree ning and treatment. Further research is required on the non-pharmacolog ical treatments for dementia. Further research is required on the cost-effectiven ess of support for carers with specific attention to a UK context. 130 References for Section 6: Dementia Alzheimer's Society (2008) Dementia: management in primary care Alzheimer's Society .

T he different approaches are listed below along with a short description of the model, and av ailable evidence of effectiveness. In terms of primary care in the UK, Bower and Gilbo dy (2005) argue that quality improvement activities in the UK have focused on the replacemen t/referral model (with a parallel increase in psychological therapies) and training and education of primary care staff. This is discussed in more detail below. 133 7.1.1 Training for primary care staff Training is taken to mean the provision of knowledg e and skills in the area of mental health for primary care staff. This could include improving pr escribing or skills in psychological therapy. Training incorporates passive dissemination of guid elines or information to more active methods like seminars. Bower and Gilbody (2005) identified two quality rev iews on training. One review focused on 'passive' training and authors concluded that this approach was ineffective in improving outcomes in patients. The second review examined more intense t raining around psychosocial interventions, and found some benefits to patient outcomes. Christensen and colleagues (2008) concurred with th is finding and in their review the training of GPs in depression care and provision of clinical guidel ines on their own were not associated significantly with improved outcomes. They hastened to add that t his does not imply that interventions would be more effective without this element, but rather pla y a role in influencing clinical practice, team collaboration and referral routes. 7.1.2 Consultation-liaison model This is a variant of the training and education mod el and seeks to improve skills of primary care professionals and improve quality of care through i mprovement in skills. However, this model promotes an ongoing educational relationship with t he primary care team, to support them in caring for specific patients undergoing care. An example w ould be regular practice visits by a psychiatrist t o discuss ongoing care. Doughty (2006) outlines four elements of the consul tation-liaison model as described by Bower and Sibbald: Regular face to face contact between psychiatrist a nd primary care team Psychiatric referral only after discussion at face to face meeting Some cases managed in primary care If referral does take place, feedback to primary ca re team and management by them. In their review Bower and Gilbody (2005) concluded that there was inconsistent and limited evidence to comment on the consultation-liaison app roach to management of mental health in primary care, a finding supported by Doughty (2006) . A more recent study by Cape and colleagues (2010) i dentified five studies for inclusion in their review that focused on management of depression in primary care. They found no significant effect of this model on antidepressant use, or short or lo nger-term outcomes. However, the evidence base was very limited and further research would be requ ired to boost the understanding of this approach and how it might be used in conjunction wi th other models, e.g. collaborative care. 7.1.3 Graduated access This approach can modify the point at which people access services and may involve 'graduated access' including use of 'direct health services' w hich people can access without face-to-face contact 134 with professionals and which maximises the use of n ew technology. No systematic reviews of this approach were identified. 7.1.4 Stepped care This is a system for delivering and monitoring trea tment with the aim of providing the most effective and least burdensome treatment to the patient with a self-correcting mechanism built in. So if someone does not benefit from initial intervention, they are 'stepped up' to a more complex intervention. Typically interventions start at low- intensity and move up rather than down. This approach can be used in primary care and is promote d by NICE guidelines for treatment and management of depression in primary care and second ary care (NICE 2009). Evidence of effectiveness According to the review by the NCCMH (2010) this mo del is increasingly common and is set out in various NICE guidelines (2009, 2011) but there is a limited evidence-base of mental health studies to evaluate the approach. The authors report on a revi ew by Bower and Gilbody (2005) who set out three assumptions for a framework for stepped care in the management of depression. Namely, equivalence of clinical outcomes between minimal an d more intense interventions, efficient use of resources, and acceptability of low-intensity inter ventions. On the basis of these assumptions, they reviewed existing evidence and found some limited s upport for clinical and cost effectiveness of this approach as a way to deliver psychological therapie s but no evidence for overall effectiveness. Stepped care has been considered outside of the fie ld of depression, often as part of collaborative care approaches. There is some evidence that the in tegration of stepped care into a more complex model may be associated with better outcomes but no direct evidence. 7.1.5 Case management An individual healthcare professional takes respons ibility for co-ordination of care but is not necessarily directly involved in provision of inter vention. Gensichen et al (2006) describe Norris et al. (2002) five elements in relation to case management : Identification of patients in need of service Assessment of individual needs Development of treatment plan Co-ordination of care Monitoring outcomes and altering if favourable outc omes not achieved. Gensichen and colleagues (2006) was the only system atic review identified that focused on case management. The authors reviewed 13 studies of case management and found improved outcomes (symptom improvement, remission, response, and adhe rence). This led to the conclusion that case management is an effective intervention to improve management of major depression in primary care. However, the majority of studies were from th e US and the health care system differs greatly from the UK. Further consideration of the transfera bility of this approach, along with a fuller analys is of the increased costs associated with 'complex' ma nagement is required. In 2008 Christensen and colleagues conducted a deta iled review that considered three elements of published studies in detail: components of care, in terventions and study intentions. They were more successful in identifying papers from outside the U S and concluded that case management was 135 associated with better outcomes for people with dep ression than usual care. They extracted several elements associated with more effective practice: Direct feedback to GPs Provision of some additional intervention (e.g. psy chological therapy) Case manager with mental health background or train ed para-professionals. 7.1.6 Chronic Care Model (CCM) The chronic care model for management of illness, i n this case depression, was devised by Wagner and reported in Williams et al. (2007). The review by Williams et al. examined 28 studies, all of whic h had at least 3 to 4 elements of CCM as noted below: decision-making support for clinicians self-management support for patients delivery systems redesign clinical information systems in place health care organisation community resources available. Given the range and scope of the studies involved, it was not possible to do a meta-analysis but they did identify enough evidence to conclude that there was support for the benefits of care management, and specifically approaches that were m ulti-faceted. They felt the CCM framework was useful for understanding outcomes better and fo r identifying the key elements of successful interventions. They recommended that policy-makers promote efforts that include well-trained care managers, patient support and education, longitudin al monitoring and decision support for medication management to strengthen the integration of mental health specialists. 7.1.7 Disease management Interventions designed to manage or prevent chronic conditions using a systematic approach to care and using multiple treatment staff and modalities w ere discussed in Duncan et al (2010); however, details about specifics of workforce etc were not f ound in the report. Nonetheless, the authors conclude that the majority of patients who were tre ated by GPs as part of the intervention had better outcomes that patients receiving usual care. 7.1.8 Collaborative care This model involves all sectors of care to ensure a comprehensive and integrated approach to mental and physical healthcare. Typically the progr amme is co-ordinated by a case manager and supported by a multi-disciplinary team. There is jo int determination with service user regarding intervention plans and review. It can be summarized as follows: 136 Case manager role in primary care Close collaboration between primary care and mental health specialists Mechanisms to collect and share information on indi vidual patients Working to a protocol. Collaborative can take into account elements of oth er models e.g. stepped care. Compared with training/education models for example, there is les s involvement of primary care staff as patients are likely to have more severe disorders. Evidence of effectiveness The evidence reviewed in NCCMH (2010) focuses on de pression but does not include significant chronic physical health problems, and the limitatio ns of the evidence are clear given the size of the dataset. The authors concluded that the evidence re viewed was not sufficiently strong enough to generate recommendations for the use of a collabora tive care model for depression. The same conclusion was drawn by authors of the review for G AD (National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health 2011). They were unable to draw substantive conclusions from the evidence available specifically on GAD, and had further concerns given the studies originated in the US where the health care system is very different to the UK. However, evidence from previous reviews, (Gilbody e t al. 2003, Gilbody et al. 2006) support collaborative care as an effective approach for man aging depression in primary care. In a review of 37 studies Gilbody and colleagues (2006) concluded that collaborative care was more effective than standard care in short and longer-term outcomes for people with depression. Bower et al. (2006) conducted a meta-regression to identify 'active ing redients' in collaborative care, but failed to identify a significant predictor of the effect of c ollaborative care on antidepressant use. They found key predictors of depressive symptoms included syst ematic identification of patients, professional background of staff and specialist supervision. How ever, a major limitation of both reviews is the over-reliance on studies from the US. Until recentl y there were no definitive UK trials in the UK. Currently a team from the University of York are co nducting Phase III of the CADET pilot trials having developed and pilot tested a UK collaborative care protocol. The results of the RCT are due in 2012. In 2007 the Task Force on Community Preventive Serv ices recommended depression care management in primary care setting for older people with major depression or chronic low levels of depression (dysthymia) on the basis of sufficient e vidence of effectiveness in improving short-term depression outcomes (Steinman et al. 2007). A subse quent review in 2010 went on to conclude that collaborative care had strong evidence based in imp roving depressive symptoms, adherence to treatment, response to treatment and remission and recovery from depression. Finally Duncan et al (2010) reviewed 9 reviews of r eviews and 35 RCTs which looked at different models of service delivery. They concluded that the re was evidence to support collaborative care as an effective management approach for mental health illnesses like depression. However, the evidence indicated the results were more significan t for patients with more severe illnesses rather than patients suffering from mild depression. Shared decision-making One important aspect of collaborative care involves shared decision making between professional and patient. It is a policy directive in some parts of the UK; however, there is insufficient evidence available to comment on the impact of shared decisi on-making in primary care (Duncan et al. 2010). 137 7.1.9 Replacement/referral model In this model the primary responsibility for the ma nagement of the presenting problem is passed to the specialist for the duration of treatment. This model is most often associated with psychological therapy. Bower and Gilbody (2005) identified eight reviews o f differing quality and therapies. However, reviews concluded that the approach had clinical ev idence of support at least in the short-term. Again this approach would be for patients with more severe mental health problems and rather than directly involving primary care, is handled by a me ntal health specialist. Attached professional model A variation of the replacement/referral model, a me ntal health professional has direct responsibility for care, usually in primary care, focusing on the treatment of the problem. The co-ordination of care remains with the GP or primary care team. Contact w ith patient is limited to treatment with little or no follow-up beyond specific intervention offered. No review-level evidence was identified to comment on this approach. 7.1.10 Home and community-based outreach One review was identified that explored outreach wo rk as a model to identify and reduce symptoms of depression among older people (van Citters and B ritels 2004). There were methodological limitations and generalisability difficulties with the 14 studies included; nonetheless, they conclude d that there was some support for outreach services i n identifying isolated older adults and improving psychiatric symptoms. 7.1.11 Gateway workers Guidance issued by the Department of Health (2003) introduced the role of a Gateway worker. Policy argues that Gateway workers are needed at cl inical and strategic levels. They can work as member of local services to support delivery of ass essment and treatment or in an emergency situation. At a strategic level, Gateway workers ca n support planning and integration of services through leadership and service development. While they recognised the role of local Gateway wor kers would vary to reflect local practice and structure, some suggestions include: Provision of a single point of access for people in crisis and their families A round-the-clock response for assessment and triag e Co-ordination of the next steps in care, such as re ferral to specialist services Strengthening assessment, triage and onward referra ls Support and training for primary care mental health staff Liaise with A&E if necessary Work with service users and carers to help with tre atment and care options Input into protocol developments. 138 No evaluation of the role of Gateway workers has be en identified to date so it is not possible to comment on the impact of the role. 7.1.12 Primary care graduate mental health workers In 2003, the Department of Health in England set ou t plans for a second complementary role in the developing mental health workforce, the primary car e graduate mental health worker (PCGMHW). The key duties of the role are to: Support the delivery of brief, evidence-based effec tive interventions and self-help Strengthen information for patients Support development of practice-based information s ystems and outcome measures Improve service users' satisfaction with care Improve knowledge within the practice about resourc es for people with mental health problems. A national evaluation of the role of the PCGMHW was published in 2006 by the National Primary Care Research and Development Centre (Harkness et a l 2006). However the evaluation focused mostly on process outcomes rather than impact. More research is needed to determine the impact of this relatively new role. 7.1.13 On-site mental health workers Harkness and Bower (2009) looked at the impact of a n on-site mental health worker on the behaviour of primary care professionals (PCP). Focu sing on the replacement model, they defined mental health workers as professionals able to deli ver psychological therapies and psychosocial interventions as a distinct activity and not solely as part of normal primary care consultations or by those employed by or attached to the PCP working on site or as part of the same clinical team. In this instance the review focused on outcomes associ ated with professional behaviour change rather than patient improvement. They found a reduction in PCP consultations when referral to mental health worker had been made, a reduction in referra l to offsite mental health workers and finally a reduction in the likelihood of prescriptions for ps ychotropic medication. All effects were small and no effect on the broader practice population was no ted. Improving access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) is part of an ongoing pilot in England that will se e the training of 3600 therapists over the three year lifespan of the work. The scheme uses a stepped care approach to offer both high and low intensity therapies including CBT, CCBT, guided self-help, PST and BA. 7.2 Cost effectiveness of different models of care One review (Gilbody S., Bower PJ. et al. 2006) cons idered the cost effectiveness of collaborative care and case management. They identified 11 full econom ic evaluations of the approach and concluded that there was near uniform evidence to state that collaborative care/case management led to improved outcomes for patients, but were associated with increased costs to primary care and required additional investment. Education intervent ions were not linked to increased costs, but did not demonstrate clinical impacts (as described abov e). 139 Another review (van Steenbergen-Weijenburg et al. 2 010) examined the cost effectiveness of collaborative care for management of depression in primary care. They identified 8 studies, and although the quality of information provided was mi xed, all concluded that collaborative care was effective in primary care, but more expensive than usual care, particularly in the first year. However , the authors felt that it was not possible to draw o ut policy decisions based on current evidence given the variation in quality. They recommended that inf ormation on the cost effectiveness of collaborative care in other settings is needed befo re it could be broadly implemented. 7.3 Complex System Interventions for the Treatment of Depression in Primary Care - Gunn et al In an analysis of GP systems, currently in place in Australia for the treatment of depression, Gunn et al (2010) using a Normalised Process Theory (NPT) f ramework, organised their findings around the concepts of (a) coherence (b) cognition (c) collect ive action and (d) reflexive monitoring. In doing so they sought to address questions relating to the re quirements for an effective model and system for the treatment of mental health within a primary car e setting. While the findings may not completely generalise to the UK, they nevertheless highlight a range of potentially important factors which need to be dealt with to make any system of c are more effective. In terms of treatment coherence Gunn et al saw the need for clear boundaries aroun d who has or has not a given mental health condition, and for cl ear agreement on how any diagnosis is to be achieved. This common agreement was seen as fundam ental for the care and treatment of patients. Frequently this common agreement was lacking. Dist inguishing between distress and a mental health condition, for example, was frequently perce ived as presenting seemingly insurmountable problems given the limited time involved. In the wider field of diagnosis this issue is frequently referred to as one of sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity is defined in terms of the proportion o f true cases that are correctly identified; and speci ficity, on the other hand, is viewed as the proportion of true negative cases that are correctl y identified. Diagnostic tools, which might have facilitated this process, were frequently viewed in terms of presenting information that was perceived as 'obvious', rather than as a check on a potential condition, or for the purpose of determining or recording change. This perceived la ck of clarity and conciseness (diffuseness) also created considerable ambiguity around treatment, it was suggested. Cognition requires an engagement with a shared set of techni ques and clear categorisation. Ironically, the intended framework for such an orde red structure, i.e., the DSM and ICD, was little used. GPs claimed knowledge of the criteria requir ed for a condition, but they in general questioned the usefulness and applicability of these criteria for general practice. Patients were frequently perceived to be in a 'grey zone' and in the words o f Gunn et al \"GPs outlined that their work was to explore the set of presenting symptoms or problems using clinical and communication skills. They placed this in the context of the patient with thei r current and prior knowledge of the person and their social situation.\" Part of this hesitancy wi th regard to diagnosis may also have related to the fact that many GPs felt that they lacked the experi ence to provide either an adequate diagnosis or treatment. 140 The need for collective action within the GPs surgery, in terms of the organisati on of care, was seen as being required within an agreed framework. This was described in terms of (a) skill set workability (b) contextual integration (c) interact ional workability and (d) practice meetings. Skill set workability referred to how work was allocated and performed. The main issue around this area was often the referral system; to whom should the p atient be referred and what were the logistics around this decision process? This related to a fr equent lack of contextual information where the procedures and structures around managing patient c are were often felt to be inadequate. Further, there was a general feeling that greater interactio nal working relationships and accountability across disciplines was required. A number of internal and external factors are required for this construct (effective action) to be effective. In particular the opportunity was needed for staff within primary care organisations to self-assess and evaluate the effectiveness of treatment interventions. The lack of an electronic system for the recording of diagno stic information was viewed as a major debilitating factor. For example, it appeared that few if any GP practices could produce a list of people currently being treated for depression, othe r than those currently being prescribed antidepressants. Within the current GP environment the options for reflexive monitoring were perceived to be limited. This was seen as being due to financial c onstraints and the organisational infrastructure within which the service was provided. However, th ere was a felt need for review pathways to be established for reviewing information between diffe rent types of health professionals. Follow-up information on patients was down to individually ta ilored appointments, but there was no systematic method for checking that these follow-up meetings had occurred. Further, there was no consensus on how often these follow-up visits shoul d occur. In a separate review of literature relating to stak eholders, Gunn and associates summarised their finding as shown below. Many of the observations r eported within GP Surgeries had echoes of similar content when stakeholders were interviewed, especially around the time required to deal with issues relating to mental health. There was a lso the expression of the need for a joined up system of care that linked the different types of p roviders. The patients' perspective In the table below Gunn et al present a neat summar y of findings from their published research involving how stakeholders perceive the requirement for treatment. Table 1 Summary of stakeholders informed conceptual designs of an effective model and system of depression care (Gunn et al., 2010). 141 Domain Criteria Requirements in the Relational Domain Stakeholder want to and 'encouraged' b y care providers (particularly GPs), receive depression ca re that is 'holistic,' 'tailored to the individual,' and 'invo lves the patient in planning.' Requirements in the Competency Domain Stakeholders want 'competent and thorough diagnosis and management,' 'assessment for severity and suicide r isk,' 'appropriate and 'prescription and management of medication.' Requirements in the Systems Domain Stakeholders want 'funding for longer consultations and follow- up,' 'systems to enable monitoring,' 'timely referr al through range of treatment options,' 'the integration of pr imary care and other providers,' and 'professional support to gene ral practice.' How can the effectiveness of the Relational Domain be assessed? 'Measuring patient satisfaction,' patient recov ery.' How can the effectiveness of the Competency Domain be assessed? 'Measuring whether there is less reliance on medica tion medical model,' 'monitoring recovery and diagnosis rates,' 'monitoring patients' capacity to function physical ly, socially, and in the community,' and 'developing appropriate pres cribing.' How can the effectiveness of the Systems Domain be assessed? 'Measuring for 'increases in referral options and s ervices in regional areas,' 'patient satisfaction,' 'access an made by GPs,' 'mon itoring the duration and quality of follow-up,' of patients seeking help,' 'and 'monitoring collaborat ion.' Common themes across practitioners and patients wer e the need for more time and resources to be made available for the diagnosis, treatment and man agement of clients presenting with potential mental health problems. Patients desired to be ful ly involved with the treatment regimen and it was acknowledged by the practitioners that this buy-in by the patients was essential for treatment to be successful. The competent diagnosis and management of the condition was seen by both the patient and the practitioner as essential. However , the practitioners were concerned about their competence to deal with issues around mental health diagnosis and in the allocation of appropriate case management. Patients on the other hand expres sed a desire for the diagnosis to be within a holistic context that took into consideration both the mental health condition and the person's wider circumstances. Both the practitioners and th e patients had concerns regarding the monitoring and follow-up of treatment interventions. The moni toring of patient experience was seen as a necessary outcome by the patients. However, monito ring should extend to the success or otherwise of the treatment intervention. Availability and a ccess to services was important for clients, while practitioners had concerns around finding the appro priate services for a given patient. 142 References for Section 7: Models of Care Ahururu-Driscoll, A., Rasmussen, R., Day.

These principles and associated research questions have been presented in Section C of this report. The following discussion aims to compare the extracted review level evidence in relation to these research questions and key principles. The concluding narrative considers to what extent revie w level evidence addresses the overall research question: \"What aspects of primary care are effective in the prevention, recognition and management of mental health issues across the lifes pan; for whom do they work, in what circumstances and why?\" 1. What does the evidence tell us about the effectiven ess of assessment services/processes in primary care? As outlined in the Bamford Report on mental health promotion (2006), primary care has a crucial role to play in the early identification of common mental health problems. While methods of assessment will ultimately vary depending on the me ntal health disorder or sub-population under consideration, standard guidelines consistently emp hasise the need for comprehensive assessments based on standardised criteria. Furthermore, guidan ce emphasises the need for a holistic assessment which considers potential co-morbidities both mental and physical. This section summarises review level evidence from Section D in terms of the effectiveness of assessment services/processes in primary care. The review-level evidence would appear to suggest t hat there are significant variations in assessment practices and processes in and between c lient groups. Despite the availability of a range of standardised instruments that are specific to pa rticular client groups and/or disorders, there is little evidence to suggest consistency in their use . Review level evidence of the clinical and cost-effe ctiveness of methods and processes to identify post-natal depression and other disorders in post-n atal settings is lacking. The evidence that is available suggests a lack of consensus about recomm ended assessment methods and a lack of a uniform screening instrument for the detection of d epression among this sub-group. For example, while the EPDS has been recommended by the RCP (RCP 2002), there remains a distinct lack of research evidence to inform the optimum timing and frequency of its use. Additionally, a recent systematic review of assessment methods for PND fou nd that 14 different identification strategies have been validated. Review level evidence sugges ts that just one Cochrane review has considered antenatal psychological assessments. While the rese arch findings indicate increased awareness of the risk factors for mental health disorders among post-natal women, the authors concluded that they could not comment on the efficacy of such asse ssment methods in the public health context (Austin et al 2008). Furthermore, cost-effectivenes s analysis suggests that formal identification methods do not seem to represent value for money (P auden et al 2009). Review studies focusing on the assessment of depres sion among the general population indicated that a significant proportion of people with depres sion are not diagnosed when they attend primary care (Williams et al. 1995; Mitchell et al. 2009 (N ational Collaborating Centre for Mental Health 2010). Mitchell and colleagues go on to suggest tha t while GPs are able to rule out depression in most people who are not depressed with some accurac y, difficulty arises in diagnosing depression in all true cases. With specific reference to the old er population, Ell (2007) and earlier, Ahururu-Dris co and colleagues (2004) argued that there was poor re cognition of psychiatric illness, specifically depression, among older people by GPs and health ca re workers generally. Others argue that even if depression is recognized, it is often left untreate d with only a small minority receiving treatment or 149 referral (Illiffe 2007). Given this evidence, as pa rt of a step-care approach to depression, NICE (201 0) recommend two initial screening questions (Whooley questions) for high-risk populations before proceeding to further assessment: 1. During the last month, have you often been bothered by feeling down, depressed or hopeless? 2. During the last month, have you often been bothered by having little interest or pleasure in doing things? A recent review of screening tools (National Colla borating Centre for Mental Health 2010) suggested that the data supports the ongoing use of the Whool ey questions as first stage of case identification in primary care. However, given the lack of specifi city, people with positive responses would benefit from a more detailed clinical assessment. There was no one tool identified as being the most effective for the clinical assessment with variatio ns in scales in terms of specificity and sensitivit y. Considering the evidence on assessment of depressio n among individuals with chronic physical conditions, Thombs et al (2008) found that depressi on screening tools are reasonably accurate in patients with CVD, but there are few examples of sc reening tools or screening tool thresholds with demonstrated accuracy in more than one sample of pa tients with CVD. Thombs et al note that in primary care settings, the use of depression screen ing questionnaires without substantial organisational systems to support management and fo llow-up provides little or no benefit. In contrast to the evidence which suggests poor rec ognition of depression in older adults, the current review identified strong evidence demonstra ting the effectiveness of screening tools for the detection of dementia. Holsinger et al (2007) ident ified 25 available screening instruments and reported that screening tests to identify dementia in older people in primary care settings vary in diagnostic accuracy and administration time. While no single instrument is ideal for all settings, the authors suggest that clinicians should select one p rimary tool and familiarise themselves with it in order to become more efficient in screening for dem entia. Harvan et al (2006) identified 20 relevant studies in their review and concluded that the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) has high sensitivity and specificity in outpatients older th an 65 years when age and education specific cut-off s are used. As outlined in previous sections, while individuals with depression tend to seek help relatively promptly following the initial onset of symptoms, i ndividuals with anxiety disorders wait on average 15 years before seeking help in comparison. Wittche n (2002) concludes that recognition of GAD in primary care is poor, resulting in a high proportio n of people receiving inappropriate or no treatment. In a recent survey (McManus 2009) only 3 3% of patients with GAD reported receiving treatment. In terms of effectiveness of assessment methods, NICE (2011) concluded that, with regard to ultra brief instruments (1-3 items), the GAD-2 had the best diagnostic accuracy for use in primary care while the GAD-7 had the best diagnosti c accuracy among the longer instruments considered. In terms of assessment for alcohol disorders, the N CCMH (2011) review for the development of the NICE (2011) guidelines on the diagnosis, assessment and management of harmful drinking and alcohol dependence identified three tools to measur e alcohol dependence. These were the AUDIT (Babor et al., 2001); the SADQ (Stockwell et al., 1 979); and the Leeds Dependence Questionnaire (LDQ) (Raistrick et al., 1994). Despite these guide lines the current review has not identified evidenc e which points to the extent of the use or effectiven ess of these processes in current practice. The review of literature of psychosis and schizophr enia found no systematic reviews on the effectiveness of assessment processes or methods of early detection. McCrone et al (2011) 150 concluded that early detection services for psychos is are not routinely provided and provision is currently very limited. While review level evidence of the effectiveness of assessments for these disorders is lacking, there is limited review level evidence in terms of cost-effectiveness. McCrone e t al. (2011) found some evidence that early detection services can reduce the rate of transition to full psychosis at an additional cost of \u00a32,948 (2008/9 p rices) per patient, compared with \u00a3743 for standard care. In a separate investigation of the e ffectiveness of specialist early detection services , Mc Crone et al (2011) estimated that, compared to s tandard care, early detection services for patients with prodromal symptoms of schizophrenia a re cost-saving overall. Given the backdrop of 30 to 40 years of civil confl ict in Northern Ireland, PTSD poses a substantial public health burden and challenge to primary care services (Ferry et al 2008). Examination of review level evidence suggests that various well-validated assessment tools exist for screening purposes with one review being identified which explored the ir relative effectiveness (Brewin 2005). The author identified 13 available tools, and concluded that the questionnaires with greatest potential for use in primary care were the Trauma Screening Q uestionnaire (10 items) and the SPAN (4 items). Since the publication of this review, the PTSD-8 ha s been validated and has potential for use in primary care. There is a lack of evidence however w hich indicates if and to what extent these assessment tools are being utilised in primary care settings in Northern Ireland. Isacsson and Rich (2001) who published primary care guidelines for the management of patients who deliberately self-harm, emphasised that these p atients should be assessed as comprehensively and thoroughly as soon as possible, including for t he risk of suicide. These guidelines are indeed mirrored in other sources of guidance which underli ne the need of identification of known risk factors, individual characteristics and mental heal th disorders associated with suicide (NICE 2004). Gaynes et al (2004) concluded that while screening tools can reliably identify people at risk of suicide, they also have the potential to falsely cl assify people at risk, creating an additional burde n on health care staff. There have been inconsistent results around their effectiveness in reducing risk s of suicide, with outcomes largely dependent on the quality of the aftercare and support offered following referral. Despite the obvious gaps in review level evidence w ith respect to screening for suicide risk, Gaynes et al (2006) tested the Symptom Driven Diagnostic S ystem for Primary Care and found that one item (thoughts of death) was effective in the detection of patients with a plan to commit suicide (Gaynes et al 2006). Such a single item test could prove us eful in detecting at-risk patients who could undergo further evaluation of risk factors. So in summary, a variety of tools and processes for mental health assessment exist. The available evidence however suggests that there is considerabl e variation in practices relevant to particular psychiatric conditions and across client groups. T here is little evidence of consistent use of standardized instruments and it can be concluded fr om the evidence reviewed that assessment processes are inconsistent and often reactive. 2. What circumstances help or hinder the effectiveness of assessment services/processes and what are the implications of this/these on targeted and accu rate diagnosis? A variety of circumstances appear to impact on the quality of assessment services/processes. With primary care positioned as the gateway to more spec ialist mental health services and treatment, the majority of mental health disorders are managed wit hin this sector. Given the range and complex combinations and presentations of mental health dis orders and the influence of social, environmental and cultural factors, it is understan dable that GPs and other primary care providers face a difficult challenge in the accurate identifi cation of such disorders. One notable issue that 151 undoubtedly hinders the effectiveness of assessment processes and which will be considered in detail in subsequent paragraphs is the significant proportion of GPs who have not received specific mental health training. This section summarises rev iew level evidence of the factors that help or hinder the effectiveness of assessment processes an d the impact these have on targeted and accurate diagnosis. The review-level evidence poin ts to three circumstances in particular - effectiveness research, treatment-seeking behaviour s and co-morbidity. One recurring theme emerging from evaluation of rev iew level evidence is the lack of 'effectiveness research' and the lack of a uniform validated asses sment instrument for the detection of each specific disorder. With regard to PND, there is a lack of consensus in the use of assessment instruments with regard to timing and frequency. Si milarly, beyond the use of Whooley questions for broad assessment for depression, review evidence pr esents an array of assessment tools that are widely used. To conclude that this lack of consens us may hinder effective assessment; however, is to assume that one uniform assessment instrument fo r each disorder or sub-population is more effective. Further research is therefore required t o determine the effectiveness of these numerous instruments with respect to different disorders and sub-populations. In addition to this lack of reliable evidence of clinical effectiveness, there is a lack of review level research of cost- effectiveness, particularly in relation to depressi on and GAD assessments. This gap in information potentially hinders the widespread assessment of in dividuals with these disorders, as GPs and practice managers will be uninformed as to whether the widespread use of such assessments is economically viable for their practice. The second major theme emerging from the literature which may hinder accurate and targeted diagnoses is the lack of, and substantial delays in , treatment seeking among individuals with mental health disorders. This phenomenon is particularly p revalent in relation to anxiety disorders and substance abuse disorders with individuals waiting on average 22 years and 15 years before seeking treatment (Bunting et al, pending). Wittchen (2002) suggests that just 33% of individuals with GAD have received treatment. These delays in help seeki ng mean that there are substantial numbers of individuals with mental health needs who are enduri ng their problems without appropriate professional help. NICE, and indeed the Bamford rep ort on health promotion, underline the importance of early detection of symptoms in increa sing the chances of effective treatment (NCCMH 2011; Bamford 2006). In the absence of effective tr eatment, the risks of individuals developing a more complex profile of mental health disorders and also associated physical health problems are increased (2008). A further factor that may hinder the effective iden tification of mental health disorders, and directly linked to the theme of 'treatment seeking', is the impact of co-morbid disorders. The NCCMH, for example, outline the range of co-morbidities and co mplex presentations that are known to be associated with GAD which include chronic physical health conditions, other anxiety and depressive disorders and tendency for alcohol misuse (NCCMH, 2 011). The particular challenge presented by co- morbid mental health presentations once again under lines the need for increased training among GPs, and raised awareness of additional physical an d mental disorders that are likely to be associated with a particular mental illness. Whilst focusing specifically on mental health among the older population, Ell (2007) and Ahururu- Drisco (2004) identified a number of features that may hinder recognition of mental disorders: denial of problems and symptoms by the individual; insidious nature of onset; co-morbidity; tolerance of unusual behaviours in remote areas; ac ceptance of cognitive decline in older people; and lack of trained staff with expertise in detecti on of disorders. Further research is however required to determine if these specific influences apply to the wider population. With specific reference to dementia, the current review suggests that despite the availability of screening tools, 152 dementia is probably under-diagnosed and under trea ted with an estimated 50% of primary care patients over 65 not diagnosed by their primary car e physicians. Iliffe et al (2009c) suggest this problem of under-diagnosis is probably not due to a lack of diagnostic skills, but the interaction of case-complexity, pressure on time and the negative effects of reimbursement systems. In their review Koch et al (2010) identified three factors which may have an impact on dementia diagnosis within primary care. Doctor factors consi st of barriers such as diagnostic uncertainty or insufficient knowledge or experience, as well as di sclosing the diagnosis, stigma attached to dementia, and therapeutic nihilism. Patient or soci etal factors included stigma, as well as delayed presentation which could be because of stigma, but also because of many other reasons. Finally the systems factors included time constraints and lack of support (which were the most often-identified factors), as well as financial or remuneration issu es. Despite the aforementioned evidence that focuses on the various aspects which may hinder effective assessment and identification of mental h ealth disorders, review level evidence also provides comprehensive evidence on the prevalence o f mental disorders and their risk factors which offers a useful reference to primary care practitio ners in the identification of mental health disorders. The incorporation of information about r isk factors into assessment approaches is demonstrated in the recommended approach for depres sion assessment. NICE concludes that screening for depression and other mental illness s hould only be undertaken for high-risk populations rather than general population screenin g. High-risk groups identified included people with a history of depression, significant physical illness causing disability, or other mental health problems e.g. dementia (NCCMH 2010). This guidance is now widely implemented in GP practices in terms of targeting assessment processes. Further re search however is required to determine the impact of these targeted assessments in detecting o ther mental disorders particularly among individuals whose profile does not conform with the profile of 'high risk groups'. So in summary, three factors are seen to hinder the effectiveness of assessment practices/processes (effectiveness research, treatment-seeking behaviou rs and co-morbidity). These factors highlight the need for more work to be done to identify the e ffectiveness of standardised approaches to assessment in order to 'convince' primary care work ers in particular of their usefulness in diagnoses practices. The need for greater awareness among th e general population of the importance of treatment-seeking at an early stage in the progress ion of illness is identified. The impact of co- morbidity on assessment effectiveness needs further investigation and consideration. Targeting high-risk groups with information about risk-factor s appears to help in screening programmes and early identification of mental illness 3. What evidence is there of the effectiveness of prim ary care services building on and working with local authority community services, with colleagues in secondary specialised services, and services in the non-statutory sector in order to ensure continu ity of care across all phases of care and service delivery? One of the key aspects of the role of primary care in the management of mental health disorders is ensuring that there is continuity of care across al l phases of care and service delivery. NICE guidanc e underlines this role stating that the best primary care services build on, and work with the local authority community services, with colleagues in se condary specialised services, and services in the non-statutory sector ( NCCMH, 2010). GPs have a vital role to play, not only in the ini tial assessment of individuals, but in ensuring communication with the individual and between the various healthcare professionals involved in the treatment process. Th e current review has devoted a detailed section to the appraisal of evidence regarding models of qu ality improvement that consider numerous treatment models and approaches to the management o f mental health disorders. These 153 approaches are outlined in detail in Section C. In answering the question posed, the review-level evidence focuses on different service delivery mode ls, including case management, collaborative care, stepped care, chronic care, replacement refer ral and home-based approaches. In terms of 'case management', Gensichen and collea gues (2006) in their review of 13 studies of case management of major depression, found strong eviden ce of improved outcomes (symptom improvement, remission, response, and adherence). T his led to the conclusion that case management is an effective intervention to improve the management of major depression in primary care. Further research however is required on the generalisability of these findings to a UK setting, given that the majority of studies include d in the review were based in the US. In a review of studies that also considered papers outside the US however, Christensen and colleagues (2008) concluded that the following elements of case manag ement were associated with more effective practice: direct feedback to GPs; provision of some additional intervention (e.g. psychological therapy); case manager with mental health backgroun d or the use of trained para-professionals. These findings underline the importance of communic ation among different sectors in ensuring effective treatment management and in ensuring the effectiveness of case-management as a service model. Moving on to collaborative care, while reviews by t he NCCMH found insufficient evidence to recommend the use of collaborative care in the trea tment of depression and GAD, numerous previous reviews provided a strong evidence base fo r the effective use of this model in the management of individuals with mental health disord ers (Duncan et al, 2010; Steinman et al, et al. 2007; Gilbody al. 2006; Gilbody et al. 2003). For example Steinman et al. (2010) concluded that collaborative care had a strong evid ence base in improving depressive symptoms, adherence to treatment, response to treatment and r emission and recovery from depression. Stepped-care is a system for delivering and monitor ing treatment with the aim of providing the most effective and least burdensome treatment to the pat ient, and is advocated in the NICE guidelines for the treatment and management of depression in prima ry and secondary care (NICE 2010). According to the review by the NCCMH (2010) this mo del is increasingly common and is set out in various NICE guidelines but there is a limited evid ence-base of mental health studies valuating the approach. Bower and Gilbody (2005) reviewed existin g evidence and found some limited support for the clinical and cost effectiveness of this approac h as a way to deliver psychological therapies, but they also found no evidence for the overall effecti veness of the approach in terms of outcomes. Williams et al (2007) concluded that the Chronic Ca re Model (CCM) framework was useful for understanding outcomes better and for identifying t he key elements of successful interventions. They recommended that policy-makers promote efforts that include well-trained care managers, patient support and education, longitudinal monitor ing and decision support for medication management to strengthen the integration of mental health specialists. One review was identified that explored outreach wo rk as a model to identify and reduce the symptoms of depression among older people (van Citt ers and Britels 2004). There were methodological limitations and generalizability dif ficulties with the 14 studies included. Nonetheless, they concluded that there was some sup port for outreach services in identifying isolated older adults and improving psychiatric sym ptoms. In addition to evidence of effective collaboration between primary care and other sectors through quality improvement models, the review also identif ied studies that have focused on the benefits of cross sector co-operation with respect to suicide m anagement. Woods et al (2010) point to the emerging evidence of multi-component approaches to suicide prevention which involve addressing a 154 variety of risk factors at one time, and at varying levels (e.g. individual, community and societal). Such an approach might, for example, combine school and community education initiatives with training for health professionals and gatekeepers, and emotional support for those with needs. A review by Hegerl et al (2009) indicated that this a pproach has been successful in reducing rates of suicide. Over the intervention period and during th e following year, levels of suicidal acts decreased by over 30% (Hegel et al, 2009). The current review also identified some evidence of the effective collaboration between primary care and other sectors in the management of older p eople with mental health needs. Bruce et al (2005) conducted a review that considered a variety of community and home-based approaches to management of mental health problems among older pe ople which included: the development of shared care protocols, shared care treatment led by primary care, nurse led management, multidisciplinary outreach team managed by a case m anager, and training for care-givers. The authors concluded that despite the heterogeneity of studies, there was some support for home- based mental health services for older adults who h ave limited access to traditional practice-based models. In relation to the management of alcohol disorders, the Department of Health in England (2007) recommends a four tiered approach which may incorpo rate the delivery of interventions by a wide range of staff within a variety of settings. The cu rrent review however did not identify any studies which point to the effectiveness of this approach i n Northern Ireland. To summarise, there is strong evidence that primary care services are effectively implementing both 'case management' and 'collaborative care' models. There is limited evidence of effectiveness to support the use of models of 'stepped care', 'chron ic care', 'replacement referral' and home-based approaches for older people. 4. To what extent is partnership working in facilitati ng service user/carer wishes; are decisions and treatment options evident, and what effect does suc h partnership have on service user outcome? The availability of evidence to answer this questio n is notably lacking with limited evidence identified in relation to supporting families and c are-givers of individuals with dementia. A number of relevant issues were also raised from the analys is of available national guidelines and these are considered here. A review by Chien et al. (2011) found some benefits of group support for carers/family of patients with dementia. The meta-analysis of 30 studies fou nd group support had a positive impact on caregivers' psychological well-being, depression, a nd social outcomes. The review found that the use of theoretical models, and length and intensity of group sessions had a signicant impact on psychological wellbeing and depression. This find ing suggests that educational groups can provide immediate information and advice on care-giving ski lls, ways of self-adjustment, handling and legal issues, and thereby facilitate caregivers' access t o available resources that can reduce their burden in patient care quickly. Psychoeducational groups n ot only provide practical information on patient care, but also focus on caregivers' psychological a nd emotional status as well as establishing a socia l, supportive network, and are more effective at impro ving caregivers' psychological well-being and depression. Throughout their guidance consiste ntly emphasises the importance of 'person- centred care'. They state that individuals who pres ent in a primary care setting with mental health disorders should be treated in a sensitive manner a nd that treatment approaches should take the 155 needs and wishes of the individual into considerati on. Taking guidance on GAD as an example, NICE states that following initial detection, treatment should be offered using a stepped-care approach in consultation with the patient, taking his/her views and needs into consideration. With reference to patient consultation and involvement in treatment d ecision making, practitioners are asked to consider: providing information and signposting to other services; offering written and verbal information on management of GAD including their ro le in supporting the patient; and providing information about crisis management and steps to ge t help (NCCMH 2011). The key role of carers and others significant to th e person in the management of mental health disorders is also referred to in the NICE guidance for psychosis which states that carers, relatives and friends of people with schizophrenia are import ant both in the process of assessment and engagement, and in the long-term successful deliver y of effective treatments (NICE 2009). The review was unable to find any review level evid ence of the extent to which service user wishes in relation to treatment options are being implemen ted. The issue of shared decision making is touched upon to a limited degree within the context of the 'collaborative care model' with Duncan et al (2010) emphasising the key role that professi onal and patient shared decision making has to play in this approach. There is insufficient eviden ce available however to comment on the impact of shared decision making in primary care. In summary, given the clear emphasis across NICE Gu idelines of the importance of service-user involvement in treatment decision making, a key rec ommendation arising from this review is the need for more research in this area. In particular , there is a need for greater understanding of the 'partnership interventions' that enable service use r/carer participation in decision-making and the resulting care outcomes. The making explicit of th e meaning of 'person-centred care' in service delivery models that enable partnership working wou ld be further enhanced through ongoing research. 5. How effective are existing health promoting strateg ies used in primary care and how do these strategies help to reduce the impact of psychiatric conditions on individuals, families and communities? There is considerable review-level evidence availab le pertaining to health promoting strategies in primary care. The effectiveness of these strategie s is different across client groups and mental health conditions. The integration of mental health promotion strategi es among all members of the primary care team has been identified as one of the key principles wh ich characterise an ideal primary care mental health model (see Section C). Given the elevated pr evalence of mental health disorders among the Northern Ireland population, aside from focusing on effective treatment options, primary care should focus efforts on the prevention of mental il lness and the promotion of mental well-being across the population and across the lifespan. Incl uded in the series of final Bamford Reports is a report devoted to this issue of mental health promo tion (Bamford, 2006) which emphasises how mental health underpins all aspects of well-being a nd, therefore, should be seen as an integral part of all health and well-being service provision. The report acknowledges the need for more research into the effectiveness of mental health promotion a t primary care level and advocates that GPs are particularly well placed to deliver mental health p romotion strategies and interventions. Turning firstly to depression, the evaluation of re view level evidence suggests that targeted preventative interventions are effective in reducin g depressive symptoms among women from low 156 socio-economic backgrounds. Van der Waerden and col leagues (2011) found that interventions such as PST, CBT, IPT, and more commonly psycho-educatio n and social support, either at group or individual level, produced significant mental healt h benefits in terms of preventing major depression. In particular, they offered support for targeted psychosocial interventions, and interventions that included both individual and com munity components. The benefit of exercise in promoting mental well-be ing and prevention of mental illness is alluded to in the Bamford Mental Health Promotion Report (2006 ). Grant et al (2000), for example, show that exercise prevents clinical depression and is as eff ective in treatment as other psycho-therapeutic interventions. This review has indeed found that \"E xercise on prescription\" schemes have become increasingly implemented in the UK (Biddle et al. 1 994 in NCCMH 2010). Despite this evidence of the benefits of exercise as a health promotion strategy , the review did not identify any review level studies that examined effectiveness of exercise in terms of mental health promotion. The review identified numerous studies of mental he alth promotion initiatives in post-natal settings. As previously mentioned, the Royal College of Psych iatrists (2002) outline the importance of regular antenatal examinations with continuity of care to p revent depression during and after pregnancy. Dennis (2005) explored the effectiveness of differe nt approaches to prevention with this population and found emerging evidence to support the provisio n of professional support (from midwives or health visitors) post-natally. Furthermore results from another trial showed that flexible, individualised postpartum care by midwives, which i ncorporated assessment tools, also had a preventive effect. Dennis (2005) also examined the evidence on the effectiveness of psycho-social interventions to prevent and treat postnatal depres sion. While there was no benefit among the overall population under consideration, interventio ns that targeted at risk women, those that were individually based, and those that were initiated p ost-natally, were more likely to be beneficial. Although many approaches have been suggested, there is no known way to prevent dementia, except possibly for vascular dementia, when it is r easonable to expect that risk can be reduced by maintaining a healthy lifestyle and by intervention s targeting cardiovascular risk (MeRec 2007). Middle aged and older people should be reviewed for vascular and other modifiable risk factors for dementia (e.g. smoking, excessive alcohol consumpti on, obesity, diabetes, hypertension and raised cholesterol) and treated where appropriate. There is a notable lack of review level evidence of health promotion strategies or prevention strategies in relation to anxiety disorders and sub stance disorders. There was no review level evidence identified for the prevention of initial o nset of GAD, although there is a growing body of primary studies looking at sub-threshold GAD and ea rly signs of worrying. One review of prevention was identified in the area of PTSD prevention. Rose et al. (2002) conducted a review of 15 trials to consider the preventative impact of individual debr iefing sessions following traumatic events. They found no evidence to support the effectiveness of t his approach in prevention onset of PTSD. They concluded compulsory debriefing of victims should c ease and a more appropriate response would be 'screen and treat'. In terms of alcohol disorders, evidence indicates that brief interventions in primary care settings achieve an average 12.3% redu ction in alcohol consumption per individual (Kaner et al 2007). However, this is a short-term e ffect and evidence about its duration is less clear cut. In contrast to this dearth of evidence on the preve ntion of anxiety and substance disorders, the current review identified a number of reviews which have focused on promotion strategies aimed at reducing suicide risk. Three reviews (Beautrais et al 2007, Mann et al 2005, Leitner et al 2008) have examined the evidence on effectiveness of suicide p revention including work within primary care. The principal theme that emerged from these studies was the benefit of increased GP training in 157 suicide prevention and associated reduction in suic idal behavior. Research with GPs in Australia found that many felt ill-equipped to prevent or ide ntify suicide risk in their patients (Pfaff et al 2 001). In their review of the evidence Beautrais et al (20 07) also classified training for general practition ers as having strong evidence of effectiveness. These c onclusions concur with Mann et al's findings which found that GP education/training led to an in crease in the detection of diagnosed and treated depressed patients, with accompanying reductions in suicide. Furthermore, recent research from Scotland (Griesbach et al 2008) indicates that GPs who attended a suicide prevention training (ASIST) course had a 20% greater chance of identifying thos e at risk of suicidal behaviour in the year following training. In contrast to this cohort of evidence, other studi es have found mixed effectiveness evidence in this area (Leitner et al, 2008); Church et al, 2006). Le itner et al for example found three studies specifically on training GPs to recognise and treat depression or other mental ill health. None of these studies reported any change in outcomes for s uicidal behaviour or ideation, either with or without the support of statistical analysis. Church et al (2006) also commented on the limited robust research evidence into effective suicide prevention training programs. They refer to research from Sweden that found some evidence that education for GPs helped to reduce the number of suicides. Despite these positive results, the findings were t he subject of some debate. When half of the GPs who had received the training left the area, the su icide rate subsequently increased, indicating the need for regular training to sustain the positive e ffects. In summary, there is considerable evidence highligh ting the importance of the use of health promoting strategies in primary care. The evidence suggests that targeted health promotion strategies (such as those used in the prevention of depression) may be effective, whilst others that are considered by practitioners to be useful (such as exercise programmes) have limited evidence of effectiveness. This is not to suggest that such pr ogrammes as 'targeted exercise' are not effective, but highlights the need for further outcomes-based research in this area. 6. What evidence is there that GPs are adequately trai ned for assessing, diagnosing and planning treatment/treating people with mental health needs? According to Foy et al (2004) GPs spend 30% of thei r time managing the mental health disorders of their patients (cited in Bamford 2006). Once again the importance of adequate GP training is highlighted in the Bamford Review (Bamford 2006), i n NICE guidance (2010), and is reflected in the key principles of the ideal primary care mental hea lth service outlined in Section C: Primary healthcare professionals should have the appropriat e training to assess and treat adults with mental health needs generally and appropriate to specific mental health and psychiatric disorders. In addition, given the epidemiological evidence of the prevalence of co-morbid mental and physical health disorders (Bunting et al, pending; Ferry et al, 2008), GPs should be aware that mental health disorders commonly co-exist with both physical diso rders and other mental disorders and they should be competent in recognising and assessing th ese possible associations. Despite the obvious importance of mental health focused GP training, 50 % of GPs have had no formal psychiatric training (Croft, 2000) although this figure may have changed since the publication of the Croft (2000) study. Much of the review level evidence of GP training, w hich has been discussed in previous sections, has focused on suicide prevention or health promotion w ith the aim of reducing suicidal behaviours. Training programs have demonstrated positive short- term effects on reducing suicides and suicide attempts but results have been mixed. Follow-up tr aining or additional interventions may be required to sustain benefits. Furthermore, addition al research is required to determine the level and effectiveness of these training strategies in a Nor thern Ireland setting. 158 Aside from the aforementioned evidence of GP traini ng in the specific area of suicide prevention, there is little review level information on the lev el and competency of GP training in relation to oth er mental health issues. In relation to under-diagnos is of dementia, Koch et al (2010) suggest that diagnostic uncertainty or insufficient GP knowledge or experience is an important factor. Primary care training has also been considered to some degr ee under the umbrella of quality improvement models, although evidence is distinctly limited. Bo wer and Gilbody (2005) identified two quality reviews on training. One review focused on 'passive ' training and the authors concluded that this approach was ineffective in improving outcomes in p atients. The second review examined more intense training around psychosocial interventions and found some benefits to patient outcomes. Christensen and colleagues (2008) concurred with th is finding in their review and concluded that the training of GPs in depression care and provision of clinical guidelines on their own were not associated significantly with improved outcomes. Th ey added that this does not imply that interventions would be more effective without this element but rather that they play a role in influencing clinical practice, team collaboration a nd referral routes. In summary, the lack of available review level info rmation on the adequacy of GP mental health training is a pertinent issue, particularly given t he evidence on the lack of early identification of mental health disorders such as depression and GAD. The evidence appears to suggest that GPs are able to rule out depression (for example) in most p eople who are not depressed but difficulties arise in diagnosing depression among those who are depres sed. Findings such as this and those that highlight the limited impact of 'one-off' training, suggest the need for a reconsideration of the plac e of mental health in primary care education programm es. What aspects of primary care are effective in the prevention, recognition and management of mental he alth issues across the lifespan; for whom do they work, in what circumstances and why? Considering the available evidence, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer to the overall research question. Rather than identifying a strong evidence base which demonstrates effective primary care practice in prevention, recognition an d management of mental health disorders, the current review highlights inconsistencies in availa ble evidence and substantial research gaps. In terms of prevention, a number of potentially eff ective strategies have been identified including increased GP training, multi-component approaches t o suicide prevention, targeted strategies aimed at reducing PND and exercise as a form of mental he alth promotion. Evidence however is far from conclusive in these areas, with an obvious gap in N orthern Ireland specific information. Evidence on recognition of mental health disorders also present s a mixed picture. Review level evidence suggests that assessment tools for the detection of dementia such as the MMSE are being effectively used in primary care. Primary care appears to work effectiv ely in ruling out depression, using targeted assessment processes such as the 'Whooley' question s. Despite the availability of a range of standardised instruments that are specific to parti cular client groups and/or disorders, there is litt le evidence to suggest consistency in their use. Revie w level evidence suggests that this lack of consistent evidence coupled with lack of treatment seeking and co-morbid presentations has a marked impact on the effectiveness of current asses sment processes. Finally, the evidence relating to management of mental health disorders across the lifespan raises numerous questions rather 159 than providing clear answers. While there is strong evidence on the effective use of 'case management' and 'collaborative care' models, other models require future research and/or development. Furthermore, aside from limited eviden ce on the use of family and carer support in the management of dementia, there is a distinct lac k of information on the consideration of user/carer wishes in treatment decision making, man agement of mental health disorders in rural areas and effective management of mental health iss ues in older people to name a few. 160 References Ahururu-Driscoll, A., Rasmussen, R., Day.

Research not only produces new information, but refines our thinking in relation t o the event that we once thought we understood, or took for granted. The nature of any review will always be more complete in some areas than in others. Nevertheless, the overall manuscript allow s us to reflect on a great range of literature, by many individuals who have spent a considerable amou nt of time examining the issues dealt with in this review. Based on these studies and our readi ng of the evidence base, a fairly large number of recommendations have appeared in the Executive summ ary. Such recommendations have the potential to affect many individuals and interests, but they all highlight the ready acceptance that we can do better. Despite the limitations of this review, (the curren t report) provides a comprehensive overview of available review-level evidence relating to the eff ectiveness of primary care mental health services across a broad range of disorders, sub-populations and cross-cutting issues. The importance of effective prevention, recognition and management st rategies and processes within primary care has been consistently highlighted throughout the Bamfor d Reports, particularly in the Mental Health Promotion Report (Bamford, 2006) which outlines the key role of the GP in ensuring effective mental health service delivery. This point has been reinfo rced by contextual evidence presented in Section A of this report: Epidemiological evidence underlines the extent of the public health burden posed by mental health disorders, the additional impact of t he Troubles and challenges for primary care in terms of delays in treatment and treatment dropout. The current review has collated information on the effectiveness of primary care mental health service provision with the aim of comparing the ava ilable evidence with key principals of the ideal primary care model. While it is recognised that the ideal model will vary with respect to different disorders and targeted sub-population, broad compar ison of review level evidence with the key principals presented in Section B reveals some limi ted evidence to suggest that there are certain circumstances in which primary care works effective ly in the recognition, prevention and management of mental health problems. For example t here is evidence to suggest that primary care works effectively in: assessing high risk groups fo r depression; the use of assessment procedures for dementia; the use of identification measures for GA D; managing home visits for older people; individualised post-natal care management; implemen tation of models of quality improvement; providing group support for carers and families of those with dementia; and reducing suicidality through increased GP training. The review however has also highlighted many areas where there are gaps or insufficient evidence on effectiveness. In relation to assessment process es, the review-level evidence would appear to suggest that there are significant variations in as sessment practices and processes in and between client groups. A number of key factors have been i dentified which may hinder the effectiveness of assessment processes and which may be used to infor m future research and development. While the review has collated strong evidence to support the development of some models of service delivery such as 'case management', alternative mod els require further investigation. There is an acute lack of evidence which demonstrates partnersh ip working in facilitating service user/carer wishes about treatment decisions which presents a p ertinent area for further research. While there 166 exists considerable review-level evidence pertainin g to health promoting strategies in primary care, the effectiveness of these strategies is different across client groups and mental health conditions. Finally the current review has confirmed the need f or increased and sustained GP mental health training. Limitations of the current review The results of the current review should be interpr eted with a number of limitations in mind. Firstly, given the broad scope of the commissioned review an d limited timeframe, the review primarily considers review level evidence relating to effecti ve service delivery in primary care. While the report draws upon some contextual level information as well as guidance standards, it was not possible to incorporate information from primary le vel studies which may contain answers to some of the research questions under consideration. For similar reasons, qualitative reviews were not considered in the current review. Given that the ov erall research question is somewhat qualitative in focus, a review of qualitative data on this subject area presents a specific opportunity for future research. Secondly, this report does not provide ev idence across an exhaustive list of mental health disorders. Impulse-control disorders for example ha ve not been included, but given that these are mostly prevalent among children, it is assumed that this topic has been considered elsewhere. The review also provides limited evidence on substance abuse and does not include studies on drug abuse or addiction, phobias or bi-polar disorder am ong others. One important issue identified in the original proposal was the delivery of effective pri mary care services in rural areas. The review searc h found limited information relating to this topic an d it has therefore not been included. One obvious gap in the evidence included in this review is the lack of Northern Ireland specific studies with many of the reviews based in the US and other parts of t he UK. Individuals living in Northern Ireland, as i n many societies, come from different ethnic backgrou nds, and may well experience ambivalence in terms of cultural identity, plus having to live wit h the psychological and social effects of racism an d discrimination. These are known to have psychologi cal consequences, but within the context of Northern Ireland these effects have yet to be exami ned within the current context. Equally there is a lack of review level evidence on the impact of the 'Troubles' on primary care services. While there now exists an invaluable body of primary evidence o n the mental health impact of the 'Troubles' from epidemiological data, no reviews were identifi ed which relate specifically to primary care.
