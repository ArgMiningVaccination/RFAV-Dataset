These substances include whole-food supplements, homeopathy remedies, herbs, enzymes, exercise, and other natural products but do not involve prescription drugs or unnecessary surgery. Naturopathic examinations include hair analysis, symptom survey, salivary testing, and blood analysis. At Winiger Chiropractic, we focus on supporting our patient's mind, body, and spirit by promoting healthy lifestyle choices and seeking to determine the underlying cause of each patient's acute and chronic conditions. Your wellness is our main priority. Are you looking for a healthy lifestyle? Or do you want to know more about naturopathy? Call us today at (812) 424-8514 to schedule an appointment for a naturopathic consultation. Naturopathic consultations are $25 per hour. We know it can be hard to consume all the nutritional needs to maintain a healthy diet, so whole food supplements may be a practical option to receive all the nutrients you might lack.
