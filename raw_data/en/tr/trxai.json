Wed. 10:00-10:30 am, http://webct.uvm.edu:8900 Prerequisites: 21 and one 100-level course in Anthropology Course Description: This advanced seminar applies social and cultural perspectives to the exploration of health and illness experiences, doctor-patient interactions, healing traditions and therapeutic practices, and the political economy of health and health care. Central issues explored include the influence of culture on people's views and experiences of health and illness, how sociocultural factors involved in doctor-patient interactions can affect treatment efficacy and client satisfaction, the cultural assumptions underlying various healing traditions and therapeutic practices, and the ways in which politics and economics can affect people's access to health and health care. This course will provide an opportunity for students to read, analyze, discuss, and write about an extensive selection of scholarly literature in medical anthropology. In the spirit of an advanced seminar, class meetings will center primarily around interactive class discussion, and course work will involve not only mastery of assigned readings and in-class material, but also the completion of independent reading and research connected with each student's semester project. This semester, readings, lecture material, and class discussions in this course will focus on Asian conceptions of health and Asian healing practices across the world and on health, healing, and health care in Asian societies. In the spirit of cross-cultural comparison, however, professor and students alike will be free to draw into class discussion examples from non-Asian societies and healing traditions. In addition, students are encouraged to conduct their semester projects on sociocultural aspects of health, healing, and/or health care in any society or culture, Asian or non-Asian, in which they have an interest. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Anthropology 295: Medical Anthropology Professor Shea, Spring 2001 Introduction to the course: Wed.

Preparation: Assigned readings must be completed prior to each class meeting. Inadequate preparation will impair your ability to participate effectively in class discussion and perform well in your written work. Class discussions will assume completion of assigned readings. It is your responsibility to make sure to complete all of the readings in a timely fashion. Attendance: Attendance at each class meeting is crucial to your ability to do well in this course. Classes will start promptly at 1:25 pm on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Students are expected to arrive in the classroom by 1:25 pm and to remain in the classroom until the end of the class at 2:15 pm. No absences and no tardiness can be permitted without documentation of a serious health problem, family emergency, religious obligation, or other excused reason. Unexcused absences, tardiness, or early departures will bring down the student's class participation grade. If you do need to be absent, with or without an excused reason, please touch base with the professor and TA via a brief note or email as soon as you can. If, during class, you need to arrive late or leave early, you should do so quietly and considerately, giving a brief note with your name, the date, and an explanation to the lecturer. It is your responsibility to make up any content that you miss due to absence from class. Conduct: All members of the class are expected to be attentive and considerate, to work together to create a positive and invigorating learning environment, and to treat each other with respect and compassion. In the classroom, students are expected to actively participate in course discussions, to ask questions and express their analyses of issues raised in readings, to encourage others to participate in discussion, to listen respectfully to others' points of view, and to respond diplomatically to differences of opinion. On the course website, participants should take full advantage of the possibilities offered by online interactivity, while making sure to observe web etiquette and refrain from flaming, spamming, and other inconsiderate online practices. Inappropriate conduct whether in the classroom or on the course website will bring down the student's class participation grade. Late papers and makeups: Late papers cannot be accepted, extensions cannot be granted, and makeups cannot be given without documentation of a serious health problem, family emergency, religious obligation, or other excused reason. Please mark your calendars and set your alarm clocks carefully. Unexcused absence on the day that a presentation is scheduled will result in a zero on the presentation in question. Unexcused late papers will be marked down by a full letter grade per day late (e.g., one to twenty-four hours late, an A- becomes a B-). Plagiarism and cheating: Not only do these practices hamper a person's ability to learn and create and a group's ability to maintain fairness and trust , plagiarism and cheating are both serious violations of the honor code at the University of Vermont. Violations will result in severe consequences, including a zero on the essay, paper, or presentation in question. Please familiarize yourself with proper citation practices. If you have any questions concerning the line between doing your own work and copying the work of others, please do not hesitate to ask. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Anthropology 295: Medical Anthropology Professor Shea, Spring 2001 Overview of Course Readings Experiences of health and illness: Lock, Encounters 2: Regimens of Treatment Western Biomedicine Kleinman, What is Specific to Biomedicine (on reserve) Humoral Systems in Papua New Guinea Strathern, ch. 3: Humoral Papua Melpa Strathern, ch. 5, Duna Ritual Practices and Healing Traditional Chinese Medicine Zhang, Who Can Ride Medicine Practice ... a Published Case Unschuld in Leslie, Traditional Chinese Medicine in the Twentieth Century Ayurvedic Medicine Trawick in Leslie, Death and Nurturance in Indian Systems of Healing Obeyesekere in Leslie, Science, Experimentation, and Clinical Practice in Ayurveda Zimmerman, The Flower Power of Ayurveda Islamic Humoral Medical Traditions Good in Leslie, Greco-Islamic Medicine Laderman in Leslie, Islamic Humoralism Medical Syncretism, Medical Pluralism Strathern, ch. 6: Medical Pluralism among the Huli Leslie, Syncretism in Modern Ayurveda Political economy of health and health care: Strathern, ch. 13: Critical Medical Anthropology Kim, Dying for Growth Farmer in Kim, Foreword Millen in Kim, ch. 1: Introduction: What is Growing?
