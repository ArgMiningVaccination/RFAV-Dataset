We included 1482 publications in the report. Since several of these may have report ed to have more than one study de- sign, such as both a publication with a human study and an animal experiment, the number of study de- signs included are in total 1760. Respiratory , cardio- vascular as well as other adverse e vents (outcome not given under other code) were the health o utcomes most often reported. Very few h uman studies were published the first years after the introduction of e -cigarettes in 2007, but from 2013 there was an increase. C ase reports and case se- ries led the way, followed by cross -sectional studies. We iden tified 41 randomised controlled trials (RCT) . This study design is the most rigorous way of deter- mining if a cause -effect relation exists between inter- vention (here use of e -cigarettes ) and outcome. Only one of the RCTs had a follow -up time of six months o r more . Among the other 105 studies with a control group, only six had a follow -up time of more than 2 years. Thus, any adverse impact of e -cigarette use on health which may take long time to develop , may re- main undetected. Overall, the interactive research map gives a visual presentation of th e broad variety of health conse- quences linked to the use of e- cigarettes and may be used to identify potential human health risks and pos- sible research gaps. Identification of the latter can be useful for the discussion of focus of future research The map shows what research is available, it does not assess the quality of the studies or size or severity of the health risk from using e -cigarettes.

Innledningsvis oppf\u00f8lgingstid Hovedbudskap Preface In 2020, the Ministry of Health and C are Services requested the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) to update and expand the report \u00abHealth risks from the use of e- cigarettes\u00bb published by the NIPH in 2015 ( NIPH, 2015 ). The mandate for the assignment of a new report on health risks as sociated with the use of e -cigarettes was given in June 2020 . Since the report f rom NIPH in 2015 , new products with changes in design and content have been introduced, and the scientific literature on health effects of e -cigarettes has increased significa ntly. Th is implies a need for updated information. The Ministry gave the NIPH a t wo-part assignment: The first part of the assignment w as to perform a systematic literature search and subsequent ly prepar e an interactive map of research on health effects o f e-cigarette use or exposure . This research map should include all studies (in vitro, in vivo, clinical, epidemiological, etc.) classified by type of publication and topic of the research. Areas where research is lacking or insufficient should be identified. The systematic literature search should be restricted to studies addressing health effects and not include other e - cigarette related issues such as harm reduction and \"gateway\" (here the possibility that use of e -cigarettes lead s to use of other tobacc o or nicotine containing products) or the use of e -cigarettes in smoking cessation. In agreement with the established policy of leading scientific journals , research funded by or otherwise linked to the tobacco industry sh ould not be included. Otherwise, NIPH was free to organize the work with the interactive map, as found appropriate, including consultation with any external expertise. The present report with linked interactive research map is the result of the first part of the assignment. The report including its interactive resea rch map provides an orientation on available research and knowledge gaps on the potential health effects from e -cigarettes. The report and the interactive map will be an important base for the second part of the assignement ; the preparation of a systematic review over selected possible health con- sequences of e -cigarettes use and exposure . 8 Hovedbudskap Project leader Rune Becher , Norwegian Institute of Public health Working group H\u00e5kon Valen , Norwegian Institute of Public health Gunn E.

Johan \u00d8vrevik Director of Research / Chief Scientist Project responsible Rune Becher Senior scientist Project leader 9 Hovedbudskap Introduction E-cigarettes Electronic cigarettes ( e-cigarettes) are electronic devices, essentially consisting of a cartridge filled wit h a liquid ( e-cigarette liquid), an evaporator unit/heating element associated with a battery, all together connected to a mouthpiece . When heated, the e - cigarette liquid will form an aerosol (vapour) meant to be inhaled. Other terms such as ENDS (electron ic nicotine delivery system) and NVP (nicotine vaping products) are also used. E-cigarettes were developed and patented in China in 2003, subsequently modified and launched on the American market in 2006. They can be disposable, rechargeable with a cartri dge, or manually refillable with e -cigarette liquid. First -generation e- cigarettes were often cigarette imitations. Later , more advanced products have appeared. Some shaped like a pen, while others come with systems that may carry larger amounts of e - liqui d than earlier models. Third generation e- cigarettes consist s of a diverse range of products often termed \"vaping\" produc ts. Their design often ha s even less resemblance to cigarettes, as the cartridge may be square or rectangular and they may have options for customizing and conversion. These products are often referred to as \"mods\", since the users can modify the device or build their own version ( NASEM, 2018 ). The e -cigarette liquid may contain nicotine or be nicotine free. The e -liquid usually contains a mixture of propylene glycol (PG) , vegetable glycerine (VG) , and available number of these flavours/combination of flavours is exceedingly high. The harmful potential of nicotine has been documented from studies in cell culture s, animals and, although less, in humans ( US Surgeon General, 2014 ). For other constituents identified in e -liquids, such as PG/ VG and flavours, the potential health risks have been evaluated following oral intake an d are thus generally regarded as safe. However, the health risks associated with inhalation of these constituents ha ve been less evaluated. Moreover, t he heating process can lead to chemical decomposition of these constituents and the formation of new compounds of altered toxicity (pyrolysis) . Other constituents found in aerosols including metals and silicate particles may add to the toxicity of the inha led vapour (SCHEER, 2020 ). Numerous in-vitro - and animal studies have been performed to elucidate the potential health consequences these inhalable constituents confer. Several of these studies 10 Hovedbudskap report c ellular effects associated with potential impact on airways, inflammation, impairment of cardiovascular function and toxicity. In addition, some of the compounds identified in aerosol fro m e-liquid are known or potential carcinogens. There is also an increasing number of studies adressing adverse impacts of e -cigarettes on human health, related to e- cigarette- or vaping use -associated lung injury (EVALI) , ingestion by infants as well as explosions /burns. However, the composition of the inhaled vapour is affected by the e- cigarette device and e -liquid as well as the vaping pattern which all affect the dose of toxicants the user is exposed to. Any adverse outcomes will also depend on user s pecific ( genetic ) and environmental factors linked to the each vaper that may predispose for possible health effects ( NASEM, 2018 ; SCHEER 2020 ). Thus, a more precise evaluation of the health risks linked to e - cigarettes use is complicated due to the large variation of products on the marked and the heterogeneity of users (e.g. time of use, age of user, comorbidity) . Furthermore, the potential long -term effects of e -cigarette use have so far only been scarcely investigated. It should also be noted that e -cigarettes may be used for vaping other liquids or compounds that may be illegal or produced for other purposes, and thus not provided commercially from the e -cigarette producer. However, this latter is beyond the scope of this report. The need for an interactive research map The previous report on health risks associated with the use of e -cigarettes from NIPH was published in 2015 . In addition, the report \"Public Health Consequences of E -Ciga- rettes \" from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (N ASEM) was published in 2018, with a literature search dated as of August, 2017 ( NASEM, 2018 ). The European report from SCHEER published in April 2021 was based on a liter- ature search dated as of April 2019 (SCHEER, 2020 ). This latter repor t did not includ e a clear description of the methods used for inclusion and evaluation of the scientific liter-ature; and health consequences were only fully described for cardiovascular diseases. The rapid development and modification of e -cigarettes and e -liquids leading to diver- sification of the inhaled aerosols and habits , combined with a continuous stream of new research publications makes it relevant to update the literature search on this field to detect new data of importance for the assessment of h ealth risks rela ted to e -cigarette use. The interactive map gives an overview over available research on health consequences from the use and exposure to e- cigarettes. The interactive map gives a visual overview of the amount and type of available research and allows th e users to select themes a nd subgroups of special interest. In addition to showing what research is available the map also shows where there are research gaps. 11 Hovedbudskap Aims The aim of this work was to systematically search, identify and categorize published research linked to human health risks associated with the use of e -cigarettes and to present our findings in interactive map s which can be used for extracting references on self selected categorie s such as study design, age of participants in the studies a nd type of health consequences. In addition to human studies, the map include s relevant in- vitro - and animal studies. 12 Hoved budskap Method We have prepared this interactive research map in accordance with o ur pre -published -/) and the Campbell Collaboration's for evidence and gap maps ( https://campbellcollaboration.org/evidence- gap-maps.html ). Problem statement Since the introduction of e -cigarettes on the market, a development and diversification of both the e -cigarette and e- liquids has followed. The amount of scientific literature on health effects of e -cigarettes is increasing steeply. Thus, there is a need for updated overview of the available scientific information on health consequences of e -cigarettes to be able to contribute to evidence based advices and regulations regarding e - cigarettes. Inclusion criteria We used the following inclusion criteria: Populations: No restrictions : all human -, animal - and in -vitro studies Measures: All types of electronic cigarettes and additives Comparison: No restrictions: smoki ng, snuff or no use of tobacco product allowed as comparison Outcomes: All health outcomes as a result of the use of electronic cigarettes Study design: No restriction Publlcation year: No restriction Language: Danish, English, Norwegian, Swedish Exclusion criteria: Research funded by or otherwise link ed to the tobacco industry Harm reduction publications without evidence of health outcomes Studies tha t only describe or discuss the pattern of use of tobacco products Primarily addiction focused research Discussion papers without primary data or secondary analysis 13 Hovedbudskap Literature search Research librarian Miriam Bakkeli prepared, in collaboration with the pro ject group, the search strategy. The strategy was peer reviewed by another research librarian before she conducted the searches. The following databases were searched: Ovid MEDLINE Embase PsycInfo Web of Science Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews The full search strategy in shown in Appendix 1. Selection of studi es Two authors f rom the working group (RB, HV, BCB, JAH, GEV, TKG, JA and IK\u00d8E) read through and assessed each of the references identified in the literature searches. Relevant references were selected on the basis of our inclusion criteria. The selection was stepwise, first on the basis of title and summary/abstract, and then full -text versions of the publications. Any disagreements we re resolved through discussion or contact with another re searcher in the team. We used the software EPPI Reviewer 4. Data collection and presentation All categories were divided into subcategories, and the suggestions in the protocol were piloted and improved . Our final set of categories are presented in the co de book in Appendix 2. EPPI Reviewer 4 software was used to code the included studies. At least two authors (RB, HV, BCB, JAH, GEV, and TKG ) categorized each selected publication independently of each ot her. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. Asse ssment of the risk of systematic biases and confidence in the results Our research map provide s an overview of the scope and type of research on the health effects of electronic cigarettes. This work doe s not include assessment of the risk of systematic biases in the included studies, analysis or assessment of confidence in the effect estimates. We have deviated from the protocol by assessing the quality of the included systematic reviews using AMSTAR 2 ( Shea et al., 2017 ). VU and GEV made these assessment s independently, disagreements were solved by discussion. Codebook 14 Hovedbudskap The development of a codebook was part of the project (Appendix 2). The purpose of the codebook was to give the project staff a common understanding of how the codes should be used. The co debook specifies which main and sub -categories are to be included in the research map's axes, filters and segments, with definitions and examples. The project group at FHI fi rst made a proposal for a codebook based on categories used in relevant publicati ons that were already known to the group . A reference group consisting of the project's external experts reviewed and provided input to the proposal. The project group complet ed the codebook based on the input, and piloted it on a selection of systematic o verviews. Preparation of the interactive map This NIPH report present s the different categories of the interactive research in tables and text describing the existence of ava ilable research. We extracted information from studies and sorted this into the v arious categories using frequency and cross table functions in EPPI -Reviewer. The interactive research map s are available as html file s which may be uploaded and freely avai lable on a website . The maps show an interactive matrix that illustrates the land scape of evidence on health consequences from use of electronic cigarettes. 15 Results Result s Result s from the lit erature search Our literature searches in the databases Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo and Web of Science were conducted in December 2020, the liter ature search in Cochrane w as conducted in February 202 1. After removal of duplicates, we were left with 9969 references to be assess ed on title and abstract against our inclusion criteria (Figure 1) . Figure 1. PRISMA flow diag ram of the r esults of the literature search Records screened on ti tle and abstract (n =9969 ) Records identified through database search es (n = 19 356 ) Records identified through search in Cochrane (n = 316 ) Records after removing of duplicates (n = 9661 + 308 ) Records excluded based o n title and abstract (n = 6128 ) Full-text publications assessed for eligibility (n =3841 ) Full text articles excluded : Additional duplicates n = 193 Not a study n= 1180 Link w/tobacco company n= 298 Different languages n= 164 Heat not burn n= 43 Cannabinoids/THC/marijuana= 130 Not health outcome n= 98 Other n= 253 Include d publications (n = 1482) 16 Results Each of the 9969 identified references were assessed on title and abstract a ccording to our inclusion criteria by two authors independently of each other . Disagreements were solved by a third reviewer . The 384 1 references that were considered potentially relevant were assessed in full text, again a ccording to the same inclusion criteria and by two people independently of each other. We did, however, code s ome references based only on abstract due to unavailable full text s. Excluded studies The reasons for exclusions are shown in figure 1. The most common reason for exclu- sion was that the publications did not actually present a study or systematic review, most of these 118 0 excluded publications were commentaries , editorials and review ar- ticles without a literature search . The second most common reason for exclusion was that the publication was either sponsored by or written by authors with links to a to- bacco company, which applied to 298 publications . There were still 193 duplicates un- identified before the full text assessment. One hundred and thirty publications reported either a study with the use of electronic cigarettes in combination with canna- binoids/THC/marijuana or on the health consequences or cases with adverse events resulting from such use. These studies and case reports where all the partici-pants/cases had been using cannabinoids/THC/marijuana were excluded. Other stud-ies or case reports involving one or more participants/cases who did not use these s ub- stances were included in the map. Included studies We included 1482 publications in the report , references are presented in Appendix 3 . Since several of these may have one or more study design, such as a publication with both a human study and an anima l experiment, the number of study designs included was in total 1760. Figure 2 shows that airway and pulmonary, cardiovascular and vascular as well as other adverse e vents were the health outcomes most often reported. Figure 2.

However, only 23 of them had both a literature search and an assessment of the risk of bias (the internal validity) of the in- cluded studies . These 23 were included as systematic review s and health consequences in humans were assessed in 1 5 of these. Three of the 23 studies assessed animal and in vitro/mechanistic data. The time trend for publication of systematic reviews and non- systematic reviews (with literature search) is shown in Figure 5. Figure 5. Time distribution of publications of systematic and non -systematic reviews re- garding health consequences of use of electronic cigarettes Critical appraisal of systematic r eviews We used the AMSTAR 2 critical appraisal tool ( Shea et al 2017 ) to assess the quality of the included systematic reviews of health consequences . The 16 questions used for the AMSTAR 2 appraisal were : 1. Did the research questions and inclusion criteria for the review include the component s of PICO (Population, Intervention/exposure, Comparison, Outcome)? 2. Did the report of the review contain an explicit statement that the review methods were established prior to the conduct of the review and did the repo rt justify any significant deviations from the protocol? 3. Did the review authors explain their selection of the study designs for inclusion in the review? 4. Did the review authors use a comprehensive literature search strategy? 5. Did the review authors perform study selection in duplicate? 6. Did the review authors perform data extraction in duplicate? 7. Did the review authors provide a list of excluded studies and justify the exclusions? 8. Did the review authors describe the included studies in adequate detail? 9. Did the review authors u se a satisfactory technique for assessing the risk of bias (RoB) in individual studies that were included in the review? 0102030405060 <2011 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020Number of publications Publication year Systematic review Non-systematic review 19 Results 10. Did the review authors report on the sources of funding for the studies included in the review? 11. If meta -analysis was performed did the review authors use appropriate methods for statistical combination of results? 12. If meta -analysis was performed, did the review authors assess the potential impact of RoB in individual studies on the results of the meta -analysis or other e vidence synthes is? 13. Did the review authors account for RoB in individual studies when interpreting/ discussing the results of the review? 14. Did the review authors provide a satisfactory explanation for, and discussion of, any heterogeneity observed in the res ults of the rev iew? 15. If they performed quantitative synthesis did the review authors carry out an adequate investigation of publication bias (small study bias) and discuss its likely impact on the results of the review? 16. Did the review authors report any potential sources of conflict of interest, including any funding they received for conducting the review? Each question was answered yes (Y), probably yes (PY), probably no (PN), no (N) or not applicable (NA). Question #9 is answered twice, first for RCT and then for obser va- tional studies. Two authors critically appraised each systematic review ind ependently before they compared and discussed. Our full AMSTAR 2 assessments of the 18 included systematic reviews pertaining to health consequences in humans of u se of electroni c cigarettes are presented in A ppen- dix 4. An overview of our assessments is presented in Table 1. Only four of these re- views obtained a High quality score (H), nine were of Moderate quality (M) and four of Low quality (L), one scored Critica lly Low (CL) . In Table 2 the systematic reviews are presented according to which health conse-quences that were assessed in the review, marked as dark green in the box. Reviews are listed so that the one with the most recent literature search is presented first. It is clear from the table that the following health consequences measured in human studies had not been summarised in a systematic review by the time of our search (February 2021): Digestive system Central nerve system Cancer Immune system Metabol ic disorders Mortality Explosions and burns Other biomarkers Kidney and urological tract 20 Results Table 1.

In figure 7, the RCTs are presented according to the areas of health consequences cov- ered by the trials. The numbers add up to more than 41 because some trials assessed several different outcome categories. Exposure characterisation and assessment and or physical or chemical analysis was the aim in 5 of the randomised t rials, providing no explicit measure of health consequences. Figure 7. Health consequences addressed in the randomised controlled trials Participants in these 41 RCTs were a dolescents and young adults 16 -24 years (27 tri- als) and ad ults > 25 years (33 t rials) . Two trial s did not provide the age of the partici- pants. These age groups were not exclusive, as several of the trials included partici- pants from more than one age group. Only one of the RCTs had a follow -up time of six months or more, which was an 8-week study with a follow -up telephone call at six months (Lee et al 2018). The other 40 RCTs had a follow -up time of < 6 months. We coded publications involving humans according to what the use of e-cigarettes was compared with (figure 8) . Multiple com parisons could be performed for each of the studies. Typically the use of e -cigarettes could be compared to an unexposed control group or to tobacco smoking .

Shows the proportion between the different comparisons, exposures for random- ised controlled trials and non -randomised studies with a control group Non -randomised studies with a control group We identified 105 non- randomised controlled studies involving the use of electronic cigarettes. In figure 9, these studies are presented according to the relevant areas of health consequences measured. The numbers add up to mor e than 105 because some studies measured several different health outcome categories. Figure 9.

Participant characteristics in these 105 non- randomised controlled studies are shown in figure 10. Adolescents and young adults 16 -24 years ( 69 studies) and a dults > 25 years ( 85 studies) were well represented . Thirteen studies did not provide the age of the participants. These age groups were not ex clusive, as many of the trials included part icipants from more than one age group. Figure 10. Participant characteristics for the non -randomised controlled studies Only s ix of the 105 non- randomised controlled studies on use of electronic cigarettes had a follow -up time of more than two years. One study investigated changes in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) progression over a six -year period (Bowler et al 2017) . Two studies had a four -year follow -up, on e report ed on the participants ' per- ceived stress (Leventhal et al 2 017) and one report ed on the participants ' self-reported health (Bhatta et al 2020) . Three studies had a three -year follow -up, one reported on the development of gum disease (Atuegwu et al 201 9), one on respiratory disease (Xie et al 2020) and one on depressive symptom s (Marsden et al 2019) .

The interactive research map s give a systematic and visual overview by providing graphical presentation s of areas with many, some or non-existent scientific documentation. The identified research gaps further indicate where future research may be useful. This interactive research map visual ise the available research but it does not assess the size of the health risk associated with electronic cigarettes. The interactive research map s are available as html file s which may be uploaded and freely available on a website. These maps should be u seful for evidence synthesis and the production of systematic reviews as well as for prioritising new research. We have made 5 evidence and gap maps about research on electronic cigarettes: Health consequences of e- cigarettes, studies involving humans Health consequences of e- cigarettes, prospective studies involving humans Health consequences of e- cigarettes, case reports and case series Health consequences of e- cigarettes, follow up time for prospective studies involving humans Health consequences associated with e -cigarettes, follow up time for animal studies We classify the s tudies involving humans in four study groups: ra ndomised controlled study, non -randomi sed controlled study, prospective study, case -controls .

Our literature searches were conducted in December 2020 (in Cochrane in February 2021 ). After removal of duplicates, we had 9969 references . These references were assessed on title and ab- stract according to our inclusion criteria by two authors independently of each other. The 3841 r eferences that were considered potentially relevant were assessed in full text, again according to the same inclusion criteria and by two people independently of each other. After exclusion, a total of 1482 publications related to health consequences of the use of electronic cigarettes were included . There were many reviews, however, only 23 of them were systematic reviews, fifteen of them were on health consequences in humans who use electronic cigarettes. Health consequences summarised in these systemat ic reviews covered oral, airways and pul- monary health, cardiovascular and vascular health, mental health, pregnancy, poison-ing, other adverse events and sexual health. Randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies are the most rigorous study design for de- termining if a caus ality between intervention (here use of e- cigarettes) and outcome. However, among the 41 RCTs, only one study had a follow -up of six months. Among the other 105 studies with a control group, only six had a follow -up time of more than 2 year s. Thus, any (adverse) impact of e -cigarette use on health which may take an ex- tended time to develop may so far pass undetected. Due to the recognised health hazards associated with tobacco use, it would be in general unethical to randomise people with out any experience with tobacco use or with use of electronic cigarettes. H ence, it is no surprise that there w as no long -term rando mised human studies on the health cons equences associated with t he use of electronic cigarettes. Among the health conseque nces reported in the included human studies, respiratory and cardiovascular outcomes and other adverse events (outcome not given under other code) , were most frequently assessed. For case -reports and case -series studies, after respiratory outcom es, the sec ond and third highest numbers of adverse outcomes were 34 Discussion injuries caused by explosions and burns, and by poisoning. Many of the studes on poisoning episodes assess ingestion of nicotin -containing e -liquid by children. In addition there are numer ous animal and in vitro studies examining the effect of exposure to e- liquid/constituents of e -liquid and/or their aerosols available. Such studies may be use to support or refute if the use of electronic cigarettes confer a risk for specific adverse healt h outcomes, or to detect potential health risk which are difficult to reveal in present human studies Evidence gaps The interactive research map visualizes identified knowledge gaps. There are few publications, and hence, little available documentation regarding effects of e-cigarette use on the digestive system, the central nerv ous system, mental health, cancer, immune system, metabolic disorder, pregnancy, mortality, sexual health, kidney and ur inary tract. Research and surveillance reg arding these outcomes ma y therefore be needed before any conclusion regarding potential health impact from the use of e - cigarettes is reached . The majority o f available epidemiological studies investigating an association between adverse health outcomes and the use of e -cigarett es have focused on health consequences related to respiratory and cardiovascular health . Few studies have long follow -up time, thus any adverse health consequences of e -cigarette use which may take an extended time to develop , may s o far gone undetected. With regard to animal and in vitro studies, there are still need for supportive studies for assiciations/lack of associations seen in epidemiological studies. There is in particular a strong need for information further elucidating any potential risk for adverse health outcomes which take s long tim e to develop in humans. Strengths and limitations of this research map The strength of the map is th at it provides an overview over current knowledge and identifies knowledge gaps by a systematic and transparent approach. The systematic mapping of an area of research is a steppingstone for conducting new research . The map provides easy access to relevant studies to summarize evidence in a systematic review. On the other hand, the map does not assess the quali ty of the studies nor the size or severity of the health risk s. It is always a limitation with any summarising documents that they may be outdated as soon as new literature is published. This also goes for our interactive map on research 35 Discussion on the use of ele ctronic cigarettes, as our literature searche s were conducted in December 2020 and February 2021 . Another limitation of interactive research maps is that they are based on categorisation systems that can be difficult to use consistently. The aim of each category/code is to be as specific as possible, but not all data extracted from the different publications will always fit with one code precisely. An example is that several of the publications included in the present maps have study designs that are dif ficult to categories precisely to one c ode, as overlaps may occur between study designs. 36 Conclusion Conclusion The codes most often in the included human studies were related to respiratory and cardiovascular health, along with adverse events not associated wi th a specific organ or disease type. Few human studies were published during the first years after the introduction of the e-cigarettes in 2007, with an increasing rate from 2013 , and a steep increase in publications the last few years . Case reports and case series led the way, followed by cross -sectional studies. As for all new products put on the marke t, there are few long -term human studies available to detect adverse effects that may develop over years and decades. However , numero us in-vitro - and a nimal studies were identified in our search . These may be useful for assessing human health risk. A common reason for exclusion was that the publication was either sponsored by or written by authors with links to tobacco industry , this a pplied to 298 publications. The present interactive research map gives a visual presentation of the broad variety of health consequences linked to the use of e- cigarettes and may be used to identify potential human health risks and possible research gaps . The interactive research map does not assess the size or severity of the health risk s from use of e-cigarettes . Identification of research gaps can be useful for discussion of where future research should focus. 37 Referenc es Atuegwu N C, Perez M F; Oncken C and Mead E L; Maheshwari N ; Mortensen E M; (2019) E -cigarette use is associated with a self -reported diagnosis of prediabetes in never cigarette smokers: Results from the behavioral risk factor sur -veillance system survey.

For Partial Yes (ALL the following): For Yes, should also have ALL the following: x described populations described population in detail Yes x described interventions described intervention in detail (includ- ing doses where relevant) x Partially Yes x described comparators described comparator in detail (includ- ing doses where relevant) No x described outcomes x described study's setting x described research designs timeframe for follow -up 9. Did the review authors use a satisfactory technique for assessing the risk of bias (RoB) in individ ual studies that were included in the review? RCTs For Partial Yes, must have assessed RoB from For Yes, must also have assessed RoB from: unconcealed allocation, and allocation sequence that was not truly random, and Yes 177 lack of blinding of patients and as- sessors when assessing outcomes (unnecessary for objective out- comes such as all -cause mortality) selection of the reported result from among multiple measurements or anal- yses of a specified outcome Partial Yes No x Includes only NRSI NRSI For Partial Yes, must have assessed RoB from For Yes, must also have assessed RoB from: x from confounding, and x methods used to ascertain exposures and outcomes, and x Yes Partial Yes No Includes only RCT x from selection bias x selection of the reported result from among multiple measurements or anal- yses of a specified outcome 10. Did the review authors report on the sources of funding for the studies included in the review? For Yes x Must have reported on the sources of funding for individual studies included in the re- view. Note: Reporting that the reviewers looked for this information but it was not re- ported by study authors also qualifies Yes x No 11. If meta -analysis was performed did the review authors use appropriate method s for statistical combination of results? RCTs For Yes The authors justified combining the data in a meta -analysis Yes AND they used an appropriate weighted technique to combine study results and ad- justed for heterogeneity if present. No AND inv estigated the causes of any heterogeneity na No meta -analysis conducted For NRSI For Yes x The authors justified combining the data in a meta -analysis x Yes x AND they used an appropriate weighted technique to combine study results, adjusting for het erogeneity if present No x AND they statistically combined effect estimates from NRSI that were adjusted for confounding, rather than combining raw data, or justified combining raw data when adjusted e ffect estimates were not available No meta -analysis conducted AND they reported separate summary estimates for RCTs and NRSI separately when both were included in the review 12. If meta -analysis was performed, did the review authors assess the potential impact of RoB in individual studies on the result s of the meta -analysis or other evidence synthesis? For Yes included only low risk of bias RCTs x Yes x OR, if the pooled estimate was based on RCTs and/or NRSI at variable RoB, the au- thors performed analyses to investigate possible impact of RoB on s ummary estimates of effect. No No meta -analysis conducted 13. Did the review authors account for RoB in individual studies when interpreting/ discussing the results of the review? For Yes x included only low risk of bias RCTs x Yes OR, if RCTs w ith moderate or high RoB, or NRSI were included the review provided a discussion of the likely impact of RoB on the results No 14. Did the review authors provide a satisfactory explanation for, and discussion of, any heterogeneity observed in the results of the review? For Yes There was no significant heterogeneity in the results x Yes 178 x OR if heterogeneity was present the authors performed an investigation of sources of any heterogeneity in the results and discussed the impact of this on the results of the re- view No 15. If they performed quantitative synthesis did the review authors carry out an adequate investigation of publica- tion bias (small study bias) and discuss its likely impact on the results of the review? For Yes x performed graphical or statistical tests for publication bias and discussed the likelihood and magnitude of impact of publication bias x Yes No No meta -analysis conducted 16. Did the review authors report any potential sources of conflict of interest, including any f unding they received for conducting the review? For Yes x The authors reported no competing interests OR x Yes The authors described their funding sources and how they managed potential conflicts of interest No Your overall assessment of the risk of bias of this systematic review High Published by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health October 20 21 P.O.B 4404 Nydalen NO-0403 Oslo Phone : + 47-21 07 70 00 The report can be downloaded as "}
