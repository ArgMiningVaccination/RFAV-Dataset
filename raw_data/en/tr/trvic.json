Join us for ConnectIONS Live on May 6th with Dr. Lissa Rankin - MD and author of Mind Over Medicine and Sacred Medicine: A Doctor's Quest to Unravel the Mysteries of Healing. Dr. Rankin will share the findings from her latest book sparked by a curiosity around miracle cures. What is really making us sick? Can we create miracles when conventional medicine has given up on us, and if so, how? Why do some people with healthy habits fall sick, while others with bad habits live a disease-free life until they are 100 years old? These were some of the questions she packed in her suitcase in 2007, when she left a promising career in medicine driven by the desire to heal herself. She went on a journey across the globe to visit medical professionals, medicine people, and healers from all schools and traditions. Fueled by the controversy that emerged during the pandemic around what wellness and disease actually are, what causes them, and how they are interconnected, she went back and rewrote parts of the book. Attend the ConnectIONS Live to find out about her conclusions! Dr. Rankin will be interviewed by Dean Radin, Chief Scientist at IONS. Sacred Medicine: A Doctor's Quest to Unravel the Mysteries of Healing Friday, May 6, 2022 11:00 AM - 12:15 PM (Pacific) Please register even if you can't attend live and you'll receive an email with a link to the recording.
