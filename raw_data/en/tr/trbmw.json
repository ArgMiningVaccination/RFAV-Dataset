Oregon Medicaid PA Criteria May 1, 2016 General PA information Overview For drugs that require PA on Point of Sale (POS) claims: A new evaluation feature of the Oregon Medicaid POS system, DUR Plus, reviews incoming POS claims and issues PA when the drug meets appropriate clinical criteria. For drugs that do not pass DUR Plus review, pharmacies must contact the prescribing provider, who then requests PA from the Oregon Pharmacy Call Center. Drugs req uiring PA - See OAR 410 -121-0040 for more information The Division may require PA for individual drugs and categories of drugs to ensure that the drugs prescribed are indicated for conditions funded by OHP and consistent with the Prioritized List of Health Services and its corresponding treatment guidelines (see OAR 410-141-0480 and 410-141-0520). DUR Plus review The Oregon Medicaid POS system initially evaluates incoming pharmacy claims for basic edits and audits. If the drug on the claim requires PA and requires DUR Plus evaluation, the claim passes through a series of clinical criteria rules to determine whether DUR Plus can issue PA and allow dispensing the drug to the client. DUR Plus checks the current drug claim as well as the client's medical and c laims history for the appropriate criteria. If suitable criteria are found, a prior authorization will be systematically created, applied to the claim, and the claim will be paid. This interactive process occurs with no processing delays and no administrative work for the pharmacy or prescribing provider. If all criteria are not met, the claim will be denied and PA will be required. The prescriber will be responsible for requesting PA, using procedures outlined in OAR 410-121 -0060. Oregon Medicaid PA Criteria May 1, 2016 How to request PA For pr escriptions covered by the client's coordinated care organization (CCO), contact the CCO for their PA procedures. For prescriptions covered by OHA on a fee-for- service (\"open card\") basis, use the following contact information: For prescriptions and oral nutritional supplements The Oregon Pharmacy Call Center is available 24 hours per day, seven days a week, 365 days a year and processes PA requests within 24 hours. When calling in a PA request, have the diagnosis code ready. Phone: 888-202-2126 Fax: 888-346 -0178 Refer to PA procedures outlined in OAR 410-121-0060. For emergent or urgent prescriptions that require PA The Oregon Pharmacy Call Center may authorize up to a 96 hour emergency supply for drugs that require PA, but have no PA on file. Refer to 410-121 -0060(4) Emergency Need. The Pharmacist may request an emergent or urgent dispensing from the Pharmacy Call Center when the client is eligible for covered fee-for-service drug prescriptions. a) Clients who do not have a PA pending may receive an emergency dispensing for a 96- hour supply. b) Clients who do have a PA pending may receive an emergency dispensing for up to a seven-day supply. For diabetic supplies (lancets, test strips, syringe and glucose monitor supplies) Diabetic supplies in excess of OHA 's utilization guidelines require PA from the Division: Health Systems Division - Provider Clinical Support Unit 500 Summer St NE, E44 Salem, OR 97301-1078 503-945-6821 (direct) 800-642-8635 (in-state only) Use the MSC 3971 form to submit PA requests.

Patients considered opioid-tolerant are those w ho are taking at least 60 mg/day morphine, 50 mcg/hour transdermal fentanyl, or an equianalges ic dose of another opioid for a week or longer. Because life-threatening respiratory depression c an occur at any dose in patients not taking chronic opioids, transmucosal and buccal fentany l is contraindicated in the management of acute or postoperative pain. This product must not be used in opioid-na\u00efve patients. Short acting (SA) fentanyl is intended to be used only in the care of cancer patients and only by oncologists and pain specialists who are knowledgeable and skilled in the use of Schedule II opioids to treat cancer pain. When prescribing, do not convert patients from other fentanyl produc ts on a mcg per mcg basis. Pharmacokinetic differences between products could cause fatal over-dose. Caution should be used when combining these agent s with CYP3A4 inhibitors. Increases in fentanyl concentrations can caus e fatal respiratory depression. Patients and their caregivers must be instructed that fentanyl products contain a medicine in an amount which can be fatal to a child. Patient s and their caregivers must be instructed to keep all units out of the reach of children and to discard opened units properly.

Both are proven effective in reducing LDL-C levels, but ther e is uncertainty about whether this equates to reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mo rtality. It is not feasible to do an outcomes study due to the low prevalence of the disease. However, the current safety data does not support the use of mipomersen and lomitapide in patients with lower CHD risk. 1, 2 Few patients with homozygous FH achieve adequate LDL-C lowering even with 4-drug therapy. Maximum lipid lowering therapy is defined as reac hing the highest tolerated statin dose or maximum FDA recommended high potency Combination therapy with ezetimibe 10 mg per day, colesevelam, and/or niacin. Niacin and bile acid sequestrants should both be used unless they do not produce significant LDL-C lowering (< 5%) and/or if significant si de-effects are occurring. 4, 5 OR If statins are contraindicated or not tolerated then, combination therapy with ezetimibe 10mg per day, colesevelam and/or niacin is recommended. 4, 5 Statin intolerance incl udes but is not limited to: evidence of new-onset muscle pain, significant gastr ointestinal disturbance or alterations of liver function tests.4, 5 1.

Yes: Approve for 12 months No: Deny for lack of treatment response. 192 Clinical Notes: The National Institutes of Health Cons ensus Development Conference on PKU recommend maintaining the following blood concentration1: Neonates through 12 years of age: 2 to 6 mg/dl (120 to 360 mol/L) After 12 years of age: 2 to 15 mg/dl (120 to 900 mol/L) or 2 to 10 mg/dl (120 to 600 mol/L)* During Pregnancy 2-6 mg/dl (120-360 mol/L) *However, although data are limited, higher blood Phe concentrations appear to adversely affect brain function, even in adults. Thus, maintenance of lower levels (2 to 10 mg/dl, or 120 to 600 mol/L) is strongly encouraged duri ng adolescence or even beyond. In addition to the recommended Phe concentrations, o ften, a 30% or more reduction in blood Phe is considered a clinically signifi cant change from baseline and should occur after the initial trial. 2 If not, the patient is a nonresponder and will not benefit from Kuvan therapy.
