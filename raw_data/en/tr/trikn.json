Are you ready to swap out your traditional nail polish for non-toxic nail polish? It's probably no surprise that most nail polish brands use plenty of harmful ingredients. It's so common, in fact, that even traditional polishes have started moving away from \"the big 3\" - the three most toxic ingredients in major polish brands. So, what are \"the big three\"? And does that mean that there is no such thing as non-toxic nail polish? And if that's the case, then what is the least toxic manicure? No worries! I've got the answer to these questions, and so much more. If you're ready for a natural manicure that lasts, I'll help you find the perfect polish to get the job done!

And no. After all, nail polish is paint. And all paints are toxic. They require solvents and structure-inducing polymers to make them work. And nail polish is no different. But some ingredients are more toxic than others. And many nail polish brands are starting to move away from these toxic ingredients. Especially the \"big three\". What three toxic ingredients am I talking about? - Formaldehyde - a well-known carcinogen. It is used to harden traditional nail polishes. - Toluene - a solvent that can disrupt the development of an embryo or fetus after prolonged exposure. - Dibutyl Phthalate (DBP) - can cause irritation, headaches, and dizziness. DBP is used to make the polish more flexible and less brittle. If you are reading labels (and you should be!) you might see the term \"three-free\". These three ingredients are what \"three-free\" refers to. Or, you might see \"five-free\", \"six free\", all the way up to \"16-free\". These labels point to the number of toxic ingredients the polish does not have in its formula. The higher the number, the less toxic the polish is. But just because a label says \"three-free\" does not mean it is non-toxic nail polish. It can still have any number of other toxic ingredients. Finding a clean nail polish really is more about what's in the ingredients, rather than what's not. That's why it's so important to read those labels! Why There Are Limited Non-Toxic Nail Polish Options on EWG If you use the EWG database to find non-toxic polish, you may have noticed that the options are limited. This is because all nail polish is paint, and paint is toxic. It is hard for EWG to rate a polish in the green, because all polishes have some level of toxicity in their formulas. In fact, a [new study](https://www.ewg.org/research/nailed) by researchers from Duke University and the Environmental Working Group (EWG) found that many polishes contain triphenyl phosphate, or TPHP. TPHP is an endocrine disruptor, interfering with normal hormone functioning. It has been found to mess with reproductive and developmental processes in animals as well. Twenty-six women volunteered to paint their nails for this study, and all 26 had elevated levels of TPHP afterwards. Most of the polishes I recommend (below) have a yellow or \"fair\" rating in EWG. You really want to look for products with a green rating, but they are dang near impossible to find. For more information on how the EWG works, or to do your own research, you can read my totally honest [review of the EWG Healthy Living App](https://essentialmovestowellness.com/ewg-healthy-living-app-review/). And without further ado, let's look at my recommendations for the least toxic manicure! The Best Non-Toxic Nail Polish at Target: Olive and June First up, Olive and June. Sometimes you just don't want to wait for your beauty products to be shipped to you. But you can find an awesome non-toxic nail polish brand right at your local Target! Olive and June has 102 shades available, but not all colors are at Target. If they don't carry the shade you want, you may have to order it. If you are counting, Olive and June is \"seven-free\" - it is free from the big three, but goes above and beyond by leaving out formaldehyde resin, camphor, ethyl tosylamide, and xylene as well. It also is lacking benzophenone-1 (BP-1) and benzophenone-3 (BP-3). What I like about Olive and June is its rich, glossy finish. The formula actually comes in a variety of finishes, including sheer, shimmer, and gel-like. It is easy to apply, stays put for a week or more, and the shine holds up for days! It may take a few coats to be opaque, however, but it dries quickly, reducing the possibility of imprints and dents. Olive and June does have a super wide brush, just so you know. Some people really like that, but some may find it to be a little clunkier. All in all, if you want salon quality in a bottle, then Olive and June is the non-toxic polish brand for you! Average Cost: $9 a bottle The Best Non-Toxic Nail Polish on Amazon: Sally Hansen GOOD. KIND. PURE. Next up: [Sally Hanson GOOD. KIND. PURE](https://amzn.to/3Mj0cHi). If you've always liked Sally Hanson but want to stay away from the traditional toxic chemicals used in their line, then you will love GOOD. KIND. PURE. And Sally has 30 gorgeous shades to choose from! Because I know you are counting, Sally Hanson GOOD. KIND. PURE. has gone way above and beyond with their non-toxic polish line - they boast \"16-free\"! Their formula is made without the traditional big three, of course. But they also do not have formaldehyde resin, xylene, acetone, camphor, parabens, other Their formula is entirely plant-based and is 77% natural, which is pretty good. But they've also added avocado extract, fruit extract, camellia sinensis leaf extract, and spinach leaf extracts to nourish your nails! For those with sensitive nail beds, this non-toxic polish is a great choice. I seem to always be dealing with hangnails, so these are one of my favorites! It goes on smooth, stays put for days, and dries quickly. It even smells a bit coco-nutty. If you want to feel doted on at home, Sally Hanson GOOD. KIND. PURE. is a great choice. Average Cost: $6-$10 The Best Non-Toxic Nail Polish for Kids: Piggy Paint [Piggy Paint](https://amzn.to/3yy8buv) is \"as natural so they claim. And they're close! Piggy Paint is the best non-toxic nail polish for kids! Piggy Paint comes in 43 shades and claims to be free of all harsh chemicals. Indeed, you will find some shades of Piggy Paint on the EWG that are in the green! They are a water-based formula that is hypoallergenic with no smelly chemicals, which is great for your kiddos. The polish dries hard and doesn't wear off, but it can take a bit longer to dry, since it is water-based. A blow-dryer will speed that process up, though, if you have an impatient little one. If you are looking for a non-toxic nail polish for your kids, I'd highly recommend Piggy Paint. Just keep in mind that the staying power isn't as long as traditional nail polish. Average Cost: $7.99 The Best Non-Toxic Nail Polish for Pregnancy: Ela + Mila I totally understand that you want to paint your nails during pregnancy! Who doesn't want to look their best during such a momentous life-changing event! But use nail polish at your own discretion while pregnant. Even non-toxic brands. Because, remember, nail polish is paint. I personally didn't use it. But you do what's best for you! [Ela + Mila](https://amzn.to/3TeOmR3) markets itself as \"pregnancy safe\", but I found aluminum on the ingredient list of a few colors, so it's best to be informed. They offer a \"seven-free\" formula, omitting the big three, of course. But they also leave out formaldehyde resin, camphor, TPHP, and exylene. Ela + Mila offer a whopping 193 shades!! And release trendy new colors often. You can get a variety of lovely finishes with Ela + Mila, such as metallic, shimmer, and pearl. The polish goes on very smoothly and has gorgeous color and shine! It usually requires only two coats, and it works best if you apply thin layers. If you are looking for a nail polish during pregnancy, Ela + Mila may be your safest option. Average Cost: $10.50 The Best Water-Based Non-Toxic Nail Polish: Honeybee Gardens [Honeybee Gardens](https://amzn.to/3CNpDgY) is one of the first natural makeup brands I used when I started my clean beauty journey because their prices are amazing. The owner is also a total sweetheart! You can read about their amazing and sustainable makeup options in my [Honeybee Gardens review](https://essentialmovestowellness.com/honeybee-gardens-review/). Honeybee Gardens is \"12-free\", not containing the big three, of course. They've also excluded camphor, formaldehyde resin, xylene, parabens, nitrocellulose resin, triphenyl phosphate, BP-1, fragrance, and animal ingredients. They offer 26 beautiful shades that are easy to apply and quick drying. Their colors come in a variety of finishes, such as slight shimmer, slight iridescent, and matte. Honeybee Gardens has great staying power for a water-based formula. They don't chip easily at all, but some people do find the polish hard to remove. It might help to soak your nails in water and then peel the polish off if you have this issue. If you want the best water-based non-toxic nail polish from an amazing company, I can't recommend Honeybee Gardens enough! Average Cost: $12.99 Other Brands Worth Mentioning: Okay, so we've gone over the best non-toxic nail polish at Target and the best polish on Amazon. We've covered the best water-based polish, the best for pregnancy, and the best non-toxic nail polish for your kids. But I'd be doing a disservice if I didn't mention a couple of other brands that are great as well! Kure Bazaar [Kure Bazaar](https://essentialmovestowellness.com/kurebazaarpolishhippie) is \"ten-free\". Besides the big three, their formula is also free from camphor, TPHP, paraben, xylene, styrene, BP-1 and BP-3. It's 85% natural and comes in 40 different shades. But what's really cool about Kure Bazaar is its moisturizing ingredients. It contains sunflower seed oil, bamboo leaf, wood pulp, and tocopherol, which is an antioxidant. This polish is slick, shiny, and elegant! It goes on smooth, dries quickly, and stays shiny. However, it might be best not to polish your nails before hitting the hay; you can get bed creases on your nails if you do. If pure elegance is what you're after, then Kure Bazaar might be the polish for you! Average Cost: $18 Cote And finally, last, but not least: [Cote](https://coteshop.co/). Cote nail polish is \"six-free\", losing the big three, of course. They also are free from camphor, formaldehyde resin, and TPHP. Cote has 129 shades to choose from! You can also grab their strengthening two-in-one base coat and topcoat. These rich and vibrant colors go on smoothly and evenly, with a shiny finish. But like Kure Bazaar, Cote added moisturizing ingredients to their formula, like safflower seed oil and garlic bulb. If you are looking for a luxurious non-toxic nail polish, Cote might work for you! Average Cost: $18 Final Thoughts on Natural Nail Polish Although non-toxic nail polish does exist, it's not necessarily as clean as we'd all like it to be. Nail polish is paint, after all. So, it's bound to have some chemicals in it. But, if you like polishing your nails, you can definitely take steps to use the cleanest polish possible! The most important thing is to read the label before purchasing. You want to look for what is in the polish, not what's not. Or just choose a gorgeous non-toxic nail polish brand from my favorites!
