DRAKE, in his official capacity as President of the UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, Defendants.MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION Date: September 27, 2021 Time: 1:30 pmPlace: Courtroom 10C We, the undersigned, d eclare as follows: 1. We are adults of sound mind and make this declaration volunta rily, based upon our own personal knowledge, e ducation, and experience. 2. The University of California (\" UC\") is a public university intended to serve the residents of California and is open to students from around the world. It currently has more than 280,0000 students and more than 227,000 faculty and s taff.1We are a group of UC faculty writing regarding vaccination for individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 (the \" naturally immune \"). True and correct copies of our CVs are attached to this declaration as Exhibit A . Extensive scientific data demonstrates that naturally immune individuals have robust immunity as a result of having b een exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and may suffer worse adverse effects after vaccination than individuals not previously exposed to the virus. 3. The evidence shows the infection caused by the SARS-CoV-2 vir us in humans produces durable immunity, and that natural immunity ind uced by the virus is at 1https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/uc-system .Case 8:21-cv-01367-JVS-KES Document 15-4 Filed 08/23/21 Page 2 of 187 Page ID #:352_______________________________________________________________ ___________________ DECLARATION OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA FACULTY IN SUPPORT OF PL AINTIFF'S MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION31 23456789 10111213141516171819202122232425262728least comparable to vaccine-induc ed immunity. We base these op inions on careful reviews of published and preprint medical literature .The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (\" CDC \") estimates that approximately 115 million persons in the U.S. (35% of the population) were infected with SARS-CoV-2 by April 2021. 2The CDC also estimates that approximately forty nine percent of those aged e ighteen to forty-nine years have been infected with SARS-CoV-2.3The California Department of Public Health estimates that as of June 2021, 85.9% of adults age 18 and olde r in California have antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.4 4. Our declaration addresses three areas: A. The strength of natural immunity appearing subsequent to a SA RS-CoV- 2 infection. B. Whether the Covid-19 vaccine can prevent infection and transm ission of SARS-CoV-2. C. Concerns about the growing number of reported serious harms a fter receiving the 3 of 187 Page ID #:353_______________________________________________________________ ___________________ DECLARATION OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA FACULTY IN SUPPORT OF PL AINTIFF'S MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION41 23456789 10111213141516171819202122232425262728A. Natural Immunity 5. The human body knows how to develop immunity to new viruses. T h e adaptive immune system consists of an enormously diverse repert oire of B cells (precursors of antibody-secreting plasma cells) and T cells wit h a nearly unlimited capacity to recognize and 'adapt ' to previously unseen pathogen s. 6. University of California policy currently indicates that indi viduals recently diagnosed with COVID-19 \"may be eligible for a temporary Medica l Exemption (and, therefore, a temporary Exception), for up to 90 days after your diagnosis and certain treatments.\" However, as a matter of factual evidence, more is known about the durability of natural immunity t han the durability of immunity from the Covid-19 vaccines, due to the novelty of the vaccines. Data (please see the cited research studies below) indicate that natural immunity is more durable than immu nity from the Covid-19 vaccines. The 90-day temporary Me dical Exemption is therefore not supported by scientific data and underestim ates the durability of natural im munity. 7. The robust natural immunity that develops after SARS-CoV-2 in fection derives from multiple sources, in cluding antibodies to the nucl eocapsid and to the spike protein, T-helper cells, B-cells, natural killer cells, and inn ate immunity. Immunologic studies using human subjects who have had SARS-CoV-2 demonstrat e that they Case 8:21-cv-01367-JVS-KES Document 15-4 Filed 08/23/21 Page 4 of 187 Page ID #:354_______________________________________________________________ ___________________ DECLARATION OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA FACULTY IN SUPPORT OF PL AINTIFF'S MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION51 23456789 10111213141516171819202122232425262728developed sustained immunity 5which protect from reinfection6and robust T-cell memory7t o t h e v i r u s . T h i s m e a n s t h a t t h e a d a p t i v e i m m u n e s y s t e m , a f t e r being successfully engaged in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2, will be capable of recognizing SARS-CoV-2 in the future. 8. As such, it is a more extensive host defense system than the limited array of antibodies to the spike protein ge nerated by COVID -19 vaccines. The natural immunity produced by the closely related SARS-CoV-1 has been documented to last for years.8 This is evident from numerous studies, including: a. A study from researchers at th e La Jolla Institute for Immuno logy found that that the immune systems of those who recovered from COVID- 19 had durable memories of the viru s up to eight months of 187 Page ID #:355_______________________________________________________________ ___________________ DECLARATION OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA FACULTY IN SUPPORT OF PL AINTIFF'S MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION61 23456789 10111213141516171819202122232425262728b. A study from researchers at Washington University School of M edicine which found that \"SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a robust antigen - specific, long-lived humoral immune response in humans.\"10 c. A study from researchers at Emory University and Fred Hutchin son Cancer Research Center which found that recovered COVID-19 pati ents mount broad, durable immunity aft er infection, and that \"[t]he durable antibody responses in the COVID-19 recovery period are further substantiated by the ongoing rise in both the spike and RBD mem ory B cell responses after over 3-5 months before entering a plateau p hase over 6-8 months. Persistence of RBD memory B cells has been noted.\"11 d. A different group of researchers at Aarhus University Hospita l in Denmark studied the immune response following SARS-CoV-2 infections in 203 recovered patie nts. The patients' disease se verity ranged from mild to serious cases that required hospitalization . T h e authors found that the vast maj ority of recovered individuals h ad detectable, functional SARS-CoV 2 spike-specific adaptive immune responses, despite diverse disea se severities, making vaccinati on post- of 187 Page ID #:356_______________________________________________________________ ___________________ DECLARATION OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA FACULTY IN SUPPORT OF PL AINTIFF'S MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION71 23456789 10111213141516171819202122232425262728e. The most recent study of T-cell immunity six months after infe ction demonstrated that every single person tested showed \"robust T c ell responses to SARS-CoV-2 virus pep tides [six months after primar y infection] in all participants\" ptomatic or mild/moderate COV ID-19 infection.\"13 9. The Pfizer had initia lly, at best, efficacy of 95%,14the Moderna vaccine had efficacy of 94.5%,15and the J&J vaccine efficacy was approximately 67%,16 and that was under the ideal conditions in a clinical trial, ag ainst the original wild-type variant of the virus. The COVID-19 vaccines have had considera bly less efficacy in the real world which has been the case based on the data to date.17Hence, there have been many thousands of reported \"breakthrough\" cases of COVID-19 sub sequent to vaccination. Most such cases a re alleged to arise from variant strains of the virus that the original vaccine was not designe d to neutralize. The number of breakthrough cases among the vaccinated was growi ng so rapidly and burdening 7 of 187 Page ID #:357_______________________________________________________________ ___________________ DECLARATION OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA FACULTY IN SUPPORT OF PL AINTIFF'S MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION81 23456789 10111213141516171819202122232425262728that the CDC changed its reporti ng criteria to only report brea kthrough cases to breakthrough cases resulting in hospitalization or death. 18In contrast, the more varied and evolving resources of the na tive immune system of COVID-19 survivors have proven effective at neutralizing such variants.19 10. After a natural SARS-CoV-2 infe ction, even in cases where an tibody responses have not met the threshold for being \"reactive\" in th e approximately 100 commercial assays, the evidence is clear that cellular based im munity is present. This evidence reflects that clinical infection alone, without either antibody or cellular based testing afterwards, is sufficient to identify an individual who is either no longer susceptible or minimally suscep tible to COVID-19, similar to th e vaccines.20 11. Importantly, in such individuals who have had natural SARS-C oV-2 infections, the evidence reflect s that they are less likely to again acquire, carry, and transmit the virus to another individual when compared to those vaccinated for this virus.21This is evident from numerous studies, including: a.A new Israeli study of over 6 mi llion participants found that n atural immunity from SARS-CoV-2 infecti on was better than vaccination immunity in reducing risk of COVID-19 reinfection, hospitalization, and 8 of 187 Page ID #:358_______________________________________________________________ ___________________ DECLARATION OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA FACULTY IN SUPPORT OF PL AINTIFF'S MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION91 23456789 10111213141516171819202122232425262728severe illness. Vaccination was highly effective, with overall estimated efficacy for documented infect ion of 92.8%, hospitalization 94. 2% and severe illness 94.4%. Similarly, the overall estimated level o f protection from prior SARS-CoV-2 infection for documented infection was 94 .8%, hospitalization 94.1%, and severe illness 96.4%.22As the study explains, \"both the BNT162b2 vaccine and prior SARS-CoV-2 infection are effective against both subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection and othe r COVID-19-related outcomes.\" 23 b.Another study from Israel found that the vaccinated had 6.72 ti mes the rate of infection as compared to those that had had COVID-19: With a total of 835,792 Israelis known to have recovered from the virus, the 72 instances of reinfection amount to 0.0086% of people who were already infected with COVID. By contrast, Israelis who were vaccinated were 6.72 times more likely to get infected after the shot than after of 187 Page ID #:359_______________________________________________________________ ___________________ DECLARATION OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA FACULTY IN SUPPORT OF PL AINTIFF'S MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION101 23456789 10111213141516171819202122232425262728c. The Cleveland Clinic recently released an investigation evalua ting the value of COVID-19 vaccination in persons previously infected wi th the SARS-CoV-2 virus. All employees of the Cleveland Clinic's Ohio facility on December 16, 2020, the day their COVID-19 vaccinati on program began, were included (n= 52,238). Any individual testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 at least 42 days earlier was considered previously infected . The investigators measured cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection over the next five months. They found tha t none of the 1,359 previously infected who remained unvaccinated contracted SARS-CoV-2 over the co urse of the research despite a high background rate of COVID-19 in the hospital . The authors concluded that \"individuals who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection are unlikely to benefit from COVID-19 vaccination.\"25 d. A similarly conducted study led by a researcher at University o f California Los Angeles found that there was no difference in the infection incidence between vaccinated i ndividuals and individuals 10 of 187 Page ID #:360_______________________________________________________________ ___________________ DECLARATION OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA FACULTY IN SUPPORT OF PL AINTIFF'S MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION111 23456789 10111213141516171819202122232425262728e. An outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 caused by the Gamma variant infecte d 24/44 (55%) employees of a gold mine in French Guiana. The att ack rate was 15/25 (60.0%) in fully vacci nated miners, 6/15 (40.0%) in t hose partially vaccinated or with a h istory of COVID-19 (none of the partially vaccinated with a history of COVD-19 were positive), and 3/4 (7 5%) in those not vaccinated. The atta ck rate was 0/6 among persons wi th a previous history of COVID-19 vers us 63.2% among those with no previous history.27 f. Israel is currently having a new outbreak of COVID-19 cases a nd the \"Health Ministry data ... showed that fully vaccinated individuals were responsible for most new cases and most of those hospitalized i n moderate condition or worse.\"28 12. Given the current number of es timated COVID-19 worldwide cas es of approximately 204 million,29if reinfection occurred in only 1% of individuals, the world would have observed 2.04 milli on second and third cases, with m any coming to clinical attention and/or requiring hospitalization. In fact, no such l arge volume of recurrent cases has been observed in any world region. In the 19 months since the COVID-19 virus first 11 of 187 Page ID #:361_______________________________________________________________ ___________________ DECLARATION OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA FACULTY IN SUPPORT OF PL AINTIFF'S MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION121 23456789 10111213141516171819202122232425262728appeared in the United States, doctors and scientists have not identified any naturally immune individual that was re-i nfected with and transmitted thi s virus to anyone. 13. Irish researchers recently published a review of eleven cohort studies with over 600,000 total recovered COVI D patients, not all of whom we re well defined and may have had suspected COVID-19 with positive serologies later on who were followed up with over ten months. They found the reinfection rate to be 0.27% \"with no study reporting an increase in the r isk of reinfection over time.\" 30 Based on this data, the researchers were able to assert that \"naturally acquired SARS-C oV-2 immunity does not wane for at least 10 months post-infection.\"31 The study also did not identify any case of reinfection of SARS-CoV-2 that r esulted in further transmission of the virus. 14. Based on this data, prior inf ection with SARS-CoV-2 appears to provide greater than 99% efficacy from reinfection, which is far greate r protection than the efficacy from vaccine immunity which, in an optimal clinical tr ial setting, provided no greater than between 67% and 95% efficacy, depending on the COV ID-19 vaccine. The Pfizer vaccine was reported to have, at best, efficacy of 95%,32the Moderna vaccine 94.5%,33and the J&J vaccine 67%,34under the 12 of 187 Page ID #:362_______________________________________________________________ ___________________ DECLARATION OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA FACULTY IN SUPPORT OF PL AINTIFF'S MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION131 23456789 10111213141516171819202122232425262728trial, against the original wild-type variant of the virus. Bu t even assuming the optimal clinical trial efficacy numbers, this is still far less than th e efficacy from having had the COVID-19 virus, which, based on all the available data, is over 99% effective in preventing reinfection. Id. \u00b6 14. 15. This finding is not surprising given that vaccines, by desig n, attempt to emulate the immunity created by a natural infection. Nonethele ss, they never achieve the same level of protection afforded by natural infection from a v irus. They universally confer inferior immunity to having had the actual virus and eve n the best vaccines do not confer immunity to all recipients. In those who do obtain some immunity from vaccination, the immunity creat ed typically wanes over time. 16. A recent article aptly explained why infection-induced immun ity to SARS- CoV-2 is much deeper and broa der than vaccine immunity: A natural infection indu ces hundreds upon hundreds of antibodies against all proteins of the virus, including the envelope, the membrane, the nucleocapsid, and the spike...Dozens upon dozens of these antibodies neutralize the virus when encountered again. Additionally, because of the immune system exposure to these numerous proteins (epitomes), our T cells mount a robust memory, as well. Our T cells are the 'marines' of the im mune system and the first line Case 8:21-cv-01367-JVS-KES Document 15-4 Filed 08/23/21 Page 13 of 187 Page ID #:363_______________________________________________________________ ___________________ DECLARATION OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA FACULTY IN SUPPORT OF PL AINTIFF'S MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION141 23456789 10111213141516171819202122232425262728of defense against pathogens. T cell memory to those infected with SARSCOV1 is at 17 years and running still.... In vaccine-induced immunity...we mount an antibody response to only the spike and its constituent proteins ... [and] this produces much fewer neutra lizing antibodies, and as the virus preferentially mutates at the spike, these proteins are shaped differently and antibodie s can no longer 'lock and key' bind to these new shapes. B. Covid-19 Vaccinated Individuals Can Still Become Infected and Transmit the Virus 17. Natural immunity confers an a dditional benefit over vaccine immunity. Natural immunity will prevent a virus from being able to replic ate and shed in the naturally immune individual. In contrast, COVID-19 vaccines ap pear to reduce symptoms in some but still permit the vaccinees to become infec ted with and transmit the virus.35 18. In animal studies, the COVID-19 vaccine candidates could notfully block viral infection and replicati on in the nose of monkeys upon vir al challenge.36In contrast, 35https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covi d-19/health-departments/breakt hrough-cases.html (\"There is some evidence that va ccination may make illness less severe for those who are vaccinated and still get sick.\"). 36https://www.nejm.org/doi/ full/10.1056/NEJMoa2024671 ;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.Case 8:21-cv-01367-JVS-KES Document 15-4 of 187 Page ID #:364_______________________________________________________________ ___________________ DECLARATION OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA FACULTY IN SUPPORT OF PL AINTIFF'S MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION151 23456789 10111213141516171819202122232425262728the ys completely prevented r re-infection at any site tested - by nasal, throat, and anal swabs. 37 19. Viral carriage by the vaccinat ed is reflected in the recent outbreak in Barnstable County, Massachusetts, which has a 69% vaccination c overage rate amount its eligible residents.38A recent CDC investigation found that 74% of those infected in the outbreak were fully vaccinated for COVID-19 and, even more alarming, the vaccinated had on average more v irus in their nose than the unv accinated that were infected. The study reported zero cases of infection among th ose that previously had COVID-19. 20. This forced the Director of th e CDC, Rochelle Walensky, to a dmit that individuals vaccinated for COVID-19, while having less symptoms , can still become infected with and transmit the virus.39Dr. Walensky admitted that \" what [the COVID- 19 vaccines] can't do anymore is prevent transmission .\"40After this admission, Wolf Blitzer asked Dr. Walensky if \"you get covid, you're fully vacc 15 of 187 Page ID #:365_______________________________________________________________ ___________________ DECLARATION OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA FACULTY IN SUPPORT OF PL AINTIFF'S MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION161 23456789 10111213141516171819202122232425262728asymptomatic, you can still pass on the virus to someone else, is that right?\" and Dr. Walensky answers \" that is exactly right .\" 41 21. While COVID-19 vaccinees can be asymptomatic carriers and sp readers of SARS-CoV-2, based on all availabl e data to date, the naturally immune have a near zero risk of becoming reinfected with and transmitting SARS-CoV-2. C. Concerns About Harms Asso ciated with the Vaccine 22. The COVID-19 vaccine is not without risk, particularly for t hose previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. It violates medical ethics to expose someone to this risk when they have robust, durable im munity that actually neutraliz es SARS-CoV-2 upon exposure. 23. Studies have found that naturally immune individuals have si gnificantly higher rates of adverse reactions when receiving the COVID-19 v accine. For example, Raw et al. reported that among 974 individuals vaccinated for C OVID-19, the vaccinated COVID-19 recovered patients had higher rates of vaccine reactio ns.42Mathioudakis et al. found the same result in a study of 2,002 individuals vacci nated for COVID-19.43 Krammer et al. found the same result in a study of 231 voluntee rs 16 of 187 Page ID #:366_______________________________________________________________ ___________________ DECLARATION OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA FACULTY IN SUPPORT OF PL AINTIFF'S MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION171 23456789 1011121314151617181920212223242526272819, concluding that, \"Vaccine recipients with preexisting immun ity experience systemic side effects with a significant ly higher frequency than antibod y na\u00efve vaccines.\" 44 24. The primary system for tracking adverse events after vaccina tion in the United States is the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System ( VAERS ) to which \"fewer than 1% of vaccine a dverse events are reported.\"45 25. Reports of serious adverse events from COVID-19 vaccines are apparently similarly underreported to VAERS. Id. For example, according to the CDC, \"Anaphylaxis after COVID-19 vaccination is rare and occurred in approximately 2 to 5 people per million vaccinated in the United States based on events reported to VAERS.\"46However, a recent study at Mass General Brigham that assessed a naphylaxis in a clinical setting after COVID-19 vaccination found \"severe reactions consistent with anaphylaxis occurred at a rate of 2.47 per 10,000 vaccinations .\"47This is equivalent to 50 to 120 times more cases than what VAERS and the CDC are repo rting for a serious, potentially life-threatening, adverse event that occurs almost immediately after vaccination and which medical providers are advised they must w atch for 17 of 187 Page ID #:367_______________________________________________________________ ___________________ DECLARATION OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA FACULTY IN SUPPORT OF PL AINTIFF'S MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION181 23456789 1011121314151617181920212223242526272826. If anaphylaxis is being unde rreported, the level of underrep orting for serious adverse events that do not occur immediately after vaccination or are not easily identified is likely far greater. For example, on June 23, 2021, the CDC rep orted the alarming numbers of reported myocarditis a nd pericarditis cases occurrin g after COVID-19 vaccination. 48The long-term effects of myocarditis are not fully understood b ut can be very serious. Cases of thrombocytopenia have also occurred aft er COVID-19 vaccination, as well as serious and sometimes fatal blood clots .49These and numerous other serious adverse events are being recognized but the true rate of these serious adverse events is most certainly underreported.50 48https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/ that the coronavirus spike protein from COVID-19 vaccines enters the bloodstream and can be found t hroughout the body in almost all vital organs. https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ci ab465/6279075 .T h i s would help explain the high rate of reported blood clots, heart disease, brain damage and reproductive issues. Dr. Byram Bridle, a viral immunologist and associate professor at the University of Guelph, Ontario, recently stated: \"We made a big mistake. We didn't realize it until now...We thought the spike protein was a great t arget antigen, we never knew the spike protein itself was a toxin and was a pathogenic protein. So by vaccinating people we are inadvertently inoculating them with a toxin.\" https://omny.fm/shows/on- point-with-alex-pierson/new-peer -reviewed-study-on-covid-19-vac cines-sugge .R e c e n t data from Japan - data not required by the U.S. - reflects that l ipid nano particles from the vaccine encapsuling the spike protein mRNA are being deposi ted into vital organs after vaccination. Of concern are the data related to lipid na no particles depositing into the adrenal glands, bone marrow, liver, ovaries, brain, and spl een and increasing in quantity over time post-vaccination. https://www.icandecide.org/wp-content/up loads/2021/06/Translation-of-Japanese-data.pdf at 16-17.

Studies reflect that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein from COVID -19 vaccines enters the bloodstrea m and can be found throughout the body in almost all vital organs.51This accords with recent data from Japan - data not required by the U.S. - which reflects that lipid nano particles from the vaccine encap suling the spike protein are being deposited into vital organs after vaccination, including the adrenal glands, bone marrow, liver, ovaries, brain, a nd spleen and increasing in qua ntity over time post- vaccination.52This may explain the high rate of reported blood clots, heart di sease, and other serious issues from the COVID-19 vaccine. 28. In a paper published by Bruno, et al. the authors pose urgen t questions on COVID-19 vaccine safety, high lighting the high number of report ed serious adverse events to this vaccine and the short comings of the clinical tr ials including exclusion of those with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection.53 Vaccinating the naturally immune can lead to serious injury or death by causing antigen specific tissue infl ammation in any tissues harboring viral antigens. 29. The ethical issue with exposing the naturally immune is comp ounded by the fact that the data on the safe ty and pharmacokinetic profiles o f the spike 19 of 187 Page ID #:369_______________________________________________________________ ___________________ DECLARATION OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA FACULTY IN SUPPORT OF PL AINTIFF'S MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION201 23456789 10111213141516171819202122232425262728been made available to the scien tific community. In particular : a. All COVID-19 vaccines produce SA RS-CoV-2 spike protein in-sit u. Therefore, the safety profile of spike protein itself (i.e., in the absence of virus) must be thoroughly understood, and this is not currently the case. b. Evidence of systemic circulation of the spike protein or its components after vaccination has been reported. 54In fact, all studies we are aware of to date raise concerns about the safety of spike protein,55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67and that the concentration of circulatory spikes is correlate d with disease severity in CO VID-19 patients.68 c.

Addi tional concerns may be identified in the future. 69 70 71 30. A thorough investigation of seri ous adverse events captured by pharmacovigilance systems in the U.S. has not yet been reported and the systems in the U.S. have limitations. In Isra el, for example, myocarditis was estimated to occur in 1 in 3000 to 1 in 6000 men ages 16 to 24 who received the Pfizer/Bio NTech, or between 5 and 25 times the background rate.72However, this excess risk was not detected by the CDC for several months. 31. Because previously infected indi viduals are already immune to SARS-CoV- 2, the risks they face from COVID -19 vaccination, even if minim al, exceeds the benefit of receiving the vaccine. 32. Based on our communications w ith other University of Califor nia physicians and researchers, it is our understanding that many a gree that mandating vaccination for individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 is unlikely to yield a health benefit, but they are reluctant to express this publicly due to concerns about employment security, academic prom otion, or 21 of 187 Page ID #:371_______________________________________________________________ ___________________ DECLARATION OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA FACULTY IN SUPPORT OF PL AINTIFF'S MOTION FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION221 23456789 1011121314151617181920212223242526272833. Based on the foregoing, we concl ude that those who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 are at least as prot ected as those vaccinated for CO VID-19, are less likely to spread SARS-CoV-2 to others, and will be exposed to the pote ntial harm from this vaccine without a counterbalanci ng benefit because they are alr eady immune to the virus.
