Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many people are seeking information and tips for enhancing their immune systems. Nobody likes being sick, whatever the cause, so it's natural to look for ways to avoid infection and illness. We want our bodies to be as strong as possible! It's important to understand that our immune system is not a single organ in our bodies. Instead, it is a complex system that works on many different levels to fight infection. This means that our immune systems cannot technically be boosted, even though many people on TV, the internet, and social media say otherwise. However, we can improve our immune health to feel better and be healthier. Also, we can take precautions to avoid infections and illnesses. This manual has 5 modules. You can use each one separately to educate about enhancing immune health. Or, you can use all of the modules together to teach a 5-week class on improving immunity. We've designed this material specifically to educate people with lived experience of mental illness, but it can be used by anyone who wishes to understand and enhance their immune health. The modules are: Module 1: What is Immune Health? Module 2: Vaccination & Health Screening for Immunity Module 3: Adequate Sleep for Immune Health Module 4: Managing Stress for Stronger Immunity Module 5: Functional Foods, Immunity Aids, & Credible Health Information Each module uses an \" Explain, Evaluate, and Engage \" framework. We explain the key information to know in each area. Using exploration and activities, we then evaluate what participants already know about immune health. This is followed by further information. Each module also includes engaging activities to work on improving immunity and health. INTRODUCTION UIC CMHSRP & CSPNJ, 2021 Page 3Module 1Enhancing Your Immune Health UIC Center on Mental Health Services Research and Policy Collaborative Support Programs of New JerseyPage 4Guide participants to understand that our immune system is not one simple structure or action in our bodies. Instead, it is a complex network functioning on many different levels to fight infection. Our immune system recognizes harmful bacteria, viruses, and parasites when they enter our bodies. Once recognized, our system takes immediate action to destroy them. Humans have two types of immunity. One is called innate or natural immunity . The other is called adaptive or learned immunity . This is complicated, but we'll break it down to make it easier to understand. What have you learned from others about how your body fights off infection? What kinds of problems does our immune system help to fix? Why do you think people get sick? Invite participants to share what they know about how their body fights infection. You don't need to fully address their misunderstandings right now. Just take note of what they know and do not know. Stick to what they know versus what they do, which is addressed later . Emphasize that it's ok if they don't know much yet, since many people don't understand how immunity works. Also, there are plenty of myths and misconceptions out there. Sample questions to choose from include the following. UIC CMHSRP & CSPNJ, 2021 Page 5Module 1: What is Immune Health?Our skin keeps the majority of germs from entering our bodies Mucus in our nose and throat traps germs, which are then removed by sneezing or coughing Stomach acids kill germs Certain substances in our sweat and tears , called enzymes, help fight bacteria Immune cells attack unwanted or harmful cells that enter our bodies Guide participants to understand that natural immunity is the first thing the body does when fighting bacteria, viruses, or parasites that try to enter our bodies. Our bodies have protective barriers to keep out harmful germs. Another part of our body's natural immune response is called inflammation. You may hear the words infection and inflammation used together, but they are different. Infection refers to germs entering and growing in our bodies when our protective barriers did not keep them out. Inflammation is what our bodies do to fight infection. The four signs of inflammation include a feeling of warmth, redness, swelling, and pain. It feels bad when we feel pain and swelling around a wound. But these things let us know that our body is working to heal. When inflammation occurs, our bodies also send out white blood cells to fight infection. All this means that temporary inflammation is helpful when we are sick. Page 6 P 1Guide participants to understand that learned immunity is when our bodies learn over time to recognize bacteria, viruses, or other germs that cause illness. Learned immunity is controlled by cells and organs in our bodies, like the spleen, thymus, bone marrow, and lymph nodes. What do you think about the information so far? Did you know that temporary inflammation is actually good because it helps reduce infection? Invite participants to reflect on natural immunity by asking the following. When something harmful, like a virus, enters our bodies, these cells and organs create both immune cells and antibodies to destroy it. Antibodies are a kind of protein that builds immunity. As we talked about earlier, this response is part of our natural immunity. But, then our bodies do something amazing. Our immune system learns to remember the harmful virus, so the next time we catch it, our body is ready to destroy it. As covered in another module, this is also how vaccines work, by introducing a sort of blueprint for our bodies to learn to wipe out specific viruses. Are you surprised by how many protective barriers we have to fight illness? UIC CMHSRP & CSPNJ, 2021 Page 7Share that despite what people hear from TV, the internet, or social media, there are no quick fixes to boost our immune health. Other than vaccination, there is no one medicine or supplement we can take to have a stronger immune system. Like many things in life, we need to commit ourselves to choosing healthier habits. Did you know that your body learns over time how to fight certain illnesses? What's your thinking about vaccines helping your body learn how to destroy specific viruses?Invite participants to reflect on learned immunity by asking one or more of these questions. wearing a mask when in public, or when around people who are ill or unvaccinated washing hands throughout the day: when coming in from outdoors, before and after preparing and eating food, after using the toilet, after coughing or blowing your nosesneezing or coughing into a tissue or your inner elbow to prevent the spread of germs Other simple behaviors to protect immune health include: keeping current on vaccinations getting regular medical & lab tests to make sure our bodies have what they need getting good sleep managing our stress & getting exercise eating certain foods or taking certain supplements, if you need them going outdoors for sunshine We'll talk more about these habits in other modules, but some that are proven to make our immune health better are:What do you think about this information on learned immunity? UIC CMHSRP & CSPNJ, 2021 Page 8Help participants complete the Module 1 Review worksheet to reinforce important information. Use the Module 1 Immunity Quiz to review concepts with participants. If you wish, you can ask participants to take it before and after this module. This will help you to assess what they have learned and what concepts require additional review. Ask participants to complete the Immune Health Behaviors log over the coming week to track how many times they engage in protective activities. Review with them what information they'll record and how often.

They do this by greatly reducing the risk of infection. Vaccines work with the body's natural defenses to develop immunity to disease. People of different ages and circumstances need different vaccines to stay healthy. Some examples are a measles vaccine for children and a pneumonia vaccine for older people. UIC CMHSRP & CSPNJ, 2021 Page 18Module 2: Vaccination & Health Screening for Immunity Part 1: Understanding Vaccination & Immunity If you live with chronic conditions like diabetes or heart disease, even if they are well-controlled, you are vulnerable to infection. Your immune system needs the protection that vaccines provide. Certain jobs, like those in health care or that require traveling, put you at risk for diseases that vaccinations can help prevent or reduce. All vaccines help develop immunity by imitating an infection. This almost never causes actual illness, but it does trigger an immune response in your body. That's why after getting some vaccines, you might feel tired or get a fever, chills, or headache. Your arm also might hurt where the shot was given. These symptoms are normal and last only a day or two. They are signs that your body is building immunity. The good news is that, once these side effects go away, your immune system will remember how to fight that disease in the future. This can save you from serious illness, going to the hospital, developing a disability, or even from dying. What have you learned about how vaccines work in the body? Did you get vaccines when you were a child? Why or why not? How do you think this helped you? Invite participants to share what they know or have heard about vaccination in general. Emphasize that you're interested in what they know about how vaccines help fight disease and death. Today, you will not be discussing politics or what commentators have to say, especially about COVID-19 vaccines. Rather, you'll explore facts to help them decide whether to take various vaccines for their immune health. Don't worry about correcting misinformation or misunderstandings right now. Just take note of what they know and do not know about vaccines. Here are some questions to choose from. UIC CMHSRP & CSPNJ, 2021 Page 19 After vaccination, it often takes a few weeks for the body to produce infection-fighting cells. This means it's possible to become ill with the disease shortly after vaccination because the vaccine hasn't had enough time to start working. So, you should keep doing things that prevent illness, like wearing a mask or avoiding others who are coughing or sneezing, for 2-3 weeks after vaccination. Some vaccines are given in more than one dose such as the shingles and COVID vaccines. In these cases, it's important to remember that the first dose does not provide full immunity. For other vaccines, immunity wears off over time. At that point, a \"booster\" dose is needed. Boosters to supplement the original vaccine are also needed for viruses that change or mutate. Further, in the case of flu vaccines, doses are needed every year because flu viruses change each season. Some people believe that it's better to build immunity by allowing oneself to get the disease instead of getting vaccinated for it. The problem with this approach is that many diseases for which vaccines are available can cause severe complications and even death. This is true even for common diseases like chickenpox or flu. It is impossible to predict who will get serious infections that may lead to hospitalization or worse. You may have heard the term \"herd immunity\" in the news. Herd immunity occurs when a large portion of a community becomes immune to a disease, which stops it from spreading. As a result, the whole community becomes protected. The percentage of immunized people needed in order to achieve herd immunity varies by disease. The more contagious a disease, the greater the number of people who must be immune to stop its spread. There are two main paths to herd immunity: getting vaccines or getting infected. There are major problems with relying on getting infected to create herd immunity. First, it's not clear how long someone is protected from getting sick again after recovering from certain diseases like flu or COVID-19. Even if you develop some immunity, it's still possible that you could get it again. Additionally, the high number of infections needed to achieve herd immunity could lead to tens of thousands of deaths before herd immunity develops, especially among older people, children, and those with existing health conditions. Also, even if you don't die from the disease, you could develop chronic health problems from it, which can quickly overwhelm the health care system. Finally, the longer the virus lingers in a community, the more likely it will mutate and become even harder to wipe out. P 1 UIC CMHSRP & CSPNJ, 2021 Page 20Two vaccines in particular can be controversial or confusing for some people: flu vaccine and COVID-19 vaccine. Again, without engaging in a political discussion, share with participants that you want to cover some facts about these 2 vaccines. You aren't trying to pressure them or make them feel stressed. Instead, you want to share information that they can use to decide what works for them. First is the flu vaccine. Flu, also called influenza, is a potentially serious disease that can lead to hospitalization and sometimes death. Every flu season is different, and the flu affects people in different ways. Millions of people get it every year, hundreds of thousands of them are hospitalized, and thousands to tens of thousands die from flu-related causes every year. The best way to avoid these risks is to get an annual flu shot. Let's look at some myths and facts about the flu. Review the Flu Facts & Myths handout (also at the end of this Module). What have you heard about why people avoid getting vaccinated? Explore what it's been like for participants to receive vaccines in the past. Some possible questions to choose from include the following. When's the last time you received a vaccine? What was that like for you? UIC CMHSRP & CSPNJ, 2021 Page 21In summary, like any medication, vaccines can cause some side effects. The most common are mild to moderate and only last a day or two. Even with access to good health care, the diseases that vaccines prevent can be very serious, and vaccination is the best way to avoid them. Also, keeping up with vaccines is the best way to stop spreading illnesses to other people, so we're not only protecting ourselves but others too. One of the best ways to avoid getting or spreading COVID is to get the vaccine. There is a lot of confusing and misleading information about the vaccine, especially on the Internet and social media. Let's review some simple facts about the vaccine and its effectiveness. Review the COVID-19 Vaccine Facts & Myths handout (also at the end of this Module). UIC CMHSRP & CSPNJ, 2021 Page 22The second vaccine that can be confusing is the one for COVID-19. Just like the flu, COVID is a potentially serious disease that can lead to hospitalization, disability, and death. Hundreds of thousands of people have died from COVID since it first appeared in the U.S. in early 2020. Thousands of people, including children, experience disabling symptoms for months after having COVID. Guide participants to understand that one of the best ways to support overall immune health is to have an annual physical exam done by a medical provider. An annual physical helps providers know whether and how you're dealing with any medical conditions that make you more vulnerable to viruses like colds and flu. Lab tests will establish whether you need vitamins or minerals to help with your immune health. Foods and supplements that support immunity are reviewed in another module. How do you feel about your current health habits, such as healthy eating or exercise? Invite participants to share their experiences with preventive care. Some questions to choose from include the following. Many of us avoid going to the doctor, especially when we're feeling well. People often dread hearing bad news from a doctor, so they put off going for as long as possible. But, the sooner we can identify problems, the better chance we have to develop an action plan. There are many risk factors that people can control, once they understand their overall health, such as quitting smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, cutting down on alcohol or drugs, and being physically active. Have you had an annual check-up recently? UIC CMHSRP & CSPNJ, 2021 Page 23Part 2: Health Screening to Promote Immune Health Are you comfortable with your current medical provider? Why or why not? Help participants complete the Module 2 Review worksheet to reinforce important information. Review the handouts at the end of this Module on recommended vaccinations and preventive health screenings . This will alert participants as to whether they are due for any shots or screenings. Remember you're providing information that can help participants work with their medical providers to make the best decisions for themselves. Also help participants to complete the handout recording questions for their medical providers . Writing questions down helps people remember what to ask, so they get the most out of their health care visits.

Research suggests that getting good sleep has a big impact on the strength of our immune systems. For example, we know that people who are exposed to a virus, like the common cold, are more likely to get sick from it when they haven't had enough sleep. A lack of sleep can also affect how quickly you recover when you do become ill. Sleep helps both the natural and learned immunity discussed in Module 1. Sleep strengthens your \"immune memory.\" It does this by reinforcing your system's ability to remember and destroy harmful bacteria and viruses. Our bodies need energy to do this work. When we sleep, our breathing and muscle activity slow down. This frees up the energy that our immune system needs to do critical tasks. UIC CMHSRP & CSPNJ, 2021 Page 35Module 3: Adequate Sleep for Immune Health Our body's natural immunity is made up of protective barriers, like skin and mucus, to keep out harmful germs. Inflammation is also part of our natural immunity, since it helps our bodies to fight infection. Learned immunity is when our bodies learn over time to recognize, and then fight, the germs that cause illnesses. For example, during sleep, your immune system releases certain proteins called cytokines , some of which promote good sleep. Also, when you have an infection, your body needs to produce more cytokines to help you recover. Unfortunately, a lack of sleep can decrease production of these germ-fighting cytokines. Also, your infection-fighting antibodies and cells are reduced when you do not get enough sleep. Believe it or not, one night of poor sleep can significantly reduce your immune response. In short, your body needs regular sleep to fight infectious diseases. You also need sleep to stay healthy in general. Sleep problems increase your risk of obesity, diabetes, and heart and blood vessel diseases. What happens when you don't get enough sleep? How do you feel when you get a good night's sleep? Invite participants to reflect on the importance of sleep. Here are some sample questions to choose from. UIC CMHSRP & CSPNJ, 2021 Page 36 Different medical conditions can affect the quality of your sleep. For example, some people who snore have a condition called sleep apnea, where they stop breathing for short periods many times a night. Sleep apnea harms the body by disrupting the supply of oxygen to important organs. People with this condition may need to use a special mouth guard, or a machine called a C-PAP. This stands for Continuous Positive Airway Pressure. Air flowing through the machine keeps them breathing and helps improve their sleep. Many people have trouble falling asleep. Sometimes, people use drugs and alcohol to help them sleep. While this may help them fall asleep, they don't stay asleep as long and don't sleep as well. The sleep you get after taking drugs and alcohol is poorer quality sleep. This means it is less restful and less helpful for your immune health. Many people don't get enough good quality sleep. So, if this is true for you, you're not alone. Sleep problems are particularly common for people with mental health and substance use conditions, especially people living with anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, and/or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Have you learned anything new about your own sleep patterns?P 1 If you can't control the noise around you, consider earplugs to block the noise. Some people find that a steady sound, like a fan, can help block noises that interrupt sleep. Too much light can make it more challenging to fall and stay asleep. Consider room- darkening shades or a sleep mask. If you have a TV, smart phone, or tablet, turn it off 30-60 minutes before going to sleep. The light from these screens can make it hard to fall asleep when you use them right before bedtime.Try to resolve your worries or concerns before bedtime. One way to do this is to keep a small pad and pen handy to jot down what is on your mind so you can set it aside for tomorrow. The good news is that there are things you can do to improve your sleep to build immune health. The place where you sleep makes a difference in how you sleep. Many people sleep better in a room that is cool, dark, and quiet. There are other ways to create a restful sleeping environment. Most of the time, you can change your sleep environment to strengthen your immune health. UIC CMHSRP & CSPNJ, 2021 Invite participants to reflect on barriers to sleep by asking them questions like those below. What makes it hard for you to fall asleep and stay asleep? What has helped you sleep better? Which of these tips might be worth trying? Page 37Nicotine, caffeine, and alcohol can disrupt your sleep schedule. The stimulating effects of nicotine and caffeine take hours to wear off and can greatly interfere with quality sleep. Caffeine is found in many things, like coffee, caffeinated tea, soft drinks like cola, energy drinks, and even chocolate. When possible, try to replace caffeinated drinks with water or another healthy beverage. Don't go to bed hungry or stuffed. In particular, avoid eating large meals or heavy foods within a couple of hours of bedtime. Doing so may disrupt your digestion and affect your sleep. Cut back on rich and heavy meals, especially in the evening. Our sleep can be affected by what we eat, how much we eat, and when we eat. Establishing a bedtime or sleep routine can help you to get a good night's sleep. Daily habits most likely to affect the quality and quantity of your sleep include when you eat, your daily activities, and your bedtime routines. UIC CMHSRP & CSPNJ, 2021 Page 38Daytime naps can interfere with nighttime sleep. If you choose to nap, limit yourself to 30 minutes or less, and avoid napping late in the day. Regular physical activity can promote better sleep. It's a good idea to spread your physical activity throughout the day in order to improve sleep and reduce stress. But avoid being active too close to bedtime, which can make it hard to fall asleep. Spending time outside every day can be good for your sleep. Fresh air triggers a number of bodily changes that can improve your sleep. Set aside no more than eight hours for sleep. The recommended amount of sleep for a healthy adult is at least seven hours. Plan to go to bed and get up at the same time every day, even on weekends or other days when you could sleep in. Create a restful nighttime routine. Try calming activities before bedtime, such as taking a bath, deep breathing, or using a relaxation technique. Feeling calm and relaxed might promote better sleep. If you don't fall asleep within about 20 minutes, leave your bedroom and do something relaxing. Read or listen to soothing music. Go back to bed when you're tired. Repeat as needed. Our daily activities also affect how easily we fall asleep and stay asleep. Having a regular sleep schedule and bedtime routines is helpful. Taking steps to improve your sleep patterns is good for your immune health. UIC CMHSRP & Page 40It's important to identify any underlying causes of your sleep problems. Treating these can help you get the better sleep you need. Talk with your medical provider about what may be interfering with good sleep, and any recommendations to improve your sleep. Sharing information from a sleep diary (explained below) can help them make suggestions for better sleep. Everyone has a sleepless night once in a while, for different reasons. However, if you often have trouble sleeping, contact your medical provider. You may benefit from learning about how well you are sleeping and how your habits affect your sleep. A sleep diary can help you with this. You use the diary to track when you go to bed, when you wake up, and how much sleep you get. You also can use it to monitor if you wake up during the night and can't get back to sleep immediately. You also can record your daily habits, such as whether you napped or exercised, as well as how much caffeine and alcohol you had. It is helpful to complete the log before bedtime, and then again in the morning to record the quantity and quality of your sleep. Review the NIH Sleep Diary Handout with participants and encourage them to complete it during the coming week. Help participants complete the Module 3 Review worksheet to reinforce important terms and concepts. Invite participants to complete the Sleep Goal Handout to start working towards better sleep, if they wish. MODULE 3 HANDOUTS & WORKSHEETS UIC CMHSRP & CSPNJ, 2021 Page CSPNJ, 2021 Page 42Why better!

Stress related to living with long-term health and mental health challenges. Sudden negative changes cause stress, such as losing a job, divorce, illness, or bad things happening in the world. Traumatic stress experienced during an event such as a major accident, war, assault, tragedy, or natural disaster. Physical discomfort, like shoulder tension, headaches, or jaw pain Mood changes, like feeling overwhelmed, anxious, sad, impatient, or angry Trouble with concentration Changes in appetite, energy, and sleep habitsExamples of stress or daily hassles include: People react differently to stressful situations. Some common signs of feeling stressed include: Everyone experiences stress. There are different types of stress that can be bad for physical and mental health. A stressful situation may happen just once, or happen over a short time, or it can happen a lot over a long time. People deal with stress differently. Some have better ways of coping and recover from stressful events more quickly than others. The good news is that there are many things you can do to manage stress. UIC CMHSRP & CSPNJ, 2021 Page 53Module 4: Managing Stress for Stronger ImmunityHow do you know when you are stressed? What is an example of a situation that is a hassle or stressful for you?Invite participants to reflect on their experiences of stress or daily hassles. Choose from the following questions. UIC CMHSRP & CSPNJ, 2021 Page 54 You may be surprised to learn that not all stress is bad for your immune health. Short-term stress improves your body's protective responses. When your body is healing from a cut or wound, you get a vaccine, or you are fighting an infection or tumor, your body's stress response triggers your immune system. In other words, short-term stress helps your body do what it's supposed to do. Early human beings evolved to experience stress in response to immediate short-term dangers, like a falling rock or a charging tiger. In this situation, stress is helpful. The body responds to a danger like this is by mobilizing energy to help us act quickly to survive. To do this, the body must limit energy used for \"background functions\" like immune health. After all, when you're in immediate danger, fighting off infection is less important than avoiding the tiger or the falling rock. Today, we don't need to worry about tigers, but we still experience dangers like crossing busy streets or traffic accidents. In these situations, our natural stress response gives us the energy we need to get to safety. How have you dealt with stress in the past?P 1 Short-term, or acute, stress comes and goes. Your body reacts. Your body recovers from the stress. When you feel stressed for a long time, though, that's called chronic stress. Chronic stress has different effects on our bodies. With chronic stress, the body never receives a clear signal to return to normal functioning and doesn't have a chance to recover. UIC CMHSRP & CSPNJ, 2021 Over time, chronic stress can affect your immune system, and can even cause a harmful immune response. Part of your natural stress response is to produce a hormone called cortisol . Long-lasting stress leads to the production of high levels of cortisol, which makes it harder for your body to manage inflammation. As discussed in Module 1, inflammation is your immune system's way of fighting harmful germs and promoting healing from injuries. However, chronic inflammation is bad for you. With lasting inflammation, you are more vulnerable to infection and to repeat infection. Stress also decreases your white blood cells. These are cells that your body uses to fight infection. The lower your level of white cells, the less able your body is to fight infection. If you are older, isolated, or lonely, or already have medical conditions, stress is even more likely to harm your immune health. Page 55There are plenty of things you can do to manage stress for better immune health. We'll talk about several stress relief tips, so you can choose what works best for you. What are some examples of chronic stress from your life?Invite participants to reflect on the connection between stress and immune health by choosing from the following questions. What are some short-term stresses or hassles you've faced in your & CSPNJ, 2021 Page 56Does what you've learned about stress and the immune system fit with your experience?Many people have found that when they meditate, or engage in mindfulness activities, for even a few minutes several times a week, their stress goes down. Meditation reduces cortisol levels and reduces inflammation. Deep breathing exercises reduce stress and help your body work against infection. Consider doing deep breathing daily, 5 to 10 minutes at a time. Some people use free smartphone applications (apps) to reduce stress. Calm and Headspace are two free phone apps that people use for meditation and calming exercises. They can be used at any point in the day for meditation or to help with deep breathing. Activities like yoga lower stress hormone levels and calm the nervous system to reduce inflammation. Regular physical activity, like walking or gardening, can be very helpful to reduce stress. Hobbies and enjoyable activities have been shown to reduce stress, like playing or listening to music, gaming, crafting, and reading. Connecting with other people, online or in-person, is another way to reduce stress and deal with daily hassles. UIC CMHSRP & CSPNJ, 2021 Page 57What do you hear around you? What do you feel? Notice what it's like to sit. Pay attention to how your clothes feel against your skin. Feel what it is like to be in your body. You don't need to change anything, just become aware. Notice the sensations of your breath coming in and going out. You don't need to change your breath at all. Just be aware of breathing. Make your breath the focus of attention. Your mind will wander. That's fine. When you notice you are thinking or worrying, just shift your focus back to your breathing. Some people like to say something to themselves as they breathe in or breathe out like \"calm\" or \"peace.\" Notice your whole body. Have any sensations changed? Don't worry about what you're thinking or if you're doing this correctly. Thank yourself for making time to pause. As you move back into your daily activities, take some of your fresh awareness and your appreciation with you.Help participants practice a relaxation exercise together. This activity takes 1 to 3 minutes. There are three steps to the activity. 1. Check in. Sit quietly. Stay upright and awake through the practice. Relax. If you want, you can try closing your eyes. Become aware of the feelings in your body. 2. Focus on the breath. Now, become aware of your breathing. 3. Proceed (with awareness). Before you end your short pause, refocus on how your body feels.

The lining of your digestive tract is covered in very tiny organisms that can only be seen with a microscope. Most of these are bacteria. Unlike the bacteria that make us ill, these bacteria help digest food and prevent infection and inflammation. In fact, most of our immune cells are housed in our intestines. Gut health also affects our mental health, weight, blood sugar, and liver. The mix of bacteria in your body is called your microbiota. Each person's microbiota is different from everyone else's. It is determined partly by your birth mother's microbiota and partly from your lifestyle. What you eat, age, stress, medications, and diseases can all increase or decrease the amount and diversity of good and bad bacteria in your gut. Some of the foods we eat can improve our immune health. To understand how foods do this, you first need to understand how your digestive system works, and the role of a healthy gut in your immunity. UIC CMHSRP & CSPNJ, 2021 Page 67Module 5: Functional Foods, Immunity Aids, & Credible Health Information Functional foods Not surprisingly, what you feed your microbiota may have the biggest impact on its health. And the healthier your gut is, the healthier you are. There are two ways to maintain your gut health. 1. First, you can help the good bacteria or microbes already in your body to grow, by giving them the foods they like, called prebiotics. 2. Second is by adding living microbes, called probiotics , directly into your system.What have you heard about this concept of healthy bacteria in the gut? Were you surprised by the ways we can change the mix of good and bad bacteria in our guts? Invite participants to reflect on the role of gut health in immunity. Here are sample questions to choose from. UIC CMHSRP & CSPNJ, 2021 Page 68Prebiotics are high-fiber plant foods that take longer to digest, giving them time to feed the healthy bacteria and other microbes living in your gut. Another way to think about it is that prebiotics are \"fertilizers\" that support the growth of healthy bacteria in your gut. We need these good bacteria to fight infection and inflammation. Without enough good bacteria in our guts, we are more likely to get sick or stay sick longer. Prebiotics are found in many fruits and vegetables, including whole grains, apples, bananas, onions, garlic, and artichokes. You can get more examples of prebiotics on the Internet or by talking to a registered dietitian. Have you or anyone you know ever taken supplements to improve gut health? Even if you're already taking prebiotics or probiotics, it is helpful to understand how they work in the body. P 1 UIC CMHSRP & CSPNJ, 2021 Probiotics contain live organisms, usually specific strains of bacteria, that directly add to the population of healthy microbes in your gut needed to fight infection and inflammation. You can take probiotics through both food and supplements. Probably the most common probiotic food is yogurt. Yogurt is made by fermenting milk with different bacteria, and keeping those bacteria in the final product. Other bacteria-fermented foods, such as sauerkraut, kombucha (a fermented drink), and kimchi (fermented, pickled vegetables), are also good sources of probiotics. To ensure the fermented foods you choose do contain probiotics, look for the words \"naturally fermented\" on the label. Also, when you open the jar, look for bubbles in the liquid, which signal that it has live organisms. Probiotic supplements also contain live organisms. A single dose may include a particular strain of microbe or blend of microbes. There are a lot of prebiotic and probiotic supplements. You should talk with your medical provider about what is best for you, to avoid buying one that won't help or is more expensive than needed. It is thought that the most beneficial way to support your immune health using food is by eating a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, yogurt, safe bacteria-fermented foods, and legumes (beans). Page 69Many people on TV, the Internet, and social media make claims about various vitamins, supplements, and other remedies that supposedly \"boost\" your immune health. While some are beneficial, many of these claims are not based on high quality research, and you should be cautious about believing them. Also, many over-the-counter supplements are not regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), so their makers do not have the same obligation to support their health claims with good science. Have you tried prebiotics or probiotics? Invite participants to reflect on prebiotics and probiotics for immunity, using the questions below. What do you know about the benefits of prebiotics or probiotics? UIC CMHSRP & CSPNJ, about prebiotics or probiotics surprise you? Because the science behind taking supplements for immune health is so new, you'll want to avoid spending a lot of money on things that aren't helpful, and may even be harmful. Also, some supplements may interact badly with other medications you take. It's best to talk with your medical provider about any supplements you want to take to strengthen your immune health. Immunity aids There are several vitamins and other supplements that research shows can improve your immune health. You should always talk with your medical provider before taking anything new . Your provider may suggest that you get lab work to determine if you lack certain vitamins. Vitamin D helps regulate your immune system. Not having enough Vitamin D has been linked to respiratory infections, immune disorders, allergic diseases, and various cancers. Studies show that a very large number of U.S. adults do not have enough Vitamin D, especially people younger than age 5 or older than 65, pregnant and breastfeeding women, people with darker skin, and those with limited exposure to sunshine. Vitamin D can also be too low among those who are very overweight, current smokers, physically inactive, and rarely drink milk. Research suggests that all adults should be screened for Vitamin D deficiency. If you lack it, your medical provider will probably suggest getting outside for more sunshine and taking Vitamin D pills. Vitamin C can help protect against various deficiencies in your immune system. Some research suggests that higher levels of Vitamin C may indicate a person's overall good health. Vitamin C is in foods like citrus fruit (oranges, lemons), bell peppers, strawberries, broccoli, and brussels sprouts. If you decide to take a Vitamin C pill, it may irritate your stomach, so it's best to take a non-acidic, buffered form. Vitamin B9 or Folic Acid supports immune health because it aids in the reproduction of cells. Because of its critical importance, folic acid is added to many foods, like cereals and breads, in a process called \"fortification.\" Folic acid deficiency is quite rare, but can occur in people who drink too much alcohol, have disorders that prevent the processing of folic acid, or during pregnancy. If you are worried about your folic acid levels due to alcohol consumption or other reasons, they can be easily checked by a medical provider. UIC CMHSRP & CSPNJ, 2021 Page 71Immunity aids (continued) Zinc is an essential mineral to support immune health that the body needs only in extremely small amounts. Some research suggests that zinc itself might be directly harmful to viruses. Many people take zinc in lozenges when they have a head cold. Zinc is most helpful if you have a deficiency, caused by not eating a well-balanced diet or having a chronic disease that limits your body's ability to absorb key vitamins or nutrients. As a sleep aid, Melatonin may strengthen your immune health. Remember, good sleep is a great way to support your immunity. You probably produce enough Melatonin through your diet and lifestyle, but it can be taken as a supplement. Talk with your provider first because it can interact with other medications. It also can be harmful in large quantities. It can be sedating, so don't take it before driving or operating heavy machinery. Iron plays a critical role in immune function, particularly when you are sick. You can get enough iron from eating a balanced diet. However, iron deficiency, called anemia, is commonly seen in women who are menstruating due to blood loss. It can also occur in vegans or vegetarians, people with poor diets, or those with chronic diseases. Some food sources of iron are red meat, pork, poultry, seafood, beans, dark green leafy vegetables (like spinach), dried fruit (like raisins and apricots), iron-fortified cereal, and peas. Taking too much iron can be harmful, so it should be taken only after discussion with a medical provider. UIC CMHSRP & CSPNJ, 2021 Page 72Are you surprised by how few supplements have been proven to help with immune health? If you have any of the risk factors I mentioned, like age or chronic medical conditions, would you like to talk with your medical provider about getting lab tests to uncover vitamin deficiencies? Invite participants to reflect on immunity aids using the following questions. UIC CMHSRP & CSPNJ, 2021 Page 73Do you take any vitamins or supplements? eat a well-balanced diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables manage your stress or daily hassles try to get regular, good quality sleep get outdoors in the sunshine get plenty of physical activity; talk to your provider if you have any medical conditions that might limit your physical activity if you smoke, consider talking with your providers or supporters about making a quit plan In general, the best action you can take to boost your immunity is a healthy lifestyle involving a number of things: Finding Trustworthy Online Health Information Many of us worry about trusting health information from the Internet or social media. There are thousands of medical and health web sites, not to mention blog and social media posts. Some provide reliable health information. Many do not. Some of the medical news is current. Some of it is not. Choosing which sources to trust is important when searching for reliable information about immune health. Let's look at the Module 5 Handout, Finding Trustworthy Health Information. It is adapted from the National Institute on Aging and contains helpful questions to ask yourself. 1. Who sponsors the information? If someone is making money from the sources or sites you visit, that's a good reason to question the validity of the health information. If the health information is on non- medical sites, blogs, or posts, that's another reason to question its reliability and look elsewhere. 2. Who wrote the information? Ask yourself if the information you're reading is clearly from a doctor, nurse, or other medical expert. If not, then dependable sources will tell you where their health information comes from, such as whether it's from medical experts, virologists, politicians, advocates, commentators, and so forth. Dependable sources also share the unbiased scientific evidence that backs up their claims. Unbiased means that the researchers were not personally invested in the results of the studies one way or the other. You can typically trust scientific evidence from medical experts that is gathered from studies conducted by unbiased researchers. Be careful! Personal stories, or testimonials, may be comforting or revealing, but they aren't always reliable. Also, not everyone experiences health problems the same way. Finding personal stories isn't really \"doing your research,\" even if you find a lot of similar ones. Also, no information should replace seeing a medical provider about your specific situation. UIC CMHSRP & CSPNJ, 2021 Page 74Finding Trustworthy Online Health Information (continued) 3. When was the information written? Look for current sources of health information. Older information isn't always a problem and can be the foundation for new research. But, using information based on the most current scientific evidence is often best. 4. What is the purpose of the source? Is the purpose of the source to inform you or is it to sell you something? Either way, choose information based on unbiased scientific evidence rather than someone's opinion or intention to sell something. 5. Does the source offer quick and easy solutions to your health problems? Be careful of sources or companies that claim any one remedy will cure you. Question cures that seem too good to be true. Make sure you can find other unbiased scientific sources with the same information. A key exception to this is vaccinations, which are proven to prevent disease, disability, and death.

Look for current sources of health information, based on rigorous research. Older information isn't always a problem. However, using the most current, science -based information is often best.Is the information from a doctor, nurse, or other medical expert? If not, that's a strong reason to question its reliability. Dependable sources state the rigorous, scientific evidence for their health information or claims. Beware! Personal stories alone are not always a reliable source. W hen was it w ritten?W hat is the purpose?Is it too good to be true? Is someone going to make money from the source, site, or post? Is the information on a non-medical source, site, or post? If yes, these are good reasons to question the validity of the health information and look elsewhere. Is the purpose of the source to inform you or is it to sell you something? Either way, choose information based on unbiased scientific evidence rather than someone's opinion or intention to sell something. Be careful of claims that any one remedy will cure you. Make sure you can find other unbiased scientific sources with the same information. A key exception is vaccinations, which are proven to prevent disease, disability, & death.
