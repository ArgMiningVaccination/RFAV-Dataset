When it comes to global challenges such as climate change, multilateralism is the right prescription. The UNFCCC and its Paris Agreement provide the fundamental legal basis for international cooperation on climate. Visions will come true only when we act on them. Developed countries should not only do more themselves, but should also provide support to help developing countries do better. It is important to harness innovations in science and technology to transform and upgrade our energy and resources sectors as well as the industrial structure and consumption pattern, promote a greener economy and society, and explore a new pathway forward that coordinates development with conservation. China will continue to prioritize ecological conservation and pursue a green and low-carbon path to development. Foster a green, low-carbon and circular economic system at a faster pace, press ahead with industrial structure adjustment, and rein in the irrational development of energy-intensive and high-emissions projects. Speed up the transition to green and low-carbon energy, vigorously develop renewable energy, and plan and build large wind and photovoltaic power stations. Form a \"1+N\" policy framework* for delivering carbon peak and carbon neutrality, with a clearly-defined timetable, roadmap and blueprint. What the G20 and developed countries can do? The G20 needs to uphold the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, push for the full implementation of the Paris Agreement on climate change, and support a successful COP26 to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and COP15 to the Convention on Biological Diversity. The G20 members should take the lead in promoting and applying advanced technologies, and developed countries should also earnestly fulfill their commitments to providing funds for developing countries. Developed countries need to lead by example on emissions reduction, fully accommodate the special difficulties and concerns of developing countries, deliver on their commitments of climate financing, and provide technology, capacity-building and other support for developing countries. What has China done? China has all along undertaken due international responsibilities commensurate with its national conditions. We have actively advanced the green transition of our economy, and raised the ambition of our climate actions on our own initiative. In the past ten years, China phased out 120 million kilowatts of installed coal-fired power generation capacity. The construction of the first batch of wind and photovoltaic power stations with a total installed capacity of about 100 million kilowatts was launched in an orderly fashion. China's carbon intensity in 2020 was 18.8 percent lower than that in 2015, a better result than the binding target set in the 13th Five-year Plan (2016-2020). The figure was also 48.4 percent less than that in 2005, which means that China had more than fulfilled its commitment to the international community - to achieve a 40-45 percent reduction in carbon intensity from the 2005 level by 2020. The drop in carbon intensity translates to a total reduction of about 5.8 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions from 2005 to 2020, and demonstrates that China has largely reversed the rapid growth of its carbon dioxide emissions. in 2020, non-fossil energy contributed 15.9 percent to China's total energy consumption, a significant increase of 8.5 percentage points compared with 2005. Electricity generated by non-fossil energy reached 2.6 trillion kWh, representing more than one-third of the power consumption of the country. From 2016 to 2020, China issued 16 mandatory energy consumption quota standards, achieving an annual energy saving of 77 million tonnes of standard coal, equivalent to 148 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions; it issued 26 mandatory product and equipment energy efficiency standards, realizing an annual power saving of 49 billion kWh. The proportion of coal in its total energy consumption dropped from 72.4 percent in 2005 to 56.8 percent in 2020. The key is to take concrete actions Balance environmental protection and economic development, address climate change and safeguard people's livelihood. Major economies should strengthen cooperation in this regard. Fully and effectively implement the United Nations (UN) Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. Uphold the role of the UN as the main channel, follow the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, abide by international law, focus on effective actions, take stronger actions and enhance cooperation.
