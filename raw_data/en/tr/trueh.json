Cooperation from those with opinions for and against vaccination in data gathering and vetting will lead to greater safety. Screening should include an integrative medical perspective regarding diet, microbiome, leaky gut, and other antigen sources. It might include emerging electronic technology or integrative energetic techniques vetted ultimately by cross-reactive lymphocyte testing or genetic evaluation. The knowledge gained from evaluating those with reactions could enhance the screening process and, since similar antigenic stimuli and reactions are involved, help long COVID sufferers. Centers for early identification and rescue from vaccine reactions could lower morbidity and mortality, and increase the percentage of people choosing to be vaccinated. Additional platforms for boosting; using lower dosage; other routes of administration, such as intranasal or intradermal needles; and possibly different antigens could make it easier to vaccinate globally to address the new variants of viruses rapidly arising.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-07-11", "cleaned_text": "Potential Immunologic and Integrative Methods to Enhance Vaccine Safety [https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10071108](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10071108) [Safety Concerns, Sources of Liability, Compensation Strategies and the Right to Be Informed: Ethical and Legal Issues of COVID-19 Vaccination]( /journal/vaccines/special_issues/Safety_Source_Compensation_Right_Ethical_Legal_COVID-19_Vaccination )) Abstract: 1. Introduction 2. Controversy [1](#B1-vaccines-10-01108)], that has generated exaggerated and questionable claims on both sides of the issue. This has disrupted combined progress toward what I see as a safer and more optimal comprehensive method of disease control with vaccines. 3. Vaccine Efficacy [2](#B2-vaccines-10-01108)]. Other reviews have confirmed short-term efficacy and safety of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines but admitted that long term effectiveness and safety is not known [ [3](#B3-vaccines-10-01108)]. The centrist medical position is that sufficiently widespread vaccination would have reduced the number of deaths by over 300,000 at 100% vaccination [ [4](#B4-vaccines-10-01108)]. However, by the very nature of the process, there have been a small minority who have experienced illness either soon or late after\u2014including neurologic injury [ [5](#B5-vaccines-10-01108)] or myocarditis\u2014and have suspected the vaccination as the cause. Those concerned about vaccine injury have pointed out sequential relationships and other data, putting suspicions on vaccination. [6](#B6-vaccines-10-01108)]. Furthermore, the side effects and deaths that, although mostly unexamined and unproven from a medical perspective, appear to have sequentially followed vaccination, have alienated people, compounded by the population polarization that has made it harder to find long-term solutions to the pandemic problem. While acknowledging the efficacy and speed of development and deployment of the mRNA vaccines [ [7](#B7-vaccines-10-01108)], we need to greatly improve on prevention and treatment of vaccine reactions, and to develop a new, safer, and more acceptable platform for vaccination and prevention that is effective for the long run and for preventing infection by rapidly changing viral variants. This is crucial for protecting humans and for allowing a return to a more normal social and industrial society. [8](#B8-vaccines-10-01108)]. Nevertheless, the experience of individuals or families dealing with severe or lasting reactions after vaccination, and the very nature of the sensitization process, leaves them doubting the science. Other studies have shown that 80% of some disorders ascribed to vaccination follow a familial pattern, suggesting that a genetic link explains their occurrence [ [9](#B9-vaccines-10-01108)]. Yet we have not identified or screened for this component, despite the fact that most of those articles state that further exploration of interaction between genetic and environmental links is necessary. I write this while acknowledging the dilemma I struggle with in discussing potential side effects of vaccination which I believe to be personally and globally worth the risk. [10](#B10-vaccines-10-01108)] have been grossly underestimated. There is little room for rational discussion of such differences. On a more relevant note, glancing at what one dizziness reactor ate before and after his vaccination, reveals a high sugar allergenic diet that would have made me sick without any vaccine. It is time that the efforts from both sides move to further verification and determining of the parameters leading to severe sequelae or death from an immunologic and integrative perspective, so that we better know who, when, and how an individual can safely be vaccinated. It is time to make billion dollar increases in the efforts and resources available for early identifying and reversing both long COVID and vaccine reactions. Additionally, we need to begin to modify or add to the vaccines that afforded such early success to more effective additional ones with safer dosages, routes of administration, and flexible control of new variants. [11](#B11-vaccines-10-01108)], rather than explored as to whom and when and in what combinations they might prove valuable to enhance protection and reduce transmission, in conjunction with vaccination. [11](#B11-vaccines-10-01108)], and the livability of our planet. Lack of cooperation is no longer a viable option. It does not take more than a trip to the store, or the avoidance of one, to understand the ongoing economic devastation due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 4. Cross-Reactive Attack [12](#B12-vaccines-10-01108), [13](#B13-vaccines-10-01108), [14](#B14-vaccines-10-01108)]. Once T-cells have been immunized against a specific batch of molecular targets from a viral infection or vaccine, they are free to attack similar targets they find throughout the body. My research with Levis and other subsequent research suggests that these T-cells initiate attack and inflammation against a very specific target or \"epitope\" which bears characteristics of the HLA [ [15](#B15-vaccines-10-01108)], tissue specificity, and the viral signature involved. COVID vaccination has been followed by autoimmune reactions in various organs and specific tissues within those organs [ [16](#B16-vaccines-10-01108)], including myocarditis in the heart [ [17](#B17-vaccines-10-01108), [18](#B18-vaccines-10-01108)], hepatitis-like syndrome in the liver [ [19](#B19-vaccines-10-01108)], autoimmune bullous disease in the skin, thrombosis of platelets [ [20](#B20-vaccines-10-01108)], and neurologic disorders [ [21](#B21-vaccines-10-01108)]. [22](#B22-vaccines-10-01108)], such as the brain or heart. It is likely that this heterogeneity accounts in part for COVID, post-COVID, and even COVID vaccine reactions attacking different organs in different people [ [23](#B23-vaccines-10-01108), [24](#B24-vaccines-10-01108)]. Severity of COVID illness has been linked to intestinal dysbiosis [ [25](#B25-vaccines-10-01108)]. The presenting structure on these cells may be further modified by seeding the vascular and lymphatic system with circulating chemical, food-derived, or microbiome-derived molecules such as LPS from the 30 trillion colonic microorganisms. Microbial chemical epitope modulation would increase the diversity of the presenting epitopes on organ specific vascular endothelial cells [ [26](#B26-vaccines-10-01108), [27](#B27-vaccines-10-01108)] to greatly increase the chance of cross-reactive stimulation and destructive attack leading to COVID symptoms, vaccine reactions, or to long COVID [ [28](#B28-vaccines-10-01108)]. Increased likelihood of adverse vaccine reactions, as with other autoimmune reactions, could in part be due to these molecules translocated into the circulation or lymphatics through a \"leaky gut\" [ [29](#B29-vaccines-10-01108)]. [30](#B30-vaccines-10-01108)]. That modification has been observed due to citrullination [ [31](#B31-vaccines-10-01108)], from Porphyromonas gingivalis, and correlates with Rheumatoid antigen. Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) more often are derived from the gut microbiome than that of the oral cavity, and have been observed to increase inflammatory activity [ [32](#B32-vaccines-10-01108)]. It is my hypothesis that yet unidentified enzymatic, antigenic, or other post-translational effects caused by some of the estimated million different gut microorganisms could also be enhancing immune responses or modifying tissue-specific epitopes to increase diversity and immune attack by cross-reactive lymphocytes stimulated by COVID vaccine, or some molecular aspect of the COVID disease process. [33](#B33-vaccines-10-01108)]. Numerous studies have demonstrated a slight increase in myocardial reactions and myocarditis, post vaccination\u2014especially in young men [ [34](#B34-vaccines-10-01108), [35](#B35-vaccines-10-01108)]\u2014and antigen modification of cardiac endothelial presenter cells [ [36](#B36-vaccines-10-01108)] would invalidate that conclusion, and furthermore suggest that such modification is key to the damage done by SARS-CoV-2 and its antigens. The latter article argues that the protective benefit of the vaccine is greater than the slight risk of damage. [37](#B37-vaccines-10-01108)]. 5. Value of Greatly Improved Pre-Vaccine Evaluation [38](#B38-vaccines-10-01108)]. The model I propose for assessing inflammation-related additional antigen exposure\u2014which has been used in my practice for over 30 years to deal with patients with inflammatory and autoimmune disorders [ [39](#B39-vaccines-10-01108), [40](#B40-vaccines-10-01108)]\u2014would lead to a number of successive questions that could be first administered by a computer and then by a savvy nurse or technician. [41](#B41-vaccines-10-01108), [42](#B42-vaccines-10-01108)] and energetic techniques followed by lab tests such as antibody levels, cytokine profiles, genetic profiles [ [43](#B43-vaccines-10-01108)], and epigenetic assessment chips. Cross-reactive testing of lymphocytes stimulated by vaccine components and the resultant cells tested against individual allogenic or autologous cells from various organs would be one of the gold standards, along with genetic profiling and in silico comparison, for assessing whether the vaccine was likely to damage specific organs. It would be more accurate if carried out with circulating LPS, microbes, and other circulating epitope modifiers. Epitopes are immunologically recognized accessible molecular structures which, by their chemical nature, can be altered or modified by chemical moieties contacting them in the circulation. Modification of epitopes by bacterial products by processes including citrullination [ [44](#B44-vaccines-10-01108)] and other signals from the microenvironment [ [45](#B45-vaccines-10-01108)]. [46](#B46-vaccines-10-01108)]. There also needs to be a weighted algorithm for testing and choosing appropriate medical and integrative remedies for terminating such reactions to protect the individual. [47](#B47-vaccines-10-01108)]. Gut microbiome modulation may moderate this effect [ [48](#B48-vaccines-10-01108)]. A comprehensive review suggests that microbiome alterations could diminish the number and severity of myocardial disorders associated with COVID infection [ [49](#B49-vaccines-10-01108)]. 6. Immune Regulation Disturbances [50](#B50-vaccines-10-01108)], to prompt the cell to produce more virus containing vesicles. Viral particles are then released on destruction of the cell and spread to adjacent cells and through the body. Virus protective interferon production is inhibited by the virus [ [51](#B51-vaccines-10-01108)]. When the acute viral process has calmed down, the virus has infected or altered surface components of cells of various organs of the body, for potential recognition. Circulating lymphocytes have become hypervigilant, specifically sensitized and ready for aggressive attack against these and analogous recognized targets. This can lead to specific organ attack and cytokine storm. It is analogous to pressing down the brakes and gas pedal, revving the engine, and then taking your foot off the brakes. The car takes off risking skidding out of control. [52](#B52-vaccines-10-01108)]. Long COVID is only partially prevented by vaccination, but prevented better than with no vaccination at all. Additional measures are recommended to prevent long COVID [ [53](#B53-vaccines-10-01108)]. This takes a big bite out of the labor force, and the people in this country and all over the Earth who are necessary for supply chains, manufacturing, and farming to deliver products that people depend on. That cost is reflected in both inflation and inability to obtain needed products. Even with the absence of liability for vaccines, we all share in the cost of the consequences, and through governmental funding need to generously devote the billions necessary to avoid those costs. 7. Potential Low-Vaccine-Dose Efficacy [54](#B54-vaccines-10-01108)]. Clinically, quarter doses of the Moderna vaccine were found to give similar immune protection data including \"Vaccine-specific CD4+ T cell, CD8+ T cell, binding antibody, and neutralizing antibody to COVID infection, and enhancement of Coronovirus cross-reactive CD4+ T cells\" [ [55](#B55-vaccines-10-01108)]. Following these publications, the Moderna booster dosage was lowered to half the original dosage. [56](#B56-vaccines-10-01108), [57](#B57-vaccines-10-01108)]. Furthermore, other routes of sensitization using microneedles could be considered [ [58](#B58-vaccines-10-01108)], depositing the antigen intradermally to enhance TH1 immunity.
