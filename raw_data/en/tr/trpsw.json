Mr. Inouye, from the Committee on Indian Affairs, submitted the following R E P O R T [To accompany S. 87] The Committee on Indian Affairs, to which was referred the bill (S. 87) to amend the Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Act to revise and extend such Act, having considered the same, reports favorably thereon with amendments and recommends that the bill (as amended) do pass. Purpose The purpose of S. 87, a bill to provide for the reauthorization of the Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Act, is to improve the health status of Native Hawaiians through the continuation of a comprehensive health promotion and disease prevention effort that involves health education in Native Hawaiian communities, and the provision of primary care health services using traditional native Hawaiian healers and health care providers trained in Western medicine. In areas where there is an underutilization of existing health care delivery systems that have the capacity to provide culturally- relevant health care services, S. 87 provides authority for the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to enter into contracts with Native Hawaiian health care systems to provide health care referral services to Native Hawaiian patients. S. 87 is intended to assure the continuity of the health care programs that are provided to Native Hawaiians under the authority of Public Law 100-579. As enacted in 1988, the Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Act is premised upon the findings and recommendations of the Native Hawaiian Health Research Consortium report to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services of December, 1985. That report clearly indicates that the underutilization of existing health care services by Native Hawaiians can be traced to the absence of culturally-relevant services in which traditional Native Hawaiian concepts of healing are lacking, as well as to a general perception in the native Hawaiian community that health care services, which are fundamentally based on concepts of western medicine, will not effect the healing or cure of diseases and illnesses afflicting Native Hawaiian people. Historical Background The islands that now compose the State of Hawai`i were governed by a monarchy of Native Hawaiians until 1893. The Native Hawaiian government was recognized as an independent sovereign nation by foreign governments, and treaty relationships were established with the United States (Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation of 1849; Treaty of Commercial Reciprocity, January 30, 1875.) Expanded trade with the United States resulted in increased western influence in the islands, and in 1893, the government of Queen Liliuokalani was overthrown in an insurrection engineered by a group of western businessmen in an effort to secure the annexation of Hawai`i to the United States. The United States minister in Hawai`i ordered one company of marines and two companies of sailors to be landed, and the minister then recognized a new provisional government even before Queen Liliuokalani's lines of defense had surrendered. Although the provisional government sought immediate annexation by the United States, President Grover Cleveland refused to submit a treaty of annexation to the Senate, finding that the provisional government lacked the popular support of the Native Hawaiian population and that the government would not have been established but for thelawless and unauthorized military intervention of the United States. Upon the inauguration of William McKinley as the new President of the United States in 1897, however, the western businessmen that sought annexation were able to change the official U.S. position, and in 1898, Hawai`i became a territory of the United States. During the first two decades of the twentieth century, the already depressed economic conditions of Native Hawaiians deteriorated further. In response the United States Congress in 1920 legislated directly to benefit Native Hawaiians by enacting the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, and establishing a land base for Native Hawaiians to provide a permanent homeland and to encourage agricultural pursuits. The Act placed approximately 200,000 acres under the jurisdiction of the Hawaiian Homes Commission, a branch of the territorial government established for the purpose of ``rehabilitating'' persons of at least fifty percent Native Hawaiian ancestry through a return to pastoral life. The Act also authorized the Commission to undertake ``activities having to do with the economic and social welfare of the homesteaders.'' Hawai`i became a state in 1959. Under the Admissions Act, the title of the Hawaiian home lands (that the Hawaiian Homes Commission administered) was transferred from the Federal government to the State of Hawai`i. The Admissions Act requires the State to hold the lands ``as a public trust * * * for the betterment of the conditions of Native Hawaiians * * * and their use for any other object shall constitute a breach of trust for which suit may be brought by the United States.'' Background Language contained in the 1984 Supplemental Appropriations Act, Public Law 98-396, directed the Department of Health and Human Services to conduct a comprehensive study of the health care needs of Native Hawaiians. The study was conducted under the aegis of Region IX of the Department by a consortium of health care providers and professionals from the State of Hawai`i in a predominantly volunteer effort, organized by Alu Like, Inc., a Native Hawaiian organization. An island-wide conference was held in November of 1985 in Honolulu to provide an opportunity for members of the Native Hawaiian community to review the study's findings. Recommended changes were incorporated in the final report of the Native Hawaiian Health Research Consortium, and the study was formally submitted to the Department of Health and Human Services in December of 1985. The Department submitted the report to the Congress on July 21, 1986, and the report was referred to the Select Committee on Indian Affairs. Because the Consortium's report's findings as to the health status of Native Hawaiians was compared only to other populations within the State of Hawai`i, the Select Committee requested that the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA), an independent agency of the Congress, undertake an analysis of Native Hawaiian health statistics as they compared to national data in other United States populations. Using the same population projection model that was employed in OTA's April 1986 report on Indian Health Care to American Indian and Alaska Native populations, and based on additional information provided by the Department of Health and the Office of Hawaiian Affairs of the State of Hawai`i, the Office of Technology Assessment report contains the following findings: ``The Native Hawaiian population living in Hawai`i consists of two groups, Hawaiians and part-Hawaiians, who are distinctly different in both age distributions and mortality rates. Hawaiians comprise less than five percent of the total Native Hawaiian population and are much older than the young and growing part-Hawaiian populations. Overall, Native Hawaiians have a death rate that is thirty- four percent higher than the death rate for the United States all races, but this composite masks the great differences that exist between Hawaiians and part-Hawaiians. Hawaiians have a death rate that is 146 percent higher than the U.S. all races rate. Part-Hawaiians also have a higher death rate, but only 17 percent greater. A comparison of age-adjusted death rates for Hawaiians and part-Hawaiians reveals that Hawaiians die at a rate 110 percent higher than part-Hawaiians, and this pattern persists for all except one of the 13 leading causes of death that are common to both the groups. As in the case of the U.S. all races population, Hawaiian and part-Hawaiian males have higher death rates than their female counterparts. However, when Hawaiian and part-Hawaiian males and females are compared to their U.S. all races counterparts, females are found to have more excess deaths than males. Most of these excess deaths are accounted for by diseases of the heart and cancers, with lesser contributions from cerebrovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus. Diseases of the heart and cancers account for more than half of all deaths in the U.S. all races population, and this pattern is also found in both the Hawaiian and part-Hawaiian populations, whether grouped by both sexes or by male or female. However, Hawaiians and part-Hawaiians have significantly higher death rates than their U.S. all races counterparts, with the exception of part-Hawaiian males, for whom the death rate from all causes is approximately equal to that of U.S. all races males. One disease that is particularly pervasive is diabetes mellitus, for which even part-Hawaiian males have a death rate 128 percent higher than the rate for U.S. all races males. Overall, Native Hawaiians die from diabetes at a rate that is 222 percent higher than for the U.S. all races. When compared to their U.S. all races counterparts, deaths from diabetes mellitus range from 630 percent higher for Hawaiian females and 538 percent higher for Hawaiian males, to 127 percent higher for part-Hawaiian females and 128 percent higher for part- Hawaiian males.'' There is thus little doubt that the health status of Native Hawaiians is far below that of other U.S. population groups, and that in a number of areas, the evidence is compelling that Native Hawaiians constitute a population group for whom the mortality rate associated with certain diseases exceed that for other U.S. populations in alarming proportions. Native Hawaiians premise the high mortality rates and the incidence of disease that far exceed that of other populations in the United States upon the breakdown of the Hawaiian culture and belief systems, including traditional healing practices, that was brought about by western settlement, and the influx of western diseases to which the native people of the Hawaiian Islands lacked immune systems. Further, Native Hawaiians predicate the high incidence of mental illness and emotional disorders in the Native Hawaiian population as evidence of the cultural isolation and alienation of the native peoples, in a statewide population in which they now constitute only twenty percent. Settlement from both the east and the west have not only brought new diseases which decimated the Native Hawaiian population, but which devalued the customs and traditions of Native Hawaiians, and which eventually resulted in Native Hawaiians being prohibited from speaking their native tongue in school and in many instances not at all. In 1998, Papa Ola Lokahi updated the health care statistics from the original E Ola Mau report. Additionally Papa Ola Lokahi extrapolates the data that the Hawai`i State Department of Health annually gathers on Native Hawaiians from the Department's behavioral risk assessment and health surveillance survey. The findings from those assessments revealed that-- With respect to cancer, Native Hawaiians have the highest cancer mortality rates in the State of Hawai`i (231 out of every 100,000 residents), 45 percent higher than that for the total State population. Native Hawaiian males have the higher cancer mortality rates in the State of Hawai`i for cancers of the lung, liver, pancreas and for all cancers combined, and the highest years of productive life lost from cancer in the State of Hawai`i. Native Hawaiian females ranked highest in the State of Hawai`i for cancers of the lung, liver, pancreas, breast, cervix uterus, corpus uterus, stomach, rectum, and for all cancers combined. With respect to breast cancer, Native Hawaiians have the highest mortality rates in the State of Hawai`i, and nationally Native Hawaiians have the third highest mortality rates due to breast cancer. Native Hawaiians have the highest mortality rates from cancer of the cervix and lung cancer in the State of Hawai`i and Native Hawaiian males have the second highest mortality rates due to prostate cancer in the State. For the years 1989 through 1991, Native Hawaiians had the highest mortality ate due to diabetes mellitus in the State of Hawai`i, with full-blood Hawaiians having a mortality rate that is 518 percent higher than the rate for the statewide population of all other races, and Native Hawaiians who are less than full-blood having a mortality rate that is 79 percent higher than the rate for the statewide population of all other races. In 1990, Native Hawaiians represented 44 percent of all asthma cases in the State of Hawai`i for those 18 years of age and younger, and 35 percent of all asthma cases reported, and in 1992, the Native Hawaiian rate for asthma was 73 percent higher than the rate for the total statwide population. With respect to heart disease, the death rate for Native Hawaiians in 66 percent higher than for the entire State of Hawai`i, and Native Hawaiian males have the greatest years of productive life lost in the State of Hawai`i. The death rate for Native Hawaiians from hypertension is 84 percent higher than that for the entire State, and the death rate from stroke for Native Hawaiians is 13 percent higher than for the entire State. Native Hawaiians have the lowest life expectancy of all populations groups in the State of Hawai`i. Between 1910 and 1980, the life expectancy of Native Hawaiians from birth has ranged from 5 to 10 years less than that of the overall State population average, and the most recent data for 1990 indicates that Native Hawaiian life expectancy at birth is approximatley 5 years less than that of the total State population. With respect to prenatal care, as of 1996, Native Hawaiian women have the highest prevalence of having had no prenatal care during their first trimester of pregnancy, representing 44 percent of all such women statewide. Over 65 percent of the referrals to Healthy Start in fiscal year 1996 and 1997 were Native Hawaiian newborns, and in very region of the State of Hawai`i, many Native Hawaiian newborns begin life in a potentially hazardous circumstance. In 1996, 45 percent of the live births to Native Hawaiians mothers were infants born to single mothers. Statistics indicated that infants born to single mothers have a higher risk of low birth weight and infant mortality. Of all low birth weight babies born to single mothers in the State of Hawai`i, 44 percent were Native Hawaiians. In 1996, Native Hawaiian fetal mortality rates comprised 15 percent of all fetal deaths for the State of Hawai`i. Thirty- two percent of all fetal deaths occurring in mothers under the age of 18 years were Native Hawaiians, and for mothers 18 through 24 years, 28 percent were Native Hawaiians. These and other health status statistics contained in the findings section of S. 87 make clear that the health care challenges that the Native Hawaiian health care systems were established to address require reauthorization of the Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Act. Native Hawaiian Health Care Master Plan and Native Hawaiian Health Care Systems The concepts embodied in S. 87 are the result of the Committee's work with Native Hawaiian health care professionals and others who are dedicated to improving the health status of Native Hawaiians. It is based on the beliefs of those with whom the Committee has consulted, that to insure that Native Hawaiians are able to achieve the healthful harmony of the self (body, mind, and spirit) of lokahi, with others and all of nature, and to assure that Native Hawaiians are able to function effectively as citizens and leaders in their own homeland, there must be a restoration of cultural traditions, an integration of traditional healing methods in the health care delivery system, and a collective effort to restore to the Native Hawaiian, a sense of self-esteem and self-worth, for his or her culture, as well as for the individual. E Ola Mau, a group of Native Hawaiian health care professionals, proposed that this effort begin with the development of a health care master plan, based on a biopsycho- socio-cultural-political model that would be aimed at identifying significant events and factors related to specific health care needs and issues. E Ola Mau proposed that this master plan be implemented at every societal level (individual, household, community, county, and state) in the Hawaiian Islands. It is their goal to have this Native Hawaiian way of dealing with health, eventually become an institutional part of the State's health policy for both Native Hawaiian and Non- Hawaiians. After much debate and careful consideration in the Native Hawaiian community and amongst those concerned with the health status of Native Hawaiians, a consensus was reached that Papa Ola Lokahi, the Native Hawaiian Health Board, should be the mechanism through which Native Hawaiian health care systems would be developed, coordinated, administered, monitored, and continually revised to meet the changing health care needs of the Native Hawaiian population. Papa Ola Lokahi is currently composed of five organizations: (1) the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, an agency of the State which was established pursuant to the authority of amendments made to the Constitution of the State of Hawai`i in 1978 to assure the well-being and interests of Native Hawaiians; (2) E Ola Mau, a nonprofit organization of Native Hawaiian professionals dedicated to insuring that Native Hawaiians achieve a healthful harmony of self (body, mind, and spirit) with others and all of nature, and become productive citizens and leaders in their homeland; (3) Alu Like, a Federally-funded Native Hawaiian agency that promotes vocational training and the founding of community-based organizations that promote health, education, and economic development for Native Hawaiians; (4) the University of Hawai`i; and (5) the Office of Hawaiian Health within the State Department of Health. Papa Ola Lokahi has assumed the primary responsibility of overseeing the development and maintenance of a Native Hawaiian Comprehensive Health Care Master Plan. Papa Ola Lokahi also is the entity responsible for certifying to the Secretary the qualifications and capabilities of Native Hawaiian organizations that petition the Secretary to carry out, pursuant to contracts with the Secretary, the provisions of the Act. Public Law 100-579 authorized Papa Ola Lokahi, the Native Hawaiian Health Board, to-- (1) designate a chairman and vice-chairman from among its member organizations and such other officers as may be deemed necessary to carry out its responsibilities under the Act; (2) adopt bylaws and such other internal regulations or procedures as may be deemed necessary to carry out its responsibilities under the Act; (3) certify to the Secretary that a Native Hawaiian organization meets the definition of ``Native Hawaiian organization'' as set forth in the Act; (4) certify to the Secretary that Native Hawaiian organization has the qualifications and capacity to provide the services or perform contract requirements pursuant to a contract with the Secretary; (5) oversee the development of a comprehensive Native Hawaiian health care master plan; (6) assure the conduct of health status and health care needs assessments of Native Hawaiian communities desiring to participate in Native Hawaiian health care programs; and (7) coordinate the activities and functions of all Native Hawaiian organizations operating health care programs pursuant to contracts with the Secretary. Public Law 100-579 envisions a comprehensive health care system that is community-based, building upon the Native Hawaiian ohana system \\1\\ and incorporating traditional healing (la`au lapa`au) practices with western medical services to provide a health care system that will be culturally consistent and responsive to the needs of Native Hawaiian communities. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ The `ohana system is based upon the fundamental unit of societal interaction for Native Hawaiians in which a family or an organization is led by haku (the recognized leader), whose function is to coordinate and facilitate the expertise and resources of the various households or affiliated organizations in order to accomplish a task or resolve a problem. The households or affiliated organizations are in turn led by a po`o (the head of the household or designated leader of the organization). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- As enacted, Public Law 100-579 authorized the establishment of Native Hawaiian Healing Centers on each of the islands comprising the State of Hawai`i, upon the acceptance of and in consultation with the Native Hawaiian communities on those islands, and wherever possible, using existing health care facilities and health care providers now serving the Native Hawaiian communities on those islands. These centers were intended to lead and coordinate the development and implementation of a statewide Native Hawaiian health care system which would include: (1) a research and monitoring staff, state-certified neighborhood counselors, outreach workers and health educators, traditional Native Hawaiian healers, and Native Hawaiian cultural educators; (2) primary health care providers; (3) primary health care facilities, using existing health care facilities where practicable and acceptable to the local Native Hawaiian community; (4) participation by the State Department of Health, Office of Hawaiian Health in the provision of disease prevention and health promotion programs, as well as a multidisciplinary approach to Native Hawaiian health care which would include nursing, dental hygiene, nutrition education, maternal and infant child care education; and (5) other Federal, State, county, community, and private organizations and agencies that could provide services which meet the health care needs of their respective communities. The development of the master plan by Papa Ola Lokahi was intended to include: (1) work with Native Hawaiian communities which support the establishment of a Native Hawaiian Health Center; (2) conducting a community health needs assessment survey for participating communities; (3) facilitating the development, establishment, and effective functioning of such Centers on the islands of O`ahu, Moloka`i, Maui, Hawai`i, Lana`i, Kaua`i and Ni`ihau; and (4) coordinating the work of relevant agencies and organizations to provide participating communities with: (a) direct health care services and health education, including maternal and child health care and mental health care; (b) instruction in the Native Hawaiian language, cultural beliefs, and traditions with an emphasis on health concepts and practices; (c) training and education of health care providers and educators and cultural educators in health promotion and disease prevention; (d) basic and applied research and monitoring of Native Hawaiian health care approaches to validate outcomes and create standards of quality care; (e) development of health care services, training and education that would have a Native Hawaiian perspective as its primary focus; (f) development of Native Hawaiian community health counselors, outreach workers, educators, and community health aide training programs; (g) prevention-oriented health care services in medical, dental, nutrition, mental health, and in other designated areas as needs assessments may identify as necessary; (h) data collection related to prevention of diseases and illnesses among Native Hawaiians; (i) medical and general health-related research into the diseases that are most prevalent among Native Hawaiians; (j) mental health research in areas of mental health problems that are most prevalent in the Native Hawaiian population; (k) ongoing health planning for further development of the Native Hawaiian health care system; and (l) the provision of health care referral services when certain care services are not available within the Native Hawaiian Health Center. Following enactment of the Native Hawaiian Health Care Act, the Papa Ola Lokahi Board became incorporated and began working with health care providers on each island toward the development of a master plan and an island-specific plan for the provision of primary health care and health care referral services. Those involved in the planning effort ultimately determined that the health care needs of Native Hawaiians would be better served by the establishment of five Native Hawaiian health care systems which could be composed of as many health care centers as might be necessary to serve the health care needs of Native Hawaiians on each island. Accordingly, Papa Ola Lokahi certified to the Secretary that five health care systems qualified as Native Hawaiian Organizations for purposes of entering into contracts with the Secretary, and plans for the provision of primary health care services or health care referral services were submitted to the Secretary in 1990. The first contract awards were made in October of 1991, and the health care systems are now engaged not only in the implementation of the plans approved by the Secretary, but the provision of health care services. The plans for each health care system vary according to the availability of and access to existing health care resources on each island and the need for primary health care services. Currently, all five Native Hawaiian health care systems have become incorporated as 501(c)(3) non-profit health care organizations. In general, the capacity to provide critical care exists only on the island of O`ahu, and thus, it has long been the pattern that if a patient requires hospitalization and complex surgery or treatment, the patient would be referred to a health care provider on the island of O`ahu. However, it is not uncommon that treatment requiring advanced medical technology must be secured in the continental United States. The Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Act provides authority for the provision of health promotion, disease prevention, and primary health services to Native Hawaiians who reside in the State of Hawai`i. Federal planning funds first became available in July of 1990. However, Papa Ola Lokahi incorporated in February 1989 and was able to initiate its organizing activities in July 1989 with funds provided by the Hawai`i State legislature. Between July 1989 and December 1990, informational meetings and organizational activities took place throughout the state, resulting in theestablishment or recognition of the five Native Hawaiian health care systems which would take he responsibility for providing services: (1) Ho`ola Lahui Hawai`i for Kaua`i and O`ahu; (3) Na Pu`uwai for Moloka`i and Lana`i (4) Hui No Ke Ola Pono for Maui; and (5) Hui Malama Ola Na `Oiwi for Hawai`i. Papa Ola Lokahi provided planning funds and technical assistance to these five health care systems, who then developed their service plans from January through June 1991, applied for funding under the Native Hawaiian Health Care Act in July 1991, and were awarded service grants in October of 1991. The basic set of services that all five health care systems must provide include: (1) outreach services to inform Native Hawaiians of the availability of health services; (2) education in health promotion and disease prevention of the Native Hawaiian population by Native Hawaiian health care practitioners, community outreach workers, counselors, and cultural educators, whenever possible; (3) services of physicians, physician's assistants, nurse practitioners or, other health professionals; (4) immunizations; (5) prevention and control of diabetes, high blood pressure, and otitis media; (6) pregnancy and infant care; and (7) improvement of nutrition. In the initial stages, because the five health care systems needed to gain experience in managing health services and because of limited funds, each health care system concentrated on outreach, health assessments, case management, and disease prevention and health promotion activities, with the ultimate objective of providing the full range of health and medical services that are available through a typical primary care health center, and working with traditional healers so that their services will also be more readily available to Native Hawaiians. Now that the five island-wide Native Hawaiian health care systems are established and engaged in the provision of health care services, Papa Ola Lokahi`s role is to provide technical and training support to the five health care systems, work with the five health care systems to develop a statewide, cooperative Native Hawaiian health system, develop research activities and capacities within the five health care systems, and evaluate how well the objectives of the Native Hawaiian Health Care Act are being met. To serve the health care needs of Native Hawaiians on the islands of Kaua`i and Ni`ihau, Ho`ola Lahui Hawai`i (to preserve the Hawaiian Race) is a nonprofit organization dedicated to elevating the health status and overall living conditions of the Native Hawaiian. Ho`ola Lahui Hawai`i has established offices in Waimea and Anahola which serve as a base from which outreach is provided to the East and West sides of Kaua`i. Service to the island of Ni`ihau is provided through the office in Waimea. Ho`ola Lahui Hawai`i is working with existing health and health-related organizations in an effort to assure access to services for Native Hawaiians that were for some reason or another inaccessible or unacceptable. Ho`ola Lahui Hawai`i is organized around the concept of lokahi (unity in all aspects of life) in which they seek to maintain a balance of body, mind, and soul. As a community-based organization which works from the ground level up, the concern of Ho`ola Lahui Hawai`i for the Native Hawaiian grows out of a shared history, for those involved in Ho`ola Lahui Hawai`i are Native Hawaiian. At this time, Ho`ola Lahui Hawai`i provides health education and teaching on cancer, diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, gout, hygiene, and diet/exercise. Ho`ola Lahui Hawai`i also conducts monitoring on blood pressure, blood sugar, weight, and diet. Ho`ola Lahui Hawai`i offers information and referral to outside agencies through case management. In addition, Ho`ola Lahui Hawai`i is sponsoring the traditional Native Hawaiian diet regimen on the island of Kaua`i. Ho`ola Lahui Hawai`i completed one diet project in Waimea in conjunction with the State Department of Health and started another in Kapa`a in May of 1992. Traditional healing is also an area Ho`ola Lahui Hawai`i addresses with sponsorship of a statewide la`au lapa`au (training in traditional medicine) in the spring of 1992 in conjunction with E Ola Mau and Ka Wai Ola`o Kalani. In addition, therapy). Ho`ola Lahui Hawai`i intends to expand its services to include health education and teaching on sexually- tansmitted diseases, family planning, maternal and infant care, and alcohol/substance abuse. Ho`ola Lahui Hawai`i plans include establishing a health education component in kindergarten, elementary, and high schools, tailored to the physical and psychological needs of the particular age group. Ke Ola Mamo is committed to improving the health status of Native Hawaiians on the island of O`ahu through the development of a system of culturally-competent services that use rather than duplicate the existing health care service delivery system. Through outreach referral and case consultation, Ke Ola Mamo's goal is the empowerment of Native Hawaiian families and individuals to access appropriate health care services; the development of partnerships with existing health care services in a collaborative effort to improve access to health care; and working with Native Hawaiian communities and neighborhoods to assist them in meeting their health care needs. In 1986, there were 137,481 Native Hawaiians living on the island of O`ahu, who comprise approximately two-thirds of the total Native Hawaiian population in the entire State of Hawai`i. The Native Hawaiian population living on O`ahu can be roughly divided into three equal groups by geographic location; those living on the leeward coast, including Pearl City; those living on the windward and north coasts; and those living in the urban Honolulu complex. There are estimated to be at least 20 distinct communities and neighborhoods where native Hawaiian families reside. As a start, Ke Ola Mamo hasselected four of these communities to develop service delivery projects. Three projects involve rural communities: the Waimanalo community, the Wai`anae Community, and the Ko`olauloa community. A fourth project is being proposed as a community education and planning process for the urban Honolulu communities with future service implementation proposals. The goal of Na Pu`uwai is to raise the health status of the Native Hawaiian residents of the island of Moloka`i, including Kalaupapa, and the island of Lana`i to the highest possible level and to encourage the Maximum participation of Native Hawaiians to achieve this goal. The strategy of the program is two-fold: (1) to develop a personalized schedule of recommended health care activities, referred to as a ``personalized health care plan'' for each client; and (2) to use case management methodologies as a behavioral intervention to assure client adherence to their ``personalized health care plan.'' To implement this strategy, the program: (1) conducts screening and enrollment for those who are self-referred, provider-referred, or recruited by staff; (2) conducts a health risk appraisal on each enrollee to assess current health maintenance status; (3) develops a personalized health care plan with each client, based on recommended primary, secondary, and tertiary health maintenance guidelines and the client's concerns and needs; (4) coordinates and provides health promotion and disease prevention programs and health screening; (5) provides clinic-based primary health care services; (6) provides multi-disciplinary case management services as appropriate, to enrolled participants; and (7) reassesses client status as dictated in the case management plan and conducts ongoing followup on all clients, case management and non-case management. Na Pu`uwai's service delivery plan provides for (1) direct outpatient care services of a physician and nurse; (2) case management services of a social worker and multi-disciplinary case management team; (3) direct health education and health screening services; and (4) patient following and outreach services. Hui No Ke Ola Pono (an association to strengthen and perpetuate life) is Maui's Native Hawaiian Health Care System, providing services that are culturally relevant to Native Hawaiians of Maui, including identification, treatment, control, and reduction of the incidence of preventable illnesses and conditions frequently occurring in the Native Hawaiian population. The services provided by Hui No Ke Ola Pono include health promotion and disease prevention; referrals for immunizations; improvement of nutrition; referrals for pregnancy and infant care; prevention and control of diabetes, high blood pressure, and middle ear infections; community outreach services; referrals to physician and nursing services; and education on traditional practitioner services. In addition, traditional Hawaiian healers provide the following services: ho`oponopono (family or group counseling); la`au lapa`au (traditional Hawaiian medicine); and lomi lomi (Hawaiian massage therapy). Hui Malama Ola Na `Oiwi (caring for our people) is the Native Hawaiian health care system for Native Hawaiians on the island of Hawai`i. The program mission of Hui Malama Ola Na `Oiwi is to assist Native Hawaiians in restoring a high quality health care system by creating and developing a non-threatening healing environment inclusive of traditional health assistance and to provide and facilitate a process of awareness and addressing the health needs, both physical and spiritual, of Native Hawaiians. Hui Malama's objectives are to (1) promote physical, emotional, and spiritual health and well-being of Native Hawaiians on the island of Hawai`i; (2) assist and promote personal responsibility among Native Hawaiians toward making sound, informed decisions which would decrease unhealthy behaviors and reduce mobility and mortality rates; (3) support and advocate the use of health care services that come from the traditions of the Native Hawaiian culture and of western science; and (4) work toward the establishment of primary health care centers in appropriate locations where quality primary care can be provided and where primary care services are not currently available. The death rates of Native Hawaiians exceed the death rates for all races in the United States caused by diseases of the heart, cancer, strokes, and diabetes. Achieving good health for Native Hawaiians appears difficult, but these diseases can be controlled through early detection, proper diet and treatment, and regular exercise. Hui Malama Ola Na `Oiwi provides the following services: (1) Outreach--enrolling participants in the program, assessing their health risk factors, assisting in securing medical insurance where needed, assisting in access to a physician, providing transportation to and from the physician for those who are unable to do so, and making home visits when necessary; (2) Health promotion and disease prevention--providing education regarding the prevention and control of diabetes, high blood pressure (hypertension), use of tobacco, alcohol and other harmful drugs, sexually transmitted disease, stress, cancer, the importance of sound nutrition habits, regular exercise, and proper maternal and infant care practices; (3) Primary health services--Hui Malama Ola Na `Oiwi assists patients in securing access to the primary health care services of a physician, a physician's assistant, or a nurse practitioner. Through the work of the five Native Hawaiian health care systems, on an annual basis 20,000 Native Hawaiians continue to benefit from the range of health care services provided by the systems. Native Hawaiian Health Care Professions Scholarships The Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Act also provides authority for the provision of scholarships to Native Hawaiians who are seeking higher education opportunities in the health care professions. The Native Hawaiian Health Scholarship Program is administered by the Kamehameha Schools, and has awarded 92 scholarships since 1991. These scholarships include: 10 bachelors of science in nursing, 2 clinical psychology doctoral programs, 2 dentists, 7 dental hygienists, one osteopathic physician, 29 allopathic physicians, 6 masters in public health, 12 masters in social work, one nurse midwife, 3 nurse practitioners, 4 doctors of psychology, and 5 registered nurses.

Seventeen are enrolled in advanced studies, three have completed their training and are awaiting placement for the service payback requirement, thirteen are in residency programs, and 24 have completed their studies and are currently providing services to the Native Hawaiian community. Reauthorization Process In order to assure the maximum involvement of Native Hawaiians in the development of a bill to reauthorize the Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Act (the Act), from December of 1997 through January of 1998, eight island `aha (island-wide conferences) were held involving more than 1,200 individuals in an effort to identify the principle Native Hawaiian health and wellness issues and concerns. In March 1998, a statewide Native Hawaiian Health and Wellness Summit, Ka `Uhane Lokahi, was held on the island of O`ahu, bringing together more than 600 people to identify potential health and wellness issues and concerns. In January 1999, a Nature Hawaiian Health Forum was convened to discuss major health care trends and strategies for health care trends and strategies for health care and wellness developed by the indigenous peoples of North America and Aotearoa (New Zealand). In March 1999, the Executive Directors of the Native Hawaiian health care systems, the members of the Papa Ola Lokahi Board, and the Director of the Native Hawaiian Health Scholarship Program met to review the Act and to incorporate recommendations from the `aha, the summit, and the health forum for inclusion in a bill to reauthorize the Native Hawaiian Health Care Improvement Act. Thereafter, a series of public meetings were held to discuss and review a draft reauthorization bill and based upon the comments received, the bill was further refined and then circulated in the Native Hawaiian community. A final draft of the bill, incorporating and responding to recommendations received from the Native Hawaiian community, was submitted to the Congress. Summary of Major Provisions Senate bill 87 extends the existing program authorities of the Act and authorizes appropriations in such sums as may be necessary through fiscal year 2006. The bill contains extensive findings on the current health status of Native Hawaiians including the incidence and morality rates associated with various forms of cancer, diabetes, asthma, circulatory diseases, infectious disease and illness, and injuries, as well as statistics on life expectancy, maternal and child health, births, teen pregnancies, fetal mortality, mental health, and health professions education and training. The bill further refines the role of Papa Ola Lokahi and the Native Hawaiian health care systems, providing authority for the establishment of additional health care systems to serve the islands of Lana`i and Ni`ihau. The Board of Papa Ola Lokahi has been expanded to include the five Native Hawaiian health care systems, the Kamehameha Schools (or other organizations responsible for placing scholars from the Native Hawaiian Health Scholarship Program), the Hawai`i State Primary Care Association (which represents the community health centers), the Native Hawaiian Physicians Association, and such other organizations as the Papa Ola Lokahi Board will admit based upon a satisfactory demonstration of a record of contribution to the health and well-being of Native Hawaiians. The 1992 amendments to the Act adopted the relevant health objectives of the U.S. Surgeon General's Healthy People 2000 objectives as goals to be met by the Native Hawaiian health care systems. Senate bill 87 establishes new objectives the Native Hawaiian health care systems must meet based on the objectives in the U.S. Surgeon General's Healthy People 2010. Senate bill 87 proposes that the providers of health care services, including traditional Native Hawaiian healers, who provide services under the auspices of the Native Hawaiian health care systems be treated as members of the Public Health Service for purposes of Federal Tort Claims Act coverage. The bill also provides authorization for Papa Ola Lokahi to carry out Native Hawaiian demonstration projects of national significance in areas such as the education of health professionals, the integration of Western medicine with complementary health practices including traditional Native Hawaiian healing practices, the use of tele-wellness and telecommunications in chronic disease management and health promotion and disease prevention, the development of an appropriate model of health care for NativeHawaiians and other indigenous people, the development of a centralized data base and information system relating to the health care status, health care needs, and wellness of Native Hawaiians, and the establishment of a Native Hawaiian Center of Excellence for Nursing at the University of Hawai`i at Hilo, a Native Hawaiian Center for Excellence for Mental Health at the University of Hawai`i at Manoa, a Native Hawaiian Center of Maternal Health Center, a Native Hawaiian Center of Excellence for Research, Training, and Integrated Medicine at Moloka`i General Hospital, and a Native Hawaiian Center of Excellence for Complementary Health and Health Education and Training at the Waianae Coast Comprehensive Health Center. Senate bill 87 also authorizes the establishment of a 21- member National Bipartisan Native Hawaiian Health Care Entitlement Commission which would in turn be authorized to establish a 10-member study committee to collect and compile data necessary to understand the extent of Native Hawaiian needs with regard to the provision of health services. This study committee would make recommendations to the Commission for legislation that would provide for the culturally-competent and appropriate provision of health services for Native Hawaiians as an entitlement.

Legislative History On January 22, 2001 Senator Daniel K. Inouye, for himself and Senator Daniel K. Akaka, introduced Senate bill 87. It was referred to the Committee on Indian Affairs. No hearings were held on S. 87, however, during the 106th Congress, the Committee did hold a series of hearings on S. 1929 which is nearly identical to S. 87. Those hearings were as follows: Moloka`i and Kaua`i (January 18, 2000); Hawai`i and Lana`i (March 16, 2000). Committee Recommendation and Tabulation of Vote The Committee on Indian Affairs, on July 24, 2001, in an open business meeting, by a unanimous vote, recommended that the Senate pass an amendment in the nature of a substitute to S. 87, a bill to reauthorize and amend the Native Hawaiian Health Care Act. Cost and Budgetary Considerations At the time of filing this report, the cost estimate of the Congressional Budget Office on S. 87 has not yet been received. Compliance with Senate Rule XXVI, paragraph 11(a) is therefore impracticable at this time. Executive Communications The Committee received no communications from the Executive branch of government on S. 87. Regulatory and Paperwork Impact Paragraph 11(b) of rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate requires each report accompanying a bill to evaluate the regulatory and paperwork impact that would be incurred in carrying out the bill. The Committee believes that the amendment in the nature of a substitute to S. 87 will have a minimal impact on regulatory or paperwork requirements. Changes in Existing Law UNITED STATES CODE ANNOTATED TITLE 42. THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND WELFARE CHAPTER 122--NATIVE HAWAIIAN HEALTH CARE Sec. 11701. Findings [The Congress finds that:] (a) General Findings.--Congress makes the following findings: (1) Native Hawaiians [comprise] begin their story with the Kumulipo which details the creation and the inter-relationship of all things, including their evolvement as healthy and well people. (2) Native Hawaiians are a distinct and unique indigenous [people] peoples with a historical continuity to the original inhabitants of the Hawaiian archipelago [whose society was organized as a Nation prior to the arrival of the first nonindigenous people in 1778] within Ke Moananui, the Pacific Ocean, and have a distinct society organized almost 2,000 years ago. (3) The health and well-being of Native Hawaiians are intrinsically tied to their deep feelings and attachment to their lands and seas. (4) The long-range economic and social changes in Hawai`i over the 19th and early 20th centuries have been devastating to the health and well-being of Native Hawaiians. (5) Native Hawaiians have never directly relinquished to the United States their claims to their inherent sovereignty as a people or over their national lands, either through their monarchy or through a plebiscite or referendum. [(2)] (6) The Native Hawaiian people are determined to preserve, develop and transmit to future generations their ancestral territory, and their cultural identity in accordance with their own spiritual and traditional beliefs, customs, practices, language, and social institutions. In referring to themselves, Native Hawaiians use the term ``Kanaka Maoli,'' a term frequently used in the 19th century to describe the native people of Hawai`i. [(3)] (7) The constitution and statutes of the State of Hawai`i: (A) acknowledge the distinct land rights of Native Hawaiian people as beneficiaries of the public lands trust; and (B) reaffirm and protect the unique right of the Native Hawaiian people to practice and perpetuate their cultural and religious customs, beliefs, practices, and language. [(4)] (8) At the time of the arrival of the first nonindigenous [people] peoples in Hawai`i in 1778, the Native Hawaiian people lived in a highly organized, self-sufficient, subsistence social system based on communal land tenure with a sophisticated language, culture, and religion. [(5)] (9) A unified monarchical government of the Hawaiian Islands was established in 1810 under Kamehameha I, the first King of Hawai`i. [(6)] (10) Throughout the 19th century and until 1893, the United States: (A) recognized the independence of the Hawaiian Nation; (B) extended full and complete diplomatic recognition to the Hawaiian Government; and (C) entered into treaties and conventions with the Hawaiian monarchs to govern commerce and navigation in 1826, 1842, and 1887. [(7)] (11) In [the year] 1893, John L. Stevens, the United States Minister assigned to the sovereign and independent Kingdom of Hawai`i, [John L. Stevens,] conspired with a small group of non-Hawaiian residents of the Kingdom, including citizens of the United States, to overthrow the indigenous and lawful [Government] government of Hawai`i. [(8)] (12) In pursuance of that conspiracy, the United States Minister and the naval representative of the United States caused armed naval forces of the United States to invade the sovereign Hawaiian Nation in support of the overthrow of the indigenous and lawful Government of Hawai`i and the United States Minister thereupon extended diplomatic recognition of a provisional government formed by the conspirators without the consent of the native people of Hawai`i or the lawful Government of Hawai`i in violation of treaties between the [two] 2 nations and of international law. [(9)] (13) In a message to Congress on December 18, 1893, then President Grover Cleveland reported fully and accurately on these illegal actions, and acknowledged that by these acts, described by the President as acts of war, the government of a peaceful and friendly people was overthrown, and the President concluded that a ``substantial wrong has thus been done which a due regard for our national character as well as the rights of the injured people required that we should endeavor to repair.'' [(10)] (14) Queen Lili`uokalani, the lawful monarch of Hawai`i, and the Hawaiian Patriotic League, representing the aboriginal citizens of Hawai`i, promptly petitioned the United States for redress of these wrongs and for restoration of the indigenous government of the Hawaiian nation, but this petition was not acted upon. (15) The United States has acknowledged the significance of these events and has apologized to Native Hawaiians on behalf of the people of the United States for the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawai`i with the participation of agents and citizens of the United States, and the resulting deprivation of the rights of Native Hawaiians to self-determination in legislation enacted into law in 1993 (Public Law 103-150; 107 Stat. 1510). [(11)] (16) In 1898, the United States annexed Hawai`i through the Newlands Resolution without the consent of or compensation to the indigenous [people] peoples of Hawai`i or their sovereign government who were thereby denied the mechanism for expression of their inherent sovereignty through self-government and self-determination over their lands and ocean resources. [(12)] (17) Through the Newlands Resolution and the 1900 Organic Act, the [United States] Congress received [1.75 million] 1,750,000 acres of lands formerly owned by the Crown and Government of the Hawaiian Kingdom and exempted the lands from then existing public land laws of the United States by mandating that the revenue and proceeds from these lands be ``used solely for the benefit of the inhabitants of the Hawaiian Islands for education and other public purposes'', thereby establishing a special trust relationship between the United States and the inhabitants of Hawai`i. [(13)] (18) In 1921, Congress enacted the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920 which designated 200,000 acres of the ceded public lands for exclusive homesteading by Native Hawaiians, thereby affirming the trust relationship between the United States and the Native Hawaiians, as expressed by then Secretary of the Interior Franklin K. Lane who was cited in the Committee Report of the [United States] Committee on Territories of the House of Representatives [Committee on Territories] as stating, ``One thing that impressed me * * * was the fact that the natives of the islands [who are our wards, I should say, and] * * * for whom in a sense we are trustees, are falling off rapidly in numbers and many of them are in poverty.'' [(14)] (19) In 1938, [the United States] Congress again acknowledged the unique status of the Native Hawaiian people by including in the Act of June 20, 1938 (52 Stat. 781 et seq.), a provision to lease lands within the extension to Native Hawaiians and to permit fishing in the area ``only by native Hawaiian residents of said area or of adjacent villages and by visitors under their guidance''. [(15)] (20) Under the Act entitled ``An Act to provide for the admission of the State of Hawai`i into the Union,'' approved March 18, 1959 (73 Stat. 4), the United States transferred responsibility for the administration of the Hawaiian Home Lands to the State of Hawai`i but reaffirmed the trust relationship which existed between the United States and the Native Hawaiian people by retaining the exclusive power to enforce the trust, including the power to approve land exchanges and legislative amendments affecting the rights of beneficiaries under such Act. [(16)] (21) Under the Act entitled ``An Act to provide for the admission of the State of Hawai`i into the Union'', approved March 18, 1959 (73 Stat. 4), the United States transferred responsibility for administration over portions of the ceded public lands trust not retained by the United States to the State of Hawai`i but reaffirmed the trustrelationship which existed between the United States and the Native Hawaiian people by retaining the legal responsibility of the State for the betterment of the conditions of Native Hawaiians under section 5(f) [of the Act entitled ``An Act to provide for the admission of the State of Hawai`i into Union'', approved March 18, 1959 (73 Stat. 4, 6).] of such Act. (22) In 1978, the people of Hawai`i amended their Constitution to establish the Office of Hawaiian Affairs and assigned to that body the authority to accept and hold real and personal property transferred from any source in trust for the Native Hawaiian people, to receive payments from the State of Hawai`i due to the Native Hawaiian people in satisfaction of the pro rata share of the proceeds of the Public Land Trust created under section 5 of the Admission Act of 1959 (Public Law 86-3), to act as the lead State agency for matters affecting the Native Hawaiian people, and to formulate policy on affairs relating to the Native Hawaiian people. [(17)] (23) The authority of the Congress under the [United States] Constitution to legislate in matters affecting the aboriginal or indigenous peoples of the United States includes the authority to legislate in matters affecting the native peoples of Alaska and Hawai`i. (24) Further, the United States has recognized the authority of the Native Hawaiian people to continue to work towards an appropriate form of sovereignty as defined by the Native Hawaiian people themselves in provisions set forth in legislation returning the Hawaiian Island of Kaho`olawe to custodial management by the State of Hawai`i in 1994. [(18)] (25) In furtherance of the trust responsibility for the betterment of the conditions of Native Hawaiians, the United States has established a program for the provision of comprehensive health promotion and disease prevention services to maintain and improve the health status of the Hawaiian people. This program is conducted by the Native Hawaiian Health Care Systems, the Native Hawaiian Health Scholarship Program, and Papa Ola Lokahi. Health initiatives from these and other health institutions and agencies using Federal assistance have begun to lower the century-old morbidity and mortality rates of Native Hawaiian people by providing comprehensive disease prevention, health promotion activities, and increasing the number of Native Hawaiians in the health and allied health professions. This has been accomplished through the Native Hawaiian Health Care Act of 1988 (Public Law 100-579) and its reauthorization in section 9168 of Public Law 102-396 (106 Stat. 1948). [(19)] (26) This historical and unique legal relationship has been consistently recognized and affirmed by [the] Congress through the enactment of Federal laws which extend to the Native Hawaiian people the same rights and privileges accorded to American Indian, Alaska Native, Eskimo, and Aleut communities, including the Native American Programs Act of 1974 [42 U.S.C.A. Sec. 2991 et seq.]; the American Indian Religious Freedom Act [42 U.S.C.A. 1996]; the National Museum of the American Indian Act [20 U.S.C.A. Sec. 80q et seq.]; and the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act [25 U.S.C.A. Sec. 3001 et seq.]. [(20)] (27) The United States has also recognized and reaffirmed the trust relationship to the Native Hawaiian people through legislation which authorizes the provision of services to Native Hawaiians, specifically, the Older Americans Act of 1965 [42 U.S.C.A. Sec. 3001 et seq.], the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act Amendments of 1987, the Veterans' Benefits and Services Act of 1988, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 [29 U.S.C.A. Sec. 701 et seq.], the Native Hawaiian Health Care Act of 1988 (Public Law 100-579), the Health Professions Reauthorization Act of 1988, the Nursing Shortage Reduction and Education Extension Act of 1988, the Handicapped Programs Technical Amendments Act of 1988, the Indian Health Care Amendments of 1988, and the Disadvantaged Minority Health Improvement Act of 1990. [(21)] (28) The United States has also affirmed the historical and unique legal relationship to the Hawaiian people by authorizing the provision of services to Native Hawaiians to address problems of alcohol and drug abuse under the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 (Public Law 99-570). (29) Further, the United States has recognized that Native Hawaiians, as aboriginal, indigenous, native peoples of Hawai`i, are a unique population group in Hawai`i and in the continental United States and has so declared in Office of Management and Budget Circular 15 in 1997 and Presidential Executive Order No. 13125, dated June 7, 1999. [(22)] (30) Despite [such services,] the United States having expressed its committment to a policy of reconciliation with the Native Hawaiian people for past grievances in Public Law 103-150 (107 Stat. 1510) the unmet health needs of the Native Hawaiian people [are] remain severe and [the] their health status [of Native Hawaiians] continues to be far below that of the general population of the United States.
