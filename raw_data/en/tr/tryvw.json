Only a few controlled clinical trials have been performed with the mistletoe preparation Iscador as a complementary treatment for cancer, many of them with medium to low quality due to methodological shortcomings. Reasons for some quality concerns, particularly discontinuationof treatment and/or participation and premature termination are analyzed. Analysis is based oncontrolled clinical trials dealing with Iscador. Data stem from the archive of published andongoing research of the \u00abVerein fu \u00a8r Krebsforschung\u00bb (Society for Cancer Research) in Arlesheim, Switzerland. Controlled clinical studies with cancer patients that were started after01.01.1990 or were not completed by then have been evaluated. Fifty-six controlled studies aredocumented, 24 of them randomized and 32 non-randomized. Nine of the randomized studies were done by matched-pair design, the others by conventional parallel group design; six of the last were terminated prematurely primarily for slow recruitment due to patient preferences andcompliance of physicians. Patient and physician preference seem to be important factorslimiting recruitment for randomized trials and hence implementation. This adds to the overallunwillingness of participation by patients with serious diseases. A well-balanced mix of designsusing different research methods and outcomes is suggested combined with analyses, incountries where mistletoe therapy in general or Iscador in particular is unknown or notavailable. Keywords: cancer - patient recruitment - preference Background In Europe, a substantial portion of patients suffering from cancer use complementary therapies. However, evidence of these treatments regarding efficacy on diseaseprogression and survival is discussed controversially (1).Amongst complementary therapies against cancer,aqueous extracts of European mistletoe ( Viscum album L.), developed on the basis of anthroposophical medicine, are the most frequently used medications,particularly in German speaking countries (2,3). In recent systematic reviews (4-6) the authors concluded that in spite of the longstanding and widespread use of mistletoe preparations, only few controlled clinical trialshave been performed; the quality of many older studies is generally medium to low due to methodological shortcomings, the more recent ones tend to be better. Objective Reasons for some specific quality issues, particularly discontinuation of treatment and/or participation and premature termination of recent controlled clinicalstudies with cancer patients using the mistletoe prepara- tion Iscador as a complementary treatment are analyzed. Consequences for future research are suggested.For reprints and all correspondence: E-mail: ziegler@hiscia.ch*Expanded and updated version of a lecture given at the InternationalWorkshop on Study Methods in Complementary Medicine,Robert Bosch Stiftung, Stuttgart, April 20-21, 2006. /C2232007 The Author(s).

However,looking for concerns intrinsic to research with themistletoe preparation Iscador, additional informationcan be gained from difficulties with ongoing researchand from reasons for discontinuation. The followinganalysis is based on controlled clinical studies dealingwith the mistletoe preparation Iscador (see subsequently).All data stem from the archive of published and ongoingresearch of the \u00abVerein fu \u00a8r Krebsforschung\u00bb (Society for Cancer Research) in Arlesheim, Switzerland. In order toconcentrate the analysis on newer research, only con-trolled clinical studies with cancer patients that werestarted after 01.01.1990 or were not completed by thenhave been evaluated, including non-finished and non-published ones (7,8). The control group always receivedconventional cancer therapy (adjuvant or palliative) andthe treatment group additionally Iscador. Within thistime frame, 56 controlled studies are documented, 24 ofthem randomized and 32 non-randomized (Figure 1).Subgroups of these will be discussed separately. For the discussion of research with other mistletoe products than Iscador and concerning other qualityissues, see e.g. (3,4,6,9). References also give a detailedquality assessment of controlled clinical studies withmistletoe preparations (4,6,9). Mistletoe Characteristics Mistletoe extracts for cancer therapy were first used in1918 by Ita Wegman on the basis of anthroposophy (10).Pharmacological and toxicological properties of mistletoeextracts are documented by various publications onimmunological and anti-cancer effects in vitro and in vivo [overviews in (3,11-14)]. Iscador is a fermentedaqueous extract of European mistletoe ( Viscum album L.) that is treated by a special mechanical process of anthroposophical pharmaceutics to increase efficacy (15). There are different doses and sorts of Iscadordepending on the host tree, and various application schemes (12,16). Iscador is generally adminis- tered subcutaneously two to three times a week. For information concerning the specific therapy regimes, one has to consult the original studies. Systemic adverse reactions are very rare (3,17-20) and mild to moderate in almost all cases (i.e. CTC/WHO grade 1-2) with spontaneous recovery within one week (21,22). No irreversible events or deaths were reported. This means that there exists no real risk in using mistletoe, which is an important condition for planningand implementing mistletoe studies even if the clinical effects are still discussed controversially (1). However, local reactions at the injection site are frequent withspontaneous recovery after some hours or days. These effects are expected and typical for mistletoe prepara- tions, especially Iscador: in consequence, the dose is adjusted according to the size of the local reaction. This makes it difficult to design a pharmacologically andmedically inert placebo showing similar reactions (23). Given this situation, blinding of patients and physicians is nearly impossible. In case a placebo with a similar setof reactions is used, the placebo might not be a true placebo (showing no specific effects) any more and thus results of the treatment comparison might be at leastquestionable. Randomized Iscador Studies with Parallel- group Design From 15 randomized Iscador studies with parallel-group design (Table 1) six had to be terminated prematurely(No. 3, 4, 6-9). In five cases (No. 3, 6-9) the most important reason was slow recruitment, due toRandomized studies with parallel-group design n = 15Randomized studies with matched-pairs design n = 9Randomized studies n = 24 Prospective controlled non-randomized studies with parallel-goup design n = 9Prospective controlled non-randomized studies with matched-pairs design n = 16Prospective controlled non-randomized studies n = 25 Retrospective forward longitudinal (retrolective) cohort studies n = 4Retrospective controlled studies n = 3Retrospective controlled studies n = 7Non-randomized controlled studies n = 32Controlled Iscador studies with cancer patients started after or not finished by 01.01.1990 n = 56 Figure 1.

However,trial participation generally has many hurdles and is particularly bad with patients having therapy preferences (24-29). The situation concerning recruitment andcompliance in randomized studies is even more compli-cated in the context of complementary oncology com- pared to conventional oncology (3,30-33). Obviously, these difficulties were also encountered in completed studies. For instance, in a large trial inGermany during the eighties, the investigators had torevise the power calculation twice to reduce sample size, but still needed more than 9 years for patient recruitment (41). Another study needed considerably more time forcompletion than anticipated (35,42). In addition, for both cases showing no significant effect of Iscador on tumor progression or survival, one can argue that they sufferedfrom a false-negative bias (3,4,6). Given these experi- ences, an empirical study was conducted to evaluate the willingness of patients to participate in a randomizedclinical mistletoe trial (39). The results are shown inTable 2 and present a whole bundle of reasons why particular patients were not able to enter the trial. Among these, preference of mistletoe is the onlymistletoe-specific reason for not participating. The refusal of trials in general as well as the wish to determine the therapy itself is prominent as well. Randomized Matched-pair Studies with Iscador The concept of randomized matched-pair studies is rather unusual in cancer research. The recruitment andrandomization of patients for this kind of trial is executed pair-wise: From a successively filled pool ofcancer patients not treated by any kind of mistletoe ortherapy stimulating the immune system, pairs accordingto pre-specified prognostic factors are built and then randomized separately. Details of the randomization process (43) were executed according to pre-specifiedrules, in accordance with the suggestions of theCONSORT statement (44,45). Randomization and Concealed Allocation Two slips of paper with names of the two matched partners were put into a hat by the primary investigator, and a masked assistant drew one of the slips. It was determined that the patient selected first was asked if heor she would be willing to ask the attending doctor for acomplementary therapy using Iscador. Thus, interventiondid not consist of giving a therapy with Iscador, but ofmaking a suggestion for an Iscador therapy. Implementation The patient recruitment happened strictly according to the matching rules without interference from investiga-tors. The random allocation result was implemented bythe primary investigator non-involved in the randomselection process. Consent The acceptance of participation in this kind of study is one-sided, i.e. only the patient being suggested a therapywith Iscador was informed about this process. The otherpatient as well as the respective attending physicianwas left uninformed. Thus, this is a special case ofthe single randomized consent design of Zelen (46-48).That research was planned and started in the early 70s, where ethical committees did not yet exist; or there wasTable 2.

Exclusion of Pairs If for any reason, a single patient had to be excluded, the whole matched-pair including this patient wasexcluded. The following criteria were applied to excludepatient pairs: (i) if the allocated suggestion for Iscador therapy has not been taken up either by the patient or the attending physician; (ii) if the control partner decidedto start Iscador therapy or any other treatment modulat-ing the immune system; (iii) if for one of the partners acertified non-tumor-related accident or suicide occurred;(iv) if after the matching process any patient refusedto participate further for any reason, or if any partnerdropped out for any other reason than death or if a patient could not be found any more in the follow-up process. The statistical analysis of randomized clinical trials according to the principle of intention-to-treat (53,54) hastwo aspects which need to be differentiated: first topreserve the statistical balance of the baseline factors inthe two therapy groups and second to present anadequate picture of the real life situation, where non- compliance and drop-out occur and might be associated with the therapy and the outcome. However, a suffi-ciently complete picture of the whole situation is onlygiven if the intention-to-treat analysis estimating theeffect of assignment to therapy (use-effectiveness) iscomplemented with an estimated effect of actuallyadministered therapy (method-effectiveness\u2014not to beconfused with a simple per-protocol\u2014or as-treated analysis) (55,56).With respect to randomized matched-pair studies, the procedure of exclusion of pairs guarantees that randomization is not undermined by excluding patients.In other words, internal validity is not at issue sincethe structural comparability is preserved by pair-wiseselection and exclusion. This covers the first aspect of anintention-to-treat analysis. However, by this exclusionprocess, not all randomized pairs are included in theanalysis and hence there exists a kind of underreporting bias which does not interfere with the randomization but with the completeness of the analyzed data sets.A masking process was not applicable to the interventionof the randomized matched-pair studies, since it consistednot of a therapy as such but of a suggestion to perform atherapy with Iscador towards the randomly selectedpatient. In addition, neither the outcome assessors weremasked nor the statisticians. Nine studies of this kind have been executed (Table 3), four of which have been published (49,50,52,57-59) andthe rest await final analysis and publication. Most ofthese took a very long time to execute (more than 10years) and there have been some patients who declinedparticipation or did not receive Iscador therapy (Table 3). Concerns with Randomized Clinical Trials using Iscador According to the aforementioned results reported, recruitment for a conventional randomized controlledclinical trial (RCT) is difficult for several reasons:physician or patient preferences either in favor of oragainst mistletoe therapies, preferred co-interventions,patient and physician compliance and drop-outs. Thelong tradition of using mistletoe preparations in Germanspeaking countries has the consequence that mistletoe in general and Iscador in particular is well known amongTable 3.

Thus, many informed patients explicitly want to usemistletoe extracts and therefore cannot be randomized. Apart from this situation there are major general concerns using randomization and blinding in trialswithin complementary medicine (33). With respect toquality, blinding is nearly impossible in mistletoe studies:it was shown that at least in the long run most physiciansand patients loose their blindness (23,60). However, also in chemotherapy trials, blinding is rare (61). In addition, any kind of standardized therapy as usedin conventional randomized clinical trials is not repre-sentative of a population using the mistletoe preparationIscador as a cancer treatment. Randomized matched-pair studies have the drawback of not being well accepted by conventional trial expertsand methodologists because of the unusual design. And,they share some of the limitations of RCTs in generalwhich make recruitment and implementation difficult: physician or patient preferences in favor of or against complementary treatments, patient preferences, refusal totrial in general, compliance, drop-outs, rigid inclusionand exclusion criteria. Furthermore, a fairly big pool ofcancer patients is required to recruit enough matchingpairs. Not all quality issues concerning randomizedmistletoe research can be mentioned here. Some authors(3,4,6) discuss other limits, particularly false-negative biasstemming from other kinds of biases. Prospective Non-randomized Controlled Iscador Studies Prospective non-randomized controlled studies are advantageous for including representative samples ofpatients and doing research on those receiving actualIscador treatments, i.e. performing prospective datameasurement. However, since they should consider allknown possible prognostic factors and confounders,they tend to be expensive and, if the effect is notstrong, unreliable due to selection bias (62,63). Table 4shows the nine controlled prospective non-randomized studies in parallel-group design with Iscador that were recently finished or are still ongoing. According to thequality assessments of some of these in (4,6), they vary inquality. Compared to other types of cohort research(21,22) few patients are included, but compared to therandomized trials, the situation is acceptable. Note thatnone of them was discontinued. The main work in realizing cohort studies should focus on the design and implementation phase. That isthe place where random as well as systematic errors (bias)can be minimized, particularly by specifying adequate inclusion and exclusion criteria, and where adequate measures against selection bias (the biggest challenge fornon-randomized designs), performance bias, detectionbias and attrition bias (80,81) can be provided. In a systematic way, this has only been regarded in the fourparallel-group studies: No. II, V, VI, VII and, to some extent, in study VIII with matched-pairs. The report on random and systematic error prevention is insufficientwithin the others (82), as is the statistical analysis. Prospective Non-randomized Matched-pair Studies with Iscador There are 16 prospective non-randomized matched-pairs studies with Iscador for different solid cancers, eleven published (50,52,57-59); the remaining still await analysisand publication. Pair-wise matching is one of the strongest measures against selection bias in non-randomized cohort research.Within these, not only tumor-specific prognostic factorsare considered, but also the year of diagnosis: formatching pairs, difference between the years of initialdiagnosis is at most 3 years. This allows patientrecruitment in pairs over a long period of time (and hence long periods of follow-up) without risking the danger of significantly different prognostic or therapeuticprocedures due to medical progress. In other words: thereis no danger of stage migration (83). If for any reason a single patient was excluded, in any case the whole matched-pair including this patient wasexcluded. These pairs have neither been followed up norused for other purposes in any other Iscador research.This process does not explicitly favor one of the twotherapy groups. In most cases, the excluded patient pairs did not exceed 10% of those recruited. No study was prematurely terminated due to lack of patients.However, the recruitment period in most cases exceeded10 years. Controlled Forward Longitudinal (\u00abretrolective \u00bb) Cohorts using Iscador Controlled retrospective forward longitudinal (\u00abretrolective\u00bb) cohort analyses (84) include systematic searches of patient archival data in clinical registriesaccording to specific criteria of inclusion and exclusion,guided by a protocol that adheres to the principles ofgood epidemiological practice (85,86). These are advan-tageous for being easy to implement for a long treatmentperiod in a comparatively short data gathering period fora large sample. As such they give a picture of the real world effectiveness, since they do not require any additional selection process. The randomized selectionof study centers from an available pool guaranteesexternal validity. Their main disadvantage regardsreliance on complete archival data, that is on a retro-spective data collection (i.e. measurements and recordingsof observations happened before study onset and for24 Controlled studies with mistletoe preparation IscadorTable 4.

Therefore they are subject to selection bias: measurements and recordings of all known prog-nostic factors, possible confounders, and all wanted and unwanted events cannot be assured. Four relevant studies are available, two of which are finished and published(21,22) and the remaining two are still being analyzedand prepared for publication. Retrospective Controlled Cohort Studies with Iscador Three classical retrospective cohort studies have been performed since 1990 (87-89). They are easy to do andcomplement the overall picture concerning characteristics of the Iscador population. Reflections and Consequences Quality There are avoidable problems of quality, such as transparency and completeness of reporting data. Other problems are more difficult to overcome; however, theyare not specific to mistletoe and induce different kinds of biases (3,4,6): systematic differences in care provided apart from the mistletoe treatment (performance bias),dropouts, withdrawals and protocol deviations (attritionbias). If the outcome is survival or tumor progression, detection bias is not problematic. The situation for quality of life is more complicated necessitating the useof validated questionnaires. Duration of clinical phase Many mistletoe studies have a clinical phase of less than 12 months; one might argue, that this is insufficient tobring into action long-term effects of mistletoe therapy (81,84,90). More research on long-term applications of Iscador is needed to evaluate effectiveness as wellas safety. Designs If one wants to compare parallel groups, continue to randomize even if difficult. However, as shown earlier, recruitment may be the utmost problem for randomizedtrials with the mistletoe preparation Iscador. Before rejecting randomization, one should search for alternative designs for randomized trials [i.e. comprehensive cohortdesign (91-93), and (94-96)]. Thus randomized matched-pair studies might take a long time, depending on availability of patients, but they seem to be an alternative that requires evaluation. A survey within an academiccenter in the USA showed that for conventional physicians working in such an institution the attitudetowards using complementary therapy methods may be strongly linked to the existence of randomized trials in favor of such a treatment (97). However, randomization does not solve all problems. If the number of recruitedpatients is small, they might not be representative.In addition, the use of randomization might severelyundermine the representativeness (or the generalizability)of results, since patients who agree to randomization might be different from those who do not, especially in the context of complementary and alternative medicine,where strong preferences are more common (36,68,98). One of the most important points in this respect is to use different designs that complement each other(99,100). This was the underlying reason for implement-ing randomized matched-pair studies together with non-randomized ones (50). Thus, well-designed non- randomized research is not just an excuse for not beingable to do randomized trials, but an important contribu-tion to the overall clinical picture of Iscador therapy.If randomization is not possible or can only be done insmall groups, one can use in addition prospective controlled non-randomized studies (101,102) and adhere to high quality standards (63,80,82). Under somecircumstances, results of prospective controlled non-randomized studies might be comparable to randomizedfor the same outcome and similar population character-istics (103-106). However, care is required to prevent overestimation (62,63,82). If resources and time frames are limited, they can be complemented by retrospectivecontrolled (\u00abretrolective\u00bb) cohort studies using archivaldata and guided by a protocol (84-86) and by classicalretrospective controlled cohort studies. If all this doesnot work, a look for other sorts of designs is essential (107). Even prospective one-arm studies can be useful, if designed and evaluated properly (108,109). Centers It is essential to do research in countries or populations unaware of mistletoe, in general or Iscador in particularor where mistletoe is not readily available (as in Beogrador in the USA). The experience from Beograd (Table 1)shows: randomization is not a real problem; drop-outsare seldom, since patients are content having a chance to receive complementary therapy with Iscador; compliance is high, since patients follow closely the physician'sinstructions. Outcome Consider reduction of symptoms, side effects of conventional therapy (chemotherapy, radiotherapy) andquality of life in addition to survival and tumor behavior.26 Controlled studies with mistletoe preparation IscadorPreclinical Studies with Healthy Volunteers It was pointed out in (110) that there are also few in vivo controlled studies with healthy volunteers concerningimmunomodulating effects of the mistletoe preparationIscador or lectin extracts of mistletoe; however, thereasons are unknown. The trial in (110) complements thealready existing four trials (111-117). Such research couldbe important for design of further clinical trialsinvestigating the immunological effects of mistletoe preparations. Conclusion Randomized mistletoe research has been notoriously difficult to perform, especially in German speakingcountries where mistletoe preparations are readily avail-able outside of clinical trials. Patient and physicianpreference in favor of or against complementary therapy with mistletoe seem to be the most important factors limiting implementation of such trials with Iscador. Thisadds to the overall unwillingness of participation in trialsfor patients with serious diseases. Hence a well balancedmix of designs using different research methods anddifferent outcomes is suggested, combined with researchin countries, where mistletoe in general or Iscador inparticular are unknown or unavailable.
