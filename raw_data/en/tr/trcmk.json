Vicki Match Suna, AIA Executive Vice President and Vice Dean Real Estate Development and Facilities NYU Langone Health - Design Guidelines INTRODUCTION Real Estate Development and Facilities 3 2023 INTRODUCTION Purpose With over 13 million square feet at locations throug hout the New York metropolitan region, NYU Langone Health leases, owns and operates an enormous variety of buildings. The NYU Langone Health - Design Guidelines have been created as a guide for architects, interior designers, engineers and Real Estate Development + Facilities Project Managers (PM), etc. to design existing and new facilities. We understand all projects are unique. As such, it is expected the Architectural/Engineering Team (A/E Team) shall take into account existing site conditions, user requirements, building codes, these Design Guidelines, and all other requirements as necessary to design our facilities. In addition, these guidelines are not intended to repeat or replace any code mandated requirements. Compliance with relevant codes is the sole responsibility of the A/E Team. Goals Efficiency A principal goal of the Design Guidelines is to impr ove the efficiency of the design process. We can improve operations and maintenance by creating a commonality of systems and products across our expanding portfolio. Where appropriate, approved materials and products are indicated in the guidelines. The aim is not to limit design expression but to guide the architects and engineers toward solutions that are in conformance with our construction and maintenance practices. Improving efficiency in design, construction and operations is of substantial financial benefit to our institution. Design Excellence and Quality Construction N YU Langone Health is committed to design excellence, and stands by the premise that intelligent planning, inspired design, meticulous documentation, and quality construction are all indispensable to this effort, and will bring added value to our organization. The guidelines have been created in support of this goal. Applicability These guidelines will be updated periodically. The P M on a particular project will advise when new updates are available. A ccess and Exceptions The Design Guidelines can be accessed on both BuildF low (the NYU Langone Health construction document management site) and the RED+F website: http://nyulangone.org/vendor-supplier-information/de sign-guidelines Designers may seek approval of deviations from or alternatives/additions to the Design Guidelines by written request to the PM, who will forward such requests to the RED+F Design Studio for review. The PM will advise the designer in writing whether or not the proposed deviation, alternative or addition is approved. Under no circumstances shall deviation from the Design Guidelines be construed as a basis for additional services.

Typically, projects are formulated for approval and are then guided through Design and Construction by an assigned NYU Langone project manager (RED+F PM) who follows a defined process to formulate and implement construction projects based on a specified scope, schedule and budget to meet the goals and needs of all stakeholders. 1. F ormulation & Planning Formulation - To ensure that NYU Langone Health's resources are utilized in the most effective manner, most projects are initiated through Senior Administration. Individual departments can also initiate small department-funded projects by contacting RED+F directly. These requests are then reviewed by Senior Administration and, if approved, authorized to proceed. Requests are evaluated based on their importance in supporting NYU Langone Health's vision and strategic goals, space requirements, staffing requirements, potential impact on other programs, and funding sources. Planning - If Senior Administration determines a requested project merits further investigation, RED+F will do a planning study to identify the project objectives, scope, budget and schedule requirements. This is an iterative process, which attempts to balance project requirements with available resources. Throughout this process, RED+F provides professional assistance to define the primary objective of the project, the specific needs of the user department and the potential solutions. Working with Senior Administration, RED+F then analyzes the options in a campus-wide context and establishes target budgets. By identifying key relationships, such as adjacencies to public spaces, utility connections, and potential future uses of the site, broad facility issues can be addressed one project at a time. The best options are re- examined and re-analyzed until a viable solution is found. For major projects, RED+F will often contract outside consulting firms to work with the user-group through a process of defining the project goals, developing the space program, identifying and analyzing options, and budgeting. Throughout this process, RED+F will review the progress with Senior Administration. At the conclusion of the planning study, a formal report is prepared to document the project scope, budget, and schedule for approval by Senior Administration. For small projects, the planning process is similar, but usually less complex and without the involvement of outside consultants. Approvals - During the Formulation Process, RED+F develops a cl ear statement of project objectives. This statement is incorporated into a final report along with the space program, schedule, and project budget for approval by Senior Administration and to serve as a guide throughout the design process. NYU Langone Health - Design Guidelines PROJECT DELIVERY PROCESS Real Estate Development and Facilities 21 2023 All projects move through an approval process to ens ure that NYU Langone Health's resources are managed effectively. The parties involved in the approval process and the number of approvals required varies depending on the project category, the size of the budget, and other considerations. As projects are planned, they are incorporated into a comprehensive capital plan, either as a specific line item or as a broad allowance (pools). The capital plan is developed within the framework of a long-term financial plan. Both the capital plan and the financial plan are updated regularly to ensure that the future costs of any planned capital investments are accounted for in the long-term financial plan. As projects become more defined, capital and operating budget implications are considered and the capital and financial plans are updated, reviewed and prioritized by NYU Langone Senior Leadership and approved by NYU Langone Health's Finance Committee. The planning studies prepared in the previous phase not only identify each project's objective, scope, budget, and schedule, but they also include a Project Authorization Form with signature lines for each of the parties responsible for approval. When all signatures on the form are received the project account is established and the design process begins. 2. D esign Phase Once approved, a NYU Langone project manager (RED+F PM) is assigned to the project and a project user-group is established. Starting with a design kick-off meeting, the PM coordinates a series of meetings with the Users and the Project Team to gather information. This group - comprising representatives from users, the Design Studio, Facilities Management, MCIT, Senior Administration, architectural and engineering consultants, and the construction manager, if applicable - will guide the project through planning and design. Its meetings provide a forum for coordination of the various aspects of the project during the design process. Schematic Design (SD) - This first phase of the design process defines the design parameters and the overall layout. The A/E Team generates schemes based on information gathered from a field investigation (documenting existing conditions) as well as from Users. The PM brings in other NYULH departments (Design Studio, Facilities, MCIT, Infection Prevention and Control, EH&S, Security, etc.) to help inform the design from their perspectives. Schemes are reviewed by all stakeholders and refined accordingly. An estimate will be prepared at the end of this preliminary design phase to verify that the project remains within budget. The budget must be reconciled with scope prior to proceeding with the next phase of design. A/E Deliverables: - Meeting Minutes - Schedule - Cost Estimate - Outline BIM Execution Plan (if applicable) NYU Langone Health - Design Guidelines PROJECT DELIVERY PROCESS Real Estate Development and Facilities 22 2023 - F easibility Studies - Outline Program Analysis - Outline Scope Narrative (incl. user requirements such as storage needs, etc.) - Outline \"Basis of Design\" document - SD Drawings: - Demolition Plans - Floor Plans (w/ FFE, material notes, etc.) - Elevations - CAD Renderings of major spaces - MEP/FP schematic drawings (single line acceptable) - Structural schematic drawings (i.e. primary structural system) - Sample materials - Outline Equipment List - Outline architectural and engineering specifications Design Development (DD) - In this phase, the layout agreed upon in prelimina ry design is developed in greater detail with all major components of the project defined and developed. There is often heavy User involvement to be sure that the design adheres to their needs. The PM brings in other NYU Langone Health departments (Design Studio, Facilities, MCIT, Infection Prevention and Control, EH&S, Security, etc.) to help inform the design from their perspectives. All key design decisions are made and agreed upon by the end of this phase. The PM works with the A/E Team to keep scope in line with what was initially approved, with the addition of any changes incorporated during preliminary design. The PM must approve any changes to the agreed upon and authorized scope of the project as such changes would have impacts on the project budget. An estimate is prepared at the end of the Design Development phase and the budget must be reconciled with the project scope prior to proceeding with the next phase. In addition, the User must sign-off on the floor plan(s) in a timely manner in order for the A/E Team to proceed into the Construction Document phase and maintain the overall project schedule. A/E Deliverables: - Meeting Minutes - Schedule - Cost Estimate - Updated BIM Execution Plan (if applicable) - Final Program Analysis - Final Scope Narrative (incl. user requirements such as storage needs, etc.) - Updated \"Basis of Design\" document - DD Drawings: - Floor Plans (w/ FFE, dimensions, partition tags, RED+F room numbers, etc.) - Enlarged Floor Plans (of typical and major spaces) - Reflected Ceiling Plans - Elevations NYU Langone Health - Design Guidelines PROJECT DELIVERY PROCESS Real Estate Development and Facilities 23 2023 - S ections - Schedules (i.e. Room Finish, Furniture, Door, Door Hardware, Lighting, Plumbing Fixture, Toilet Accessory, Building Accessory, Pantry Appliance, etc.) - Typical and Major Details (i.e. building envelope, lobby / reception, millwork, etc.) - CAD Renderings of major spaces - MEP/FP DD drawings (including double line HVAC drawings and riser diagrams) - Structural DD drawings (including typical details) - Signage and Wayfinding package including a list of all applicable codes, list of assumptions and observations, location plans (including locations of brand/donor related signage), message schedule (including room and wayfinding signage, recycling posters and decals, code required emergency/egress signage, health/safety signage, etc.) and simple elevation renderings for \"high-profile\" sign types. \"High-profile\" sign types shall include brand/donor related signage such as: - Building ID Branding/Recognition - Canopy Signage/Recognition - Building Entry Signage/Recognition - Main Lobby Recognition - Floor Recognition - Departmental Recognition - Waiting Area Recognition - Staging/phasing plans (if applicable) - Updated sample materials - Finish and Furniture Booklets - Updated Equipment List - Updated architectural and engineering specifications - Outline List of Special Inspections or Testing required by the Building Code Construction Documents (CD) - This phase takes the design as developed and final ized during Design Development and documents it for construction. Details are further refined as construction issues are addressed. The main emphasis of this phase is to verify that all needed information is on the drawings and in the specifications so that the project can be bid for construction. Typically, there are fewer meetings in this phase that require the involvement of the Users, as the emphasis is documentation of earlier design decisions. Again, previously agreed upon and authorized scope, schedule and budget must be adhered to, and the Project Manager works with the A/E Team to keep scope in line, taking into account any changes incorporated during previous phases. At the end of this phase the Project Manager puts the project out to bid.

C onstruction Phase After the Design phase the Project Manager coordinat es construction of the project according to the construction drawings and specifications set by the Contract Documents. Project Managers have expertise in architecture, engineering, design and construction to bring capital construction and renovation projects forward from design to completion and occupancy. Bidding and Negotiation (B/N) - A s a given project moves from development to the construction phase, the Project Manager initiates and oversees the bidding and negotiation procedure, forwarding contract documents to a list of pre-qualified contractors to solicit bids. During the ensuing bid period, the Project Manager and a NYU Langone Health - Design Guidelines PROJECT DELIVERY PROCESS Real Estate Development and Facilities 25 2023 consulting team (typically an architect and engineer ) answer questions raised by bidders, making sure all bidders are aware of all questions asked and answered. At the end of bidding, contractors submit their proposed prices in sealed bids. Once the bids are opened, a leveling process ensues a critical part of the process; leveling vets out discrepancies among bids to ensure an \"apples to apples\" comparison. A/E Deliverables: - Meeting Minutes - Participation in Pre-Bid Conferences and Site Walkthroughs - Bid Documents (Instructions to Bidders, Bid Form, Drawings and Specifications) - Written RFI Responses - Review and Approval of product substitution(s), \"or equal\" product(s) - B id Leveling and Evaluation - Assist with bid negotiations and bidder selection - Final Construction Documents (including supplemental Addendums issued prior to award of construction contract) Construction Administration (CA) - O nce leveling is completed, the project is awarded to the qualified bidder with the lowest bid, and a contract sets an agreed upon price for the work and commits the winning contractor to the authorized scope, schedule and budget. Starting with a construction kick-off meeting and continuing through the life of the project, the Project Manager sets goals and continually reviews the progress of construction with a focus on maintaining schedule and budget. During construction, the Project Manager also orchestrates the coordination required with all other team members and organizations with ancillary project responsibilities, such as the Design Studio, Facilities, IT, Environmental Health & Safety, Radiation Safety, Infection Prevention and Control, Life Safety, Clinical Engineering and Security; as well as interior designers and other specialty consultants. During this phase the A/E Team is responsible for helping the Contractor build the project as specified in the NYU Langone-approved Construction Documents. This is done through coordination with NYU Langone and the builder, inspection of physical \"as-built\" conditions and review of project documents prepared by the Contractor.

NYU Langone Health - Design Guidelines SPACE PLANNING Real Estate Development and Facilities 54 2023 SPACE PLANNING RED+F has developed this subsection based on space p lanning layouts that we have found to be successful at NYU Langone Health. Our goal in providing this information is to streamline the design process by providing the Architect and Interior Designer pertinent information they can u se during the programming and planning phases of a project. The information provided includes: 1. Floor Area Definitions 2. Planning Definitions 3. Formulas and Ratios 4. Space Types by Staff Title 5. Typical Room Sizes and Furniture Layouts This information does not relieve the Architect or I nterior Designer of designing a project that is code compliant and appropriate to the needs of the user. The Architect and Interior Designer may suggest other room and furniture layouts if they believe the proposed layouts support our mission, design principles, and the design intent of the project. 1. F loor Area Definitions The Architect and Interior Designer shall provide fl oor area information to NYU Langone based on the following definitions: Gross Square Feet (GSF) - Floor area measured to the outside face of a build ing's exterior walls. GSF shall include the exterior wall thickness and all vertical penetrations (i.e. mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and elevator shafts, stairwells, etc.), as well as basements and garages. Gross Departmental Square Feet (GDSF) - The floor area for each department shall be m easured from the outside face of a building's exterior walls, the centerline of shared walls and to the corridor side of corridor walls. Building and Floor Common Elements shall be apportioned based on the percentage of the floor occupied by each department. In cases where the department occupies an entire floor of a building the GSF shall be used. Usable Square Feet (USF) - Gross floor area less Building Common Elements. For multi- tenant/department floors, Floor Common Elements shall be apportioned based on the percentage of the floor occupied by each tenant/department. (per REBNY) Net Square Feet (NSF) - The area occupied by each identified program space measured to the centerline of interior partitions. Examples of such spaces include individual workspaces (i.e. workstations and offices), dedicated support spaces (i.e. conference rooms), shared support spaces (i.e. shared copier rooms, break rooms, etc.) and special mission-critical spaces (i.e. exam rooms, laboratories, etc.). Note: Building Common Elements, Floor Common Elements, and primary and secondary circulation are not included. NYU Langone Health - Design Guidelines SPACE PLANNING Real Estate Development and Facilities 55 2023 Building Common Elements - The building core and common elements include portio ns of a building that serve all tenants . Such items, inclusive of their nominal 4\" enclosing walls, include equipment/utility rooms (i.e. mechanical, electrical and telecom rooms serving the entire building), HVAC shafts, telecom / electrical distribution shafts, elevator shafts, public stairwells, etc. (per REBNY) Floor Common Elements - The floor common elements include portions of a floo r that serve all tenants of that floor . Such items, not inclusive of their enclosing walls, include corridors, common toilets, shared supply rooms, etc. (per REBNY) 2 . Planning Definitions The Architect and Interior Designer shall provide pl anning information/calculations to NYU Langone based on the following definitions: Max. Allowable Occupancy - Maximum occupancy of a space as calculated per the Building Code(s). Note: The A/E Team needs to calculate the maximum allowable occupancy within a space per the Building Code(s) based on several factors including but not limited to egress stair widths, exit door widths, plumbing fixture counts, etc. Workplace Seating (WPS) - Seating designated for use by a single employee. T his can be located within an open area or in an enclosed room as described below. Total workplace seating represents the total number of employees in a particular department. o Open Workplace Seating - Seating designated for use by a single employee in an open area. This is a permanent seat such as a: - Workstation - Bench - Reception o Enclosed Workplace Seating - Seating designated for use by a single employee in an enclosed room such as a: - Private Office Collaboration Seating - Seating available for use by a group of employees and/or visitors. This can be located within an open area or in an enclosed room as described below: o Open Collaboration Seating - Seating available for use by a group of employees and/or visitors in an open area. Examples of such seating include: - Waiting Areas - Pantries - Open Collaboration areas o Enclosed Collaboration Seating - Seating available for use by a group of employees and/or visitors in an enclosed room. Examples of such seating include: - Quiet Rooms - Discussion Rooms - Conference Rooms - Training Rooms - Multi-Purpose Rooms NYU Langone Health - Design Guidelines SPACE PLANNING Real Estate Development and Facilities 56 2023 3. Formulas and Ratios The following information is intended to assist the Architect and Interior Designer during the planning and programming phases. The Architect and Interior Designer must also factor in circulation and support spaces (i.e. copy rooms, filing rooms, storage closets, lactation rooms, etc.) into their design. USF = GSF - (Building Common Elements) USF / WPS = USF \u00f7 Total # Anticipated WPS N ote: On average Administrative spaces should result in a USF / WPS of 100-150 sf. Ratio of Open WPS = # of Open WPS \u00f7 Total # of WPS N ote: On average Administrative spaces should result in a Ratio of Open WPS of 75- 85%. Ratio of Workplace Seats to Collaboration Seats: Note: Administrative spaces have the following appro ximate ratios based on seating types for a department: - Workplace Seating : Collaboration Seating = 1 : 0.6 to 1 : 1 - Encl. Workplace Seating : Open Workplace Seating = 1 : 2.8 to 1 : 5.4 - Encl. Collaboration Seating : Open Collaboration Seating = 1 : 0.3 to 1 : 0.4 - Workplace Seating : Enclosed Collaboration Seating = 1 : 0.4 to 1 : 0.6 - Workplace Seating : Open Collaboration Seating = 1 : 0.2 to 1 : 0.5 - Workplace Seating : Pantry Seating = 1 : 0.2 to 1 : 0.3 - Open Workplace Seating : Lockers = 1 : 1 to 1 : 1.5 - Workplace Seating : Waiting = 1 : 0.05 to 1 : 0.1 Legend: USF = Usable Square Feet GSF = Gross Square Feet WPS = Workplace Seats NYU Langone Health - Design Guidelines SPACE PLANNING Real Estate Development and Facilities 57 2023 4.

NYU Langone Health - Design Guidelines ERGONOMICS Real Estate Development and Facilities 91 2023 ERGONOMICS NYU Langone Health is committed to providing a healt hy work environment where our patients, visitors, students and staff are healthy, safe, comfortable and productive. In line with that effort RED+F has developed this subsection in collaboration with NYU Langone's Occupational & Industrial Orthopedic Center (OIOC) to encourage Architects and Interior Designers to consider user body size, strength and range of motion as well as surrounding environmental factors in the design of our projects. The information provided includes: 1 . Ergonomic Design Considerations 2. Helpful Resources This information does not relieve the Architect or I nterior Designer of designing a project that is code compliant and appropriate to the needs of the user. The Architect and Interior Designer may suggest layouts and products not shown in these guidelines if they believe the proposed layouts and products support our mission, design principles, and the design intent of the project. 1. E rgonomic Design Considerations When applying ergonomics, the Architect and Interior Designer shall consider the nature of the user (physical body dimensions and any individual limitation), the type of task(s) they perform, the layout of the workspace, the work organization, and the equipment/tools used. The primary focus is to create the most efficient and injury-free interface between people and the tools and technology they use. The Architect and Interior Designer shall consider th e following: Human Body - T he Architect and Interior Designer should familiarize themselves with anthropometric data, which provides a good understand ing of body measurement variation and movement limitation for the main user population. Having a good grasp of this information will allow the A/E Team to provide for appropriate: - Clearances (i.e. headroom, elbow room, legroom, etc.) between the body and surrounding objects, https://slideplayer.com/slide/3410524/ NYU Langone Health - Design Guidelines ERGONOMICS Real Estate Development and Facilities 92 2023 - Reach towards objects and equipment allowing for placemen t and adjustment of these items in appropriate reach zones, and https://www.bostontec.com/ergonomics/ - Posture , promoting healthy and safe body positioning throug h responsible furniture layouts and selection. https://www.joionline.net/library/show/ergonomics_in_the_workplace/ NYU Langone Health - Design Guidelines ERGONOMICS Real Estate Development and Facilities 93 2023 NYU Langone Health - Design Guidelines ERGONOMICS Real Estate Development and Facilities 94 2023 Further, Architects and Interior Designers should un derstand that most designed furniture targets the 5th - 95th percentile of users, or 90% of the user population. This means that the expectation is that their designs meet the needs of 90% of our users. For the 10% of users outside of this range, NYU Langone will assess the workspace, as requested, and provide recommendations to the end user. Architects and Interiors Designers should integrate adjustability and flexibility into their furniture layouts and selections. https://www.bostontec.com/ergonomics/ Environment - T he Architect and Interior Designer should keep the following items in mind during design, including relevant code requirements and industry standards: - Light - To minimize end-user eye strain Architects and Inter ior Designers should ensure that artificial lighting is not too bright, natural light does not impede the use of equipment such as computer or digital screens, glare is minimized from both artificial and natural sources, and task lighting is provided accordingly. The use of proper lighting equipment and controls as well as window drapes and shades should be integrated into the design. - Ventilation - Architects and Interior Designers should ensure tha t users have adequate fresh-air ventilation and heating or cooling so that they feel comfortable when working. - Noise - Noise can cause stress leading to tensed muscles in creasing the risk of injury. Architects and Interior Designers should locate and arrange workstations to allow for quiet surroundings around work areas, wherever possible. 2 .

NYU Langone Health - Design Guidelines ROOM FINISHES Real Estate Development and Facilities 95 2023 ROOM FINISHES In accordance with both our Mission devoted to excel lence in patient care, education, and research and our Design Principles of providing timeless designs that are cost effective, efficient, functional and practical, RED+F has developed a palette of typical materials and finishes that we have found to be successful for various spaces at NYU Langone Health. Our goals in listing these materials and finishes are to: Streamline the design process Assist the Architect and Interior Designer with spec ifying materials Comply with the Practice Greenhealth Healthcare Without Harm: Safer Chemicals Challenge, eliminating the use of formaldehyde, perfluorinated compounds, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), antimicrobials, and all flame retardants from all materials and finishes Create spaces that are timeless, durable, easily mai ntainable and cost-effective Create a consistent NYU Langone brand T he Architect and Interior Designer should use this as a guide for specifying the finishes on NYU Langone capital projects. This information does not relieve the Architect or Interior Designer of specifying materials that are appropriate and code compliant for specific spaces. The Architect and Interior Designer shall consider specifying existing building-specific standards provided they are in line with these Design Guidelines. Also, the Architect and Interior Designer may suggest other materials and finishes if they believe those proposed materials and finishes will support our mission, design principles, and the design intent of the project.

Our goals in listing these materials and finishes are to: Streamline the design process Assist the Architect and Interior Designer with spec ifying materials Comply with the Practice Greenhealth Healthcare Without Harm: Safer Chemicals Challenge, eliminating the use of formaldehyde, perfluorinated compounds, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), antimicrobials, and all flame retardants from all materials and finishes Create spaces that are timeless, durable, easily mai ntainable and cost-effective Create a consistent NYU Langone brand T he Architect and Interior Designer should use this as a guide for specifying the finishes on NYU Langone capital projects. This information does not relieve the Architect or Interior Designer of specifying materials that are appropriate and code compliant for specific spaces. The Architect and Interior Designer shall consider specifying existing building-specific standards provided they are in line with these Design Guidelines. Also, the Architect and Interior Designer may suggest other materials and finishes if they believe those proposed materials and finishes will support our mission, design principles, and the design intent of the project. Recommended manufacturers and products for specific applications have been provided in the following categories: A. Flooring B. Base C. Wall Finish D. Doors and Door Frames E. Ceilings F.

The NYU Langone Health Art Program and Collection is integrated into the daily life of our organization providing a life-affirming, healing and supportive environment for patients, families, caregivers, students, faculty and staff. This is achieved through acquisitions, exhibitions, donations of art and other related visual arts programming. Acquisitions meet overall quality standards with the aim that the art collection appreciates in value over time. 1. I mportance of Art in a Healthcare Environment O ver the past decade, art has become an integral component in healthcare environments. As indicated in the State of the Field Report: Arts in Healthcare/2009 survey, nearly half of all healthcare institutions reported having arts in healthcare programs with the majority of these in hospital settings. Studies have shown that these programs improve patients' overall health outcomes, treatment compliance and quality of life, and foster a positive environment for caregivers that reduces stress and improves workplace satisfaction and employee retention.

Means of Selecting Art T he Design Studio's Art Group at RED+F identifies and acquires art through gallery visits, studio visits, recommendations as provided by museum curators, art critics and contemporary art historians and Calls to Artists as posted on visual art websites (New York Foundation for the Arts, Public Arts Network, etc.) 3. C apital Construction Projects Many capital construction projects provide excellent opportunities to integrate art into the design of these new facilities. Emphasis will focus on public spaces with higher visibility resulting in greater impact. For patient areas, the inclusion and placement of artwork will be a calming distraction. Placement of artwork will also support wayfinding efforts. Goal is to create a singular vision and identity throughout an individual project through selection and placement of artwork. Selection of site-specific artwork will involve input from user-groups occupying the space. Art will be selected from a range of artists, from emerging to established.

Architect's Responsibilities Where art integration is part of the project scope, art selection will be the responsibility of the Design Studio's Art Group at RED+F. The A/E Team shall assist with identifying locations for art placement in a project including but not limited to the following: During Design Development, the architect will work with the Art Manager, Project Manager and users to identify potential locations for art. The A/E Team shall provide drawings sufficient to identify proposed art locations including plans, elevations and perspectives. The A/E Team will be responsible for keeping any walls that have been identified for artwork integration, free and clear of any and all electrical devices, room and directional signage, or other potentially distracting items. This includes electrical outlets, telephone/data outlets, light switches, thermostats, fire strobes, furniture, etc. The A/E Team shall ensure the art has proper lighting. NYU Langone Health - Design Guidelines ROOM NUMBERING, SIGNAGE & WAYFINDING Real Estate Development and Facilities 168 2023 ROOM NUMBERING, SIGNAGE & WAYFINDING The architect is required to use RED+F's assigned ro om numbers, and provide full design and programming services related to signage and wayfinding. The A/E Team shall follow the NYU Langone Wayfinding and Communications Standards Manual, available on the Real Estate Development and Facilities website at: http://nyulangone.org/vendor-information/design- guidelines. The manual specifies each signage type approved for use at NYU Langone Health facilities. For off-campus projects, the A/E Team shall follow these guidelines in conjunction with any building landlord requirements. 1 . Architect's Responsibilities T he architect shall submit the signed-off floor plans to the Space Planning and Management Group at RED+F who shall assign the room numbers. The architect shall insert these room numbers on the drawings. RED+F will not accept any other room numbers shown on the documents. Confirm the Room Number Prefix (if any) with the Design Studio's Signage/Wayfinding Group at RED+F. The architect shall use this Room Number Prefix to produce their signage programming documents. Confirm requirements for code required emergency/egress signage (i.e. stair and elevator fire egress maps and messaging) and health/safety signage (i.e. chemical, laboratory, hazardous material, radiation, etc.) with Environmental Health & Safety (EH&S) at RED+F. Present signage design options to the Signage/Wayfinding Group. Produce signage programming documents that include location plans and message schedules for review and approval by the Signage/Wayfinding Group. Review and approve shop drawings. Shop drawings are also to be forwarded to the Signage/Wayfinding Group for their review and approval. Punchlist installed signage in coordination with Signage/Wayfinding Group. Final acceptance of the signage in conjunction with the Signage/Wayfinding Group. Architects, or their consultant, shall be responsible for signage/wayfinding on capital projects. Where there is no architect, signage/wayfinding shall be the responsibility of the Signage/Wayfinding Group. The sign design package may be created by the Architect, a pre- approved signage consultant or one of the NYU Langone-approved signage vendors. If available, SignAgent shall be used to upload and share project documentation with NYULH and the signage fabricator/installer. When used, NYULH shall be granted visibility, access and full ownership permissions to any project documentation managed with SignAgent. NYU Langone Health - Design Guidelines ROOM NUMBERING, SIGNAGE & WAYFINDING Real Estate Development and Facilities 169 2023 2. Sign Planning and Programming Process There are five groups of signs comprising the NYU La ngone system: identification, directional, informational, regulatory, and pageantry. Before programming a facility's signs, the complete sign typology (contained within the NYU Langone Wayfinding and Communications Standards Manual) should be understood by the signage programmer. The following outlines a step-by- step approach for sign planning and programming. Analysis - When planning and programming signs the programme r shall know the architectural layout, be familiar with the day-to-day operations and activities of the end- users within the space and consider the perspective of first-time visitors. Whenever possible, it is recommended that the sign programmer(s) meet with end-users to review how the facility will function. The programmer should explore various visitor scenarios, and locate wayfinding decision points (both clear and obscure) along arrival and departure routes. Consider the route distances and turns from start to end point. Typical questions to ask: Where are the restricted-access areas, and for what reasons? Who are the visitors, and for what purposes? What kind of sign types are needed, and where? Visualization of the Space - The programmer should imagine a \"visitor-eye-view\" through the department. The programmer should enhance comprehension of the architectural character of the visitor experience, of walking the hallways, facing impaired sightlines, or seeking visual landmarks. High and low ceiling space should be noted, along with wall position and angle, both on first entry and closer approach. The programmer should visualize the look and feel of the spaces, and identify optimal sign locations for decision points, avoiding obstacles. If possible, the programmer should suggest the architect revisit particular design details to accommodate sign locations. Typical questions to ask: Are doors or walls opaque or transparent? What color is the wall finish behind reception, and how tall? Is there any art or furniture nearby when determining placement of signage? Are there any devices (electrical outlets, light switches, thermostats, fire alarm strobes, etc.) or other signs nearby that should be considered when determining placement of signage (with respect to height, alignment, etc.)? Programming Documentation & Clarification - The programmer should issue documents f or sign vendors to produce message layouts and shop drawings. Draft documents should be submitted to the RED+F PM, end-user representative, and the Design Studio's Signage/Wayfinding Group at RED+F for approval and comments. A unique sign number shall designate floor/location ID (if applicable), designation ID and sign type ID. Typical questions to ask: What is the proper name of the facility? Are there any donor recognition signs?

SEATING In order to create and maintain a consistent brand a nd allow appropriate maintenance at NYU Langone Health spaces, specific furniture and accessory items are used. The list below will give the A/E Team a sense of the typical seating used at NYU Langone facilities. It is the Architect's responsibility to select items that are code compliant and appropriate for the capital project based on the type of space and end-user needs. The Architect and Interior Designer shall consider s pecifying existing building-specific standards provided they are in line with these Design Guidelines. Architects shall coordinate with the RED+F Project M anager and the Design Studio to finalize seating selections. The images shown are for illustrative purposes only and may not be a reflection of a project's final specification. Please note the following requirements as they pertain to seating: All task seating selections must allow for ergonomic adjustments, such as adjustable arm heights, seat depths, seat heights, etc. Provide seating selections with hard casters for carpeted areas and soft casters for hard floor surface areas. 20% of all seating in Waiting Areas must meet Bariatric seating requirements. Mesh and upholstery shall be PVC-free. Consider silica as an alternative upholstery fabric. Foam shall be formaldehyde-free. Use manufacturer's graded in upholstery for items identified as Cost-saving Alternatives. Cost-saving Alternatives: The RED+F PM will advise the A/E Design Team if items identified as Cost-saving Alternatives shall be allowed on their project.

NYU Langone Health - Design Guidelines RECYCLING PROGRAM Real Estate Development and Facilities 281 2023 RECYCLING PROGRAM NYU Langone Health has instituted a system-wide recy cling program to reduce our waste to landfill, meet our sustainability goals and comply with updated NYC Local Law 87 rules for business recycling. We want to ensure staff, residents and visitors are able to recycle required materials, that the integrity of our recycling program is maintained and that waste and recycling are properly handled by our private carters. In line with that commitment we are providing additional information about NYU Langone's Recycling Program organized as follows: 1. General Recycling Program Requirements 2. Specific Recycling Program Requirements 3. Signage Requirements 4. Decal Requirements 5. Locations for Trash and Recycling Receptacles 6. Trash and Recycling Receptacle Specifications 1. G eneral Recycling Program Requirements NYU Langone has determined that centralized sorting of trash and recyclables and movement away from individualized collection is the preferred methodology. DSNY rule of thumb: Wherever there is a trash bin, there should also be recycling bin(s). When specifying trash and recycling receptacles, the A/E Team shall: Confirm project recycling procedures, including any landlord or building requirements. NYU Langone has chosen to pursue source-separated recycling. DSNY defines source- separated recycling collection as: \"The practice of separating the two designated recyclable \"streams\" from each other and from garbage. These three streams must be kept separate from the point of generation (where staff/customers place an item in a receptacle) until the materials are placed out for collection. Your carter is then required to collect the three streams with three separate trucks or in three separate compartments in a truck.\" The three streams include: - Trash | Waste | Landfill - Paper | Cardboard | Paperboard Recycling - Metals | Glass | Plastics | Beverage Cartons Recycling Provide adequate space on the plans for trash and recycling receptacles to be located in discreet areas (i.e. niches, alcoves, built-in millwork, etc.), but still convenient to staff and visitors. Select container gallon capacities appropriate to the designation, size and type of activity occurring within the space the receptacles serve. Avoid oversized bins (i.e. C linical facilities shall receive receptacles that are no more than 32 gal. per container ). F or Storage and Hauling, the regulation makes it illegal for any hauler to collect recyclables and trash in the same truck. Therefore, the infrastructure to keep these streams separated from point of generation to hauling must be provided by NYU Langone. Project Teams must ensure adequate storage space and loading dock configuration for NYU Langone Health - Design Guidelines RECYCLING PROGRAM Real Estate Development and Facilities 282 2023 separated trash and recycling. It can be in the same room or on the same dock, but must be clearly separated with its own signage and labeling. Consider predicted waste volume and the activity happening in the space. Helpful Resources: - City of New York Department of Sanitation - www1.nyc.gov/assets/dsny/site/home - https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dsny/docs/commercial-recycling-notice-english.pdf - AIA \"Zero Waste Design Guidelines\" 2. S pecific Recycling Program Requirements When specifying trash and recycling receptacles, the A/E Team shall: For Private Offices and Work Stations, do not provide deskside bins. Should staff or departmental representatives opt to have deskside bins 1 \"paper only\" receptacle shall be provided under desk. Deskside bins for items other than \"paper only\" are not permitted. For Open Work Areas: - Provide centralized trash and recycling receptacles placed no more than 50'-0\" apart so that staff walk a maximum of 25'-0\" in either direction to access the nearest receptacle. - Calculate the capacity using the following as a minimum guideline: 1 person = 1 gallon trash + 1 gallon metal-glass-plastic + 1 gallon paper Provide compost receptacles at Caf\u00e9s, Cafeterias and Pantries if composting is available at the site. These receptacles shall be in addition to trash and recycling. Inclusion of a sink for disposing of liquids prior to sorting of waste is encouraged. For Back-of-House Areas, coordinate trash and recycling receptacle specification and locations with the Design Studio, appropriate maintenance department (i.e. Building Services, Environmental Services, etc.) and end-user during the Design Development phase. Trash and recycling receptacles shall be procured by the RED+F PM either as part of the furniture package or directly from an NYULH-approved commercial maintenance products vendor. While trash and recycling built into millwork is part of the millwork package it is the responsibility of the RED+F PM to procure the specified internal rigid liner.For Confidential Paper Recycling, HIPAA paper should always be kept separate for shredding as part of NYU Langone's existing HIPAA shredding program. For Universal Waste Recycling, all universal waste shall be stored in accordance with EH&S safety policies and then recycled by either EH&S or MCIT. For Lab Glass, appropriate bins shall be made available to NYU Langone labs for lab glass collection separate from the recycling program. NYU Langone Health - Design Guidelines RECYCLING PROGRAM Real Estate Development and Facilities 283 2023 3. Signage Requirements There are a variety of different signs required for the Recycling Program at NYU Langone Health. The A/E Team and RED+F PM shall coordinate signage fabrication and installation with NYU Langone Design Studio's Signage/Wayfinding Group as part of the capital project. The signs shall be located as follows: Exterior - Business Integrity Commission (BIC) hauler decals shall be displayed where they are visible from the outside of a building (if owned, leased by or occupied exclusively by NYU Langone) or tenant space (if leased by NYU Langone and we provide our own waste hauling). BIC decals are supplied by the contracted waste hauler. To obtain BIC decals coordinate with either Environmental Services or Building Services. BIC decals shall be aligned to architectural elements and placed in lower corners of storefront windows away from entry doors. BIC decals shall not be placed adjacent to entry doors, unless it cannot be avoided. Recommended locations, listed in order of highest to lowest preference, are loading docks and exterior waste storage areas, exterior building entries and interior tenant entries. Public Areas (w/o Composting) - The following signage shall be posted wherever tra sh and recycling centers are provided. Signs shall be printed on Sintra and installed with the bottom edge 3\" above the trash and recycling center's top surface.

NYU Langone Health - Design Guidelines ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH & SAFETY Real Estate Development and Facilities 325 2023 ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH & SAFETY NYU Langone Health's Environmental Health and Safety (EH&S) division develops and manages programs that (1) protect personnel in all departments and on all levels from health and safety hazards, (2) ensure waste is discarded in an environmentally sound manner and (3) facilitate compliance with regulatory requirements for environmental and occupational health and safety. EH&S's programs cover a broad spectrum of health and safety issues, including but not limited to: asbestos, biosafety, bulk storage tanks, chemical safety, ergonomics, fire safety, hazard communication, hearing conservation, indoor air quality, laboratory and animal safety, mold prevention and remediation, and waste management. 1. A rchitect's Responsibilities The A/E Team, to the best of their ability, shall in corporate Best Management Practices for environmental and occupational health and safety into the design of the space. The A/E Team responsibilities include: Anticipating, identifying and eliminating potential health and safety hazards (i.e. ergonomics, hazardous materials, noise, etc.) associated with the proposed use of the space, to the extent reasonably practical. Note: Eliminating hazards is not intended to limit creativity, but to ensure the designer minimizes foreseeable risks to the health and safety of those who: - Carry out construction work, including demolition. - May be affected by the project, including building occupants and the general public. - Occupy the space post-construction. - Clean and maintain the space. Specifying the least toxic, flammable/combustible and reactive products available for construction and renovation. Where health and safety hazards cannot be eliminated, proposing alternate engineering controls to minimize or eliminate the risk. The A/E Team shall use and comply with the design and safety regulations, guidelines and references listed in the References subsection below, as well as other health and safety guidelines received from NYU Langone's Project Manager or division of EH&S. The A/E Team shall utilize the latest editions of the references available at the time of the design contract award. If the design does not incorporate Best Management Practices for environmental and occupational health and safety, and comply with the References listed below, the A/E design firm shall obtain approval from NYU Langone's division of EH&S. The A/E Team shall not specify any of the following without approval from NYU Langone's division of EH&S: - Chemical products containing known (IARC group 1) or probable (IARC group 2a) human carcinogens*. - Chemical products containing toxic and hazardous substances listed in OSHA 1910 subpart Z*. NYU Langone Health - Design Guidelines ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH & SAFETY Real Estate Development and Facilities 326 2023 - C hemical products containing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in excess of 50 grams/liter. - Chemical products for which the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) rates the health, fire or reactivity hazard as greater than \"1\" (slight hazard) on the NFPA/HMIS scale or as less than \"4\" (slight hazard) on the GHS hazard scale. - Chemical products which emit strong odors. * Exceptions may be made for products containing chemicals which do not pose a hazard to persons during their application/use (i.e. paints containing silica). In order to minimize potential delays associated with asbestos abatement, the A/E Team shall submit a set of Design Development Drawings that identify the scope of work including 100% complete Demolition Drawings. The Demolition Drawings shall provide sufficient information to initiate an asbestos investigation and pull a demolition permit. The Demolition Drawings submitted shall be the same drawings that are filed with the DOB. The A/E Team shall confirm requirements for code required emergency/egress signage (i.e. stair and elevator fire egress maps and messaging) and health/safety signage (i.e. chemical, laboratory, hazardous material, radiation, etc.) with Environmental Health & Safety (EH&S) at RED+F. 2.

As a healthcare organization, it is imperative that we act as a community leader in environmental stewardship. Creating a vital and healing environment is also central to our mission devoted to excellence in patient care, education, and research and is integral to the comfort and lifelong wellness of our staff, students and patients. This sustainability commitment extends across every facet of NYU Langone, including how we design, construct and operate our facilities. Furthermore, the health system recognizes the risks associated with climate change and has committed to being a carbon neutral health system by 2050 with an interim 50% carbon reduction goal by 2030. The goal of NYU Langone's sustainability program is to fulfill a quadruple bottom line approach where decision-making is based on balancing the potential impacts on people, the planet, business economics and patient care. The goal is not only to design green buildings and use environmentally-preferable materials, but to augment our benefit to the community and reduce the negative environmental and human wellness impacts of operations once occupied. Teams should ensure projects exemplify our key sustainability pillars of emissions mitigation, adaptation and resiliency to climate change, health promotion and demonstration of leadership. In line with that commitment we are providing additional information about NYU Langone's sustainability program organized as follows: 1. Sustainable Building Design Guidelines 2. Green Roof and Solar PV Guidelines 3. Sustainable Furniture and Furnishings Guidelines 4. Sustainable Flooring Guidelines 5. Bicycle Transportation Guidelines 6. Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Guidelines 7. Building Energy Efficiency Rating Label Guidelines 8. Related Components or Policies More can be read about the scope and progress of NYU Langone's sustainability program, called GreenFirst, at http://nyulangone.org/our-story/sustainability. 1. Sustainable Building Design Guidelines For all n ew construction and major renovation (more than 25,000 square feet or projects that include significant MEP scope) , NYU Langone has instituted a goal of achieving Gold or higher level certification under the LEED v4 or v4.1 ratings system. Projects should assess the appropriate project type including BD+C, ID+C or others that may apply. Designers are to discuss the LEED and energy performance requirements with RED+F Project Managers from the outset and to follow an integrative design process. Where achievement of these goals presents significant hurdles for a project, the requirements should be discussed with the RED+F Project Manager, RED+F Leadership, and the Energy & Sustainability Program Manager early during the design process. Good communication of goals, requirements and challenges will help all projects achieve the highest levels of performance and innovation while containing costs. NYU Langone Health - Design Guidelines ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY Real Estate Development and Facilities 328 2023 Designers shall assist NYU Langone Health with prepa ration of the Owner's Project Requirements (OPR). The OPR shall outline the Project's environmental and sustainability goals and measures, waste and recycling requirements, energy performance requirements, and other system expectations. A template OPR can be provided by the Energy & Sustainability Program Manager. It shall be reviewed and approved by the RED+F PM and the Energy & Sustainability Program Manager. This information is mandatory for LEED certification and will be reviewed by the commissioning agent. If an option, projects must also complete a NYSERDA or whole building energy model simulation as part of meeting its LEED goals and take advantage of available funding or incentives for this work. This can include utility, State or Federal incentives including those outlined for either direct pay or Tax Credit (through the design professional) in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. In addition, projects that are 25,000 sq. ft. or greater and within New York City shall comply with Local Law 97. Such projects shall include a review of energy performance, carbon emissions and life cycle costs. The life cycle cost review shall include energy costs, operating costs and potential future LL97 or other penalties using a moderate approach to carbon coefficients after 2034. The A/E Team may consult with the Energy & Sustainability team regarding reasonable assumptions, space type assignments, campus carbon accounting, and any other aspects of LL97 as needed. For fit-outs, interior-only and smaller projects , the LEED and energy goals should be discussed with the RED+F Project Manager, RED+F Leadership, and the Energy & Sustainability Program Manager at the outset of the design process to establish requirements and goals on a case by case basis. Other guidelines or certification standards that NYU Langone encourages project developers to take into consideration include the WELL Building Standard, the NYC Active Design Guidelines: Promoting Physical Activity and Health in Design, the CDC's Fitwel standard, My Green Labs certification and resources from the International Institute for Sustainable Laboratories (www.i2SL.org). NYU Langone believes that LEED and green buildings aim to protect, restore and work in harmony with the local environment, existing transit infrastructure and underlying natural systems. In general, green buildings are energy efficient, water conserving, durable and nontoxic, with high-quality spaces that incorporate nature. NYU Langone seeks to integrate the following features of well-designed green buildings where possible and applicable: Demonstrate resiliency and adaptability in response to a changing climate and extreme weather events. Incorporate passive design strategies and maximize use of energy efficient infrastructure and renewable energy sources (with or without energy storage). Reduce or eliminate reliance on fossil fuels to reach carbon emissions reduction targets. Minimize building stormwater runoff by incorporating green roofs, gardens, permeable pavers, bioswells and other green infrastructure (GI) or low-impact development (LID) techniques as well as maintain compliance with NYC LL94 where applicable. Use native and adaptive plants that minimize landscaping and irrigation needs. NYU Langone Health - Design Guidelines ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY Real Estate Development and Facilities 329 2023 I ncorporate green and open spaces and provide access to the outdoors for patients and staff. Incorporate facilities and design that encourage the use of alternative transportation methods, particularly biking and public mass transit. Maximize use of natural lighting and provide views to the outside. Reduce impact of noise and vibration through use of professional acoustical analysis and design services. Provide for improved indoor air quality and minimize the use of chemicals of concern to increase the productivity of staff and reduce recovery time for patients. Minimize or eliminate the use of mercury-containing materials where safe, effective alternatives exist in compliance with NYU Langone Health Safety Policy 170. Focus on material health. This includes compliance with the Practice Greenhealth Healthcare Without Harm: Safer Chemicals Challenge, eliminating the use of formaldehyde, perfluorinated compounds, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), antimicrobials, and all flame retardants from all materials and finishes. Focus on material and product circularity. This includes materials and products that incorporate recycled, local and renewably sourced materials, and can be reused or upcycled at the end of life Provide well-incorporated waste and recycling segregation and bins using the built environment to encourage proper recycling behavior in occupants (see the Recycling Program subsection of these Design Guidelines) Support occupant mental and emotional health by implementing design strategies to ensure they are informed about their environment and have access to a variety of relaxation and social spaces. An integrative design approach and a life cycle assessment approach are both essential to meet these guidelines and marry green building with sustainable operations and resiliency for the life of the facility. Finding synergies between the built environment and eventual operations is an important concept. For example, incorporation of a green roof feature can provide insulation and lower energy needs, help manage stormwater runoff on the campus and reduce the heat island effect in the NYC community. Or designing with the understanding that the flooring material used not only has an embedded energy, carbon and natural resource footprint, but that the type of material used impacts how the facility needs to be cleaned post-occupancy. Material decisions such as these can either facilitate or hinder a reduction in chemical and water usage as part of green cleaning practices. Or designing into the built environment smart waste sorting stations that cater to the type of activity (research, clinical or office) taking place in each space can ultimately drive employees to practice good recycling behaviors. By using an integrative project approach that brings in multiple stakeholders from the outset, project teams can more readily discover synergies and areas for true innovation. NYU Langone Health - Design Guidelines ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY Real Estate Development and Facilities 330 2023 2. Green Roof and Solar PV Guidelines New York City Local Laws 92 and 94 of 2019 require a ll new and existing buildings undergoing major roof construction or renovation to have a green roof system, solar photovoltaic system, or a combination of both. The regulation also requires projects to meet new, higher solar reflective index (SRI) requirements. Examples of projects affected include new construction, vertical or horizontal building extensions, and replacements of the entire roof deck or assembly. Even when not required by code, Architects are encouraged to consider implementation of green roofs, solar photovoltaics or both on NYU Langone projects to take advantage of the benefits of sustainable roof systems as outlined below: Achieve points under USGBC LEED standards Improve resiliency and backup generation Lower energy costs either through direct offset or through better building insulation Feed additional distributed energy resources and renewables back into the grid Reduce the urban heat island effect Manage stormwater and runoff 3. S ustainable Furniture and Furnishings Guidelines NYU Langone has committed to the Practice Greenhealt h Healthcare Without Harm: Safer Chemicals Challenge, which impacts furniture purchasing and design decisions. This goal means that at all purchases of freestanding furniture and medical furnishings1 for any individual project are to be specified without the intentional use of the following chemicals of concern: halogenated and brominated flame retardants2, formaldehyde, perfluorinated compounds, PVC (also known as vinyl) and antimicrobials3. Project teams should discuss with the RED+F Project Manager, RED+F Leadership, the RED+F Design Studio, and the Energy & Sustainability Program Manager throughout the process to meet these guidelines and evaluate feasibility. For all projects, regardless of the level of certification or LEED ratings system being pursued, NYU Langone also encourages the use of locally-sourced furniture and textiles, furniture that contains pre or post-consumer recycled content and the use of wood that is FSC-certified. Other standards or certifications to refer to include the ANSI/BIFMA e3 Furniture Sustainability Standard, SCS certified and Cradle to Cradle. Notes: 1 Furniture and medical furnishings include seating (i.e. chairs, stools, sofas, benches, etc.), worksurfaces (i.e. tables, desks, etc.), built-in and modular casework systems (i.e. walled desks with seating), beds (including mattresses), storage units (i.e. cabinets, filing cabinets, dressers, drawers, etc.), shelving (i.e. bookshelves, built-in shelves, etc.), panels and partitions, cubicle curtains, and window coverings. 2 Eliminate the intentional use of all flame retardants where code permits. When flame retardant chemicals are necessary to meet code requirements, use chemicals that meet GreenScreen Benchmark 3 or 4 of their equivalent. 3 Triclosan and triclocarban are explicitly prohibited. No other added or built-in chemical antimicrobials are allowed unless they are registered with the U.S. EPA under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), and have published data that show efficacy in a hospital/clinical setting measured by a reduction in healthcare-associated infections (HIAs) as part of comprehensive infection control measures. Antimicrobials added to materials or products for the sole purpose of preserving the product are exempt. NYU Langone Health - Design Guidelines ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY Real Estate Development and Facilities 331 2023 4. Sustainable Flooring Guidelines Some of the materials and chemicals used in flooring can make it a negative contributor to indoor air quality, lead to a wide range of adverse health effects including but not limited to asthma, cancer, and developmental impacts, and promote unsustainable cleaning practices. All capital projects, regardless of pursuit of requirements for LEED certification or other building rating systems, shall use flooring materials, coatings, and adhesives free of select chemicals of concern as dictated by Health Care Without Harm's Healthy Flooring criteria (minimum silver level rating). 5. B icycle Transportation Guidelines The NYU Langone Bicycle Transportation Policy seeks to foster a bike-friendly culture with bike commuter amenities such as parking, security, safety and bike registration. Inclusion of bike amenities shall be discussed with the RED+F Project Manager as well as representatives of the Real Estate team and the Sustainability Manager regardless of pursuit or requirements around LEED certification for a project as specified in these Design Guidelines. The Project shall provide adequate bike parking to meet end user daily demand. Bike Parking and Amenities - Indoor Bike Parking - When provided indoors, bike parking shall be within secure bike parking rooms for use by approved staff, faculty and students. These rooms shall be accessible through a keycard reader. For fit-outs within leased premises, the A/E Team shall follow the landlord's rules for the management of indoor bike parking/storage within NYU Langone's own premises. The Real Estate team can advise on a particular building's policies. - Outdoor Bike Parking - Outdoor bike parking may be located outside building entrances and exits, in parking lots or garage structures, within secure courtyards or on terraces. NYU Langone's preference is for outdoor bike parking to be covered or protected from the outside elements. - Bike Commuter Shower Facilities - If a project, particularly new construction, can accommodate male/female or a unisex individual shower facility, the A/E Team shall include them in the design. - Refer to the Building Accessories subsection of these Design Guidelines for bike rack specifications. 6. E lectric Vehicle Infrastructure Guidelines Capital projects involving NYU Langone-owned car par king lots and garages shall provide a minimum of 5% of total parking spots to have EV chargers installed and ready for use with NYU Langone preferred software. An additional 5% of total parking spots shall have EV chargers installed and/or be EV Ready with the necessary power infrastructure installed to meet future demand. The A/E Team and RED+F PM shall coordinate related signage fabrication and installation with NYU Langone Design Studio's Signage/Wayfinding Group as part of the capital project. This shall be discussed with the RED+F Project Manager as well as representatives of the Real Estate team and the Energy & Sustainability Program Manager. NYU Langone Health - Design Guidelines ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY Real Estate Development and Facilities 332 2023 7. Building Energy Efficient Rating Label Guidelines New York City Local Law 33 of 2018 and 95 of 2019 re quire the display of an energy efficiency score and grade provided annually by the New York City Department of Buildings.

NYU Langone Health - Design Guidelines SECURITY Real Estate Development and Facilities 337 2023 SECURITY Given its location in the heart of New York City, NY U Langone pays special attention to security in its facilities and operations. In order to bring existing and new locations undergoing renovations in line with our security standards, new security components are required to be installed as additions to existing security systems or completely new installations. Security system design and installation will require varied approaches depending on the Project Type as outlined below: 1. P roject Types Facilities with Existing Security Systems - In nearly all facilities that NYU Langone owns or l eases, there is an existing security system to which follow-on installations will link and we will use that vendor's equipment for the follow-on installation. The vendor of that equipment is the Security Vendor. The RED+F PM and the A/E Team will work with the Security Vendor to develop equipment placement requirements and will meet with NYU Langone's Security Department at key points during the design and construction process for their review of the security design. Among other things, the Security Department will review the equipment the Security Vendor proposes to use and the pricing. The Security Vendor will work under contract to the construction contractor. Facilities without Existing Security Systems - If the facility is new, there will not be an e xisting Security Vendor. Accordingly, the Architect shall provide security design services or shall engage the services of a Security Consultant (pre-approved by NYU Langone's Security Department) to provide such services and the Architect will be responsible for the services the Security Vendor would otherwise provide. The project team will work with RED+F's Project Support Office to determine how to procure the Security Vendor. Alternatively, RED+F may direct the use of an existing Security Vendor. 2. P roject Development and Design The following are required milestones for meetings w ith NYU Langone to determine security needs, develop scope and coordinate final recommendations: Schematic Design - During Schematic Design a meeting with the A/E Team , RED+F's PM, User-Group leadership and any additional stakeholder(s) of the new space shall be held. The purpose of the meeting is to review security needs for the project. Design Development - During the Design Development Phase, the Architec t shall provide Floor plans, Furniture plans, Reflected Ceiling plans and Door Hardware information to and meet with the Security Department and Security Vendor at the same time. The Architect will propose for Security Department approval a security system design that incorporates User-Group requests, Stakeholder requests, NYU Langone security standards and industry security standards. Construction Documents - During the Construction Document Phase, the Archi tect (through the RED+F PM) will organize a meeting of the A/E Team, Security Department, and RED+F's PM to review the proposed security solutions and seek Security Department approval thereof. The Security Vendor will provide the A/E Team with equipment cut NYU Langone Health - Design Guidelines SECURITY Real Estate Development and Facilities 338 2023 sheets, cabling and rough-in requirements. The A/E T eam will incorporate this information into the Construction Documents. A final meeting will be held with the A/E Team, Security Department, RED+F's PM, User-Group leadership and any additional stakeholder(s) of the new space to present the final coordinated security design. The decision for systems cabling responsibility will also be determined at this time. \"As-Built\" Documentation - The Architect shall provide the Security Vendor and Security Department with copies of the finalized \"As-Built\" in electronic form acceptable for import into BuildFlow. 3. G eneral Requirements for Security Design The Architect shall follow the security requirements listed below in the design of the project: Any code issues, such as fire and life safety, that affect security operations must be addressed by the Architect. Interior - Common spaces should not be isolated from entrances or stairs. - Consider location of permanent staff in multiple locations within spaces to limit possibility of unoccupied spaces that cannot be monitored. - Consider use of interior glazing and other strategies to improve visibility and accessibility. - If a security officer post is included in the design, consider sightlines from the seated position. Security access control and alarm systems on the superblock must be compatible and integrated with the existing system at the NYU Langone Security Operations Center. Systems off the superblock will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis as to their need to be tied into the existing system or if they can be stand-alone and tied into a central station for monitoring and subsequent response. Cameras are required at all lobbies, laundry rooms, cash handling areas, elevators, stair doors, entrance and egress doors, as well as any other areas as recommended by NYU Langone Health. All windows should be lockable. A/E Team should alert NYU Langone Health to security conditions that are not immediately apparent but would have operational impact, such as emergency egress doors that are on hold-opens. Areas of high security risk generally include where cash, narcotics, or retail operations are planned, as well as areas housing behavioral health (i.e. Psychiatry), Infant/Pediatric, Emergency Department, TBI (Traumatic Brain Injury) or ICU patients. These areas require greater access control, panic alarms and camera coverage. In some cases, specialized systems, such as Infant/Patient tracking and monitoring systems need to be incorporated into the design to include emergency card reader override buttons and one button lockdown feature as required. NYU Langone Health - Design Guidelines SECURITY Real Estate Development and Facilities 339 2023 I DF closets require Lenel security systems and IP camera installed within. Access will be controlled by the MCIT Department. Exterior - Lighting design must carefully consider appropriate light levels without compromising security. - Employ \"passive\" security design strategies such as avoiding dead-end spaces and blind corners, and areas that are isolated from foot traffic or out of sight. - Consider relationship of ground floor spaces to the exterior for sightlines and access to open windows and doors. - Where security officer posts are required, consider issues of congestion, sightlines, ADA compliance and the physical comfort (furniture and HVAC) of the personnel. 4. R elated Security Design Guidelines N YPD has published security guidelines entitled Engineering Security, Protective Design for High Risk Buildings. Where applicable these guidelines are to be referenced and utilized as necessary.

NYU Langone Health - Design Guidelines DOS AND DON'TS Real Estate Development and Facilities 346 2023 DOS AND DON'TS As part of our approach to continually improve the D esign and Construction process, we at RED+F maintain a running list of Dos and Don'ts. This is a detailed list of items that we have found to work well (or not work well) for NYU Langone Health capital construction projects. We have listed these items in the following order: Architectural Interior Design Medical & Lab Equipment AV/IT & A/E Team Coordination Architectural 1. Make sure patient room and patient toilet room saddles have no lip (not even code allowable 1/4\"). Patients cannot negotiate with IV pole. 2. Make sure there are bed stops in Patient Rooms. 3. Where wall mounted soap dispensers are used, place them above countertops instead of above floors, so any drippings go on the counter. 4. Do not specify storage cabinets under sinks; use ADA-compliant panels instead. The area under sinks should be clear. It will fail DOH survey if storage is located underneath. 5. Provide the construction budget and schedule to the A/E Team before start of design. The A/E Team needs to design within budgetary and time constraints. They can't do that without a budget and schedule. 6. Obtain user equipment lists and determine infrastructure requirements (i.e. power requirements) ASAP so a test fit can be performed. 7. Floating ceilings might require sprinkler coverage ON TOP of them. Check it. 8. Be sure that room numbering adheres to NYU Langone standards. Device schedules need to match (for Fire Alarm Programming). 9. The Tisch Ancillary building is a balloon frame construction. There is no fire-stopping between the slab and curtain wall. Design drawings to address this. Millhauser is similar. 10. Do not 'float' HIPPA divider panels between desks. Sandwich the panels tight to the desks with no gaps for added stability and to prevent pens, papers, etc. from falling through. 11. Add card readers to all clean supply rooms. 12. Make sure mounting height of ADA mirrors is specified for the bottom of the reflective surface to be 40\" AFF, not the mirror frame. 13. Camera locations need to be coordinated with the Security PM, Security vendor and the MCIT PM. 14. The Architect should do a file/storage survey during planning to make sure adequate file and storage space is factored into the design. NYU Langone Health - Design Guidelines DOS AND DON'TS Real Estate Development and Facilities 347 2023 15. P rovide electric locks for single doors and overhead electric strikes for glass doors. Avoid the use of maglocks whenever possible. 16. All interior finish and furniture drawings and specifications are to be uploaded to BuildFlow upon closeout. 17. MER doors to have Trilogy keypad locksets with T2 keyway. Must coordinate with NYU Langone locksmith. 18. Firestopping products shall not be used unless required for fire or smoke barriers. All firestopping must be performed by a certified tradespersons in firestopping, contracted under either the GC/CM. Making individual trades responsible for firestopping their own penetrations is not acceptable. They must use only Hilti products (unless otherwise allowed in the Design Guidelines), and must use UL-approved systems. A Special Inspection is required by NYC DOB and NYU Langone Facility Operations. 19. Cable trays are not to penetrate smoke or fire barriers. Cable trays are to stop at wall with cables traversing through EZ-Path devices, then resume with cable trays past penetration. Coordinate with MCIT PM. 20. Consideration must be given to additional data drop conduits and back boxes (with drag lines) to all rooms. Furniture layouts change, often times during construction, and the only drops in the room are behind furniture. This is especially the case with wall mounted computer work stations. Similarly, additional wall grounds are to be provided on a second wall in the event this location changes as well to avoid tearing open newly created walls. Interior Design 1. Coordinate power/data drops with under-counter pedestal files, etc. 2. M ake best efforts to marry up to a column / wall to reduce core drilling for power and data. 3. N o visible whips are allowed when connecting to workstations. 4. C oordinate cable management with furniture (V30 training room - cables hanging from desktops and visible). 5. P urchase construction cores on wall / door systems, not pre-keyed cores. The main campus locksmith will provide final cores. For off-campus facilities, engage a locksmith. 6. S pecify wardrobe closets in workstations and private offices whenever possible. Provide lockers elsewhere when this is not feasible. 7. G et signage requirements early to have permanent signage at opening. PM to provide the Signage / Wayfinding PM the project schedule. 8. S pecify and install coat hooks in each toilet stall, single occupancy restroom, private office, exam room, changing room, lactation room, wellness room, etc. 9. A void specifying products that require overseas delivery unless stocked in the United States. NYU Langone Health - Design Guidelines DOS AND DON'TS Real Estate Development and Facilities 348 2023 Medical / Lab Equipment 1. Do not provide UV lights as an option when ordering new Bio-Safety Cabinets for a lab or other type of project. 2. Do not specify direct-ducted bio-safety cabinets. Canopy connected A-2's with 70/30 air circulation are preferred. There are exceptions. Please review with EH&S before specifying. 3. Provide cabinets with side ports to allow tubing and wiring to be passed through the side as opposed to the front as a default. Review exceptions with EH&S before specifying. 4. Provide height adjustable biosafety cabinets as a default. Review exceptions with EH&S before specifying. AV/IT & A/E Team Coordination 1. A/E Team shall fully coordinate with the IT consultant engaged directly with NYU Langone. Refer to the Information Technology subsection for further information. 2. IT Engineer infrastructure specification needs to be placed on the \"E\" drawings so that the electrical contractor can buy and install. 3. No MEP Services should pass through the IDF rooms that are not servicing the room. 4. Cable trays to be shown on all A/E drawings and coordinated appropriately with MCIT and the contractors. \"Coordinate in field\" is not acceptable. 5. Define who will buy the server UPS, Electrical or Low Voltage contractor PRE-BID. 6. Determine the power requirement at the rack early in the project. 7. Define AV equipment credenza ventilation requirements. 8. Coordinate light fixture locations to avoid racks / ladder racks. Wall mounted lights are acceptable. 9. Multiple outlets mounted above rack. Specifications should come from IT designer. Place the information on the Electrical plans for electrician to install. 10. Provide UPS to the rack. IT designer to specify the UPS. Electrical drawings shall show the UPS to be bought. 11. Each IDF room gets its own electrical panel. Power panels are to have surge suppressors. 12. Security panels typically go in IDF rooms. They require power and data connection. Coordinate requirements with the MCIT PM. 13. Cable Trays are to be designed by the IT designer, shown on the Electrical drawings and bought by the electrical contractor. It is critical that the cable tray path is coordinated with the MEP systems. 14. Coordinate pathway for conduits to building main IT rooms (BMS). Architects should include some allowance for demolition, temporary protection, patching, firestopping, etc. in the architectural plans. Instructions to Engineer for preparing a design and specification: I. It shall be the Engineer's responsibility to follow these NYU Langone Health guidelines on all projects located on the main campus. For projects that are located off-campus, the Engineer shall follow these guidelines in conjunction with the building landlord's requirements. II. The information listed below is a guideline only. It shall be the Engineer's responsibility to conform to all appropriate building code requirements. III. All projects shall be designed in accordance with the applicable New York City Building Code, Mechanical Code, Fuel Gas Code, Fire Code, Energy Conservation Code, and the applicable standards referenced by these codes. IV. These Guidelines will be updated periodically and suggestions for updates may be made to the NYU Langone Project Manager. Requests and proposals for changes to the guidelines should be made in writing to a NYU Langone Project Manager assigned to the project who will forward such requests to RED+F Facilities Operations, as appropriate for review. RED+F Facilities Operations will advise the PM and Engineer in writing whether an exception to the Guidelines will be permitted or not.

Training must be done by qualified personnel with intricate knowledge of equipment and system and not by salesman. C. Mercury Elimination Program Compliance In an effort to protect patients, staff, researchers and the environment, it is the policy of NYU Langone Health to prohibit the use of mercury-containing equipment, materials and instrumentation where safe, effective alternatives exist. This program is outline in more detail in NYU Langone Health Safety Policy No. 170. Typical mercury-containing materials could include\u2014thermostats, switches, float controls and lamps. Approved suppliers with known mercury-free alternatives are identified herein, but this list should not be assumed to be complete. If a designer or engineer believes the use of mercury-containing materials (besides UV, florescent and LED light bulbs, ballasts and mercury-containing batteries, which are exempted) is mandatory, the need must be formally presented to the NYU Langone Health RED+F Facilities Operations Department to obtain express permission for its use prior to any deviation from this guideline. I. If permission for use of mercury-containing materials (besides UV, florescent and LED light bulbs, ballasts and mercury-containing batteries) is given by RED+F Facilities Operations then engineers, designers or installers must ensure the proper inventorying, reporting and safe handling of any mercury-containing materials and equipment. These requirements include: a. Labeling of Material - Proper \"mercury-containing material\" stick-on labels can be obtained from Facilities Operations (Greenberg Hall, SC2, Rm 122) b. Inventorying of Material - An inventory log of properly labeled materials/equipment with installation date and specific location must be submitted to Facilities Operations by the end of project as part of closeout documentation. c. Complying with all safe handling and disposal guidelines outlined by NYU Langone Health Environmental Health & Safety in its policies available on its website and referenced in contracts. D. Equipment Manufacturers U.S.-made is strongly preferred. Non US manufacturers will be considered. Example: Ventrol, Mammoth, Alliance Air, etc. E. Equipment Access All equipment shall be installed with manufacturer's recommended clearance or code required clearance for maintenance and repair. F. State, Federal & Utility Incentives Financial rebates and incentives may be available for select mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and energy management projects.

Rebates and incentives may be offered by, but not limited to, Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Long Island Power Authority, and New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA). G. Local Law 97 Compliance & Planning Projects within New York City must complete a life cycle cost review of Local Law 97 compliance and potential penalties based on project design. Any scenario planning around energy infrastructure must take into account amortized life cycle cost of future penalties using a moderate approach to carbon coefficients after 2034. This includes installations and upgrades to mechanical equipment that impact building energy use type and consumption, such as but not limited to: boilers, generators, chillers, and heat pumps. H. Engineering Dos and Don'ts 1. If an item is not included in the guidelines, follow up with facilities. 2. Confirm with RED+F PM team that Commissioning has been bought out to a third party to include specs in engineering subsections. This is a code requirement for Article 28 spaces. In addition, commissioning is a DOB requirement for non-Article 28, please reference the NYC Energy Code for specifics. 3. Design engineer to confirm with RED+F PM that a page turn has been setup with facilities at different stages of design (schematic, design development, contract drawings). 4.

Engineer to include on the \"E\" drawings. PM to confirm with the GC/CM. 24. Do not locate IT room HVAC equipment in ceilings of the rooms. Locate outside the rooms and duct in. Or use a split system and hang the evaporator on the wall and drain outside the room. 25. Use only concealed sprinkler heads, not recessed. 26. Specify tamperproof receptacles in all waiting rooms, regardless of the clinical function of the practice. 27. For laboratory equipment rooms, provide exhaust registers directly above heat generating equipment. 28. Include UL-approved pass-thru sleeves for future use in all smoke/fire partitions to prevent non-firestopped penetrations resulting from future cable pulls. 29. Thought must be given to redundancy for critical MEP systems. If a system loss will result in compromised patient safety or revenue loss to the institution, redundant systems need to be included in the design (i.e. emergency power, UPS, etc.) 30.

Below are a few examples: NYU Langone Health - Design Guidelines PHOTOGRAPHY Real Estate Development and Facilities 548 2023 NYU Langone Health - Design Guidelines POST-OCCUPANCY EVALUATIONS Real Estate Development and Facilities 549 2023 POST-OCCUPANCY EVALUATIONS RED+F is continually seeking to improve the Design a nd Construction process of the built environment and has established a Built Environment Improvement Cycle. The cycle, which consists of Design-Construction-Occupancy-Evaluation and back to Design, allows for continual improvement of the built environment by establishing a Post-Occupancy Evaluation phase. The Post-Occupancy Evaluation phase occurs after the users have moved in and utilized the space for a certain period of time, typically about a year. The intent of the Post-Occupancy Evaluation is to provide feedback on the design and general performance of materials and furniture over a period of time. The RED+F Design Studio performs the Post-Occupancy Evaluation. It is important the same group perform the evaluation in order to maintain a consistent basis of analysis between projects. Results of Post-Occupancy Evaluations are then used to inform Project Teams and update the Design Guidelines. For example, materials and furniture that are not holding up well are removed from the Design Guidelines. Materials and furniture that are not part of the Design Guidelines but were approved for a particular project and have been holding up well are considered for inclusion in the Design Guidelines. This process reduces maintenance costs and streamlines the Design process.
