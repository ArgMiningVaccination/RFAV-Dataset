Kindest Regards, Ms Maureen Connolly, Project ManagerNOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDY 5EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Health care is mainly about people - people receiving care and the people who give it. Over 50,000 Nova Scotians make theirliving working in the health industry. Seventy cents out ofevery dollar spent on health care goes to paying the wages,salaries and fees of health care providers. In spite of the sizeand importance of the health care workforce, government hastraditionally known relatively little about this vital humanresource. This report attempts to fill in a knowledge gap andassist in the creation of a foundation for Health HumanResource (HHR) planning. The Study of Health Human Resources in Nova Scotia is a Human Resources Development Canada (HRDC) funded projectinitiated in 2001 as a joint undertaking between the HealthCare Human Resource Sector Council (HCHRSC) and the NovaScotia Department of Health (DOH). A better understanding ofthe health care workforce provides the baseline for futureplanning of Nova Scotia's Human Resources for Health. Research for the report was conducted in consultation with employers, professional and provider associations,industry/labour organizations, universities, colleges andvarious other governments. The report provides acomprehensive picture of HHR in Nova Scotia, a snapshot ofthe number of people working in each health occupation andhealth care setting; education and training characteristics; age,gender and other demographics, and workplace injury andillness information. A total of 31 health occupations wereprofiled, including the 19 regulated professions. The report setsout the changing environment in which health care providersare operating in Nova Scotia- including regulatory changes,funding challenges, an aging population and new ways ofdelivering health care. This report also presents a compilationof professional and workplace issues, as viewed by NovaScotia's health occupations. Chapter One sets out the mandate, approach and methodology for the study. The mandate was to provide a detailed baselineassessment of Nova Scotia's HHR and identify emerging trendsand issues. The project methodology was adapted from aframework developed by Thomas Hall, and employed by theWorld Health Organization (WHO), which identifies the keyelements for optimizing HHR as: Workforce planning for short and long term needs; Production of the health care workforce through education and training; and Management of human resources to recruit and retain workers.An early discovery in the data collection process was a lack of reliable data on health workers. Because most organizationscould not provide the information needed to profile the healthworkforce, less than 20% of the data came from existingsources. The remaining 80% came from primary research inthe field. Data was gathered and processed in three categories - supply, education/training and management/employment.Quantitative supply data was obtained through regulatorybodies and health care provider associations, and from variousgovernment departments, such as, the Department of Healthand the Department of Community Services. From aqualitative perspective interviews were conducted with keyinformants to identify key HHR issues for each occupation. Collection of data on education/training involved meetings with administrators, department heads and faculty at theseven institutions responsible for delivering health educationand training programs in Nova Scotia. Data from theDepartment of Education and the Maritime Provinces HigherEducation Commission (MPHEC) was used to provide trenddata and to supplement more recent enrolment andgraduation information provided by the post-secondaryinstitutions. From a qualitative perspective, key informantinterviews were documented and reviewed for commonthemes. A validation process was undertaken involving theinstitutions, agencies and organizations which provided theinitial data. Professional and provider associations, and individual employers were consulted to obtain information on theemployment characteristics of health care workers. A templateof management/employment indicators was developed anddistributed for data collection to acute care and continuingcare facilities and organizations. Health workforceemployment information was also obtained from theManagement Information System (MIS) at the Department ofHealth, the Nova Scotia Association of Health Organizations(NSAHO), Human Resources Development Canada (HRDC), andthe Workers' Compensation Board (WCB). Chapter One ends with a discussion of some of the data challenges encountered and their likely impact for HHRplanning.6 NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDYChapter T wo reports briefly on the state of HHR planning provincially, nationally and internationally. It points out that atall levels planning has traditionally been limited to physiciansand nurses, with little attention paid to other healthoccupations and to the role of the unregulated and unpaidhealth care providers. A review of HHR planning in severalcountries released in March 2003 by the Canadian HealthServices Research Foundation (CHSRF) found that: All had partial approaches to planning, ignoring the relationships between health professionals; All have experienced cycles of shortages and surpluses of health professionals, usually nurses; Supply problems are perpetuated by poor access to information, weak management and no system of continuingeducation and re-accreditation; and Little attention is paid to the distribution of medical and nursing staff between specialties and regions. Governments in Canada formally recognized the issues surrounding HHR in September 2000 when first ministersagreed to coordinate their efforts on the supply of doctors,nurses and other health care personnel. This was followed upin 2001 when provincial premiers agreed to improve planningand co-operation on training and recruitment. A number ofnational HHR studies are underway, including a study ofphysicians by the Canadian Medical Forum, the three-phaseHome Care Resources Study and HRDC studies on nursing, oralhealth, pharmacy and social work. Despite this activity, both the Commission on the Future of Health Care in Canada (the Romanow Commission) and theSenate Committee on Social Affairs, Science and Technology(Kirby Committee) found that HHR planning in Canada isplagued with many of the same problems identifiedinternationally by the CHSRF, including: Inadequate consideration of population demographics and trends, the broader determinants of health, specific needs ofpatients or the skills and knowledge of health care providers Planning approaches are often based on one-time estimates focusing on a single discipline and policies often focus onquick-fix solutions; and Lack of planning often leads to over-use of casual and part time workers, potentially contributing to a decline inproductivity and one's work life. Both Romanow and Kirby called for coordinated national action to bring about better collection and dissemination ofinformation on trends in supply, distribution, mobility andworkforce composition. Governments were also urged to betterco-ordinate retention strategies, licensing and immigrationrequirements, and to devise strategies for increasing thesupply of health care professionals from under-representedgroups.Although national co-ordination is lacking, provincial governments, including Nova Scotia, have responded in similarways to shortages. Efforts have usually been directed at nursesand physicians, but the emergence of shortages in otheroccupations has led some jurisdictions to broaden theirefforts. The most common strategy by provinces has been toincrease funding for the education and training of moredoctors, nurses or allied health occupations. Incentives,including bursary and debt repayment plans, and return forservice agreements have been used to encourage enrolments.Relocation grants and signing bonuses have been employed toattract professionals into practicing in Nova Scotia. Morerecently, greater attention has been paid to quality of work lifeissues, especially as they relate to nurses and physicianspracticing in rural and remote communities. However, theeffectiveness of these various recruitment and retentionefforts are difficult to measure, since they have often beenimplemented without an evaluation framework. The report notes that since 2001 Nova Scotia and the other Atlantic Provinces have been taking a more comprehensiveapproach to HHR. Strategies have been devised to deal withshortages among physicians, nurses and other occupations(medical laboratory technologists, advanced care paramedics,and others), as part of a better understanding obtained fromrecent undertakings of HHR baseline assessments of majorhealth occupations in each province. In addition, the Atlanticprovinces are collaborating on a joint proposal to HRDC toconduct an in-depth examination of education and trainingcapacity and planning for health disciplines at the Atlantic level. Chapter Three contains an overview of the changing health care environment and the way in which key factors such astechnology, demographics, fiscal pressures and regulation areaffecting or will affect future HHR planning. One of thechanges discussed is the focus on wellness , which represents a new way of thinking about health and health care delivery.Health is seen as \"more than an absence of disease, (but) as aresource for everyday living.\" Greater emphasis is placed onthe determinants of health - a clean environment, nutritiousfood, economic security and a healthy lifestyle. Perhaps themost important social and cultural change is that health caredelivery is moving away from a focus on hospitals and doctors.The new model reflects an integrated, community-basedapproach. Its focus is on a team-based, shared care model ofservice delivery. The report notes that in response to the focus on wellness, Nova Scotia has already progressed some way along the pathto primary care reform with the decentralization of healthsystem governance and the Strengthening Primary CareInitiative. In May 2003 Nova Scotia's Advisory Committee onPrimary Health Care Renewal recommended an incrementalapproach to primary health care reform that would leadNOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDY 7eventually to a primary health care system offering health and social services ranging from basic emergency service andtreatment of common diseases and injuries, to childdevelopment and nutrition programs. Although it will be sometime before such a model is fully implemented, the directionof health care planning toward community-based models isclear. This will pose a new challenge for HHR planning -encouraging health care providers to adapt to changing roles,re-examine their scopes of practice and acquire the skillsnecessary for a new system of service delivery. New demandsthat may be made of health providers include: Greater acceptance of change in work routines; Changed relationships with other health providers; Better understanding of team behaviors; and Ability to form partnerships with families, community members or complementary providers. Policy makers will also face new challenges. They will need to ensure their HHR education and training will have to reflectnew methods of service delivery policies include all membersof the health care team. And as the Romanow Commission hassuggested, \"sensitive issues such as wage settlements, scopesof practice and working conditions will need to be addressedin an open and direct way.\" Technology is already having a major impact on health care delivery, but has even greater potential to improve healthoutcomes, particularly in the realm of information technology.In particular, electronic health records - currently used by onlya small fraction of health providers - will allow for betterdiagnosis and treatment of patients. At the same time thesetechnological advances will create ethical issues in areas likebiotechnology and patient privacy. The impact of demographics , specifically the aging population, is discussed in two contexts. First, the fact that the percentageof Nova Scotia's 65+ senior population is projected to nearlydouble to 25% in 2026 will have an impact on health caredelivery. More resources will be devoted to treating elderlyrelated diseases like Alzheimer and dementia, to procedureslike joint replacements and to services such as home care, longterm care and other personal care services linked to a decreasein one's independence with aging. Secondly, the sheer volumeof the aging population is likely to drive up health care costs.Per capita health spending for seniors in 2001 was more thanthree times the average of $3,304 for Nova Scotia's populationas a whole, and for the very old, 85+ years, it was eight timesmore. In light of such figures, it has been suggested that theaging population will threaten the sustainability of the healthcare system. On the other hand, today's over-65 population ishealthier and less costly to care for on an individual basis thanin the past. In any event, the health system has a decade or soto prepare for the arrival of the first large cohort of \"babyboomers\".The fiscal pressures exerted by the aging population will be exacerbated by the system of federal health transfers to theProvinces. Currently, these transfers are provided for on a percapita basis, making no provision for the age structure orhealth status of the population. This type of funding is to thedisadvantage of 'older' provinces like Nova Scotia with a 65+population greater than the national average. Moreover,increasing fiscal pressures will result in governmentsdemanding more accountability for money spent on healthcare. It adds up to a challenging environment for HHRplanning in which fiscal responsibilities will have to bebalanced with the need to provide competitive wages andother incentives to attract and retain adequate numbers ofhealth care workers. Chapter Three concludes with a discussion of the impact of regulation and legislation on HHR planning. Nineteen health occupations in Nova Scotia, accounting for 19,700 are subjectto self-governing occupational regulation, and another ten orso occupations have requested it. Under self-governingregulation, authority is delegated by legislation to a regulatorybody (often referred to as a professional college), whichestablishes entry level standards, codes of practice, continuingcompetence requirements and handles public complaints anddisciplinary procedures. A key component of health profession legislation is a practice definition outlining the tasks that licensed members of aprofession may perform. Such definitions help to define anoccupation's scope of practice. Occupational regulation is doneto protect the safety of the public. However, there are said tobe a number of negative consequences associated withoccupational legislation, including barriers to entry andmobility, inefficient use of human resources, higher costs andpersonnel shortages. There is some concern that overly rigidoccupational regulation could hinder initiatives such asprimary health care renewal, which require more collaborativeworking relationships and changes to scopes of practiceamong health professionals. One approach recently endorsedby Alberta, Ontario and British Columbia to expanding thescope of practice of health care workers is a controlled actssystem that restricts to a particular occupation only areas ofpractice that carry serious risk of harm if performedincorrectly. All other activities can be legally performed by anyoccupation, subject to common rules that apply to all healthprofessions. Chapter Four profiles Nova Scotia's Health Human Resources - the size, occupational breakdown, age, sex and other key supply,education and employment characteristics of people employedin the health care workforce in this province. Only thoseproviders working for pay are described in detail, even thoughthere are many thousands of other unpaid individuals, family8 NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDYmembers and volunteers who make up our 'human resources for health.' It has been estimated that Nova Scotia benefits from 140million hours of volunteer work, or the full time equivalent of70,000 volunteers working each year, many of those hoursdevoted to health care. According to the Statistics Canada Labour Force Survey, Nova Scotia's health and social services industry totaled 52,900people in 2002. It was the second largest industry (after retail),and represented about 12% of Nova Scotia's total workforce. To obtain more detailed characteristics on the health workforce, it was necessary to gather information from other sources,including employers, District Health Authorities, theDepartments of Health, Education and Community Services,regulatory bodies and professional/provider/employerassociations and a range of other in-field data sources. From thedata-gathering exercise associated with this in-field research, ahealth related workforce of 49,808 people, or 38,335 timeequivalents FTEs was identified (Figure E1). The 'People Pie' shows workers were mainly employed in acute care hospitals (38%), continuing care (34%) and in communityand private practice (24%) settings. A relatively small numberof workers were employed in mental health (3%), addictionservices (0.5%) and public health (0.6%). Based upon the availability and accessibility of information, the health workforce was broken down into the followingbroad categories (Table E1):Information on the health workforce yielded demographic and employment data on approximately 34,000 people, enablingprofiles for 31 health occupations. Research revealed that tenhealth occupations made up more than 80% of this total.These included: registered nurses at 26%, followed by personalcare workers/continuing care assistants at 12%, communityresidential workers at 10%, licensed practical nurses at 9%,physicians at 6%, home support workers/continuing careassistants at 6%, social at 4%, health service managersat 4%, medical laboratory technologists and technicians at 3%and pharmacists at 3%. Research on sex distribution revealed that 84% of Nova Scotia's health workforce in 2001 was female. Seven of the top 10health occupations were predominately female, ranging from97% for personal care workers and home support workers to75% for community residential workers. The three remainingtop ten health occupations showed pharmacists with 65%female, health managers with 60% female and physicians with31% female. Besides physicians, seven other healthoccupations were dominated by males, ranging from dentaltechnicians with 81% male to opticians with 53% male. Byemployment setting, females made up 83% of the workforce inacute care hospitals, 94% in LTC and 97% in home care/homesupport. Age distribution information was available for 82% of the health workers profiled. The average age was 41.3 years with23% of these in the sample 50 years of age or over. Althoughno one occupation had an average age over 50 years, severalsub-specialties did, including: paediatric dentists (59.5 years),general surgeons (52.4 years), oral pathologists (51.5 years) andoral surgeons (50.4 years). Among the older occupations were: Health managers, average age of 47.0 years, and 39% were 50 years and over Physicians, average age 46.8 years, and 34% were 50 years and over Figure E1: The People Pie Community/ Private/Other24%Acute Care (Hospitals)38% Mental Health 3% Addiction Services 0.5% Continuing Care 34%Public Health 0.6% Table E1: Health Human Resources Matrix CONTINUING CARE Acute Care Mental Public Addiction Nursing Home Care/ Community/ Hospitals Health Health Services Homes FTE 1.1 1.2 1.5 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.3 1.3NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDY 9 Denturists, average age 45.0 years, and 31% were 50 years and over Registered nurses, average age 43.9 years, 29% were 50 years and over Dentists average age 43.8 years, 29% were 50 years and over Licensed practical nurses, average age 43.2 years, and 24% were 50 years and over By employment setting, the average age of workers in acute care was 41.3 years, with 20% aged 50 years and over; in longterm care nursing homes it was 39.7 years, with 21% aged 50years and over; and in home care/home support it was 41.6years, with 24% aged 50 years and over. Research also revealed that Nova Scotia's health workforce was highly educated and fairly evenly distributed across the province. Of the 31 health occupations profiled, 79% provided detail oneducation levels. Figure E2 indicated while the majority (59%)were trained at the certificate or diploma training; 22% had abachelor degree, 6% had a masters degree and 13% haddoctorates. In comparing health occupations with post-secondary training with other industry sectors in the labour force, health workersdo appear to be more highly educated. Of those in the labourforce with post-secondary education, 11% had masters level orhigher education, as compared to 19% for health occupations. In terms of geographic distribution, the Capital District with 42% of the provincial population, has 46% of the healthworkforce. This results from the concentration of health careoccupations in hospital settings, such as specialist physicians,occupational therapists, physiotherapists, respiratorytherapists and others located within the Halifax RegionalMunicipality.The Chapter also looks at historical occupational growth and occupational supply compared with the rest of Canada. Relative to growth, comparative trend data was available for 16 healthoccupations. It showed that between 1991 and 2000 theoccupations with the fastest annual growth rates in NovaScotia were social workers (12.8% per annum), chiropractors(11.7% per annum), psychologists and dietitians (6.6% perannum) and occupational therapists (5.0% per annum).Occupations with medium or low growth (0 to 5% per annum)included pharmacists, respiratory therapists, physiotherapists,dental hygienists, optometrists and specialist physicians.Occupations experiencing declines in growth included themedical laboratory and medical radiation technologyoccupations, dentists, family practitioners, registered nursesand licensed practical nurses. In examining more recent changes in supply, the following was noteworthy. Licensed practical nurses and dentists experienced increases in recent years (4% and 6% respectively), reversing the averageannual declines they experienced from 1991-2000. The supply of medical laboratory technologists and registered nurses has been flat in recent years, slowing the ten yearannual declines in supply experienced from 1991-2000; Although the growth in physicians was flat throughout the 1990s (0.6% average annual growth), there was an increase of9% between 1998-2001; and Occupations in medical radiation technology have continued to decline in recent years (-7% change), consistent with theirten-year average annual decline of -0.7% per year. Occupational supply is also assessed by comparing Nova Scotia's per capita supply in 17 health occupations with thenational average for 2000. Nova Scotia exceeded the nationalaverage in nine occupations - including registered nurses,licensed practical nurses and medical radiation technologists -three of the five occupations which experienced growthdeclines during the 1990s. The comparisons also showed thatdespite their rate of increase during the 1990s, Nova Scotia still remained well below the national average per capita, inchiropractors, optometrists and occupational therapists. Itshould be noted that these numbers do not take into accountdifferences in the health status of Nova Scotians and thedifferent mix of services delivered by various health careworkers, factors that can impact differences in the number of health care workers per capita across provinces (Table E2and Table E3). Figure E2: Level of Education of Selected Health Occupations in Nova Scotia Certificate/ Diploma59%Bachelor 22% Masters 6% MD/Doctorate 13%10 NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDYTable E2: Occupations in which Nova Scotia exceeded National Per-Capita Average, 2000 NS/10,000 Canada/10,000 NS as % Occupation population population of Canada Social Worker 14.16 7.74 128.9% Registered Nurse (2001) 93.2 74.9 124.4% Radiation Technology 5.34 4.7 113.6% Physician (specialist) 10 9.3 107.5% Physician (GP) 10.1 9.4 107.4% Source: CIHI: Health Personel in Canada, 1991-2000; Statistics Canada Table E3: Occupations in which Nova Scotia was below National Per-Capita Average, 2000 NS/10,000 Canada/10,000 NS as % Occupation population population of Canada Physiotherapist 4.47 4.65 96.1% Respiratory Personel in Canada, 1991-2000; Statistics Canada Information on the mobility of health care workers is available for physicians and registered nurses. From 1992 to 2000, threetimes more physicians moved abroad than returned fromabroad. However, from 1997 onward, the net number ofphysicians leaving the province represents less than 1% of thephysician supply for that year. According to the College ofRegistered Nurse of Nova Scotia, more than half (53%) ofregistered nurses who entered practice from 1999 to 2002 werefrom outside of Nova Scotia. They were mostly fromNewfoundland (35%), New Brunswick (19%) and Ontario (18%). Itis not possible to get a clear picture of how many registerednurses leave Nova Scotia to work elsewhere each year. Chapter Four includes a detailed discussion of supply issues as they affect certain health occupations. Although still 38%above the national average in 2000, the medical laboratoryworkforce declined at an annual average rate of 2.7% perannum during the 1990s, with the sharpest drop occurringfrom 1997-2000. Of concern for Nova Scotia is the lack of an inprovince entry level education program, following the closurein 1995 of its Nova Scotia Community College diplomaprogram. Nova Scotia has responded by increasing itsenrolments to 25 at the New Brunswick Community College.Aswell, Nova Scotia has no local training program for medicalradiation therapists. The supply of medical radiationtechnologists and therapists overall dropped 7% between 1998and 2001, similar to a national trend, said to be caused byexpansion in health services, high attrition rates and anunderutilization of training capacity.A much talked about supply issue both in Nova Scotia and nationally, is the significant shortage of registered nurses.Most of the decline in nursing supply occurred between 1993and 1998, concurrent with the cutbacks associated withhospital restructuring, cutbacks in funding for nursingeducation programs, and the transition of nursing from adiploma to a degree. Figure E3 indicates the subsequentdecline in the number of entry level nursing graduates in Nova Scotia. The report also identifies the aging RN workforce as a looming future problem. The average age of RNs increased from 39.3years to 43.9 years between 1993 and 2002. This may be ofparticular concern for specific work settings, such ascontinuing care, where 44% of gerontology registered nurseswere 50 years of age and older in 2002. Ensuring an adequate supply of family practice physicians was also a concern. While the total number of physicians in NovaScotia actually grew 0.6% annually from 1991-2000, growth waslargely attributable to an increase in the number of specialistphysicians. As Figure E4 shows, the average annual rate ofgrowth for FP/GPs over this timeframe was negative, at -0.6%,while the annual growth of specialist physicians averaged 2%per year. This decline in family practice physicians, coupledwith the significant increase in specialists, has resulted in theproportion of FP/GPs to Specialists decreasing from 56:44 in1991, to 50:50 in 2001. Figure E3: RN Entry Level Graduates, NS, 1993-2001 Graduates400 300200100 0 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 Source: CRNNS Year Figure E4: Supply of Family Medicine and Specialist Physicians, NS, 1991-2000 Supply1,100 1,000 900800700600500 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 Year Family Medicine Specialists Source: CIHI, Health Personnel in Canada, 1991-2000, excludes residents & internsNOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDY 11This problem may be further exacerbated by the fact that in 2000 approximately 10% of licensed FP/GPs were actuallyfunctionally practicing in specialty areas other than familymedicine. Offsetting these downward trends however, is thefact that between 1994 and 2000 the number of first year andresidency trainees entering family/general practice atDalhousie increased 36% and 59%, respectively. Similar to registered nurses, the physician workforce in Nova Scotia is aging, with more than one third (34%) of physiciansaged 50 years and over in 2000. Given the long lead times of 6to 10 years needed to train a new physician, Nova Scotia facesan immediate challenge to replace nearly 700 doctorsapproaching retirement age or winding down their practise inthe next decade. Adding to the challenge is the fact that asphysicians near retirement age, their practice pattern changes.FP/GPs see fewer unique patients, 17% fewer in 2000-01 forFP/GPs aged 60 years and older. Another key issue with implications for HHR planning relates to the increasing proportions of females entering medicine. Whilefemales currently comprise less than one third (31%) of thephysician supply, they accounted for 52% of the enrolments inDalhousie medical school in 2000-01. Increasing numbers offemale physicians becomes a planning issue, especially as itrelates to female participation and productivity within thelabour force. Figure E5 illustrates that female physicians were mostly concentrated in a limited number of specialties, includingPaediatrics (51%), scarce in surgery subspecialties, accounting foronly 5%. This trend signals that the addition of more females tothe physician supply has the potential to exacerbate existingsex differences in physician specialty mix.As well, increasing proportions of female physicians may have implications for future physician planning from a workloadperspective. According to CIHI and a CMA 2001 Survey, femalephysicians practiced 20% less than their male counterparts. InNova Scotia, female family physicians' service volume hasbeen consistently running at two-thirds (67%) of their malecounterparts since 1992/93. Workload and practice patterns was not an issue specific to female physicians. A priority issue highlighted overall byphysicians was not related to their numbers, but rather toworkload imbalances and the changing nature and location oftheir practice, and its potential impact on one's quality of life. Chapter Four ends with a discussion of the need to better measure the inflow and outflow of health workers. The supplyof health care workers in Nova Scotia fluctuates each year.New graduates from health programs in Nova Scotia enterpractice here while others leave the province to work. NovaScotia also imports both experienced workers and newgraduates from other regions. Health workers may temporarilyleave practice because of maternity leave, illness and/ordisability. They may also leave the workforce entirely due toretirement or career change. Defining the various componentsof the inflow and outflow of health care workers is critical, asit provides information necessary for informed decision-making about recruitment and retention strategies. At thepresent time, there are gaps in the information required tomeasure the inflow and outflow of health care workersincluding: While the age distribution of health workers was collected for about 80% of health workers profiled; nearly one half of theregulated health occupations do not routinely collect ageinformation, essential for projecting outflows due to impendingretirements; Registered nurses and physicians were the only occupations in Nova Scotia with accessible information on mobility; Although the number of graduates from health programs each year is known, the number of graduates who remain inNova Scotia one year following graduation (retainedgraduates) is not known for many health occupations; The number and type of health workers who leave the workforce and the nature as to why they leave the workforcelargely remains an unknown quantity. Outflow informationdue to death, injury, illness, or career change was unavailablefrom a central source. Chapter Five profiles how Nova Scotia educates its health care workers, and explores the issues and challenges facing theeducation and training system. In 2001-02, there were about7,800 students enrolled in some 90 health-related programs atsix universities, the Nova Scotia Community College (NSCC)and various private career colleges. In addition to training itsown health workers, Nova Scotia's educational institutionsproduce graduates for the Maritime and Atlantic region in Figure E5: Sex Distribution of NS Physicians, by Specialty Group, 2000 Surgery Subsp. General Surgery Anasthesia Diagnostic Gen. Int. Med. Int. Med. Subsp. Emergency Med. Average Lab NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDYdisciplines such as dentistry, health services administration, medicine, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speechlanguage pathology, and others. Only a handful of universityeducation programs for health disciplines are not offered inNova Scotia. But the absence of some of these - medicallaboratory technology, medical radiation therapy andmidwifery - has been cited as an exacerbating factor to supplyconcerns. Dalhousie University dominates the education and training of health workers in Nova Scotia, accounting for 45% ofenrolments in over 50 different health-related programs(Figure E6). Five other universities and the NSCC divide theremaining students fairly evenly, with St. Francis XavierUniversity having the next largest share at 16%. Overall, morethan one in five enrolments at these post-secondaryinstitutions are health-related program enrolments. While there was little increase in overall enrolment in major health discipline programs between 1991 and 2001, there were a few programs, such as occupational therapy (4.3%) and socialwork (3.2%) which showed significant growth. In contrast, licensedpractical nursing enrolment was down 3.8% over this period. One way of measuring interest in health discipline programs is the applicant-to-enrolment ratio. Information supplied byDalhousie covering 12 health discipline programs showed thatfrom 1999-00 to 2000-01 the applicant-to-enrolment ratiodropped for eight of these programs. However, these ratioshave rebounded in programs (e.g. pharmacy and occupationaltherapy) where recruitment drives were carried out. Recruiting graduates into the Nova Scotia workforce was also an important challenge: In 2001, 27% of occupational therapy new graduates chose to practice in Nova Scotia, out of 48% of Nova Scotia graduates; In 2001, 54% of nursing graduates registered to practice in Nova Scotia, out of 82% of Nova Scotia graduate; In 2001, 33% of pharmacy graduates were practicing in Nova Scotia a year later, out of 64% of Nova Scotia graduates; and Between 1996 and 2000, there were 178 Dalhousie dentistry graduates, of which 50 (28%) were licensed to practice inNova Scotia in 2001.While almost two-thirds of students in health-related programs were under 25 years of age, the age profile for students in somehealth programs has increased significantly. In 1991-92, 42% ofmedical students were aged 25 years and over, but in 2001-02,the percentage was 56%. Pharmacy, occupational therapy andphysiotherapy had 26%, 28% and 30% of students 25 compared with 11%, 15% and 19% respectivelya decade earlier. Enrolment is predominately female (75%), andfemale enrolment is beginning to dominate occupations likemedicine (52% female) and dentistry (57% female) which havetraditionally been male dominated. Funding is a key issue facing the education and training system. Some $52.3 million was allocated by the Nova ScotiaDepartment of Education in 2001 to undergraduate andgraduate health related programs, accounting for about onequarter of the Department of Educations funding to the sixNova Scotia universities with health-related programs.Dalhousie received the bulk of that funding, nearly $45 million,and the other five universities shared $7.4 million. In addition,Dalhousie received more than $20 million in targetted fundingfor several health discipline programs from the Department ofHealth. Furthermore about $12 million of the $64 million in totalpublic funding to NSCC was spent on certificate and diplomaprograms in the NSCC's School of Health and Human Services. Ironically, government funding for post-secondary institutions has consistently lost out in recent years to funding for health(Table E4). Table E4: Expenditures Nova Scotia, Health vs. Post Secondary Education, 2000-04 % change 2000-01 2001-02 2002-03(f) 2003-04 (e) 2000 $1,838 M $1,997 M $2,111 M 21% Post Secondary 262 M 266 M 276 M 277 M 6% Source: NS Dept. of Finance, budget documents Combined with overall fiscal constraints, this has createdchallenges in a number of areas. An outdated funding model, based on a weighted average of 1994-97 full course equivalents, makes it difficult to changeor expand programs; The demand for clinical placements, a fundamental component of many health programs, is not being metbecause of insufficient resources and coordination oflogistical arrangements; Funding is also having a direct impact on students. With the decline in government support, tuition fees for universityundergraduates in Nova Scotia have increased significantly andare now the highest in Canada. Compounding the financialimpact on students of the increased cost of a post-secondaryeducation are two developments which increase the necessityof obtaining more post secondary education. One factor isFigure E6: Nova Scotia Health 13called \"creeping credentialism\", and refers to the trend among occupations to increase educational requirements. The other isthe trend at educational institutions of inflated entrancerequirements beyond the published minimum, leading to a\"double degree/double debt\" situation for health disciplines.This can result in some students devoting up to eight years topost-secondary training to complete a four-year healthprogram. Both phenomena have potential to affect the supplyand distribution of health occupations. In addition, a number of challenges facing education and training institutions are the result of the changing health careenvironment. The aging population will result in requirementsfor a different mix of occupational skills, with demands forexpanded enrolments in programs such as geriatrics, long-term care administration, physiotherapy and home care/homesupport workers. Community-based, shared-care models ofservice delivery may have impacts in several areas, including: Greater demand for college-trained 'assisting' occupations, such as physiotherapy, dietitian and other assistants, whichcurrently have no education and training programs offered inNova Scotia; Increased pressure to integrate training opportunities across disciplines, in response to changes in scopes of practice inthe work environment; and Increased use of multi-skilled workers, cross-trained in two or more disciplines. Innovations in technology, such as electronic health records, tele-health and the use of complex information systems willrequire health care workers to both learn new technical skillsand be prepared to continually upgrade them. Innovations in technology will increase demand for occupations such as: Chief information officers Database managers Computer application specialists Genetic counselors Molecular genetic technicians MRI technologists Mammography technologists Laser and lithotripsy technicians Source: Making Career Sense of Labour Market Information. National regulatory changes in 2001 associated with theAgreement on Internal Trade, enable workers qualified for anoccupation in one province to work in others. Educationalinstitutions are thus increasingly required to preparegraduates to practice to national competencies. While thisensures the portability of health professions, it does notensure that local health needs are being met.Lastly, student demographic trends may make it difficult for Nova Scotia to locally recruit adequate numbers into its healtheducation and training programs. That possibility arisesbecause of two factors. First, growth in the 18-21 years of agegroup, from which post-secondary enrolment has traditionallybeen drawn, is projected to increase overall across Canada by8.5% over the next decade, but projected growth is negative forAtlantic Canada. Second, female enrolments, which havesustained enrolment growth in health-related programs, areincreasingly entering other professions. Nova Scotia currentlyhas no overall, coordinated student recruitment strategy for itshealth discipline programs. Moreover, there appears to be a lackof consensus on whether the target market for recruitmentshould be related to stated educational entry requirements, orreflect the current applicant and enrolment pool. Thisinfluences not only Nova Scotia, but the Maritimes and theAtlantic region, relative to recruiting high school graduates,university under-graduates and/or university graduates. Chapter 6 examines the quality of work life of health care workers in Nova Scotia. With human resource shortagesbecoming increasingly common across the country, aconsensus is emerging that a high quality work environmentis at least as important as financial incentives to attractingand retaining motivated and productive health care workers.Most people care about being valued for their work, havingcontrol over their work and having greater flexibility in theworkplace. The following set of quality of worklife indicatorsdeveloped by the Canadian Nurses Association in 2002 (TableE5), is considered applicable for most occupations. Table E5: Possible quality of worklife indicators Indicator Definition Span of control Average number of direct reports for each nursing supervisor Leadership Corporate nursing leader at senior level with budget line responsibility Overtime hours Percent of nursing staff earned hours that are overtime hours Full-time/part-time/casual ratios Percent of total nursing staff earned hours that are full-time, part-time and casual, reported annually Autonomy/scopes of practise Percent of nurses reporting in a staff survey that they have adequate control over their professional practice Professional development Percent of nurses participating in opportunities in-service training session and/or off-site education and training programs, with the average number of hours for each type of session, reported annually Absenteeism Average number of days absent per nurse or absenteeism as per cent of total earned hours Grievance Total number of unresolved grievances Source: CNA Quality of Worklife Indicators Workshop Report. 14 NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDYCurrent data available for the health workforce in Nova Scotia enabled reporting on three of these indicators - absenteeism,overtime and employment status. People working in health care services are likely to have a higher rate of absenteeism than those employed in otherindustry sectors. According to the Statistics Canada LabourForce Survey, in 2002 health employees in Nova Scotia lost, onaverage, 20.7 days from work because of: illness and disability,maternity leave or for other personal reasons. This was 60%higher than the 12.9 days lost on average for people working inall industries in the province. It was also higher than the 19.2days averaged by the Canadian health workforce as a whole(Table E6). Table E6: Average Days Lost for Personal Reasons per Full Time Health Care Employee vs. All Industries, NS, 2002 NS Health Industry NS All Industries Days lost % of time lost Days lost % of time lost Illness/disability 11.9 57.5% 8.6 66.7% Maternity 7.0 33.8% 2.7 20.9% Other Personal 8.7% 1.6 12.4% Total 20.7 100.0% 12.9 100.0% Source: Statistics Canada Labour Force Survey 2002. As the table shows, there is a key difference between health andother industries related to the higher number of days healthindustry workers lost due to maternity leave. The higherproportion of females employed in the health industry (86%), ascompared to other industries (55%), resulted in an average offour more days a year in 2002 lost due to maternity leave in thehealth industry (7 days), than among workers in industry as awhole (2.7 days). When maternity leave and personal leave are subtracted from the total of 20.7 days, one is left with 11.9 days lost to illness ordisability (down from 12.7 days in 2001). Based on the LabourForce Survey 2002 female health care workers in Nova Scotiahave a higher rate of absenteeism due to illness or disabilitythan their male counterparts. The average for females of 13.0days lost (excluding maternity leave) was more than double thatof males. The 11.9 days lost by both sexes equals about one day amonth per employee. Based on a health industry workforce of52,900 people, if days lost due to illness and disability in healthcare were reduced to the rate of 8.6 days incurred for all NovaScotia workers, it would be like having 671 more full timeequivalent health workers on the job in this Province. The Statistics Canada Labour Force Survey did not break down time lost to illness versus time lost to disability .H o w e v e r , information obtained from the Nova Scotia Workers'Compensation Board (WCB) indicated that in 2000, time lost by health workers due to workplace injury totaled about 2.2 days.Nurses accounted for the largest proportion of claims andpayments made by WCB in 2000, with 76% of claims and 79% ofpayments, usually for sprain or strain injuries. According to WCBdata, 42% of total claim payments were for nursing homeemployees, and 34% for hospital workers. In 2000-01, based on data reported by acute care facilities, there was $15.4 million paid out in sick pay, equaling 3.7% ofearned compensation. On an occupational level, six acute careoccupations exceeded the average, namely licensed practicalnurses (4.4%), operating (4.3%), nursingassistant/orderlies (4.1%) and psychology assistants (4.1%). Forthe health occupations in acute care, actual time lost reporteddue to illness worked out to more than 400 full timeequivalent positions. In continuing care, sick time appeared tofollow a similar pattern to acute care. Based on theinformation available from continuing care institutions, sickpay accounted for about 3.5% of the total compensation. Employment insurance (EI) information provided additional context to the employment of health care workers in Nova Scotia.The average EI claim was $3,191 among selected healthoccupations. For selected health occupations maternity benefitsaccounted for 43% of EI claims, regular EI accounted for 41% ofclaims, and sickness accounted for 16% of claims. Licensedpractical nurses and medical laboratory technologists had higherthan average proportions of claims as regular EI benefits (66% and56% respectively, versus 41% on average overall). Registerednurses had higher than average proportions of claims for EIsickness benefits (20% versus 16% on average overall). Several occupational representatives suggested that shortages of personnel and relief staff, coupled with increasing demandsfor service, have resulted in high levels of working overtime . However, at the health care industry level, Statistics Canadasuggests health care workers are less likely to work overtimethan workers in other industries. Almost one in five health careworkers (19.6%) in Nova Scotia worked paid or unpaid overtimein 2002. This was slightly higher than the proportion of healthcare workers in Canada who worked overtime (18.6%), butlower than the 21.3% of non-health workers in Nova Scotia whoworked overtime in 2002. Health care workers also worked lessovertime in 2002, on average, compared to the workforce as awhole. Of those who worked overtime, health care workers inNova Scotia averaged an extra 7 hours of paid or unpaidovertime, while non-health workers who worked overtime putin an average of 8.8 hours of paid and overtime per week extra.NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDY 15In terms of overtime by work setting, information gathered from District Health Authority (DHA) employers and the IWKin acute care indicated that overtime represented, on average,2.4% of total compensation paid to health care workers in2000-01. The overtime rate in continuing care was lower,averaging just over one per cent of payroll. For the 26 selectedselected occupational groups in acute care, only threeoccupations, operating room assistants (5.7%), respiratorytherapists (4.1%) and registered nurses (3.4%) exceeded theoverall average of 2.4%. People working in health care are much more likely to be employed on a part time or casual basis than other Canadian workers. A special Workplace and Employee Survey publishedby Statistics Canada in 1999 found that in 1998 only 52% ofworkers in health care had full time positions, compared with74% of Canadians working outside the health field. The picture was the same for Nova Scotia health workers. In acute care hospitals, mental health, public health andaddictions services in 2000, approximately 55% of workerswere employed full time, 30% had part time work and 15%were employed on a casual basis. Full time employment washarder to find in continuing care, where it accounted for only42% of employment, while part time accounted for 30% andcasual for 28% (Figure E7). Occupations with 70% or more workers in full time employment included paramedics (98%), health executives (82%), respiratorytherapists andoccupational therapists (70%). Casual employment was highest among occupations employed in continuing care settings, suchas community residential workers (30%), personal care workers(30%), licensed practical nurses (25%), and home supportworkers (23%). Analysis of data from acute care hospitals revealed that casualemployment was highest among younger workers, reflecting it maytake several years to work into full time positions. Over one-half(56%) of workers under 25 years and one-third (33%) of workersbetween 25 and 29 years worked in casual positions in 2000.Figure E8 shows the resulting 'U' shape distribution of casualemployment among younger and older age groups in acute care.As people move into full time jobs, a much lower percentageworked on a casual basis. The proportion who worked casualreached a low of 9% for those between 45-49 years of age.However, the percentage of workers working casual started toincrease again among workers 50 years of age and older. Of those60 years of age and older working in acute care, 35% wereemployed on a casual basis. A possible explanation for this maybe that some workers opt for pre-retirement by working casual, orthey return to the workforce following retirement to work on acasual basis. Chapter Six concludes with a discussion of the key employment trends and issues identified during consultationand literature review. These trends and issues have potentialimpact on future planning, recruitment and retention of thehealth workforce. Changing lifestyle expectations are an increasingly important factor for health care workers who favor a more balancedlifestyle, including more time to spend with their families.Physicians in particular want to decrease the number of hoursthey work, understandable in view of the fact that a survey in 2001 found that on average Nova Scotia GP/FPs worked a 78-hour week (compared with 69 hours for Canadian GP/FPs).On-call service was a particular concern for Nova ScotiaGP/FPs. Health service managers also say the impact ofpersonal lifestyle sacrifices, high levels of stress and longworking hours is a disincentive to attracting future leadersinto management positions. As well, continuing careinformants indicated that changing lifestyle expectations ofyounger job seekers and competition from call centers hasmade recruitment more challenging. High workload was a factor in high staff turnover, poor employee morale, burnout, lowered levels of productivity andincreased potential for injury. The issue of high workload wasraised by most occupations interviewed for this study. Some ofthe challenges identified included:Figure E7: Employment Status, Nova Scotia Health Workers, 2000 Full TimePercentage Casual60% 50%40%30%20%10% 0% Acute Care, Mental Health, Public Health, Addictions Continuing CarePart TimeFigure E8: Casual/Relief Status by Age Group, Selected Health Occupations in Acute Care, NS, HUMAN RESOURCES STUDY The increasing acuity levels and number of elderly with more complex and time-consuming problems; Restructuring of the health care system, resulting in shorter hospital stays which in turn, increases the demands onworkers in community, home and long term care settings; and The lack of a consistent approach to measuring workload. Public/professional identity was a concern for various occupations. Personal care workers, home care/home supportworkers and community residential workers employed incontinuing care were seen as representing less professionalwork than those in other health settings. Social workers alsoexpressed concern about the public's perception of what theydo, pointing out that downsizing has resulted in a redefinitionof their roles, with social work functions sometimes beingcarried out by others. Therapeutic recreation professionalsnoted the role and benefit of their practice was not wellunderstood by many health occupations and members of thepublic. In addition, some practitioners of alternative andcomplementary medicine, such as chiropractors, perceivedthere is still a bias around them becoming mainstream in theprovincial medical community and in health care planning. Compensation issues arose in a number of contexts. For health workers as a whole, competitiveness of salaries was an issue.Statistics Canada reported in 2002, that average weekly wagesfor 'professional occupations in health, nurse supervisors andregistered nurses' in Nova Scotia were 2.6% below the nationalaverage. For 'technical, and assisting and related occupations',wages in Nova Scotia were 8% below the Canadian average. Onthe other hand, wages for both groups increased more quicklythan the national average between 1998 and 2002. Forphysicians, the issue was the form of payment. Fee-for-serviceas the sole form of payment is in decline in Nova Scotia. Only38% of Nova Scotia doctors derived their income solely from fee-for-service payments in 2000-01, as compared to 59% ofphysicians across the country. In continuing care settings, frontline workers identified fair wages and benefits as a key issue,along with high rates of part time and casual employment. Some of the discussion and research on the issue of scopes of practice has involved the practice of nurse practitioners and midwives and how they may be able to provide primary healthcare that has traditionally been the preserve of physicians.Research has found that occupations such as licensed practicalnurses, dental hygienists, pharmacy technicians, nurseanesthetists and chiropractors can safely expand their roles toprovide services that are typically provided by those with moretraining. As well, some work performed by rehabilitationprofessionals can be safely delegated to assistants ortechnicians. In Nova Scotia, there was a range of scopes ofpractice issues identified, associated with occupations such asmidwives, licensed practical nurses, pharmacists, pharmacytechnicians, psychologists and dental hygienists, among others.In the continuing care sector, where most services are deliveredby unregulated health occupations, a recent study found thatworkers operate under a myriad of policies and practices, withseveral occupations expressing concern they were not allowedto perform work for which they were qualified.Professional development and leadership development are both key to creating and maintaining a strong and productivehealth care workforce. With regard to professionaldevelopment, health sector employers were becoming lesswilling and able to give time off work for professionaldevelopment because staff shortages meant there was no oneavailable to cover shifts. Several occupations also reportedlimited opportunities for career advancement within, or 'careerladdering' over time. As for leadership development, it wasconsidered essential to increasing work effectiveness, reducingoccupational stress and influencing staff retention. The studynotes a 2000 report which found that 88% of health serviceexecutives surveyed mentioned \"loss of leadership control\" asan issue. In response to findings such as these, theDepartment of Health, nursing organizations, DHAs, the NovaScotia Association of Health Organizations (NSAHO) and otherorganizations are paying more attention to leadershipdevelopment. Chapter Seven concludes with recommendations for making health workforce planning more effective. A challenge inplanning for the future health workforce is that to date thereis no planning framework that integrates HHR with thebroader forces shaping change in the health care system. HHRplanning does not occur in a vacuum (Figure E9). The nature ofhealth care service delivery structures is changing, as are theskills and competencies needed to deliver health care.Environmental factors such as technological advances,demographic changes, regulatory structures, changing publicexpectations, and economic forces, must also be considered aspart of the planning picture. The long-term HHR planning framework conceptualized from this study (Figure E9) represents an adaptation of various otherHHR planning models that have been recently proposed, as wellas the experiential knowledge and learning that resulted fromundertaking the process of this study. It suggests HHR planningshould be integrated with broader service delivery and financialplanning processes. It assumes planning efforts should be builtaround health care service needs of the Nova Scotia populationand the competencies and skills required for delivering them.And service planning for meeting these health needs mustutilize the full HR continuum (self care, family, unpaid, paid) ofresources. T wo noteworthy elements identified as critical for enhanced HHR planning were: articulation by government of service delivery requirements in various settings; and better linkages among all stakeholders - education institutions, industry, government, regulatory bodies andassociations - involved in planning the health workforce Chapter Seven concludes with a series of recommendations for improving the availability, accessibility and quality of data onNova Scotia's health workforce because, it argues, goodinformation is essential to successful HHR planning. It proposesthe DOH take a leadership role in key areas related to:NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDY 17 developing an ongoing data collection process and a centralized data repository for HHR, with standardized dataelements, definitions and structure; maintaining confidentiality agreements and a memorandum of understanding with key data stakeholders ensuring fullcompliance with privacy guidelines; establishing guidelines for the internal use and external publication of HHR information; standardizing job criteria to enable consistency and comparability of health occupations across geographic andpractice settings; standardizing education and training data elements, definitions, timing and frequency of data collection; conducting ongoing, periodic environmental scanning and labour market analyses and maintaining a qualitative issuesdata bank to input and inform HHR planning and policyprocesses; and interfacing between educational, regulatory, government and employer/industry stakeholders to collaborate on HHRstrategies and best practices to effect better planning, policy,accountability and performance measurement frameworks.This report has provided a baseline assessment of Nova Scotia's HHR, detailing workforce demographics, education andemployment characteristics, as well as emerging trends andissues relevant to HHR planning. This provides a framework todevelop strategies for balancing supply to meet Nova Scotia'shealth needs; aligning education and training to servicedelivery requirements, and valuing our people within theworkplace. Proposed activities for completing this project include: Examining occupational requirements for HHR planning; Conducting a gap analysis and identifying options; Providing recommendations for future HHR planning; Disseminating study findings and results; and Providing assistance to the DOH with integration of data and set up of processes to enhance HHR planning.Figure E9: Long Term Health Human Resource Planning Conceptual Framework Environmental Factors Technology Human Resources for Health Self Care Family Unpaid PaidCompetency Education & TrainingRegulatory /Legislative Regulatory AssociationsGlobalization Demographic Funding Public PrivateUtilization Employers Industry Foundational FeaturesEnhanced Data Informed Decisions Collaborative Linkages Sustainable Process(es)Population Needs Health determinants Health status Community priorities DemographicsTargetOutcomes Population (health) Provider (satisfaction) System (effectiveness)DefiningServiceRequirements ServiceDeliveryModels ActualOutcomes Population (health) Provider (satisfaction) System (effectiveness) PerformanceManagement/AccountabilityPolitical Economic ServicePlanning18 NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDYNOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDY 191.0 MANDATE AND METHODOLOGY 1.1 THE MANDATE Our health care system is a complex blend of many things but it is first and foremost about people, patients, clients andcaregivers. To sustain a health care system that serves the needsof Nova Scotians, we must ensure we have the necessarycaregivers - now and for the future. The Romanow Report \"The Future of Health Care in Canada,\" identified Health Human Resources (HHR) planning as one of thekey priorities to protect the future of health care in Canada.Planning is needed to meet our health requirements, and to avoidshortages of health care providers. As Romanow pointed out, aplan is even more necessary as we try to put together \"the rightmix of skills from an integrated team of health care providers (to)deliver ...comprehensive approaches to health care.\" This report identifies several elements to HHR planning, including training and strategies for recruitment and retention.However, the first step to a comprehensive plan is to conductthorough research leading to a better understanding of ourhealth workforce in Nova Scotia. The Study of Health Human Resources in Nova Scotia , a Human Resource Development Canada (HRDC) funded project, wasinitiated in 2001 as a joint undertaking between the Nova ScotiaDepartment of Health (DOH) and the Health Care HumanResource Sector Council (HCHRSC). This report develops a profileof the Nova Scotia health care workforce, identifies specificissues, and recommends priority areas for future planning. This report provides a baseline assessment of Nova Scotia's HHR, detailing workforce demographics, education and employmentcharacteristics, as well as emerging trends and issues relevant toHHR planning. This provides a framework to develop strategiesfor balancing supply to meet Nova Scotia's health needs; aligningeducation and training to service delivery requirements; andvaluing our people within the workplace. Project deliverables in this baseline report include: Environmental scan of issues and emerging trends (including labour market, regulatory/legislative, demographic, etc); Inventory of HHR initiatives (2000-2002) in other provinces; 31 occupational snapshots, detailed profiles and HR issues; Inventory of education and training programs and statistics; Highlights of occupational, education and training and employment issues relevant to HHR planning and policy; Baseline database of HHR in Nova Scotia (based on existing data availability and accessibility); and Synopsis of data issues relevant to HHR planning in Nova Scotia.Concurrently, throughout the fiscal year 2002-2003, the HCHRSC project team resources were tasked with the responsibility androle of leading the development of a joint Atlantic proposal toHRDC to examine education and training planning for healthdisciplines within Atlantic Canada. This draft proposal waspresented to the Atlantic Deputy Ministers of Health andEducation in November, 2002. Proposed activities for completing this study include: Examining occupational requirements for HHR planning; Conducting a gap analysis and developing options; Providing recommendations for future HHR planning; Disseminating study findings and results; and Providing assistance to the DOH with data integration and collection process setup to enhance HHR planning. 1.2 THE METHODOLOGY 1.2.1 Conceptual Approach A number of approaches are used in HHR planning. As there is no common or over-riding framework for planning, for the mostpart, efforts have been limited and disparate. HHR studies havefocused on specific sub-sectors (e.g. home care, acute care,primary care), occupational groups (e.g. nurses and physiciansbeing the most common), diseases (e.g. cancer, heart, alzheimers,and stroke) or specific services (e.g. oral health services, mentalhealth services). While such initiatives provide valuable information for specific practice settings or health professions, they often fail to considerthe broader context of the health care system and the inter-relationships of various health care teams who deliver healthcare services. Existing inefficiencies may not be considered, northe impact of advances in technology and anticipated changes inservice delivery. A conceptual change in the approach to HHR planning seems to be in the works. A report conducted for the Commission on theFuture of Health Care in Canada, by the Canadian PolicyResearch Networks, identified four key shifts in thinking thatneed to occur for HHR planning to be more effective 1: HHR planning must become integrated with system design issues, rather than conducted as a separate policy exercise; HHR planning must be done from the perspective of population health needs; HHR planning must be done on the basis of a team of providers, rather than on the basis of individual healthproviders; and HHR planning requires national co-operation. 1. Health Human Resource Planning in Canada: Physician and Nursing Workforce Issues. Canadian Policy Research Networks, Inc. October 2002. Summary Report prepared forthe Commission on the Future of Health Care in Canada.20 NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDYFigure 1.1 outlines the HHR planning conceptual framework derived for this study. This framework represents an adaptationof various other HHR planning models that have been recentlyproposed (such as Linda O'Brien-Pallas and others). HHRplanning does not operate in a vacuum, and is influenced, as allindustries are, by external environmental factors. This framework assumes service planning efforts are built around the health care needs of the Nova Scotia population, andthe skills and competencies required in delivering them.Another important facet for future HHR planning is theconsideration and input of the full Human Resource continuum,(both paid and unpaid) as a key resource component. Figure 1.1 also includes some core foundational features for HHR planning. Contributing toward this foundation became thefundamental goal of this project. The research conducted as aresult of this study will provide a foundation and environmentconducive to: Enhanced data for planning, policy and resource allocation; Sustainable processes to integrate HHR Planning into financial, service delivery, and education and training planning; Informed policy to enable evidence-based decision-making; and Collaborative linkages to facilitate planning, education and training and management of human resources for health.1.2.2 Project Methodology The project launch in April 2001 was followed by preliminaryconsultations with key stakeholders - provincial governmentdepartments, education and training institutions, researchorganizations and industry representatives. This led to thefinalization in September 2001 of project objectives, scope andactivities. The project methodology was adapted from a HHR framework introduced by Thomas Hall in 1988 and subsequently adopted bythe World Health Organization (WHO) in its planning and policytoolkit. The framework identifies three key elements foroptimizing development of human resources for health: Workforce planning for short and long term needs Production of a health care workforce through education and training Management of human resources to recruit and retain workers The design of the baseline assessment began with: Consultation with the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) on data access and information-sharingopportunities; Consultation with DOH on availability of internal HHR data for this study;Environmental Factors Technology Human Resources for Health Self Care Family Unpaid PaidCompetency Education & TrainingRegulatory /Legislative Regulatory AssociationsGlobalization Demographic Funding Public PrivateUtilization Employers Industry Foundational FeaturesEnhanced Data Informed Decisions Collaborative Linkages Sustainable Process(es)Population Needs Health determinants Health status Community priorities DemographicsTargetOutcomes Population (health) Provider (satisfaction) System (effectiveness)DefiningServiceRequirements ServiceDeliveryModels ActualOutcomes Population (health) Provider (satisfaction) System (effectiveness) PerformanceManagement/AccountabilityFigure 1.1: Long Term Health Human Resource Planning Conceptual Framework Political Economic ServicePlanningNOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDY 21 Secondary research, as well as a web literature review of HHR; Identification of recent, ongoing and planned HHR planning initiatives; Identification of quantitative and qualitative data availability and accessibility for supply, education and training, andmanagement and employment; and Environmental scan of HHR issues and emerging trends. Upon reviewing national, regional, provincial and locally available data, indicators were defined for availability,accessibility, appropriateness, and relevance. An early discoverywas the lack of a comprehensive or integrated database to guideprovincial HHR planning and policy functions. While ample dataexisted for physician and nursing professionals, data gaps anddefinition inconsistencies existed in areas related todemographics, education and training and practice information. Aside from nursing and physician health occupations, no formalized data collection process or agreements were in placewith regulatory bodies or professional associations. In 1999, theDOH collected preliminary supply data on other regulated healthprofessions, however, existing information was disparate andsparse, relative to content and format. Given the shortage of reliable, accurate and timely data on health care workers in Nova Scotia, most of the data came fromprimary in-field data collection. Because most organizations didnot have the information needed to profile the health workforce,approximately 20% of the data collected came from existingsecondary data sources. The rest (80%) came from primaryresearch in the field. The DOH or the Department of Education (DOE) do not currently maintain a data repository of education and training statisticsspecifically for health discipline programs or people. In theabsence of receiving projections, key decisions regarding theeducation and training of health disciplines by default, rests withthe individual educational institutions. As well, there is nocomprehensive central repository of employment related data(HHR financial, payroll and employee demographics) in NovaScotia. The project's scope, activities and schedule changed on an iterative basis to reflect these realities. The focus for the baselinebecame one of trying to piece together a credible picture, fromthe data and information received from multiple, disparatesources. Primary research occurred with one-on-one visits and the collection of qualitative and quantitative data from associationsand regulatory bodies, educational and training institutions, andvarious industry representatives and employers.Secondary research included an examination of data fromStatistics Canada, HRDC, the Labour Force Survey, EmploymentInsurance (EI) and Workers' Compensation Board (WCB)statistics. Data also came from government-related sources suchas Nova Scotia Association of Health Organizations (NSAHO),Department of Education (DOE), Department of Health (DOH),Department of Community Services (DCS), Maritime ProvincesHigher Education Commission (MPHEC) and Canadian Post-M.D.Education Registry (CAPER). A summary of key activities included:Stakeholder contacts in the field were identified. Face-to-face meetings and presentations occurred to discuss the concept and status of HHR Planning for Nova Scotia, and what wasneeded to enhance this process; Primary data indicators , definitions and templates were established for supply, education and training, and HHRmanagement/employment; Letters were sent requesting data 1) from regulatory and professional and other provider representative associations forsupply information 2) from select Nova Scotia universities andcommunity college for educational and training information 3)from 275+ organizations and employers for management andemployment information; Quantitative and qualitative information was collected from professional associations and regulatory bodies, education andtraining institutions, and DHAs, relevant provincial governmentdepartments, nursing homes, home support agencies,residential care facilities (RCFs), community based options(CBOs), and key associations and informants for other areas(such as NSAHO, Continuing Care Association of Nova Scotia,Home Support Nova Scotia Association, WCB, EI and StatisticsCanada); Templates were standardized , but incoming data varied considerably, necessitating extensive data cleaning andpreparation prior to analysis; and Validation Processes occurred, whereby results, findings and interpretations from the data analysis were formerly validatedby original and overlapping data sources. 1.2.3 Data Methodology Data was gathered and processed in three categories - supply,education and training and employment, with each areapresenting its own challenges. 1.2.3.1 Supply Data The supply data collection process began with a letter of introducing the project. Each regulatory body and associationwas consulted to access both quantitative and qualitative data toenable the construction of 31 occupational profiles.22 NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDYRelative to quantitative data, a template of approximately 55 supply indicators was introduced and discussed at the initialface-to-face meetings. A formal letter of request followed togather this and other relevant data that would be utilized for thisstudy. Individual demographic information was provided by eachof the regulatory bodies and/or health care provider associationsthrough a variety of sources, including their annual registrationprocess, local and national requests, surveys and/or membershipmailing lists. The 'quality' of supply data was collected for the 31 occupational groups. The depth and breadth of the occupational profiles was determined in large measure by the quantity and quality of the data sources. Individual demographic information was provided by each of the regulatorybody and/or health care provider associations through a varietyof sources, including their annual registration process, local and national requests, surveys and/or membership mailing lists. Inaddition, registration forms were examined to determine whatinformation these organizations collected. CIHI representatives managing HHR data were consulted to discuss data availability and accessibility at the national, regionaland provincial levels. As well, the existing data collection processwas discussed and issues involving data completeness andquality of data. CIHI information reported in Health Personnel in Canada, 1991 to 2000 , was used to analyze supply and graduate trend data for Nova Scotia, as compared to Canada overall. The quantitative data required extensive, timely preparation andcleaning before it could be analyzed. In addition, based upon the'completeness' of data received, it became necessary to collectsupplementary information beyond that received from the initialquantitative survey. From a qualitative perspective, key informant interviews were conducted. A similar series of questions were administered toenhance consistency in identifying and highlighting key HRissues for each health occupation. In conjunction with this, aliterature review was conducted on HHR related issues for eachoccupation as part of the environmental scan process. The final, but perhaps most crucial stage of the supply analysis was the validation process. The occupational profiles, one-pagesummaries and occupational issues were sent to those whoprovided the information (regulatory bodies, associations, etc.)requesting content validation. This procedure proved critical tosubstantiating the credibility and reliability of the findingsdrawn from multiple sources of data over varying time frames.1.2.3.2 Education and Training Data The data collection process for education and training was initiated by a letter of introduction, co-signed by the DeputyMinisters of Health and Education and forwarded to the majoreducation institutions responsible for education and trainingprograms for health disciplines. The collection of qualitative and quantitative data for health education and training programs occurred through consultationwith various registrars, vice presidents, institutional analysts,department heads and faculty at universities and the NovaScotia Community College (NSCC). In addition, interviews wereconducted with educational representatives from the seveninstitutions responsible for the delivery of health programs. Datawas also retrieved from institutional websites, academiccalendars, education and training institutions and associatedorganizations. A series of education and training data indicators was developed for four key areas: program, student, faculty and clinicaleducation, for a total of 46 indicators. Maritime Provinces Higher Education Commission data was used to provide trendinformation for the academic years prior to 1999-00 and tosupplement the enrolment and graduation information providedby the seven educational institutions. Education and training data covering 90 health-related programs was collected. Enrolment demogaphic information information was analyzed by institution, by program, and bydegree level for each institution. This education and traininginventory can be used to support the creation of a broader inventory of health related programs for health occupations working within the Atlantic Provinces. From a qualitative perspective, each of the key informant interviews on education and training issues were documentedand reviewed for common themes. These themes were furtherresearched and any quantitative data to support these issueswere supplemented accordingly. The validation process for education and training involved a letter to educational representatives to obtain feedback on theeducation and training tables and the education-related contentsin the occupational profiles, summaries and issues. As well,education and training issues identified during consultationswere synthesized into a summary document and included in thevalidation packages where appropriate. Quantitative data related to program statistics and student demographics were reconciled based on feedback received fromthe education institutions, primarily on the basis of registrarNOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDY 23information. Information provided by university department heads proved especially valuable for triangulating data, and as adata source for information not collected on a routine basis bythe registrar, such as clinical education and faculty statistics. 1.2.3.3 Management and Employment dataThere is no central repository of data on employment characteristics of health care workers. Numerous sources, fromregulatory bodies and professional associations to individualemployers, were therefore consulted in order to create acomposite picture of employment information. Since therelevant organizations that were consulted did not maintainaggregate data by occupation, it was necessary to develop a listof 61 individual management and employment indicators whichcould then be rolled up by employee classifications to theirrespective occupational categories. Standard electronic andmanual templates were designed and distributed for datacollection to acute care (nine DHAs and the IWK) and continuingcare (275+) facilities and organizations. Data collection for acute care facilities involved working primarily with human resource representatives among the DHAsand IWK. For mental health, public health and addictionsservices, the DOH and related in-field representatives suppliedinformation. As well, program and service representatives at theDOH assisted with the process. Data collection for the continuing care sector was more complex, as it included four different facility types: Long Term Care facilities (LTC) nursing homes; Home Care/Home Support (HC/HS); Residential Care Facilities (RCFs); and Community Based Options (CBOs). Each of these four areas in turn, was comprised of additional sub-levels. For example, CBOs included group homes, smalloption homes, developmental residences, workshops, adultresidential centres (ARCs), regional rehabilitation centres (RRCs)and supervised apartments. Another layer of complexity forcontinuing care data collection was that health care workers inCBOs and RCFs were employed by two separate governmentdepartments (DOH and DCS). Employment data for acute care was examined at an aggregate occupation and DHA level, focused mainly on the components ofdemographic and compensation-related information (e.g. sicktime, overtime, etc.). As part of the validation process,demographic and employment information and its relatedfindings were distributed to each DHA and the IWK. Asanomalies were discovered, the database was updated.The continuing care data analyzed proved somewhat limited for thorough analysis. Data from facilities and other sources, such asthe DOH and DCS, were utilized for the aggregate demographicsand compensation analysis for the continuing care workforceand contributed to the building of several of the occupationalprofiles. It is noteworthy that some of the preliminary results and findings from continuing care facilities were used to crossreference data that was contained in the occupational profiles. Inaddition, expert opinion from selected key informants was usedto substantiate gaps in data. Health workforce employment related information was also obtained from other sources, including: The Management Information Service (MIS) at the Department of Health was accessed to obtain work and benefit (e.g. earned)dollars, hours and FTEs for acute care hospitals, public health,addictions and mental health; The Nova Scotia Association of Health Organizations (NSAHO) was contacted to source information on return to work programs,retirements, and pensions ; HRDC Labour Force Survey statistics were accessed as part of the environmental scan in examining employment informationpertaining to the health industry ; Data requested from the WCB included the number, cost, type and duration of injury claims by occupation, for the period 1991to 2000; and EIstatistics obtained for the period 1995 to 2000, were used to examine the utilization of employment insurance benefits, bytype of benefit and occupation. 1.2.4 Data Challenges There is no nationally recognized standardized set of dataelements for HHR planning for health professionals. Nationalorganizations like CIHI are working to address data issues inHHR planning, but they are dependent on the accuracy of inputdata from the provinces. Confidentiality is a key issue. Of the 31 occupations profiled, about 80% reported on an individual basis, and 20% reportedaggregate information only. As part of an ongoing data collectionprocess, the DOH is developing confidentiality agreements and amemorandum of understanding with key data stakeholders, toensure full compliance with provincial privacy guidelines. Quantitative data received from regulatory bodies and professional associations, educational institutions andemployers varied in content and format, relative to their dataelements, definitions, time frames, and format. Theseorganizations have varying data requirements and resources,24 NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDYbased upon their mandates and interests, which, in turn, reflect the disparity in their data collection. Extensive coding of thedata into a common format suitable for analysis was required. In addition to these challenges, there were specific problems with using existing databases to derive information useful toHHR planning. These included: The Management Information System (MIS) at the DOH records hours and dollars only by broad occupational group and wasunable to provide demographics or more detailed employment-related information such as age, gender, sick time, overtime,and status. As well, the MIS data for DHA 9 was only availableat the aggregate level. However, the DOH has plans to expandits MIS capacity to collect greater breadth and depth ofinformation. For example, it is anticipated that data onemployment status will be added to the MIS at the DOH in the coming year; WCB data on claims by injured workers in the health care field does not always include occupation as a completed field. Thismade it difficult to analyze claims data at the occupation level; HRDC feedback on using the Labour Force Survey Statistics indicated information was reliable for use at an aggregateNational Occupational Code (NOC) group level, but not alwaysat a specific health occupation level. Traditionally, the NOCcodes reported are based upon the education and trainingrequirements for an occupational group, which means thesame NOC code may contain related and non-related healthoccupations grouped together. As well, a substantial part of thedemand and supply related information included in the NOCcodes was dated, as much of it was derived from utilization ofthe 1996 census data. On a positive note, as of 2002, the NOCcodes have been refined and redefined. Future reporting shouldenable better analysis for each health profession. As well, the2000 Census information is anticipated to be incorporated into2003 HHR projection information; and EI records were provided by the aggregate NOC at the county level, making it impossible to compare EI data with other datacomplied by DHA area. 1.2.4.1 Supply Related Data IssuesThe most comprehensive information currently exists for regulated health occupations. While the regulated occupationsrequire mandatory registration, non-regulated occupations wereonly able to provide limited data, which typically represented asub-sample of their total workforce. This made it challenging tocollect comprehensive supply data for non-regulatedoccupations. As well there was little information available onunpaid caregivers.Supply data reported by organizations such as CIHI was limited mostly to regulated health professions due to the absence ofstandardized, comparable data. CIHI utilizes membership datafor some of the non-regulated organizations as a supply proxy.However, membership in non-regulated organizations isvoluntary, and varies year-to-year by jurisdiction, so the numberof workers in unregulated occupations was likely under-represented. While a standardized supply data indicator template was distributed, the quality of the supply data varied considerably.The format of the original data received varied from electronicdatabases and spreadsheets (e.g. Excel, Quattro Pro, Access,Macintosh), to emails, surveys, annual reports and mailing lists.This made it necessary to clean supply data extensively prior toanalysis. For some organizations, the data request proved onerous in terms of resource effort required to compile data for the supplyindicators. In several cases, local associations sourced, and evenpaid for, supply data from their national counterparts. Some key data elements deemed essential for planning were either not available and/or not accessible. For example, of theage-related data initially requested from the 19 regulated healthprofessions in Nova Scotia, about half of them were able toprovide it. Additionally, several who did not provide it werefound to actually collect this information (based upon localregistration forms). Using a variety of different data sources,however, it was possible to report age information for 82% of thehealth workforce profiled for this study. There was also limited information available on the mobility of health care workers across provincial and internationalboundaries. With the exception of registered nurses andphysicians, there was no comprehensive data available, byoccupation, indicating how many health care workers move inand out of Nova Scotia each year. The timing of a data collection request can influence the quality and timeliness of the information received, due to associationsand/or regulatory bodies different registration periods. Forexample, the Nova Scotia Association of Social Workers (NSASW)requests annual registration information by the end of February,while the College of Registered Nurses and College of LicensedPractical Nurses require annual registration by October 31. Otherassociations had calendar year or other fiscal year registrationperiods. Analysis of trend information for some occupations was complicated by the timing of the introduction of legislationgoverning the licensing of health professionals. For increases insupply over time may, in fact, simply represent the requirementfor practitioners to become licensed, rather than actual increasesin supply. For instance, the Physiotherapists Act was passed inNOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDY 251998. The supply of physiotherapists in Nova Scotia went from 333 workers in the early 1990s to 422 workers in 1998. It was notpossible to determine if this growth was the result of largernumbers of practicing physiotherapists or the introduction oflicensure requirements. To remedy gaps in supply data provided by the Associations and Regulatory Bodies, and to obtain more complete information forunregulated occupations, data was obtained and utilized fromother local and national sources. As an example, demographicage data for occupational groups working primarily in a hospitalsetting, such as medical radiation and medical laboratorytechnologists, was derived from demographic informationreported by each DHA as well as data reported by local andnational associations. This enabled the building of a morecomplete profile for each occupation and provided anopportunity to crosscheck the supply data obtained from theregulatory bodies and professional associations. 1.2.4.2 Education and Training Data IssuesEducation and training information on funding, programs, students, faculty and clinical education placements was notavailable from a central source. This made it challenging tocollect information necessary for planning on an ongoing basis.For instance: Comprehensive faculty demographic data was mostly limited to St. Francis Xavier and the Faculty of Medicine at Dalhousie; While MPHEC was able to provide much of the requested information, there were caveats. MPHEC was unable to provideinformation on the number of applicants or first yearenrolments, so applicant to enrolment ratios, a key measure ofstudent competitiveness for entry into programs, werecalculated from in-field data collected and provided by theindividual educational institutions; MPHEC program enrolment data was only available for all years of program study (versus program enrolment by year of study). Thus, MPHEC data could not be used to derive programattrition rates on a year-to-year basis; A challenge in providing trend data from 1990 to 2001 was a shift in 1999 from the University Student Information System(USIS) to the Enhanced Student Information System (ESIS).Data was extracted from both systems to fulfill the request,but required some programming to do so; and MPHEC was unable to provide information on \"highest level of completed prior education\", as this element was not collectedin USIS. Statistics Canada has defined a highest level ofeducation element in its ESIS system. However, if aninstitution currently did not store this information, they were not required to populate the element. MPHEC sampled the1999-00 and 2000-01 data with regard to this data element andunfortunately, at the time of the query, all Nova Scotiainstitutions reported \"99\" (i.e. unknown). The availability and accessibility of data from the individual education institutions was also significantly affected by changesin technology. The installation of new information systems atDalhousie restricted access to education records to three years,limiting trend analysis. As well, St Frances Xavier had recentlyconverted its information system, and could not easily accessolder data. Basic information on student enrolments was not reported in a standardized format. For example, Dalhousie reported totalprogram enrolments by people count for each academic year,whereas St FX reported total program enrolments on a fullcourse equivalent basis. This made it more difficult to comparestudent characteristics across programs and educationalinstitutions. 1.2.4.3 Management and Employment Data IssuesTechnology played a major role in determining the accessibility of data. In acute care settings, no common software system wasin place, with multiple human resource (HR) software systemsexisting both between and within DHA settings. As well, withineach facility, demographic and financial related HR informationis typically housed separately, so the gathering of thisinformation proved resource intensive. Within continuing care facilities, facility size mattered, relative to data infrastructure and data reporting capabilities. For the mostpart, larger facilities were able to respond electronically, but theyencountered many software reconciliation challenges. Thesmaller facilities responded mostly on a manual basis, but werechallenged by the lack of resources in responding to the breadthof data indicators requested. The response rate in continuingcare facilities ranged from 28% for Residential Care Facilities to47% for nursing home facilities. As there was no central repository of employment-related data to provide information at the occupation level, employeeclassifications (1,000+ in acute care) were assigned and validatedby each DHA to an occupational group. This matching processenabled individual employees to be rolled up from theirclassification level to their occupation level, by facility and byDHA. Similarly, over 220 classifications were assigned to about15 occupations in continuing care. The employment datacollection, preparation, analysis and validation process resultedin a significant and iterative change of scope for this activity.26 NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDY2.0 HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES IN CONTEXT Health Human Resources (HHR) planning is still in its early days, with most planning activity a response to recent shortages inkey health professions. The planning that has taken place hasgenerally been limited to physicians and nurses, with limitedattention given to other health occupations and to the role ofunregulated and unpaid health care providers. A review of health care systems in Australia, France, Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom, completed in March 2003 bythe Canadian Health Services Research Foundation (CHSRF) forthe Advisory Committee on HHR of the Federal/Provincial/Territorial Conference of Deputy Ministers of Health, declared it\"remarkable that the market for human resources in health carehas been relatively under-researched and under-managed in alldeveloped countries (sic) health systems.\" 2 Among other conclusions, the review found that: All countries have a partial approach to planning and ignore relationships between health professionals; Despite attempts to plan, all countries have experienced cycles of shortages and surpluses of health professionals, usually inthe nursing workforce; Performance problems are perpetuated by poor access to information, weak management and an absence of systematiccontinuing education and re-accreditation; and While there is some control of overall staff numbers, little or no attention has been paid to the distribution of medical andnursing staff between specialties and regions. 3 2.1 NATIONAL INITIATIVES IN CANADA Governments in Canada gave joint formal recognition to theissues surrounding HHR in September 2000 when First Ministersagreed to coordinate their efforts on the supply of doctors,nurses and other health care personnel. This was followed up ayear later with an agreement by provincial premiers to improveplanning and co-operation on training and recruitment. A number of national Human Resources Development Canada (HRDC) studies are underway, or recently completed, including: Nursing Sector Study; National Human Resource Study of Canadian Physicians; Canadian Home Care Human Resources Study; The Oral Health Care Human Resources Study; Pharmacy Occupational Study; and Social Workers' Occupational Study. In 2001, HRDC launched a two-phase study designed to develop a long-term labour market strategy for nurses. The CanadianMedical Forum is leading a study of Canadian doctors, with thegoal being to develop a physician human resource strategy. The National Home Care Resources study is a three-phase effort todetermine priorities for meeting human resources needs in thegrowing home care sector. Sectoral studies were also initiated atthe national level for pharmacy, oral health care, and social work. Despite this activity, both the federal Commission on the Future of Health Care in Canada (the Romanow Commission) and theSenate Committee on Social Affairs, Science and Technology(Kirby Committee) presaged many of the findings of theinternational review in its comments on the state of HHRplanning in this country. For instance, the Romanow report,released in 2002, found that HHR planning in Canada is plaguedwith several problems, for example: There is little evidence that planning adequately considers population demographics and trends, the broaderdeterminants of health, specific needs of patients or the skillsand knowledge of health care providers; Planning approaches are often based on one-time estimates focusing on a single discipline; HHR policies focus on quick fix solutions; Lack of adequate planning has led to over-use of casual and part-time workers, contributing to a declining quality of worklife; and Planning has been limited to individual provincial, territorial and community initiatives and lack national co-ordination. 4 The Romanow Report pointed out the limited informationavailable on effective strategies for encouraging differentmembers of the workforce to work together, and the lack ofstandardized HHR information to make possible tracking ofsupply and trends from province to province. The Report calledfor action to fill the gaps in information on trends in supply,distribution, mobility, and composition across the country. \"Thisinformation base is essential for long-term effective planning forthe future of Canada's health workforce.\" 5 The lack of co-ordination among various HHR initiativesunderway was also seen as a concern. Romanow recommendeda leadership role in addressing HHR issues for the proposedHealth Council of Canada, working with the existingintergovernmental Advisory Committee on HHR and employingthe research and analysis capabilities of Canadian Institute forHealth Information (CIHI) and the CHSRF \"to address long-termissues and make a lasting and profound change in the future ofCanada's health workforce.\" 6 The Kirby Report also suggested a possible role for a nationalcoordinating body for HHRs, to be composed of representativesof key stakeholder groups and of the different levels ofgovernment. The Kirby Report proposed a possible mandatewould include: 2. Bloor, Karen and Alan Maynard, \"Planning human resources in health care: towards an economic approach.

The Kirby Report also suggested the federal government work with provincial governments to ensure that various educationand training programs for health care providers receive fundingrequired to permit necessary enrolment expansion. Furthermore,that student loan programs be available to health careprofessionals and that modifications be made to ensure theimpact of increases in tuition fees does not lead to barriers forstudents in lower socio-economic circumstances. Increasingrepresentation of students with aboriginal backgrounds inmedical and nursing programs was also seen as a priority. 2.2 PROVINCIAL HHR INITIATIVES IN CANADA The responsibility for coordination and implementation of HHR planning initiatives typically rests within provincial healthministries. Some provinces have established separate advisorycommittees and working groups to assist in ongoing HHRplanning activities. The committees, comprised of keystakeholder representatives, serve as a resource to provideproactive advice to government and ensure provincial HHRplanning efforts are coordinated. Table 2.1 summarizes commonthemes of HHR initiatives introduced recently by provincialgovernments.Current or impending shortages in the supply of health occupations have resulted in the introduction by provincialgovernments of an assortment of recruitment and retentioninitiatives. To date, the overwhelming focus of these initiativeshas been on physicians and nurses, with modest attention paidto other occupations. However, growing recognition of shortagesof other occupations has led several jurisdictions to identifyfuture priorities for recruitment and retention for a number ofallied health occupations. The most common strategy adopted by provinces to address supply shortages includes increasing enrolments in educationand training programs. Nearly every province has approvedfunding for increased enrolments in nursing and physicianeducation programs and several provinces have expandedenrolment (or increased out of province seat purchases) in alliedhealth education programs. Payment of financial incentives tostudents and/or practicing workers is also a popular approachadopted by provinces, including bursary and debt repaymentplans. Incentives to practicing physicians and nurses are alsocommon, which include funding for relocation, signing bonusesand guaranteed minimum annual billings for physicians in ruralareas. Return for service requirements are a norm for manyprovinces. A more recent focus of recruitment initiatives involves addressing quality of work-life concerns. Increasingly, work lifebalance issues are noted as a priority for nurses and physicians.There is an increasing focus on professional practice issuesassociated with physicians practicing in rural and remotecommunities, such as on-call responsibilities and lack of accessto continuing medical education opportunities. A number ofprovinces have initiated task forces and working groups to studynursing work life issues. Approaches used to improve the qualityof nurses work life include early assistance and return to workprograms, funding for equipment (e.g. patient lifts and lift teams)and more flexible scheduling arrangements. HHR Planning & Coordination Responsibility of DOH policy/planning Working groups and Advisory Committees: - 'Functional' working groups (data, planning methodology,education) - Nurse and physician - Allied Health Regulatory/Legislative Advisory BoardsRecruitment & Retention Focused on Physicians/Nurses Education Enrolments Direct Financial Incentives Quality of Work Life Evaluation FrameworksEducation & Training Continuing Education Clinical Placements/ Preceptor support Credential Creep Distance Education Accelerated Program Delivery Cooperative Education/TrainingQuality of Work Life Provider Health Workplace Environment Leadership Capacity Orientation PracticesLegislation & Regulation Risk-based Regulatory Models Scopes of Practice Collaborative Practice Agreements and DelegatedMedical Acts MobilityTable 2.1: HHR Provincial Initiatives in Canada - Common Themes28 NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDYOther strategies being used to address shortages include: Developing promotional material, participation in job fairs and advertising in national and international publications; Streamlining the credentialing process (assessing prior education and skills to practice) of international medicalgraduates; Training certain health professionals to substitute for occupations in underserved areas, and greater use of multi-skilling; Expanding of rural training opportunities and 'adopt a student' programs; and Changing admission policies of medical schools to increase rural intake A drawback of the various recruitment initiatives being offered is that few mechanisms exist to assess their effectiveness andsuccess. Recruitment incentives are often implemented withoutan evaluation framework, so it becomes difficult to determinetheir effectiveness over time. Some provinces have establishedcommittees to monitor the implementation of recruitment andretention strategies, including the identification of specifictargets and performance indicators. Unfortunately, theseinstances are still rare. In addition to increasing enrolment in education programs other priority areas for education and training include improvingaccess to continuing education opportunities and distanceeducation opportunities. A recent priority for some provincesincludes improving the coordination of clinical placements andthe introduction of greater support for preceptors. There isincreasing recognition that inadequate resources for clinicalplacements and availability of preceptors is a key barrier to theexpansion of health discipline education programs. Scope of practice is clearly a priority for most jurisdictions. Most provinces are examining their professional legislation andregulation in an attempt to allow occupations to practice to thefull extent of their qualifications and abilities. For example,legislation authorizing the practice of nurse practitioners hasbeen passed in a number of jurisdictions, including Nova Scotia.These regulatory changes are typically accompanied by policiesand collaborative practice agreements to outline respective rolesand responsibilities. Provinces have also introduced legislativeand regulatory changes to comply with the Mutual RecognitionAgreement on Internal Trade.2.3 NOVA SCOTIA HHR PLANNING INITIATIVES Like other jurisdictions, Nova Scotia's initial efforts in HHR planning were designed to deal with short-term problems, andwere focused at the provincial level on physicians, nurses andmore recently, medical laboratory technologists and advancedcare paramedics. Beginning in 2001, Nova Scotia, as did the other Atlantic Provinces, undertook comprehensive studies of its HHR as partof regionally-funded HRDC initiatives. HHR planning activitieshave also been included in broader strategic health plans. TheNova Scotia Department of Health 2003-04 business plan pointsout that HHR are one of the biggest challenges facing theCanadian health system. The business plan outlines four keyinitiatives in support of the high priority placed on the areas ofrecruitment, retention, and retraining of health careprofessionals. Specific initiatives supporting nurses, medicallaboratory technologists and physicians are described. Originally introduced in 2001, the Nursing Strategy for 2003-04 includes funding support for additional seats in acceleratednursing, Licensed Practical Nursing (LPN) - Registered Nursing(RN) bridging, baccalaureate nursing programs and a continuedfocus on orientation, continuing and specialty education tosupport recruitment, retention and renewal of the nursingworkforce. In addition, the business plan announced that: Nova Scotia will offer bursary assistance and purchase seats in the New Brunswick Community College system to increase thenumber of medical laboratory technologists. In the 2003-04 academic year eight new seats are to be added to the first year class of the Dalhousie Faculty of Medicine. An ongoing priority for the Department of Health is to develop, pilot, recommend and oversee the implementation of acomprehensive physician resource plan for Nova Scotia. APhysician Resource Planning Steering Committee has a mandateto develop and apply a methodology for determining theoptimum number and distribution of physicians by type andlevel of service. The Committee is currently engaged in aprovincial consultation process with physicians. Your Health Matters , released by the DOH in 2003 advocated a new approach to training, recruiting and retaining health careprofessionals. \"Health care professionals must also be supportedin doing their jobs differently - working in teams to balance theirworkloads more efficiently and improve care to patients\". 7 7. Nova Scotia Department of Health, \"Your Health Matters: Working Together Toward Better Health Care,\" 2003, p.17NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDY 29In 2001, the Health Care Human Resource Sector Council (HCHRSC) completed a Baseline Assessment of the ContinuingCare Labour Force in Nova Scotia. The HCHRSC also completed aHuman Resource Issues Study in Continuing Care in October of2002. 2.4 ATLANTIC CANADA HHR PLANNING INITIATIVES Each of the Atlantic provinces has recently undertaken studies of its HHR. As part of these regionally funded HRDC initiatives, thenumber of health occupations studied in Atlantic Canada hasexpanded from the traditional consideration of physicians andnurses to include registered nurses, licensed practical nurses,physicians and allied health professionals in Newfoundland; 30or so occupations respectively in Nova Scotia and NewBrunswick, and more than 50 occupations in Prince EdwardIsland. Education and training is an important component of HHR. Although the Atlantic Provinces are inter-dependent ineducation and training, the planning of HHR has traditionallyoccurred independently within provincial and local health regionboundaries. Concurrent with its provincial baseline assessment of its own HHR, Nova Scotia led in the preparation of a project proposal insupport of a broader Atlantic initiative. In 2002-03, Nova Scotiaworked in consultation with health and educationrepresentatives from each Atlantic province in coordinating thedevelopment of this joint initiative, which would incorporate aregional HHR planning perspective, with specific focus oneducation and training requirements. Each of the Atlantic provinces HRDC funded studies on its HHR would be key inputs to the proposed Atlantic Study (AtlanticEducation/Training Planning for Health Disciplines). The NovaScotia Study has already started to build the foundation for thisproposed Atlantic initiative by examining provincial educationand training issues related to health disciplines and by compilingan inventory of training programs and statistics for the healthprofessions. The intent of the joint HRDC funded project is towork with educational institutions to establish an integrated information base to better enable informed decision-making on production, recruitment, funding, and accountability foreducation and training of health disciplines in the AtlanticRegion.3.0 THE HEALTH CARE ENVIRONMENT 3.1 EMERGING HEALTH CARE CHALLENGES HHR Planning does not exist in a vacuum. To be successful, it must be integrated into overall health care planning, anactivity which has been described as a \"somewhat messy andunfinished project...always ... a work in progress.\" 8 This 'messiness' derives from the fact that health careplanning in general and HHR planning in particular are subjectto a range of forces. These are changing the health care systemfrom one focused on hospitals, doctors and nurses to one thatincludes the community and involves the whole range ofhealth care providers. Decter (2000) has evoked the image of \"Four Strong Winds\" to describe the challenges facing health care, listing those windsof change as: A focus on wellness; New technologies; Changing consumer expectations; and Demands for fiscal accountability and value. 9 There are other forces - including demographics, decentralizingof decision-making and legislative and regulatory factors - whichare influencing the health care environment as well. They aredealt with later in Section 3, but first a look at each of the fourwinds of change. One of the more significant is the focus on wellness , which represents a new way of thinking about the health caresystem. It is no longer considered sufficient just to manageillness or to judge success solely by procedures performed orpatients served. Most governments have adopted definitions ofhealth similar to that of the World Health Organization (WHO),which recognizes health as \"more than the absence of disease,as a resource for everyday living.\" 10Under this formulation, population health status can be measured - for example - interms of: Self-rating - in 1996-97, 25% of Canadians described their health as excellent, 38% rated it very good; Positive mental health - in 1994-95, 49% of Canadians reported high self-esteem; General health and function - in 1996-97, one-third of Canadians described themselves as problem free, with over90% indicating a high level of health; 8.

Federal, Provincial and Territorial Advisory Committee on Population Health, \"Statistical Report on the Health of Canadians,\" 1999, p.215 30 NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDY Long-term activity limitation - in 1996-97 almost four million Canadians reported a disability or handicap or being limitedon a continuing basis because of a health problem; and Rates of obesity, allergies, teen pregnancies and underweight births, measured over time. Hand-in-hand with a broader definition of health is a growing recognition that many socio-economic and environmentalfactors determine health status. As the Romanow Commissionreported: During our public hearings, many presentations focused on the need to improve our understanding of the determinants of health. I heardthat the quality of the air we breathe, of the water we drink, and ofthe food we eat directly affects our health and our health caresystem. I learned that educated, employed and physically activeCanadians are far more likely to be healthy than those who are not,and that spiritual, emotional and physical well-being are ofteninextricably linked. I also heard that lifestyle changes can markedlyreduce the incidence and severity of many major and debilitatingdiseases. 11 By way of quantifying the impact of health determinants, theinter-governmental committee on Population Health, reportingin 1999, found that only 19% of respondents with less than ahigh school education rated their health as excellent,compared with almost 30% of university graduates. 12The committee also found that Canadians with the lowest incomewere five times more likely than those with the highest toreport their health as only fair or poor, 13while unemployed people have a disproportionate share of health problems,including depression, other forms of morbidity and reducedlife expectancy. 14Nova Scotia's Clinical Services Steering Committee found a positive correlation between theprevalence of low income in a population and greater hospitalutilization. 15 New technologies are already having a major impact, but have an even greater potential to improve health outcomes forCanadians, particularly in the area of information technology.A comprehensive system of information management willallow health care providers, managers and policy makers toshare information, while electronic health records, currentlyused by only a small fraction of health providers, will be animportant element in better diagnosis and treatment ofpatients. The Romanow Commission argued that electronicrecords will improve efficiency by eliminating the time-consuming task of managing paper records, and providepatients with easy access to their personal health careinformation. But the Report also points out that advances intechnology create ethical issues, particularly in areas likebiotechnology and patient privacy, and challenge human resource managers to ensure there are programs in place totrain people to manage and operate new health technologies The Romanow Commission found that consumer expectations were primarily focused on improvements in waiting times forcertain diagnostic and surgical procedures. However, otherssuggest there will be wider pressures from consumers tomeasure quality and appropriateness of care. Romanowrecommended that a national system of electronic healthrecords include a system similar to on-line banking: ...where individuals could log onto the system using a personal identification number. At the click of a mouse, they would haveaccess not only to their personal health information but also to abroader base of general information on health issues. With thisinformation, individuals can play a more direct role in managing their own health. 16 Just as consumers are asking more from the health caresystem, so are governments. They not only fund 70% of the costs but are responsible for the smooth running of thesystem on behalf of consumers and voters. Faced with fiscal constraints , governments are demanding accountability and value for money spent on health care. For example, in conjunctionwith Canadian Institution of Health Information (CIHI), Ontariohas been publishing annual report cards on the performanceof hospitals across the Province. The Romanow Commission,even while urging substantial new investment in health care,echoed the theme of accountability when it bemoaned the factthat \"we know far more about the resources and the dollarsbeing spent than we do about the return on thoseinvestments.\" 17 The accuracy of the \"wind\" forecasts and the timeliness with which decision-makers respond to their shifts willcontinue to be a matter of debate. Nevertheless, there is agrowing conviction among governments and health careexperts that the system established 40 years ago must bechanged. The direction of change, towards what Romanowcalled \"a seamless, integrated array of services to Canadians,from prevention, to promotion to primary care, to hospital,community, mental health, home and end-of-life services\", 18 will have a profound impact on HHR planning. 3.2 AN EVOLVING SYSTEM OF SERVICE DELIVERY The seamless, integrated service delivery system is evolving albeit slowly. There has been a move away from hospital-basedcare by doctors and nurses, to alternative delivery systems.While new technology and procedures have allowed patients 11.

Moreover, changes which have taken place in service delivery have often been reactive or driven by the need to cut costs,with negative consequences for HHR planning. As Romanow(2002) states: \"for the past two decades, continuing changes inhow health care services are delivered, combined with effortsto contain costs in every province and territory, have takentheir toll on Canada's health workforce.\" 19Now, however, that workforce is being challenged again by the need to re-designroles and change scopes of practice to deliver an integrated,comprehensive and community-based approach to healthcare. 3.2.1 Primary Care Reform Primary care refers to the initial point of contact betweenindividuals and the health system. Traditionally, primary caredelivery has been provided by family doctors and generalpractitioners, operating solo or in small group practices. It hasfocused on service delivery. Reform is predicated on the notionthat offering a wider range of services - primary health care -through inter-disciplinary teams will better support the healthand wellness of the population. 20 The vision foresees a range of health care providerscollaborating with government departments, the private sectorand community organizations. Population health will improvethrough a community-based primary health care system thattends to the health needs of the population while placinggreater emphasis on prevention, health promotion and onmeasures to influence the determinants of health. In a more immediate time frame, primary care reforms may also alleviate pressure on hospital emergency departmentsand provide solutions to the shortage of family doctors insome areas. The Kirby Committee envisaged care beingprovided by group practices or clinics, operating 24 hours aday, seven days a weeks, with the method of compensatingdoctors changed from fee-for-service to some form of blendedremuneration combining capitation, fee-for-service and otherincentives. 21 3.2.2 The Nova Scotia Response Nova Scotia has been moving toward primary care reform forat least a decade. The recommendations of a 1994 task forcereport led to a decentralization of health system governancethrough the establishment of District Health Authorities(DHAs) and Community Health Boards (CHBs)withresponsibility for assessing and planning for community health needs. In 2000, the Strengthening Primary CareInitiative was established, with demonstration projects in four communities. The Initiative allowed for evaluation ofcollaborative practice models, information managementapproaches, and alternative compensation options forphysicians. In February, 2001, the Nova Scotia Clinical Services Steering Committee filed its report, noting that \"the health care systemhas, and will continue to evolve, towards a decreased relianceon in-patient acute services.\" 22The Committee report went on to say that the quality of our health care system will no longerbe judged by the number of beds and the number of hospitals.\"Services must be in the right place with the right resourcesfor Nova Scotians. 23 Also in 2001, the Nova Scotia government appointed anAdvisory Committee on Primary Health Care Renewal, whichreleased its report in May, 2003. The report recommended anincremental approach to primary health care, leadingeventually to a primary health care system offering: Basic emergency services Communicable disease prevention and control Community mental health services Community supports Continuing care Dental health services Environmental health services Health promotion (including community development) Healthy child development Nutrition services Primary maternity care Prevention and treatment of common diseases and injuries Rehabilitation services Sexual health and family planning Other publicly funded services (housing, income assistance, occupational health and safety etc.) It will be some time before such a primary health care system is fully implemented in Nova Scotia. In the meantime,however, the direction of health care planning is clear. NovaScotia is moving away from traditional models of care andservice delivery based on hospitals and doctors' offices. It ismoving toward community-based models that place greateremphasis on multi-disciplinary teams and networks ofproviders working together to address patient care needs. The evolving system of care will pose a number of human resource issues. Nova Scotia, like every other province andterritory, is already challenged to educate and train, recruit andmaintain enough health providers, and/or to convince them tomove to under-serviced areas. Now there is an additional 19. Ibid, p.91 20. Nova Scotia Advisory Committee on Primary Health Care Renewal, \"Primary Health Care Renewal: Action for Healthier Nova Scotians,\" 2003, p.vii 21. Senate Committee on Social Affairs, Science and Technology 22. Steering Committee, op. cut, p. 9 23. Ibid, p.1132 NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDYchallenge, to encourage providers to adapt to changing roles, re-examine scopes of practice and acquire the skills neededfor a new system of service delivery. Among the demands that may be made of health providers: Acceptance of change in work routines; Changed relationships with other health professionals; Understanding of team behaviors; and Ability to form partnerships with families, community members or complementary providers. Policy makers will also face new demands and challenges. They will need to ensure HHR policies and initiatives gobeyond physicians and nurses to include other members of thehealth care team. In addition, the education and training ofnew health providers will need to be revised to reflect newmethods of service delivery. Finally, as the RomanowCommission has suggested, \"sensitive issues such as wagesettlements, scopes of practice and working conditions willneed to be addressed in an open and direct way.\" 24 In addition to these general issues, the DOH business plan for2003-04 describes a number of specific activities and initiativeswhich will likely affect HHR planning. These include: (1) A \"Diversity and Social Inclusion in Primary Health Care\" initiative to involve primary health care leaders andculturally diverse populations in developing guidelines andpolicies that address diversity and social inclusion issues inprimary health; (2) A plan to improve French language health services for the approximately 37,000 Nova Scotians whose first language isFrench; (3) Development and implementation of a provincial palliative care service delivery model; (4) Finalization of the methodology to determine the optimum size, scope, and distribution of continuing care services; (5) Enhancement of cardiac care and development of a coordinated approach to planning and delivering cardiacservices; (6) Enhancement of the \"Healthy Beginnings\" home visiting program; (7) Implementation of core service standards and development of a monitoring plan for appropriate, effective mentalhealth services; (8) Negotiation of Alternative funding remuneration for physicians; and (9) Development of Nova Scotia-specific health indicators reports and other accountability and progress reports.3.2.3 Demographics - An Aging Population Nova Scotia's population, like all of Canada's, has been getting older. As table 3.1 shows, between 1991 and 2002,the percentage of Nova Scotia's population aged 65 and overincreased from 12.5% to 13.6%. The 65+ population in thecountry as a whole jumped by one third (Table 3.2) in the 20year span from 1980 to 2000. Table 3.1: 65+ Population in Nova Scotia, 1991 and 2002 Year Pop. 65+ % pop. 65+ 1991 114,272 12.5% 2002 Statistics Canada Table 3.2: Growth in 65+ Population in Canada, 1980, 1990 and 2000 Year % 65+ Change from 1980 1980 9.4% \u2014 1990 11.3% 20.2% 2000 12.5% 33.0% Source: Statistics Canada Nationally, the population is expected to get slightly youngerlater in this decade, with the 65+ and older group declining to11.5% of the population by 2011. However, when the first of thebaby boom generation (those born between 1946 and 1966)begin to turn 65 in 2011, the age of the population will start toincrease rapidly. Statistics Canada estimates that thoseindividuals over 65 will account for 17% of the population in2016, 19% % in 2021 and 21% in 2026. 25For Nova Scotia, the elderly will account for an even greater share of thepopulation, rising to 25% in 2026. Figure 3.1, shows the shift that will take place in the dependency of the young (0-14 yrs) and old (65+ yrs) on itsworking population (15-64 yrs). Over the next 15 years (2001-2016), because of declining birth rates, the dependency of theyouth on the working population will decline (5%). Similarly,as the 65+ population increases over this timeframe, thedependency of the elderly on its working population willincrease (5%). 24. Romanow ,op.cit. p.9225. Statistics Canada website, \"Population projections for 2001, 2006, 2011, 2016, 2021 and 2026, July 1,\" Updated Sept. 11, 2003.NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDY 33As the figure indicates, there is a 10 to 15 year period before the growing population of seniors causes a significant increasein the overall burden on the working age population.In the interim, preparing to meet the health needs of an olderpopulation will complement the changes in health caredelivery arising from primary care reform. Providing care to alarger population of seniors will likely mean the expansion ofservices in areas such as home care and long term care. It willprovide opportunities to further develop a team approach,involving health professionals, volunteers and familymembers. It will encourage the use of relevant technologies. 3.3 FUNDING HEALTH CARE AND HUMAN RESOURCES The health industry is labour intensive, with up to 70 cents of every dollar paid out in wages, salaries, and fees for healthcare workers. The overall financial shape of the health caresystem will have a major bearing on our ability to attract,train, and retain the health workers we needed. 3.3.1 Expenditure Patterns In the current (2003-04) fiscal year, Nova Scotia provincialgovernment spending on health is expected to total more than$2 billion (Figure 3.2). It is estimated that almost half of thetotal (43.6%) will be spent on acute care, with medicalpayments the next largest expenditure at $425.7 million(20.2%).During the 1990s Nova Scotia, like most other provinces and territories across Canada, focused its health reforms onrestructuring of hospital services. A common theme associatedwith health reforms has been reduced reliance on acute carehospitals and increased reliance on the broader health system.This is reflected in the reduction of the provincial share ofhealth expenditures accounted for by hospitals over the pasttwo decades. The percentage of total expenditure for hospitalcare decreased from 48% of total expenditures in 1980 to 38%in 2000 (Figure 3.3).15 Year SpanFigure 3.1: Youth and Old Age Dependency on Working Population in Canada Percentage50% 40%30%20%10% 0% Year 81 86 91 96 01 06 11 16 21 26 31 36 41Future Youth (0-14 Working Care Program Spending (DOH), NS, 2003-04 Other 7% Public Health Services 1% Care 6% 11% Medical Payments 20%Acute Care 44% Source: Province of Nova Scotia, Estimates, 2002-03, 2003-04 Figure 3.3: Percentage Distribution of Preliminary Nova Scotia Health Expenditures by Use of Funds1980 and 2000, Current Dollars 1980Hospitals Other Institutions Physicians Other Professionals Drugs Capital Public CIHI34 NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDYThe reduction in the proportion of spending for hospitals is reflected in the decline in acute care usage in Nova Scotia.Rates of use of acute care beds, as measured by patient daysper 1,000 population, went from 1,396 days per 1,000population in 1992-93 to 860 days per 1,000 population in 2000-01. 26This downward trend seems to have plateaued in recent years, and it is possible that further investments in home carein Canada may not allow further reduction in acute carerequirements. 27 An examination of more recent expenditures in Nova Scotia,reveals hospital expenditures continue to rise, albeit at aslower pace than in four other areas - emergency healthservices, home/community care services, long term careservices and pharmacare services, all of which are increasingat a rate of 10-15% a year (Table 3.3) in recent years. Table 3.3: Change in Expenditure by Health Care Category, Nova Scotia, Estimates 2002-03, 2003-04 The result is that the share of the health care dollar consumed by these four areas is estimated to increase from 22.1% in2000-01 to 24.2% in 2003-04 (Figure 3.4). In comparison, theshare consumed by hospitals and physicians is expected todrop to 63.7% in 2003-04 from 66.5% in 2000-01.3.3.2 Expenditure Levels The 2002 edition of National Health Expenditure Trends published by CIHI, estimated that Nova Scotians, on average, spent$3,304.02 each on health goods and services. About 70% of thisexpense ($2,296) was spent on their behalf by the three levelsof government (federal, provincial and municipal). Theremaining 30% ($1,007) came from private sources, eitherdirectly out-of-pocket or from private health insurance. Thistotal figure of over $3,300 per head, represents three timesmore than Nova Scotians spent per person on health care thanin 1982. Even when inflation is accounted for, per capitaspending in 2002 was more than 70% higher than what it wastwenty years ago (i.e. $2,940 in 2002 vs $1,711 in 1982 per NovaScotian). Such increases have led to questions about whether or not we can still afford and sustain our health care system. One way ofanswering that question is to look not just at how much moreis being spent on health care, but what it represents as aproportion of how much more there is to spend on everythingelse - measured as the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In 2002, the GDP was $27,986.88 for each Nova Scotian. Out of that, $3,304.02 was spent on health care, or 11.8 %. In 1982, ourGDP was $10,681.39 per head, out of which was spent$1,068.72, or 10%, on health. In the last 20 years there has beenan 18% increase, less than 1% a year - in the health industry'sshare of the Nova Scotia economy. As the table shows, growthin the country as a whole was somewhat greater, at just over1% a year (Table 3.4). Table 3.4: Change in Health Spending per Capita as % of GDP, Canada and Nova Scotia, 1982 and 2002 GDP/ Health/ Health/ GDP/ Health/ Health/ Capita Capita GDP Capita Capita GDP Change 1982 1982 1982 2002 2002 2002 82-02 At 11.8% of the GDP, Nova Scotia ranks fifth among Provinces, behind Manitoba and the other Atlantic provinces. In contrast,Alberta spent only 7.6% of its GDP on health care. 26. Department of Health 2000-2001 Statistical Report 27. Understanding Canada's Health Care Costs, Interim ReportLTC / EHS / Home Care / PharmacareFigure 3.4: Health Care Program Spending 2000-01 and 2003-04 (est.) HUMAN RESOURCES STUDY 35Even though health spending accounts for a significantly greater share of Nova Scotia's GDP than the national average,this does not mean that Nova Scotia spends more per capitaon health. The reason for the higher percentage of healthspending per capita is that the denominator, GDP per capita, ismuch lower in Nova Scotia. As Table 3.5 shows, total per capitahealth spending ($3,304) in Nova Scotia, public and private, isactually the second lowest among the provinces and territoriesand is 7.5% below the national average ($3,572). Table 3.5: Total Health Expenditure per Capita by Province and Territory, 2002 (Forecast) Province/Territory $ per Capita Nunavet $6,467 North West Territories $6,142 Yukon $4,568 Source: \"National Health Expenditure Trends,\" 2002, CIHI Another factor to consider is that increases in health care spending have been moderating for most of the last decade.During the 1980s the increase both nationally and in NovaScotia was considerably higher than it has been the last tenyears. As table 3.6 shows, in constant dollars health care spending increased at a rate of approximately 4.5% a year from 1982 to1992 in both Nova Scotia and nationally. But in the most recentdecade from 1992 to 2002, increases averaged 3.75% per yearnationally and less than 3% annually in Nova Scotia. Table 3.6: Comparative Rates of Increase in Health Expenditure, Nova Scotia and Canada, 1997 Constant Dollars 1982 1992 % Inc. 2002 % Inc. Nova Scotia CIHI3.3.3 Financial Impact of Aging Population Adding an important dimension to the debate about thesustainability of the health care system are these facts: ourpopulation is aging, and more money is spent on health careas people age. Health expenditures for seniors aged 65+ represented 46.9% of the total expenditures in Nova Scotia in 2001, while seniorsaccounted for just 13.2% of the population (Figure 3.5). Healthexpenditures for seniors age 65+ were $10,451 per capita in2000-01, more than triple the average spending of $2,938 perNova Scotian overall. Usage by Canadians aged 65+ varied by type of service, ranging from 86.4% of expenditures on non-hospital institutions likelong-term care facilities, to 27.8% for physicians (Table 3.7).In most categories, expenditure on persons aged 65+ hasrecorded a slow but steady increase over the last two decades. Table 3.7: Percentage of Expenditure by Category for Persons 65+, Selected Years, Canada, 1980-2001 Other Other Home Other Hospitals Institutions Physicians Professions A notable exception is drug expenditure, which includesprescription and non-prescription drugs as well as personalhealth supplies. Although overall drug expenditures increasedalmost 10-fold between 1980 and 2001, from $450 million to$4.443 billion, drug expenditures by Canadians over 65 yearsincreased a more modest six fold.Figure 3.5: Percentage Distribution of Total Health Expenditure by Age Group, Nova Scotia Source: National Health Expenditure Trends, 2002, CIHI36 NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDYTable 3.8 compares the health expenditure on seniors 65 years and over, by expenditure category in Nova Scotia with thenational pattern. In 2000-01, Nova Scotia spent about the samepercentage on hospital and home care services as the nationalaverage. The Province spent a significantly larger percentage ofits budget for physicians and drugs on seniors, and less on\"other institutions\" and \"other health professionals\". Table 3.8: Percentage Health Expenditures Over Age 65, Nova Scotia and Canada, 2000-01 Expenditure Category Nova Scotia Canada Hospitals 54.2% 54.7% Other 80.1% Health Expenditure 2002, CIHI As noted, the proportion of Nova Scotia's population 65 andolder is expected to increase to 25% of the population in 2026,up from 13.2% in 2001. The Romanow Commission considered the issue of aging population and played down the consequences of aging on thehealth care system. Romanow cited reports which indicatedthat aging alone will increase health spending by only about1% a year, and pointed out that countries that have alreadyexperienced aging populations have been able to managecosts. 28Another mitigating factor to consider is that we are spending less on the health care of individual seniors than wedid two decades ago. From 1980-81 to 2000-01, the share ofhealth expenditures for those aged 65 and over increased 22%while seniors' share of the population went up 33%. 29 The Romanow Report expressed optimism that futuregenerations of aging Canadians will continue the trend and be healthier than preceding ones, with fewer chronic andlifestyle-related health problems. Romanow contends that anaging population is not \"a catastrophe waiting to happen\" butit will have significant implications with respect to: higher incidence of elderly related diseases such as Altzheimer's and dementia; an increase in demand for health/personal care services linked to a decrease in one's independence; and increasing numbers of people who will require joint replacements.Another factor is the timing of this elderly population bulge. It will be nearly ten years before the first large cohort of babyboomers hit 65 years of age, so there is some time to prepare forthe impact of the aging population on the health care system. 3.3.4 Federal Health Transfers There are other issues raised by aging population that are of particular concern to Nova Scotia as a province with apopulation that is older than the national norm. All else beingequal, if the 2026 demographic had existed in 2001, total healthcosts would have been more than $1 billion higher. As Table 3.9 shows, all but two Provinces exceed the national average of 12.5% for population 65 years and over, and fourProvinces, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Nova Scotia and PEI, exceedit significantly. In the wake of federal-provincial agreements in2002 and 2003, federal funding is becoming a more importantpart of the overall health funding picture in Nova Scotia withtransfers under the Canada Health and Social Transfer (CHST)growing each of the last three years, as Table 3.10 shows.Although the CHST is not earmarked for health alone, increasesin recent years have been directed to health initiatives. Table 3.9: Percentage of Population 65+ Years by Province, 2000-01 Province 65+ % 3.10: CHST Transfers to Nova Scotia as Percentage of Provincial Government Health Spending, 2000-2004 Year $ CHST $ Health Spending NS Dept of Finance, 2002, 2003 28. Commission on the Future of Health Care in Canada, Final Report, 2002, p. 20 29. Health Canada, \"Health Expenditures in Canada be Age and Sex, 1980-81 to 2000-01, HighlightsNOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDY 37Unfortunately for Nova Scotia and other Provinces with older populations, federal health transfers are provided on a percapita basis and make no provision for the age structure or thehealth status of the population. Unless the formula is changedto recognize factors like an aging population, even greaterpressure will be placed on the Province's capacity to deal withdemographic challenges. 3.3.5 Public-Private Split Another factor to consider is the nature of the services used bythe older population and who pays for them. About 70% ofhealth care in Nova Scotia is paid for from public sources(taxes and assessments) and 30% from private sources. As thetable shows, the private share has been increasing over time asthe public share diminishes (Table 3.11). Table 3.11: Health Expenditure by Source of Funds Nova Scotia, Percentage, Selected Years Year 1975 1980 1990 1995 2000 2002(f) Public % 78.8 77.5 73.8 68.5 70.5 69.5 Private % 21.2 22.5 26.2 31.5 29.5 30.5 Source: \"National Health Expenditure Trends,\" 2002, of approximately 70% public and 30% privateexpenditures does not apply across all age groups. Figure 3.6shows, as individuals retire and lose the benefits of privateinsurance, they rely more on the public system. The three agegroups which are the highest percentage users of public sectorhealth care are those aged 65+. On average, Canadians 65 years and over obtain 78% of health services from the public sector, 22% from private. As Table 3.12 shows, in common with the overall population, Canadians65 years and over have been paying for an increasing share of health care services through private insurance plans or out-of-pocket.Table 3.12: Change in Public and Private Share of Health Expenditure by Age Group, 1980-2001, Canada Public : Private Public : Private Year Aged 65+ Years Population Overall 1980-81 83 : 17 74: 26 1990-91 82 : 18 73 : 27 1995-96 80 : 20 69 : 31 2000-01 78 : 22 69 : 31 Source: \"National Health Expenditure Trends,\" 2002, CIHI For Nova Scotians 65 years and over, the public and privateimbalance is greater, at 82% public and 18% private. An aging population will present challenges to Nova Scotia's health care system in the years ahead. However, as thepreceding analysis indicates, we have considerable time andfiscal resources to meet those challenges. To quote Romanow once again:...aging is not the ominous threat to future sustainability of our system that some would suggest. Aging will challenge and add coststo our health care system, but those costs can be managed,particularly if we begin to prepare and make adjustments toanticipate the impact of an aging population. 30 3.3.6 Impact on Health Human Resources With salaries estimated to account for about 70% of healthcare costs the financial challenges facing the province willimpact the health care workforce in a number of ways. Recruitment and retention of occupational groups in short supply will continue to be a challenge given the effgects ofglobalization and intense competition for scarce HHR in otherprovinces and countries. The province will increasingly betested by the challenge of balancing its fiscal responsibilitieswith the need to provide competitive wages and otherincentives in to attract and retain adequate numbers of healthcare workers to deliver services. In addressing compensation levels for health care workers, governments and public sector unions face a formidablechallenge. The need to address skill shortages in the labourmarket, and to recruit and retain knowledge workers, willincreasingly put upward pressures on wage costs at a timewhen the financial sustainability of the health care system isrelatively fragile.Figure 3.6: Health Expenditures by Source of Funds % Private Source: Health Canada 30. Commission on the Future of health Care in Canada, Final Report, 2002, p.2338 NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDY3.4 REGULATION OF HEALTH OCCUPATIONS 3.4.1 Overview of Health Occupation Regulation Governments regulate many things that people do, particularly if there is potential risk to the public from those activities.Across Canada, more than 30 different health professions areregulated by at least one province or territory, and the list isgrowing. Regulated health care workers in Nova Scotia must beregistered under provincial legislation in order to practice. Allprovinces have a self-governing model of occupational regulation, under which authority is delegated by legislation toa regulatory body (often referred to as a professional college)which governs the professional practice of its members in thepublic interest. The main objective of health profession legislation is to protect the public from harm arising from exposure to riskwhile receiving health care services. Occupational regulationprotects the public by establishing: Entry-level standards for those entering the profession (the education level, skills, and knowledge to be licensed); Standards of practice and a code of ethics to guide professionals in the performance of their duties; Continuing education or continuing competence requirements members must follow to maintain theircompetence throughout their career; and Procedures to assess complaints from the public and to discipline members. A key component of health profession legislation is a practice definition outlining the tasks that licensed members of theprofession may perform. Such tasks help to define theoccupation's scope of practice, by providing a legal definitionof its work. Some provincial statutes also contain provisionsregarding the supervision and delegation of tasks to otheroccupational groups. There are several kinds of systems used in Canada to regulate health care workers. 31Under a right to title model, legislation protects an occupation's title, so that only those registeredwith a regulatory body can use the title authorized by statute.However, under this model there is typically no formalrestriction in the tasks that can be performed by otheroccupational groups. This has also been referred to aspermissive or voluntary regulation models. 32 An exclusive scopes of practice model not only protects the use of an occupation's title, it restricts certain tasks to those who arelicensed to perform them. Members of a profession are grantedexclusive rights under the law to provide particular tasks oractivities to the public.Lastly, a controlled acts system restricts certain tasks or activities to certain occupations. Rather that granting each professionexclusive control over broadly defined areas of practice, onlyareas of practice that carry serious risk of harm, if performedincorrectly, are restricted through legislation. All otheractivities can be legally be performed by any occupation. 3.4.2 The Regulation of Health Occupations in Nova Scotia Legislation establishes the legal framework for the practice of 19 health occupations in Nova Scotia (Table 3.13), accountingfor over 19,000 health care workers.

Human Resources for Health Toolkit for Planning, Training and management. \"Legislation Practice Requirements.\" NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDY 39Other occupations which have requested self-regulation in Nova Scotia include cardiology technologists, dentalhygienists, 33kinesiologists, massage therapists, midwives, osteopaths, paramedics, professional counselors, podiatristsand respiratory therapists. Self-governing professions in Nova Scotia operate under a combination of exclusive scope of practice and title protectionmodels. Legislation includes definitions of occupations' scopesof practice and protects occupations' titles, so that only thoseregistered with a regulatory body can formally use the titleauthorized by statute and perform tasks defined in the act. It should be noted that in recent years Nova Scotia has updated and modernized several statutes to ensure standard,consistent legislative provisions and governance structures.For example, a number of professions moved to a collegesystem of governance (i.e. chiropractors, pharmacists,registered nurses and licensed practical nurses). As well,improved disciplinary processes have recently beenintroduced. 3.4.3 Issues and Trends in Health Occupation Legislation Occupational regulation is done to protect the safety of thepublic. The primary benefit of self-regulation includespotential for decreased risk of harm to the public throughquality assurance mechanisms, practice standards, andcontinuing competence requirements. However, research hasrevealed a number of negative consequences that have beenassociated with occupational legislation, including potentialfor the following 34: Occupational monopoly; Barriers to entry and mobility; Inefficient use of human resources; Higher service costs; Personnel shortages; Lack of public accountability; Stifling of innovation; and Exacerbation of shortages. Reviews have also revealed that the structures and processes created by the regulatory bodies, as well as the terminologyused, can vary from profession to profession, especially withrespect to the complaints and discipline processes. 35 Furthermore, although public protection remains thecornerstone of occupational regulation, research suggests ithas demonstrated a \"weak relationship to outcome quality\". 36 The Economic Council of Canada looked at occupational regulation in Canada in detail and concluded: ...occupational regulation in Canada is not working as well as it could, or should. The evidence that we have gathered suggests that anumber of regulatory restrictions are imposing costs in excess of thebenefits provided. 37 One concern with overly rigid occupational regulation is that itcould hinder the goals of key health care reforms. Servicedelivery initiatives such as primary health care renewalemphasize more collaborative working relationships andpotential changes to the scopes of practice among healthprofessionals. This requires supporting legislative structuresthat are flexible, adaptable to change and encourageinnovation. This will place pressures on the regulatory systemto accommodate demands for flexibility, while at the sametime ensuring that public safety is protected. As onesubmission to the Kirby Commission stated: ... if health care providers are qualified through education and training to perform certain tasks, they should be allowed to performthem. 38 3.4.3.1 Evolving Scopes of Practice - 'Omnibus' Legislation and Shared Scopes of Practice Models There are a number of approaches that have been used to expand the scope of practice of health care workers.Traditionally, scopes of practice have evolved throughcollaborative practice agreements between employers andregulatory bodies. Furthermore, the creation of policies andguidelines for delegation of tasks are often used as a strategyfor ensuring more efficient utilization of health care workers'scopes of practice. For example, the College of Physicians andSurgeons of Nova Scotia and the College of Registered Nurseshave guidelines outlining the principles, criteria andconditions for the delegation of restricted medical acts fromphysicians to nurses. Ontario, British Columbia and most recently, Alberta, have introduced new approaches to the regulation of healthprofessions to improve flexibility and add greater publicchoice. These provinces have introduced a single law, oromnibus legislation, which lays out common rules that applyto all health professions, such as registration, continuingcompetence, professional conduct and discipline. 33. Dental Hygienists and Dental Assistants are presently regulated under the Dental Act, which is governed by the Provincial Dental Board of Nova Scotia. 34.

Reforming Regulation (Chapter 10). Ottawa: Canadian Government Publishing Centre. P. 118 38. Interim Report on the State of Health Care System in Canada, M.J.L Kirby, M. LeBreton40 NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDYA critical aspect of these reforms has been the move away from exclusive scopes of practice in legislation, towards sharedor overlapping scopes of practice. As indicated earlier, controlled actsregulation restricts only a limited number of tasks or activities to certain occupations, rather than regulating anentire field of practice. Only those areas of practice that carryserious risk of harm, if performed incorrectly, are controlled inlegislation. All other activities can legally be performed by anyoccupation. The practice areas restricted in legislation areknown as 'controlled acts' in Ontario, 'reserved acts' in BritishColumbia and restricted activities in Alberta. Reaction to legislative reforms in these jurisdictions has been mixed. Governments generally claim that omnibus legislationincreases the protection of the public, provides greaterconsumer choice and improves accountability. Furthermore,they contend these models replace exclusive scopes of practicemodels with the concept of shared scopes of practice. This inturn demonstrates the potential for more flexible and efficientuse of HHR in providing care consistent with the objectives ofhealth care reform initiatives, such as primary care renewal. There is currently some anecdotal evidence to support this type of model. A recent review of Ontario's model, which hasbeen in operation for nearly a decade, noted the following: Not one submission suggested that the system of controlled acts should be discarded or that Ontario should return to the previoussystem of exclusive scopes of practice. HPRAC concludes that afterfive years of implementation, the system of controlled acts remains apositive feature of the health professions regulatory system inOntario. 39 However, it should be noted that no empirical evidence can befound to support the effectiveness of controlled acts modelsversus the other practice models. The evidence is not clearthat this type of legislative framework fundamentallyincreases the choices available to the public, or whether thistype of legislative framework increases or decreases the levelof protection afforded to the public. 40 As well, there may be practical considerations associated withomnibus legislation for this region. Nova Scotia is smallcompared with the provinces that have introduced omnibuslegislation. A 'one size fits all' approach to occupational regulation may not be practical, given the resources availableto smaller regulatory bodies. For instance, nearly half of theregulatory bodies in Nova Scotia do not have websites and lessthan half currently produce annual reports. Some regulatorybodies may not have the institutional capacity and resourcesrequired to implement omnibus legislation, which may requirethe establishment of standardized administrative structuresand procedures. 3.4.3.2 Increasing Credentials of Health Professions Occupational regulation provides a framework for theestablishment of educational and other requirements thatmust be met in order to enter a profession. One consequenceof occupational self-regulation is the incremental elevation ofeducational requirements required for entry-to-practice,commonly referred to as \"credential creep.\" A number of occupations, which currently require a diploma for entry to practice, are considering moving to a bachelordegree. These include dental hygienists, medical laboratoryand medical radiation technology groups. Occupations thatare moving from bachelors to masters degrees includeoccupational therapists and physiotherapists. The rationale for increasing credentials is that such changes are required to keep pace with changes in the health caresystem. These include greater on-the job responsibilities,evolving scopes of practice, more sophisticated technologies,changing demographics, and demands for teamwork andinterpersonal communications. Although increasing credentials is often justified on the basis of the need for more qualified health care workers, there arenegative consequences as well. The main concern is thepotential to exacerbate personnel shortages. Increasingcredentials requires a longer training period, increases costsfor students and pushes salaries upwards, which can have animpact on the supply of certain occupations. 41This presents particular challenges for occupations considered to be in ashortage situation, such as medical laboratory and medicalradiation technology occupational groups. 39.

Obtained from presentation by Renate Krakauer.NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDY 41Some authors have also noted concern that a more highly qualified workforce can worsen the inequitable geographicdistribution of workers. A study that examined the practicelocations of masters versus certificate trained nursepractitioners found that graduates of the masters degreeprograms were much less likely to work in under-servicedareas than their certificate program counterparts. 42This could have implications for occupations such as occupationaltherapy and physiotherapy, which already have challengeswith distribution: 73% of occupational therapists and 70% ofphysiotherapists are located in the Halifax RegionalMunicipality region. As well, increasing credentials could potentially impact the demand for other occupations. If fewer graduates are availableto perform lower task level activities, some of the functions orroles may need to be filled by other occupations. This willlikely increase pressures on employers to encourage delegationof tasks to other providers. 3.4.3.3 Removing Barriers to Mobility A shortage of health care workers in other provinces andcountries has created a global demand for HHR. Nova Scotiarelies somewhat on recruiting out-of-province health careworkers for delivering services. For instance, over one-half ofregistered nurses entering practice in Nova Scotia from 1999and 2001 were from other areas; 48% from other parts ofCanada, three per cent from overseas and one percent fromthe U.S. 43Similarly, one-half of Nova Scotia physicians in 2000 were educated in other areas; 25% from other provinces and25% from other countries. 44Recruitment of health care workers requires a highly mobile health workforce. This hasplaced pressures on governments to ensure that federal andprovincial laws do not impose unnecessary barriers to labourmobility. Mobility within Canada Regulatory changes introduced over the past decade havemade movement within Canada much easier. For example,Chapter 7 of the Agreement on Internal Trade (AIT), signed by the federal, provincial and territorial governments, wasintroduced as a way to enable workers who are qualified for an occupation in one province to seek employment in otherprovinces. The AIT requires provincial governments andregulatory bodies to ensure their legislation and regulations do not impose mobility restrictions. Since 1994 occupationalregulatory bodies in Nova Scotia have been working with other provinces to comply with AIT requirements, and all but onehas complied. Some occupations have been particularly challenged to comply with the AIT, due to provincial differences in entry-to-practicerequirements. For example, psychologists have differenteducation and training requirements from province toprovince. At the national level, the Canadian PsychologicalAssociation (CPA) currently supports doctoral level training,and will accredit only doctoral programs. However, master-level training is a sufficient requirement in Nova Scotia, NewBrunswick, Alberta and Saskatchewan. Prince Edward Islandalso has entry to practice at the masters level, butpsychologists are not allowed to work independently. InOntario, a doctorate is required, although one can practice as apsychological associate with training at the masters level.Provinces such as Quebec, Manitoba and British Columbiarequire doctoral level training. The introduction of regulatory changes to minimize restrictions on mobility highlights a broader trend. Health careworkforce regulation, along with education and credentialing,is moving in the direction of national standards. The mostdramatic impact of this trend will be on the scopes of practiceof health care workers, entry-to-practice requirements, andentry-level competencies of regulated health care workers. Mobility from Abroad In addition to mobility within Canada, health careprofessionals from other countries migrate to Nova Scotiaevery year. Health care professionals who migrate to NovaScotia undergo an assessment process to have theircredentials recognized. In some cases this assessment processis relatively straightforward, whereas in other cases, it is timeconsuming and complex. Physician representatives notedparticular challenges in the assessment of credentials offoreign-trained physicians, commonly referred to asInternational Medical Graduates (IMGs). Although the RoyalCollege and the Medical Council of Canada have developedexaminations to assist in this process, the assessment processand the standards for licensing vary by province. IMG physicians seeking licensure in Nova Scotia, who have no North American experience or accredited residency training,must undergo a formal clinical assessment process from the 42.

IMG physicians seeking licensure as family physicians undergo anassessment, currently done at the University of Manitoba bythe Clinicians' Assessment and Professional Enhancement(CAPE). The evaluation of IMG specialists seeking licensure asspecialists is more complex, and is currently done on a case-by-case basis. It is considered to be a time-consuming andcostly process for both the CPSNS and the candidate. 45 3.4.4 Continuing Competence One of the ways regulatory bodies ensure quality practice is by prescribing continuing competence requirements. Theconventional method used for continuing competence in NovaScotia is through mandatory continuing education. Legislationoutlines continuing education requirements that must befulfilled in order for individuals to renew their registration(Table 3.14). However, continuing education requirements varysignificantly between regulatory bodies. Table 3.14: Selected Health Occupations' Approach to Demonstrating Continuing Competence in NS Continuous Competence Health Occupation Approach Requirements Chiropractors Continuing Education 24 credit hours every 2 years Dentists Continuing Education 90 credit hours every 3 years Dental Hygienists Continuing Education 45 credit hours every 3 years Pharmacists Self-AssessmentOccupational Therapists Minimum practice 1200 'currency hours' hours in the 5-year period prior to the renewal date Registered Nurses Reflective practice Annual completion of (Self-assessment tool self-assessment tool will\"Building Your Profile\") be mandatory starting in 2003, for the 2004 licensing year Optometry Continuing Education 30 hours every 3 years While the preferred approach to demonstrating continuing competence is via continuing education, new approaches arebeing developed. These include: reflective learning, self-assessment tools, on-site practice assessment and peer review.In Nova Scotia, health occupations such as nursing andpharmacy recently introduced self-assessment tools to enableself-managed competency assessment.4.0. HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES IN NOVA SCOTIA 4.1 HEALTH PROVIDERS Painting a picture of our health human resources (HHR) is a challenging task, since those resources are many and varied.Human resources for health care are not just about doctors,nurses and other paid health workers, nor is their care limitedto providing treatment in hospitals and clinics.Our health care system is a mix of non-profit and for-profit,paid and volunteer, self-employed and salaried occupations,unionized and non-unionized employees, and government andprivately financed mechanisms. The term 'human resources for health' encompasses a broad spectrum of all those who contribute to the objectives of thehealth system, including individuals, families, and volunteers(Figure 4.1). The community, as a whole, is involved as healthcare providers, as the range of health care services is becomingincreasingly broad. To start with, most Nova Scotians, most of the time, are their own health care providers. They work to maintain lifestylesthat help them to stay healthy and prevent disease. As HealthCanada puts it: As individuals, we can all contribute by taking responsibility for our own health and well-being; actively seeking out the informationwe need to make informed health decisions; building supportivecommunities; and participating in community activities that have an impact on health. 46 Many Nova Scotians volunteer, tending to the health careneeds of their family or neighbors in their homes andcommunities. As volunteers, working either informally or aspart of an organization, they represent an important humanresource cohort, nearly 60% of the health work done inCanada. 47 45. Key informant interview46. \"Health is Everybody's Business,\" www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hppb/phdd/collab/index.html 47. Jeff Carr, \"Health Role of the Voluntary Sector,\" Health Canada, 2001Figure 4.1: Human Resources for Health Paid Volunteers Family SelfNOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDY 43The importance of linking unpaid caregivers into the planning framework for HHR cannot be understated. Reports from GPIAtlantic have shown that Nova Scotia benefits from 140million hours of volunteer work each year, estimated at over$2 billion in economic value to the province. 48Most noteworthy, Nova Scotia contributes 43% more in volunteerwork than the Canadian average. Although Nova Scotia's track record of volunteerism has been admirable there are signs that the number of volunteers maybe in decline. A report released by GPI Atlantic showed adecrease in volunteer services of 7.2 percent from a decade ago(compared to Canadian average of 4.7% decrease). GPI Atlanticsuggested one cause may be that the time stresses facingmarried women, the largest source of formal and informalvolunteers, has been increasing. According to GPI, Nova Scotialost 30,000 volunteers, or 10.7%, between 1997 and 2000. 49 Although it is not definitive that this attrition rate applies tohealth care volunteers, it is clear that any consideration ofHHR must take volunteer resources into account. The role of the unpaid worker is, and will increasingly become, more important as the focus of health care increasingly shiftsaway from hospitals and other institutions, and moves moretowards care in the community and in ones home. Thechanging setting for health care is significant, both sociallyand culturally, as it increases ones reliance more onfamily/self/home over institutionally-based delivery of healthcare. This presents challenges given increasing pressuresfacing the family caregiver. As the Canadian Home CareHuman Resource Study pointed out: This significant shift in responsibility to the family caregiver has occurred at a time when Canadian family life itself has undergonemajor transformations. Falling birth rates, increased labour forceparticipation by women, increased divorce rates, more single parentfamilies, more geographically dispersed families all strain the family'scapacity to cope with increased responsibility for home care. 50 4.2 A CHANGING HEALTH INDUSTRY The nature of the health care industry is changing andexpanding. The traditional nurse, doctor and dentist are beingjoined by a myriad of other health care providers. The publicly-financed part of the health care system is undergoing constant change, thus posing a challenge forhuman resource planning. It is even more difficult to measureHHR in the privately-funded sector. Some of the private expenditure Nova Scotians pay each year for health care goestoward long-established services like dentistry, or shared costprograms, like those for prescription drugs, home care orambulance services. In addition, increasing numbers of Nova Scotians are availing themselves of services that are complementary to, oralternatives for, conventional medical treatment. Examples ofcomplementary and alternative medicine include such thingsas massage therapy, homeopathy, herbal remedies, reflexologyand traditional Aboriginal or Chinese medicine. Some of theseproviders of complementary and alternative medicine areorganized into self-regulating associations. Most however, arenot, thereby complicating the task of assembling a completepicture of the health workforce. 4.3 CHARACTERISTICS OF THE NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH WORK FORCE According to Statistics Canada, Nova Scotia's health care workforce totaled about 52,900 in 2002. This representsapproximately 12% of Nova Scotia's total employed work force of 428,400 people. In other words, more than one in everyten people in Nova Scotia's labour force worked in the healthand social services industry. Viewed from the perspective ofemployees in the public sector, the number increases to aboutone out of every three people employed. The health and social services industry represented the province's second largest industry. Only the retail tradeindustry employed more Nova Scotians (Figure 4.2). Figure 4.2: Top Five Industries by Employment in Nova Scotia, 2002 Retail trade 66,800 Health and social services 52,900Educational Services 34,900Accommodation, Food and Recreational Services 34,100 Construction 30,100 Source: Statistics Canada Labour Force Historical Review, 2002, CD-ROM No. 71F0004-XCB To obtain detailed information on the health workforce in Nova Scotia, it was necessary to look beyond StatisticsCanada's Labour Force Survey and National OccupationalClassification (NOC) information. This is because these sourcesinclude employment characteristics in the broader socialservices industry level, rather than for specific healthoccupations. Furthermore, NOC codes have traditionally beenbased upon the education and training requirements foroccupational groups, so the same NOC code historically may 48. GPI Atlantic. The Economic Value of Civic and Voluntary Work in Nova Scotia, 2001 49. GPI Atlantic, The Economic Value of Civic & Voluntary Work in Atlantic Canada: 2003 Update. 50. Canadian Home Care Resource Study44 NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDYcontain multiple occupations grouped together. There was also insufficient detail available on health occupations'practice locations by employment setting (e. g. nursing homesversus hospitals) and geographic distribution (e.g. by healthdistrict). More detailed information on the health workforce in Nova Scotia was supplied by the District Health Authorities (DHAs),the Department of Health (DOH), the Department ofCommunity Services (DCS) and other in-field data sources.This information showed health workforce employment in2001 at 49,808 people (Figure 4.3). About four out of five (80%)health care workers were employed in patient/direct care. Theremaining 20% were involved in indirect patient care, such ashousekeeping, administration, maintenance, etc.. The 49,808 workers represented 38,335 full time equivalents (FTEs). This means about 1.3 people are required to do thework of one FTE worker. This factor arises because not everyhealthcare worker is employed on a full time basis, and manyhealth workers provide clinical, administrative, teachingand/or research services as part of their job.To determine the practice location of health care workers in Nova Scotia the workforce was viewed from the followingcomponents: acute care (hospitals), continuing care, addictionservices, public health, mental health, and community/private/other. Continuing care, in turn, was sub-divided into the fourareas of: long term care nursing homes (LTC/nursing homes),home care/home support (HC/HS), residential care facilities(RCFs) and community based options (CBOs). Figure 4.4 shows the number of health care workers employed in each major employment setting in 2001. The largestproportion of workers (38%) was in acute care settings(hospitals), followed by continuing care settings (34%). Overall,over 70 per cent of the workforce worked in either acute careor continuing care settings. Table 4.1 shows the breakdown of the number of health care workers and FTE numbers for each employment setting.Employment settings with higher than average people to FTEratios, such as LTC with a ratio of 1.5, reflect a higherproportion of part time and casual workers. In terms ofplanning and utilization of human resources, one would needmore people for each FTE position in a setting where there arefewer people employed on a full time (versus casual or parttime) basis.

Theestimated proportion of direct care providers ranged from alow of 63% of workers in RCFs and 68% of workers in LTCfacilities (nursing homes) to a high of 94% in public health and92% in mental health. Key workforce characteristics at the occupational level (versus employment setting level) were obtained by collectinginformation from the health occupations' regulatory bodies andprofessional associations. This process identified a workforce of33,900 people engaged in 31 health occupations of which occupational summaries, profiles and issues for each occupation profiled were created. The choice of which health occupations to profile was based largely on availability and accessibility of data and relative size of the occupation. Table 4.2 illustrates the number of workers comprising the occupations profiled for this study. There were 10 occupationsthat comprised about 28,000 people, or more than half of thetotal health workforce. These 10 occupations accounted formore than 80% of the profiled groups of health care workers.The two nursing occupations, registered nurses and licensedpractical nurses, accounted for approximately 12,000 healthworkers representing over one third of the occupationsprofiled.Table 4.2: Occupations Profiled, NS, 2000-2003 Active % of Supply Occupation Year Supply all Occupations Cum.

A similar pattern is developing in dentistry, where females comprised 57% of enrolments in Dalhousie's program (ascompared to existing dentist workforce supply of 31% female).4.3.2 Age Distribution Age information was available for 82% of health workersprofiled. The average age of this workforce was 41.3 years ofage. About one in four (23%) of these workers were 50 yearsand older, and 14% were under 30 years of age. There was significant age variation between occupational groups (Table 4.4). There were 12 occupational groups with anaverage age of 40 years or more. Most of these occupations hadat least one in five who were over the age of 50 years, andtherefore would be approaching retirement age in the nextdecade (Figure 4.7).

As well, a number of occupations had high concentrations of 45 to 49 year olds, a further indication of the aging workforcedemographics in play. Occupations with high concentration of45 to 49 years of age included registered nurses technologists (20%), dietitians (17%) well, there were a number of occupations with high proportions of young workers. Paramedics were the youngestoccupation, with an average age of 34 years. Other occupationswith young average ages included occupational therapists (35.5years), dental assistants (35.7 years) and dental hygienists (36.7years). 4.3.3 Geographic Distribution The distribution of the health workforce profiled in NovaScotia, overall, closely resembled the distribution of theprovincial population (Figure 4.8). A slightly higher percentageof health care workers were located in the Capital district(46%) as compared to the proportion of Nova Scotians residingin this area (42%).For occupations considered mostly urban, or those with greater than 60% located in the Capital district, thisdistribution was expected, given the large number of healthcare facilitates that serve the broader provincial, and in somecases Maritime and Atlantic population (Table 4.5). Table 4.5: Health Occupations in Urban vs. Non-Urban Setting, NS >60% in Capital District (Urban) Percentage Occupational Therapists 73% Physiotherapists 70% Respiratory Therapists (Non-Urban) Percentage Paramedics 26% Licensed Practical Nurses 36% Personal Care Workers 36% Community Residential Workers 37% Home Support Workers 37% Recreation Therapists 38% Optometrists 40%Figure 4.7: Percentage 50 Years of Age and Older, Selected Health Occupations, NS Health Managers Physicians Denturists RNs Dentists Health Records District123456789 District123456789 Health Supply NS Population48 NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDY4.3.4 Occupational Growth in Nova Scotia 4.3.4.1 An Historical Perspective For the 16 occupations for which comparative trend data was available, between 1991 and 2000, five occupations in NovaScotia experienced average annual growth of 5 percent ormore (Table 4.6). Social workers (12.8%) and chiropractors(11.7%) experienced the highest average annual growth duringthis time frame. It is noteworthy that in most cases, these'high growth' occupations in Nova Scotia approximated thetrend for Canada as a whole. However, the growth ofchiropractors and social workers was considerably higher inNova Scotia than in Canada. Furthermore, although there washigh growth of dietitians provincially, it was even higher inCanada. Table 4.6: Selected Health Occupations in NS and Canada, Average Annual Growth, 1991-2000 High Growth Nova Scotia Canada Social 0.2% Source: Annual Growth Rates derrived from Supply Trends in CIHI, Health Personnel in Canada, 1991-2000 Six occupations in Nova Scotia experienced an average growth in supply between 1% and 3.4% annually. These medium/low(0-5% per annum) growth occupations in Nova Scotia grew atrates comparable to the rest of Canada. However, respiratorytherapists, physician specialists, dental hygienists,optometrists and respiratory therapists, which experiencedhigher growth rates nationally in Nova Scotia.From 1991 to 2000 a number of occupations experienced growth declines in the supply of workers in Nova Scotia.The largest decline was experienced by medical laboratorytechnologists (2.7% average annual decline). For the most part,these occupations also experienced declines in Canada as awhole, with the exception of dentists, family physicians,medical radiation technologists which experienced slightpositive growth in Canada. 4.3.4.2 Most Recent Supply Changes Whereas Table 4.6 showed a picture of long term growth of selected health occupations in Nova Scotia, recent changes insupply are outlined under Table 4.7. Table 4.7: Recent Changes in Selected Health Occupations, NS, 1998-2001* Occupation % Change Medical Radiation Technologists -7% Registered Nurses (2002) 0% Medical Laboratory Technologists 0% Hygienists 3% Workers 29% Respiratory Therapists 37% Chiropractors (2002) 68% * Supply figures based on CIHI definitions in Health Personnel in Canada, 1991-2000 In examining more recent changes in supply, the followingwas noteworthy. Licensed practical nurses and dentists experienced growth in recent years (4% and 6% respectively), reversing the averageannual declines experienced from 1991-2000 The supply of medical laboratory technologists and registered nurses has been flat in recent years, slowing theten year declines in supply experienced from 1991-2000NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDY 49 Although the growth in physicians was relatively flat throughout the 1990s (0.6% average annual growth), therewas an increase of 9% from 1998-2001 (primarily related tophysician specialists) Occupations in medical radiation technology have continued to decline in recent years (-7% change), consistent with theirten-year average annual decline of -0.7% per year Recent supply changes for the remaining occupations have been consistent with their longer term occupation growthtrends. 4.3.5 Health Workers per Capita - Where Nova Scotia Stands One way of comparing Nova Scotia's supply of health care workers is to compare the number of health care workers percapita with the overall average for Canada. Informationcomparing the supply of health care workers per capita inNova Scotia to Canadian figures was available for most of theregulated health occupations (CIHI). It should be noted that per capita figures represent a measure of the number of health workers as a proportion of the provincialpopulation. These numbers do not take into accountdifferences in the health status of Nova Scotians and thedifferent mix of services delivered by various health careworkers. These factors can impact differences in the number ofhealth care workers per capita across provinces. Information from the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) indicated that in 2000, Nova Scotia wasabove the national average on a per capita basis for 9 healthoccupations (Table 4.8) and below the national average in eight(Table 4.9). The occupations in which Nova Scotia is under-represented make up a much smaller proportion of the healthworkforce. It was not possible to make comparisons withnational data for the unregulated occupational groups, such ascommunity residential workers, personal care workers, homesupport workers or paramedics.Table 4.8: Occupations in which Nova Scotia exceeded National Per-Capita Average, 2000 NS/10,000 Canada/10,000 NS % of Occupation population population Canada Social Worker 14.16 5.79 244.6% 138.2% 7.74 128.9% Registered Nurse (2001) 93.2 74.9 124.4% Radiation Technology 5.34 4.7 113.6% Physician (Specialist) 10 9.3 107.5% Physician (FP/GP) 10.1 9.4 107.4% Table 4.9: Occupations in which Nova Scotia Workforce was below National Per-Capita Average, 2000 NS/10,000 Canada/10,000 NS % of Occupation population population Canada Physiotherapist 4.47 4.65 96.1% Respiratory 66.6% Chiropractor 0.66 1.82 36.3% 4.3.6 Education Levels Information on the highest level of completed education was available for close to three-quarters (74%) of profiled healthoccupations. More than half (56%) possess certificate ordiploma level training (Figure 4.9). Workers with a bachelor'sdegree accounted for 21%, master's degree accounted for 5%,doctoral level training 13%, and the remaining 5% did notcomplete post-secondary training. Table 4.10 shows theeducation Masters 6% MD/Doctorate 13%Figure 4.9: Level of Education of Selected Health Occupations in Nova Scotia50 NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDYTable 4.10: Highest Level of Completed Education, Health Care Workers, NS Mostly Certificate or Diploma level training Dental Assistants Dental Hygienists Dental Technicians Denturists Licensed Practical Nurses Medical Laboratory Technologists Medical Radiation Technologists Opticians Registered Nurses (71% of RNs) Mostly Bachelor level training Dietitians (75%) Pharmacists (92%) Occupational Therapists (91%) Mostly Masters level training Audiologists and Speech Language Pathologists Dietitians (22%) Registered Nurses (2%) Pharmacists (1%) Mostly Doctorate level training Chiropractors Dentists Optometrists Physicians Psychology (42%) It is anticipated that fewer health workers will be certificate and diploma level trained in the future. For instance, althoughmost RNs possess diplomas, Nova Scotia now requires aBachelor of Science in Nursing (BScN) degree as a minimumrequirement for new registered nurses entering into practice.Therefore, the proportion of RNs with diplomas will decreasegradually as more and more bachelor educated RN graduatesenter the workforce. Furthermore, several other occupationsare considering moving from a diploma to degree level trainingrequirement for entry to practice, including the medicallaboratory and medical radiation technology occupations anddental hygienists.It is noteworthy that social workers in the health field in Nova Scotia possess higher education credentials than the overallaverage for social workers in the province. A 1999 Nova ScotiaAssociation of Social Workers survey indicated 34% of socialworkers had masters degrees, compared with 69% of socialworkers employed in health. 4.3.7 Mobility Each year, Nova Scotia gains and loses health care workersbecause of immigration and migration. For most healthprofessions in Nova Scotia, there is little information availableon the flow of workers in and out of the province. Thefollowing outlines the information that is currently available,which is limited to physicians and registered nurses. From 1992 to 2000, there has been a net emigration (loss) of approximately 221 physicians from Nova Scotia. 52Three times more physicians moved abroad (323) than returned fromabroad (102) during this timeframe. However, the net numberof physicians leaving Nova Scotia has declined since the mid'90s (Figure 4.10). From 1997 onward, the number of physiciansleaving the province represented less than 1% of the physiciansupply for that year. In 2000, the net movement of Nova Scotia physicians moving abroad and within Canada represented less than one half percent (0.4%) of Nova Scotia's total physician supply. According to the College of Registered Nurse of Nova Scotia (CRNNS), Nova Scotia currently obtains more than half of itsnew registrants, each year, from outside of the province. Table4.11 shows 53% of registered nurses who entered practice from1999 to 2002 were from outside of Nova Scotia.Figure 4.10: Net Migration of Physicians to/from Nova Scotia, 1992-2000 Net Migration10 0 -10-20-30-40-50-60-70 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 Source: CMA Masterfile 52.

Figure 4.11 shows that most 'come from away' registered nurses whorecently entered practice originated from other provinces inCanada (91%) or from oversees (7%). Only 2% originated fromthe United States. Among those originating from otherprovinces in Canada, most came from Newfoundland (35%),New Brunswick (19%) and Ontario (18%). It is more difficult to get a clear picture of how many registered nurses leave Nova Scotia to work each year. TheCRNNS is currently not able to determine how many registerednurses migrate to work in other regions each year from NovaScotia.4.4 WORKFORCE CHARACTERISTICS - SNAPSHOT BY EMPLOYMENT SETTING 4.4.1 Acute Care (hospitals) Information sourced for acute care was comprised of 44 hospitals across the nine DHAs and the IWK in Nova Scotia.There were approximately 19,000 people employed in acutecare (hospitals) in Nova Scotia in 2000-01, with 70% in directpatient care related positions and 30% employed in a non-clinical or indirect patient care function (e.g. maintenance,environmental, etc). Data collected from the DHAs and theDOH provided the following demographic information relatedto direct care providers. Major Occupations and Geographic DistributionThe majority (80%) of direct care health providers employed in hospitals worked in one of the six occupations noted in Figure4.12. Registered nurses comprised 42%, licensed practicalnurses represented 10%, medical nursing assistants/orderlies 5%. Theremaining 20% were employed in other direct care occupationsworking in acute care hospital settings. Close to one-half (51%)were located in either DHA 9 or the IWK (Table 4.12).

Employment Status More than half (53%) of acute care (hospital) workers wereemployed full time, almost one-third (31%) part time, and theremaining 16% worked on a casual/relief basis (Figure 4.15).4.4.2 Mental Health Services Mental Health Services is comprised of five core programs:mental health promotion, advocacy, prevention and education;inpatient program; outpatient and outreach; communitymental health supports and specialty services. There wereapproximately 1,300 people employed in mental healthservices in Nova Scotia in 2002, with 90% in direct care relatedpositions and 10% employed in a non-clinical or indirect carefunction. Data collected from the DOH, DHAs and in-fieldpersonnel from mental health services provided the followingdemographic information related to these direct patient/cleintcare providers. Major Occupations and Geographic Distribution The following Table 4.13 identifies four major occupations thatmade up 80% of the direct care providers that worked inmental health services in Nova Scotia in 2001-02.

Almost half (49%) were employed on a full timebasis, with 39% employed part time and 12% employed on acasual or relief basis. 4.4.8 Community Based Options There were approximately 3,500 community residentialworkers (CRWs) employed in community based options in2001. Demographic information was obtained for 80% of theseworkers. CBOs include: adult residential centres (ARCs),regional rehabilitation centers (RRCs) group homes,developmental residences, workshops, small options homes,and supervised apartments. The Department of Community Services employs more than 3,000 of the CRWs working in CBOs. The remaining CRWs wereemployed by the DOH. Demographic information was notavailable for those 500 or so CRWs employed by the DOH. Of the two thirds of CBO workers with some post-secondary education or training, 29% had university degrees, 26% acertificate and 11% a diploma. Of the remaining one third, 30%had completed high school, and 4% had less than high schoolgraduation.

In recent years, however, the natureof this imbalance has been more pronounced. Reports ofshortages have included other occupations, such as medicallaboratory technologists, medical radiation technologists,pharmacists, and others. Furthermore, chronic health careshortages are being experienced by most provinces acrossCanada as well as internationally, making health care resourcesa global concern. During consultation with key informants a number of perspectives arose on the issue of HR \"shortages\". For someoccupations, shortages were considered a province-wideproblem, while others were concerned with distribution-related shortages in rural areas. Some occupations framed their shortage issue from the perspective of specific practicesettings, while others highlighted shortages of workers withspecific qualifications. The following provides an overview of some of the supply related issues impacting future planning for the healthworkforce in Nova Scotia. 4.5.1 Declining Supply As indicated previously, over the past decade a number ofoccupations have experienced declines in the supply ofworkers employed in Nova Scotia. Among occupationsprofiled, the MLT workforce had the largest decline, with a2.7% average annual decline. This represents the mostsignificant 10-year decline among Nova Scotia healthoccupations profiled. A shortage of MLT personnel can have significant implications for service levels. One key informant pointed out that laboratorytest results are a critical component of physicians' decisions,and if they are not processed in a timely manner, there exists apotential for delay in patient diagnosis. The lack of an entry-level medical laboratory education program in Nova Scotia was noted as a concern for MLTs. 53 The Nova Scotia Community College (NSCC) diploma programfor general medical laboratory technology was closed in 1995,at a point in time when there existed a percieved surplus ofMLTs. Like elsewhere in Canada, Nova Scotia is widely considered to be in the midst of a serious shortage of registered nurses. From1993 to 2002, the number of registered nurses employed innursing in Nova Scotia declined by 0.6% per year, on average,resulting in 584 fewer RNs employed in the province (Figure4.38). In comparison, the supply of RNs in Canada declined onaverage, 0.2% per year from 1993 to 2001.Figure 4.36: Employment Status, Workers in Community Based Options, NS, 2001 Full Time 43%Part Time 26% Casual/Relief 31% Figure 4.37: CBO Employment Status by Facility Type, NS, 2001 ARC/RRC Group Homes Developmental Res.

Health Canada. An Environmental Scan of the Human Resource Issues Affecting Medical Laboratory Technologists and Medical Radiation Technologists, 2001.NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDY 59The most significant decline in the number of registered nurses employed in Nova Scotia occurred during thetimeframe from 1993 to 1998. During this period Nova Scotiaexperienced a greater decline (6.3%) than other Canadianprovinces (3.4%). In recent years, the supply of RNs employedin Nova Scotia has been relatively constant. The net change innurses employed in Nova Scotia from 1998 to 2002 has been anincrease of two RNs. There was a substantial decline in the number of registered nursing graduates during the 1990s, corresponding with adecline in the number of funded seats in nursing programs inNova Scotia and the closure in 1995 of the nursing diplomaprogram (Figure 4.39). The Nova Scotia Nursing Strategy has introduced a number of recruitment initiatives for RNs. For instance, in 1999,enrolment in entry-level Bachelor of Nursing programsincreased by 75 seats (a 35% increase). By 2003, with close to200 RNs graduating, this represents more than double thenumber that graduated in 1997. In March, 2003 the DOHintroduced further funding for an additional 60 seats, bringingthe total annual intake of RN entry level education andtraining positions to 345 for the 2004-05 academic year. Ensuring an adequate supply of physicians is a common concern for many Nova Scotians. Interestingly, the totalnumber of physicians in Nova Scotia actually grew 0.6%annually from 1991-2000. Growth in physician supply in NovaScotia during this time period, however, is largely attributableto an increase in the number of specialist physicians(Figure4.40). The average annual rate of growth for FP/GPs over thistimeframe was negative (-0.6%), while annual growth ofspecialist physicians in Nova Scotia averaged 2%. This declinein FP/GPs, coupled with the significant increase in specialists,has resulted in the proportion of FP/GPs to specialistsdecreasing from 56% in 1991, to 50% in 2001.In the latter part of the 1990s the physician picture in Nova Scotia had improved. From 1997-2000, the number of FP/GPs inNova Scotia increased 3% 54. Nonetheless, the growth in supply of FP/GPs still remains somewhat disproportionate to that ofspecialists, as evidenced by a 12.6% increase in specialists inNova Scotia from 1997-2000 (vs 5.8% increase in specialists forCanada). The decline in FP/GPs licensed in Nova Scotia over the past decade is potentially more significant than licensure datasuggests. Table 4.20 compares the number of physicianspracticing in 2000-2001 by licensed versus functional 55 specialty. From a functional perspective, approximately 10% ofFP/GP physicians in Nova Scotia are practicing in specialtyareas other than family medicine. These FP/GPs are practicingin fields such as emergency medicine, psychiatry, andanaesthesia.

CIHI, Health Personnel in Canada, 1991-2000. 55. Functional specialty is identified by the DOH though several factors including licensed specialty, physician payment information, telephone contact withphysicians, newspaper announcements, information provided by hospitals andDistrict Health Authorities and other sources of information.60 NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDYIn 2000, the proportion of FP/GPs to specialists based on 'licensed' specialty was 50 to 50. However, this ratio based on'functional specialty' translated to 43% FP/GPs to 57% specialists. It is difficult to determine with certainty what accounts for the greater growth in specialists as compared with FP/GP. Oneconcern raised by key informants was changing lifestyleexpectations (see Chapter 6), coupled with higher debt loads,have given rise to changing preferences for specialty practiceover family medicine. Another reason commonly given for thelower growth in FP/GPs was the elimination in 1993 of therotating internship as the training requirement for licensure as aFP/GP in Canada. The change to a two-year residency programfor family medicine may have led to a decrease in the number ofpostgraduate trainees choosing family medicine. It is noteworthy, however, that the Canadian Post-MD Education Registry indicates there has been a steady increase since 1994 inthe number and proportion of first-year trainees entering FP/GPtraining at Dalhousie, as well as the number of residencytrainees completing their residency training 56 in FP/GP Medicine. For instance, first-year post-MD trainees in Family Medicine atDalhousie increased from 28 in 1994 to 38 in 2000 (36% increase).The number of residency trainees who completed their post-MDtraining at Dalhousie in FP/GP increased from 22 in 1994 to 35 in2000 (59% increase). One source noted it was common prior to1993 for residents to apply for licensure as a FP/GP in order tomoonlight during residency training. 57This may have led to an artificial overstatement of the number of FP/GPs based onlicensure data. The medical radiation technology (MRT) workforce, comprised of radiological technology, radiation therapy, nuclear medicinetechnology, and magnetic resonance imaging technology 58, experienced 0.7% annual decline in supply from 1991-2000. Morerecently, from 1998-2001, supply declined by 7%. Shortages inthe number of medical radiation technologists and medicalradiation therapists has been attributed at the national level toan expansion in services, high attrition rates, and anunderutilization of training capacity within the school system. 59 While a 3-yr diploma and 4-yr degree program exists for medicalradiation technology in Nova Scotia, there still is no medical radiation therapy program in Atlantic Canada. The academic site for medical radiation therapy training is Michener Institute inOntario. The QEII sends 4 to 6 students a year to Michenerthrough a return for service agreement and thus, is responsiblefor recruitment into the program.4.5.2 Impact of Impending Retirements As indicated previously, the health workforce is aging. Thereare at least a dozen occupational groups with an average ageof 40 years or more. Most of these occupations have more thanone in five who are over the age of 50 years, and will thereforebe approaching retirement age in the near future. A concern isthat there will be too few new recruits to replace those whoretire over the next decade, potentially leading to shortagesand disruptions in service levels. The aging of the registered nurse workforce has the potential to impact virtually all areas of health care service delivery in the province. The average age of RNs in Nova Scotiaincreased from 39.3 years of age in 1993 to 43.9 years of age in 2002. In 2002, 30% of nursing health workforce was 50 yearsand older, with only 18% under 35 years of age. Employment settings in continuing care may be among the first to feel the impact of an aging RN workforce. Registered nurseswho care mostly for elderly patients are aging the most rapidly.For instance, 44% of gerontology registered nurses 60(registered nurses who work mostly with elderly Nova Scotians) were 50years of age or older in 2002, whereas only 3% of gerontologyRNs were under 30 years of age. This represents an aging ofgerontology RNs since 1993, when 30% were 50 years of age orolder and 13% were under 30 years. If this trend continues,there will be too few registered nurses with experience caringfor the elderly in home care and nursing home settings. AsTable 4.21 indicates, registered nurses in all employmentsettings have average ages that are older as compared with theaverage for RNs in hospital settings. Table 4.21: RN Average Age in Years by Selected Employment Setting, NS, 2002 Employment Setting Average Age Self Employed 52.6 Educational Institution 48.0 Mental Health Centre 47.4 Private Nursing Care Practice 47.0 46.6 Rehabilitation 46.4 Business/Industry/Occupational 46.4 Community Health Agency 46.1 Home Care Agency 45.5 Hospital 42.5 Overall Average 43.9 Source: CRNNS 56. The practice entry cohort comprises physicians who have completed post-MD training and are legally able towork in Canada (source: Canadian Post-MD EducationRegistry). 57. Key informant interview58.

Canadian Association of Medical Radiation Technologists (2000), Human Resource Planning Issues Affecting Radiation Therapists60. Registered nurses who list 'geriatric' as their primary area of responsibility to the College of Registered Nurses.NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDY 61Among registered nurses, a trend worth noting is that older nurses are increasingly more likely to work on a casual basis.The proportion of older workers (i.e. 65 years of age and older)working on a casual basis increased from 18.5% in 1998 to31.2% in 2002. This suggests that RNs approaching retirementage are not permanently leaving the workforce but choosing tomaintain their license by working a reduced number of hours. Looking ahead, the physician workforce in Nova Scotia also faces impending retirements. Given the long lead time toeducate a new physician (6-10 years from first year of medicalschool), the impact of impending retirements is an immediateconcern for Nova Scotia. In 2000, the average age of physiciansin Nova Scotia was 46.8 years, with approximately one-third(34%) of physicians 50 years of age or older. 61This translates to almost 700 Nova Scotia physicians approaching retirement ageand/or winding down their practices within the next decade.Specialty groups with the highest average age were generalsurgery (52.4 years), psychiatry (49.8 years) and surgerysubspecialties (49.4 years). All physician specialty groupsexcept emergency medicine were, on average, greater than 45years of age. One issue for physicians is that as they age they may change their workload either by working fewer hours, or providing adifferent range of services. For instance, the Department ofHealth physician database shows that older FP/GP physicianssee fewer patients, on average, than other physician agegroups. FP/GPs over 60 years of age had 17% fewer 'uniquepatients' than the average FP/GP in 2000-2001. Specialists over60 years of age had 11% fewer unique patients per physicianthan the average specialist. One reason for this may be thatolder FP/GPs have a higher proportion of older patients; 42% ofthe older FP/GPs workload was attributable to patients 65 yearsand older, as compared to an overall average of 31% for allFP/GP workload. 62 Physicians recruited from other countries may also be facingimpending retirements. Three quarters (75%) of InternationalMedical Graduates (IMGs) practicing in Nova Scotia had 20years or more experience in 2000. This compares with 51% ofDalhousie graduates and 37% of Canadian medical schoolgraduates. It is noteworthy that only 5% of IMGs have less than10 years experience, as compared to 15% for all physicians.This suggests IMGs practicing in Nova Scotia are, on average,older than Dalhousie and Canadian medical school graduates.If retiring IMGs are replaced by graduates of Canadian MedicalSchools, this could have implications for recruitment into ruralareas, since graduates of Canadian Medical Schools currentlyhave a much higher concentration (62%) in the Capital District.Adding to the lack of a local entry-level training program, the MLT workforce also has a significant proportion eligible forretirement in the next 10-15 years. In 2001, the average age ofcertified MLTs in the province was approximately 44 years, and17.4% were over 50 years of age. In contrast, only 9% of thecertified MLT workforce was under 30 years of age, suggestinga positive shortfall between impending retirements and newrecruits. In the future, there is potential for retirements to negatively impact the supply of dentists in Nova Scotia. Dentists in NovaScotia are among the oldest of health occupations, with anaverage age of 43.8 years. Dental specialties in particular hadhigher than average ages as compared to the average for alldentists (Table 4.22). Table 4.22: Average Age of Dental Specialties by Specialty, 2001 Specialty Average Age Paediatrics 59.5 Oral Pathology 51.5 Oral Surgery 50.4 Prosthodontics Source: Provincial Dental Board of NS 4.5.3 Increasing Proportions of Females Most occupations in the health care industry have historicallybeen dominated by females. Exceptions were occupations ofmedicine, dentistry and pharmacy, which were largelycomprised of males. However, these male dominatedoccupations are gradually increasing the proportion of femalesamong younger age groups. This is largely the result of recentincreases in female participation in health education programs. Increasing numbers of female graduates becomes a planning issue for some health disciplines, especially as it relates tofemale participation and productivity within the labour force.For instance, the supply, specialty mix, practice patterns anddistribution of female physicians are important considerationsfor future planning. While females currently comprise lessthan one-third (31%) of the physician supply, they account for53% of the first-year enrolments in Dalhousie medical school. 61. DOH Physician database, 2000-2001 information 62. DOH Physician database, 2000-200162 NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDYFigure 4.41 illustrates that female physicians are mostly concentrated in a limited number of specialties, includingpaediatrics (51%), and (33%). Females are noticeably scarce in surgery subspecialties, accounting for only 5%. The situation in Nova Scotia is not unique, as there are increasing proportions of females in these residency trainingpositions in Canada. This trend signals that the addition ofmore females to the physician supply will likely exacerbatesex differences in physician specialty mix. Increasing proportions of female physicians may have implications for future physician planning from a workloadperspective. According to CIHI and a CMA 2001 Survey 63, female physicians practice 20% less than their malecounterparts (as measured by health service billing data andself-reported work hours ). 64In Nova Scotia, female family/general practice physicians' service volume has beenconsistently running at two-thirds (67%) of their malecounterparts since 1992-93. 65 An increasing proportion of female physicians may also haveimplications for the future geographic distribution of FP/GPphysicians. Figure 4.42 indicates 58% of female FP/GPs arelocated in urban areas, as compared to 46% of male FP/GPphysicians. Although these percentages are not substantiallydifferent, this could have implications for recruitment of FP/GPs into rural practice as the proportion of female FP/GPsincreases over time. 4.5.4 Geographic Distribution As mentioned previously, there were some occupations whichhad a high concentration of workers located in the capitaldistrict. A shortage of health care workers outside urban areasis a recurring challenge for some health occupations.Attracting health care workers to rural and remotecommunities may be a challenge due to the isolated natureand restricted resources available in some areas. Recruitment of rural physicians in under serviced areas has been an ongoing priority for Nova Scotia. There is increasingrecognition that recruitment and retention initiatives mustaddress the working conditions and lifestyle issues of ruralpractice. Rural physicians typically have less professionalsupport compared to their urban counterparts, but mustpractice with expanded roles, often necessitating advancedcompetencies. As well, their levels of on-call responsibilitiescan limit opportunities for vacation or personal leave. 66 A review of recruitment and retention initiatives for ruralphysicians in other jurisdictions reveals a number ofinteresting trends. Although the traditional focus ofrecruitment efforts has been the payment of direct, financialincentives (e.g. signing bonuses, relocation incentives, etc.),some jurisdictions have started to supplement these financialincentives with other recruitment tools such as: changing admission policies to medical schools in an attempt to increase intake of students from ruralbackgrounds; exposing medical students to rural practice through 'rural tours' during first and second year, and providing funding forrural internships and residencies (accommodation andtravel) and rural preceptors; Figure 4.41: Sex Distribution of NS Physicians, by Specialty Group, 2000 Surgery Subsp.

Some researchers have suggested that greater use of technologies may help to alleviate the geographic barriers topatients accessing services. Telehealth services offered in NovaScotia include: tele-radiology, tele-dermatology, tele-psychiatry,tele-emergency, etc. Future technology developments that canpotentially impact service delivery include tele-homecare, tele-consults, and the electronic patient record. Occupational therapists also suggested that rural areas may be particularly vulnerable to shortages of occupational therapists.Key informants indicated that shortages of occupationaltherapists continue to appear in rural areas. These positionswere considered to be professionally challenging, due to theisolated nature and restricted resources available in someareas. 4.5.5 Recruiting and Retaining New Graduates Recruiting recent graduates from Nova Scotia education andtraining programs is critical for Nova Scotia to be self-sufficient in the production of new health care workers.Reports of aggressive recruitment campaigns and generousfinancial incentives from other regions, directed towardsrecent Nova Scotia graduates, raises concerns over how wellthe province can alleviate supply shortages through expansionof local education and training programs. Unfortunately, for many health professions in Nova Scotia, there is little information collected on the proportion of recentgraduates who remain in the province following graduation. The out migration of recent graduates from degree-granting nursing schools in Nova Scotia is an ongoing concern. Duringthe mid to late 90s there was a steady decline in theproportion of graduates from nursing programs in Nova Scotiawho remained registered in the province one year followinggraduation (Figure 4.43). The proportion of graduatesregistering in Nova Scotia one year following graduation wentfrom 84% in 1995 to 66% by 2001.There are signs, however, that this situation is improving. The CRNNS noted that 82% of the 2002 graduating class (springconvocation) were registered to practice in Nova Scotia for the2003 registration year (as of December 2002). 67 Nova Scotia does not seem to be losing licensed practicalnurse (LPN) graduates to the same extent as registered nurses.From 1996 to 2000, there were 727 graduates from licensedpractical nursing programs in Nova Scotia. Of these, 567 (78%)were licensed in Nova Scotia in 2002. It was not possible todetermine the status of the remaining 22% of graduates (e.g.moved elsewhere versus career changed or unemployed). How many physician trainees stay in Nova Scotia following their residency training? Figure 4.44 shows the practicelocation of the 1998 Dalhousie residency trainees, two yearsafter finishing their residency training. In 2000, 31%, or 25 ofthe 80 who completed their residency training at Dalhousie in1998, were practicing in Nova Scotia. The Atlantic Provincesoverall retained about half (51%), or 41 of Dalhousie's 80 post-MD trainees, from the 1998 class.Figure 4.43: Percentage of NS RN Graduates Registered in NS One Year After Graduation, 1995-2002 Percentage90% 80%70%60%50% 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2002 Source: CRNNS Grad Year2001 * 2002 data based on 6 months of data Figure 4.44: Where they Went - Practice Location of Dalhousie 1998 Residency Graduates, 2 Years Later,in 2002 Annual Report64 NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDYTrend wise, the proportion of Dalhousie residency graduates practicing in Nova Scotia two years after completing theirresidency training has declined, from 46% in 1995 to 31% in2000. 67 It should be noted, however, that while Nova Scotia onlyretained about one-third of Dalhousie residency trainees, itimports from other provinces. Of the 48 physicians practicingin Nova Scotia in 2000 who completed their residency trainingtwo years prior (in 1998), about one half (52%) completed theirresidency training in Nova Scotia. The remainder completedtheir residency training in another province. This is consistentwith the overall supply of physicians educated in Nova Scotia,in that 50% are Dalhousie graduates. Nova Scotia relies heavily on locally trained dentists in the delivery of oral health care services. The vast majority ofdentists in Nova Scotia are graduates from Dalhousie's Facultyof Dentistry. Data obtained from the Provincial Dental Boardof Nova Scotia indicated 88% of dentists were Dalhousiedentistry graduates, 10% were graduates of other Canadiandental schools and 2% weree graduates from internationalschools. Although most dentists in Nova Scotia are educated locally, only a small proportion of the annual Faculty of Dentistrygraduating class actually ends up practicing in Nova Scotiaafter graduation. In 2001, there were seven dentists registeredin Nova Scotia out of a Dalhousie Dentistry graduating class of35 in 2000. Thus, one year after graduation, Nova Scotiaretained approximately 20% of the 2000 graduating class.Between 1996 and 2000 there were 178 Dalhousie dentistrygraduates, of which 50 (28%) were licensed to practice in NovaScotia in 2001. There was limited information on other health care providers who move to/from Nova Scotia. A recent survey of 2001Dalhousie pharmacy graduates (64) indicated 33% of graduating students were employed in Nova Scotia one year followinggraduation, 16% of graduating students were working in NewBrunswick, 10% of graduating students were employed in PEIand 19% were employed in Ontario. As well, 17% of studentswent on to further education (including pharmacy residencies).There was one pharmacy graduate who had moved to theUnited States and three were reportedly working in othercommunity settings, but had unknown practice locations.Occupational therapists (OTs) also reported graduate retention statistics. In 2001, it was estimated Nova Scotia retained 12 outof 44 (27%) graduates from Dalhousies' occupational therapy(BScOT) program in 2001. However, key informants noted thatless than one-half of total enrolments in the BScOT program(45% in 2000-01) were from Nova Scotia. Therefore, it is notreasonable to expect that out of province students may returnto their province of origin upon graduation. 4.5.6 Changing Employment Settings During consultation with key informants each group orindividual was asked the following question: \"within theexisting system, what population/client groups are youcurrently under-servicing?\" Lack of adequate services forseniors, particularly in home care or long-term care settings,was a common observation. One trend likely to impact future program delivery involves the movement of registered nurses out of hospital settings, and into community based settings, such as home care and long-termcare. From 1993 to 2002, RNs employed in hospital settingshave been declining at an average rate of 1% per year, whereasRNs employed in nursing homes have been growing at a rateof 1.8% per year. As well, home care has experiencedsignificant growth, with a tripling of its RN employment overthis timeframe. Lack of funding for full time dietitians in community settings reportedly results in recruitment problems, especially in ruralareas and long-term care facilities. A number of facilities havefunding for 0.3 to 0.5 FTE's, which in turn results inrecruitment challenges, especially for new grads requiring anFTE position to adequately reduce their debt loads. Theresulting vacancies are thought to pose a strain on the existingworkload for full time dietitians. 68 Nationally, there has been a significant shift in the practicepatterns of occupational therapists toward community-based practice, many in a self-employed capacity with funding fromprivate sources, in addition to/or in place of, public health caresources. 69Occupational therapists indicated a view that their primary role could be better utilized in the home care setting,where they could be assisting the client in their transition/adaptation to their home environment. About two-thirds ofoccupational therapists in Nova Scotia are currently employedin hospital settings. 67. Derived from CAPER annual census documents.68. Key Informant Interview 69. Canadian Association of Occupational Therapists. The Education, Supply and Distribution of Occupational Therapists in Canada.. November 22, 2001NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDY 65Seniors face a number of barriers to obtaining adequate oral health care , including: the loss of dental insurance that comes with retirement; decreased mobility that comes with aging;and limited access to services in environments such as long-term care facilities. This is exacerbated by the fact that oralhealth services are not integrated into the overall health careservice delivery model for seniors. For example, Nova Scotialegislation requires any senior entering a long-term carefacility to have a physical exam, but an oral healthexamination is not part of this process. Within the academic environment, the recruitment and retention of faculty is influenced by the private sector labourmarket. For instance, a key informant suggested that incentivesare often not sufficiently attractive to recruit new faculty to thedentistry program, due to differences in earnings potentialbetween private and public sectors. Feedback from key informants at the DHA level indicated vacancies of pharmacists in hospital settings in some parts ofthe province had been an issue. 4.5.7 Shortage of Qualifications A number of key informants also suggested there wereshortages of qualified staff in some practice settings. Forinstance, representatives for dietitians noted feedback from some employers that there is a shortage of qualified people atthe Masters level. 70As of 2001, 22% of dietitians in Nova Scotia were educated at the Masters level. A shortage ofdoctorate trained psychologists for specific practice settings was also noted by key informants. 4.5.8 Measuring the 'Inflow and Outflow' of Health Care Workers Defining the various components of the inflow and outflow of health care workers is critical, as it provides informationnecessary for informed decision-making regarding HHRplanning and various recruitment and retention strategies. Ifthe specific characteristics of the inflow and outflow of humanresources were known, it would be possible to monitor thespecific elements of the supply of the health workforce overtime. Details on the nature and magnitude of the inflow andoutflow of health providers enables enhanced supplyprojections and forecasting, as well as better information onwhich to create targeted marketing strategies for recruitmentand retention of specific health occupations.At the present time, there are gaps in information required to measure the inflow and outflow of health care workers. Forinstance, as indicated previously, registered nurses andphysicians were the only occupations in Nova Scotia withsufficient detail on workforce mobility. Furthermore, projectingoutflows due to retirements is not possible for thoseoccupations without available information on age distribution.Also, the number and type of health workers who leave theworkforce due to death, injury, illness, maternity, or careerchange, etc., is generally not available from regulatory bodiesor professional associations. Lastly, as indicated previously,although the number of graduates from health programs eachyear is known, the number of graduates who remain in NovaScotia each year following graduation is not know for manyhealth occupations. 4.5.8.1 Example of Inflow/Outflow - Registered Nurses The most comprehensive information available on the inflowand outflow of health care workers was for registered nurses(RNs). Each year, nearly 500 RNs register to practice in NovaScotia. 71The annual inflow of RN registrants from 1994 to 2000 was comprised of the following: RNs who re-establish their registration following a period of absence. This component represented, on average, 43% of theinflow. Recent new graduates from Nova Scotia nursing programs. This represented 29% of the inflow. Recent new nursing graduates from other provinces. This represented 9% of the inflow. RNs that migrated from other provinces, to become new registrants in Nova Scotia. This represented 19% of the inflow. 70. Key Informant Interview71. The inflow and outflow figures were derived from the College of Registered Nurses of Nova Scotia database. The inflow and outflow figures were examined from 1994 to2002 in order to derive averages.66 NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDYIn contrast the outflow of RNs who do not renew their registration because of retirement, out-migration, careerchange, illness, injury/disability and maternity, death, amongother reasons. The difference between the inflow and outflowrepresents the net gain/loss of RNs registered to practice in Nova Scotia each year. From 1994-2002, the outflow of RNs averaged 597 per year, and the inflow averaged 497 per year. This has resulted in a net loss , on average, of 100 RNs per year. Figure 4.45 shows the annualnet gain/loss from 1994-2002. Cumulatively, there was a netloss of approximately 900 registered nurses registered in NovaScotia over this nine year time frame. However, the situation isimproving, as more recent years (1998-2002) indicate anaverage net loss of 34 RNs per year. At the present time the underlying causes for the outflow of RNs are not readily available. Given the magnitude of theannual outflow of RNs, particularly as increasing numbers ofRNs retire over the next decade, a greater understanding of thenature of the specific outflow measures will become critical tooptimize retention of RNs within the Nova Scotia workforce. While we may not understand fully the 'why', we do know some basic information about the 'what', of RNs who do not renew their registration. The average age of those RNschoosing not to renew their registration in 2002 was 41.4 years, and about one third (32%) were 50 years of age or older.Another noteworthy characteristic of those RNs not renewingtheir registration in 2002 was their higher casual employmentstatus at 26%, as compared to the average of 14% for theoverall nursing workforce in Nova Scotia.5.0 EDUCATING NOVA SCOTIA'S HEALTH WORKFORCE 5.1 INTRODUCTION Each year, nearly a thousand students enter more than 90 health related education and training programs in Nova Scotia'scommunity colleges, private career colleges and universities.Nova Scotia offers an education program for nearly every majorhealth care discipline. These programs are vital to ensuring thatthe province has the right number and mix of health careproviders with the right knowledge and skills to meet its healthcare needs. Forces shaping changes in health care over the next decade will have implications for education and training of the healthworkforce. Changing population demographics, new models ofservice delivery, evolving scopes of practice and technologicalinnovations are changing the numbers and mix of humanresources required, as well as the kinds of skills needed, todeliver health services in the future. Population demographics will create challenges. An aging, albeit healthier, and longer-living population means health care needswill gradually shift from predominately acute and episodic care,towards a greater emphasis on care for individuals with chronichealth conditions living within their community. At the sametime as the aging population creates pressure to increaseenrolment in health programs, there will be challenges tomaintaining sufficient enrolments, including a decline in the 18-21 year age cohort in Atlantic Canada from which new healthworkers would normally be drawn. Education institutions will be called upon to adapt education and training programs to meet our changing health care needs.They will also need to replace retiring faculty, address capitaland infrastructure requirements and increase their involvementin research and development activities. These challenges aresignificant, as there are concerns that Nova Scotia does not havesufficient critical mass and financial resources to sustain oureducation programs for health into the future. What can be done to address these challenges? The following sections will help to inform human resource planning efforts forhealth and health related disciplines by providing the following: Forces shaping changes in health care and the education system Characteristics of education and training for health disciplines in Nova Scotia Responding to challenges: education planning for health Figure 4.45: Registered Nurses Net Gain/Loss, NS, 1994-2002 Supply100 0 -100-200-300-400 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 Year2002NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDY 675.2 FORCES SHAPING CHANGE IN HEALTH CARE EDUCATION AND TRAINING Labour market planning is typically driven by economics and based on the rules of supply and demand in the marketplace.The health industry is an anomaly to this, as it reflects a mix ofsocial and economic models, with the social model predominant.The Canada Health Act (CHA) and its related social objectives ofaccess, comprehensiveness, universality, portability, and publicadministration often take precedence over efficiency and costeffectiveness. The forces for change dealt with in this sectionshould therefore be considered within that context. 5.2.1 Aging Population The impact of the aging population on the overall health systemwas discussed in Chapter 3. The increased volume of healthservices associated with caring for a larger population of seniorswill have a specific impact on education and training, resultingin a requirement for a different mix of occupational skill setsthan we have today. An aging population may increase demand for the following occupations: home care workers personal care workers licensed practical nurses registered nurses nurse practitioners physiotherapists respiratory therapists speech language pathologists occupational therapists dental hygienists palliative care counsellors Source: Making Career Sense of Labour Market An aging population will lead to increased demand for educationand training institutions to expand enrolments in programs forworkers at virtually all levels of education, including highlyskilled workers (e.g. geriatricians, long-term care administrators,physiotherapists, occupational therapists, social workers,registered nurses), workers with community college leveltraining (e.g. licensed practical nurses, personal care workers,home support workers) and individuals with little or no formaltraining in health care (unpaid providers, such as volunteers,family and relatives. 725.2.2 New Models of Health Care Delivery As mentioned previously (Chapter 3) Nova Scotia is moving awayfrom traditional medical models of health care and servicedelivery toward community-based, shared care models of servicedelivery. These models will require new ways of educating andtraining health care workers, including greater emphasis oninterdisciplinary learning. The move toward shared care models of service delivery may translate to a requirement for a different mix of occupationalskills. During consultation with key informants it was apparentthat various points of view existed among post-secondaryinstitutions about which occupations and skill sets will beneeded in community based health services in the future. Theperspective from one key informant from Dalhousie's Faculty ofHealth Professions noted \"what needs to change is the deliveryof services, not the skills underlying such services.\" Others pointed out that many services in long term care (LTC) and home care/home support (HC/HS) are currently beingdelivered by health care providers with community college leveltraining, such as personal care workers and home supportworkers, or by unpaid providers and family care givers with littleto no formal training. It was suggested that the communitycollege system, which trains many of these workers, may beunder-utilized for health discipline programs, especially for the'assisting' occupations. The Canadian Occupational ProjectionSystem (COPS) occupational outlook for 2002-2007 in Nova Scotiais projecting more than 13% employment growth for 'assisting'occupations in support of health services, and an 11% increasefor health workers overall. 5.2.2.1 Moving Away from SilosThe training of health care professionals in Nova Scotia, like other provinces in Canada, has historically occurred in silos,even where shared and overlapping scopes of practice existwithin the work environment. This was highlighted as a concernin the final report of the Commission on the Future of Health Care in Canada , which recommended that a national Health Council \"review existing education and training programs and providerecommendations to the provinces and territories on moreintegrated education programs for preparing health careproviders, particularly for primary health care settings.\" 73 Dalhousie University already has experience in integratingtraining opportunities across disciplines. Dalhousie's Tri-FacultyInter-professional Academic Advisory Committee provides inter-professional education opportunities between the faculties of 72. Summarized from Making Career Sense of Labour Market Information. Shaping Labour Market Trends. Table 3: Impact of Labour Market Trends in Occupations in theHealth and Medical Sector.73. Commission on the Future of Health Care in Canada, \"Building on Values: The Future of Health Care in Canada,\" Final Report, p.25068 NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDYdentistry, health professions and medicine. Although its impact on improving health outcomes is not yet clear,74there is increasing support for the concept of inter-professionaleducation, particularly among students. 75 Several informants noted barriers to inter-professionaleducation. For example, the Faculty of Medicine noted that todate the majority of Nova Scotia physicians are still practicingprimarily in solo practice environments. Therefore, whilestudents may become trained on the theory of collaborativepractice, they have little opportunity to adopt these skills oncethey enter practice. Formalized program articulation between universities and community colleges has had limited success to date. However,informal arrangements, collaboration, and increased interestwere occurring. Potential exists for cooperation betweenuniversity and college programs such as dentistry, pharmacy,recreation, kinesiology, nursing, and others. In addition, similar program offerings at different institutions set curriculum independent of each other. For instance, Dalhousie'snursing model is designed with a focus on acute care settings,whereas the St. Francis Xavier (StFX) and University College ofCape Breton (UCCB) program focus is on a community-basedmodel. The Applied Nutrition programs offered at threeeducation institutions in Nova Scotia have differing orientations.This minimizes opportunity for coordinating curriculumdevelopment for health discipline programs, even where thesame or similar program is offered at another educationalinstitution. Program articulation between universities couldenhance these offerings by providing standardization of the basecurriculum for the same/similar program offerings. 5.2.2.2 Use of Multi-Skilled Workers An emerging trend in some community settings involves the use of multi-skilled workers who are cross-trained to performprocedures and functions in two or more disciplines. For instance,there is increasing interest in having medical laboratorytechnologists cross-trained in X-ray, which is considered to beparticularly relevant in rural areas. 76An Alberta study revealed that just under half of the agencies and institutions surveyedemployed multi-skilled workers, with community health unitsemploying the greatest number of such workers. However, there isan absence of detailed research demonstrating the effectiveness ofmulti-skilled workers, particularly in community-based settings. 77Furthermore, as noted by another key informant from Dalhousie,there is also a need to examine employment demand as well asregulatory structures for this kind of work: There needs to be clear employment demand for such 'hybrids' and a regulatory regime for their work.. I note that we have a nursepractitioner programme that was much delayed by the lack of aregulatory framework for nurse practitioner practice. 5.2.2.3 Greater Acceptance of Complementary Service ProvidersThe public is increasingly receptive toward the services provided by alternative and complementary service providers. An April2000 Ipsos/Reid survey indicated that half of Canadians have by now used complementary health care at some point in theirlives, with chiropractic care being the most popular choice. 78 This will require the education system to adapt its curriculum,to allow for a broader knowledge base for professional practice.For instance, the College of Pharmacy at Dalhousie noted thatherbal therapy is now an integral part of its curriculum. 5.2.3 Innovations in Technology Technological innovations are being introduced in the healthcare system at an exponential rate. Innovations such aselectronic health records, telehealth and the use of complexinformation systems, require much greater technical capacityand computer knowledge for many health occupations. This will require health care workers to continually upgrade theirtechnical skills and become educated on advances. Furthermore,graduates will be expected to possess technological skills as partof the foundation of their knowledge and training. Innovations in technology will increase demand for occupations such as: Chief information officers Database managers Computer application specialists Genetic counselors Molecular genetic technicians MRI technologists Mammography technologists Laser and lithotripsy technicians Source: Making Career Sense of Labour Market Information. Technological innovations will also increase pressures oneducation institutions to adapt education delivery models. Forinstance, the introduction of technology has made distanceeducation increasingly more accessible to learners. While theseadvances will provide greater opportunities and enhancedpotential for communication for students, it creates challenges 74. Zwarenstien M et. Al (2001).

Furthermore,faculty must be given adequate support for technology-basedtraining and development in order to create successful distanceeducation programs. 79 Technological innovations will also increase pressures on education institutions to contribute to research anddevelopment. Proportionate expenditures on university researchin the United States are about double those in Canada. However,the situation is improving, as in 2000-01, Canadian Institute ofHealth Research (CIHR) had an injection of $65 million, and theCanadian Health Sciences Research Fund (CHSRF) received anadditional $35 million to research the effectiveness of theCanadian health care system. 5.2.4 Regulatory Environment The education and training of the health workforce in NovaScotia is increasingly driven by national standards. Nationalregulatory changes introduced over the past decade, such asChapter 7 of the Agreement on Internal Trade (AIT), enableworkers who are qualified for an occupation in one province to work in other provinces. Educational institutions areincreasingly required to prepare graduates to practice to nationalcompetencies, thereby ensuring the portability of healthprofessions. The accreditation process at the education andtraining institution is also driven by these nationally derivedcompetencies. While provincial differences still exist, AIT willencourage increasingly standardized entry-level competenciesand scopes of practice among regulated health care personnel. Some occupations have faced challenges implementing the AIT regulations due to differences in entry-to-practice requirementsbetween provinces. For instance, in Ontario, the AIT currentlypermits diplomas from Community College for social workers,whereas provincial regulations in Nova Scotia dictate minimumentry to practice requirements of a bachelor degree. For nursing,some provinces still accept diploma graduates, whereas EasternCanada requires a degree. The national regulatory entity forPsychology accredits PhD programs only, whereas a masters levelprogram is the recognized entry to practice for psychologists inmany Canadian provinces. Lastly, the national competency foropticians includes education and training for contact lens fitting,whereas only 15% of Nova Scotia's opticians are certified to docontact lens fittings. A concern raised by a number of informants was that these common competencies may become diluted to the lowestcommon denominator, such that they end up not reflecting oraligned with, provincial or regional health service needs. In preparing graduates to practice to national competencies, nomechanism currently exists to ensure that local health needs arebeing met. 5.2.4.1 Increasing Credentials As detailed previously, the entry to practice for a number of occupations which currently require a diploma are moving to abachelor's degree, while several others are moving frombachelors to masters degrees. The potential of this creepingcredentialism to affect both supply and distribution of healthoccupations has raised concerns. One rationale for increasing credentials is that better-prepared graduates are thought to possess the critical thinking andproblem solving skills required to keep pace with changes in thehealth care system. A key informant from Dalhousiesummarized in this line of thinking: In today's knowledge-based and technological (sic) advanced Canadian society, the health care system is one area of the economy that stands atthe frontiers of complexity of knowledge and technology. While strictlytechnological functions may be mastered through on-the-job training orshort-term technical training, successful preparation for a knowledge-based economy can only be achieved through education becauseeducation alone links teaching with theoretical foundations, researchand clinical education. Furthermore, education provides corebackground knowledge that makes utilization of research possible -these gains seem to be readily dismissed as \"creeping credentialism.\"Today's knowledge-based and therefore complex economy placesincreasingly complex demands on the health professions. Under thesecircumstances, the awarding of degrees is justified.\" A benefit of increasing credentials is that it can allow new graduates to broaden their areas of practice to include research,teaching, management, and policy development. It can alsocreate potential opportunities for recent graduates to practice innon-traditional employment settings. 5.2.5 Competition and Choices The stated entry requirement for acceptance into many of theundergraduate health discipline programs is high school or theequivalent of one year of undergraduate study. Increasingly,however, student applicants have pre-existing undergraduatedegrees. Key informants reported this for up to 50% of pharmacy,65% of occupational therapy and 75% of applied nutritionapplicants. Similarly, professions requiring a masters degree,such as speech language pathology and audiology, indicated anincreasing intake of students applying with two pre-existingdegrees. The double degree situation facing many health professionals in Nova Scotia results in a double debt situation for the student,arising from eight or more years of post-secondary education tocomplete a four-year health program. This is an area worthy of 79. Irani, Tracy and Telg, Ricky. Building It So They Will Come: Assessing Universities' Distance Education Faculty Training and Development Programs. Journal of DistanceEducation/Revue de l'enseignement \u00e0 distance (2002). ISSN: 0830-044570 NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDYfurther study, given that the average debt upon graduation from a four-year bachelor degree program in Nova Scotia hasincreased almost 2.5 times over the past decade, from $9,000 toapproximately $22,000. One potential contributing factor to the double degree and double debt situation may be the lack of direct entry into somehealth programs from high school. Unlike disciplines such asEngineering, Commerce and Business, which allow direct entryto programs following high school, health programs such asOccupational Therapy, Physiotherapy, Pharmacy, Social Work orDental Hygiene have minimum entry requirements equivalent toone year university. This has led to qualified first year studentshaving to compete with various levels of undergraduate andgraduate education, both within and from other universities inthe region. With the heightened competition for entry into theseprograms, there is a natural tendency to give preference to thestudent with a higher educational level. High student debt has the potential to influence student behavior in ways that negatively impact planning. While not an issue for the 50% of students who graduate without debt, 80 increased debt may influence students' decision to enter aprogram, the choice of program and where to practice upongraduation. These are all key determinants which ultimately,can impact the number, mix and distribution of workforcesupply. In addition to the financial hardship imposed fromadditional student debt, there is a potential societal cost fromlost productive service to the health industry due to increasedtime in school. Concerns have been raised by national dental and medical associations, regarding the impact of increasing student debt onstudent choices and well-being. Both groups expressed concernsthat increasing tuition could be: Closing the door on those who cannot afford high tuition, or who wish to avoid high student debt loads, resulting in a lessdiverse student population, and, in turn, a less diverseworkforce; Influencing students to choose specialty areas that which will maximize earning potential in order to pay off; Encouraging graduates to choose practice locations offering the best potential for quick debt repayment; Discouraging rural students from enter training, given higher costs, thus making rural recruitment more difficult; and Negatively affecting the health and well being of students, and new entrants into the labour force. 5.2.6 Enrolment Trends in Canada In the 2001-02 academic year, Canadian universities served 1.3million students and 34,500 full time faculty. There were 646,000(60%) full time students, 275,000 (10%) part time students and400,000 (30%) continuing education students. In the 1980's, theOrganization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reported the percentage of people attending university inCanada ranked number two in the world (behind the UnitedStates). By the end of the 1990's, however, Canada's ranking haddropped to number eight. 81 Full time enrolment growth in Canadian universities peaked in1992, leveled off and remained flat throughout most of the1990's. However, from 1999-2001 enrolment growth has reneweditself once again, with an additional 45,000 (7.5%) full timestudents attending Canadian universities. Enrolment increases are primarily influenced by two key demographic factors: growth in the population (of 18-24 yearolds) and/or increases in the participation rate (proportionatelymore students attending educational institutions). Other keydeterminants include: Parental education and peer attitudes; Family income; Labour market demand; and Growth of the knowledge-based economy. These factors are expected to translate over 2001-2011 into university enrolment growth of 20 to 30% , or an additional200,000 students across the country. Some 20,000 more facultywill need to be replaced due to retirement and attrition, andanother 20,000 more will be required to respond to projectedenrolment growth. 82 While university participation rates are projected to be theprimary driver of future enrolment growth in Canada in thecoming decade, changing population demographics attributableto the influx of children of the baby boomer era is also expectedto play a contributing role. From 2001-2011, the population of 18-21 year olds is projected to increase by 8.5%, and the 22-24 yearolds by 6%. 83 This contrasts with the past twenty years when Canadaexperienced demographic declines in these age groups, andrelied upon increasing female participation rates for universityenrolment growth. Females have accounted for more than 90%of total enrolment growth in Canada in the past decade and nowaccount for more than half (56%) of full time, and more than 60%of part time enrolments in Canadian universities. 84 Health program enrolment is predominately female. Theseprograms have been able to take advantage of high femaleparticipation rates to maintain enrolments. However, growth inuniversity full time enrolment in Canada in recent years hasbeen in programs other than health, and females areincreasingly choosing more diverse professions. 80.

While Engineering, Businessand Science experienced increases in total enrolments (7% to8%), and in female enrolments (12% (Health respectively).

Table 5.2: Community College Enrolments, Canada, 1994-95 to 1998-999 Total % change Female % change Community College Programs 94-95 to 98-99 94-95 11% Source: Education in Canada 2000 These recent trends in female enrolments may have a negative impact on overall health program enrolment in Nova Scotia.Nova Scotia has a much higher participation rate (ratio ofstudents to population in the same age group) among femalesthan the national average, likely because of the high influx of 18- 21 year olds into its multiple university setting. The Education in Canada, 2000 report indicated 65% of 18-21 year-old females and 47% of 18-24 year-old attended post-secondaryinstitutions in Nova Scotia in 1998-99 versus 35% and 38 %nationally. 85At issue for Nova Scotia is whether it can continue to rely upon increased female participation to fuel enrolmentgrowth for education and training of health care professionals. Another issue for Nova Scotia involves the 18-21 age group. The so-called \"echo\" generation, a surge in children born between1974 and 1991, will be heard in Ontario and the West, but not inthe Eastern Provinces. Over the next decade, there is projectedto be a decline in Quebec and negative or flat growth in theAtlantic Provinces for the 18-21 year age cohort, from whichmuch of the enrolment in post-secondary institutions and healthcare occupations is normally drawn (Figure 5.1). Looking ahead, the impact of negative growth in the Atlantic region for the 18-21 year old age cohort is difficult to predict. Forthe net effect of this population variable on enrolment growthlikely results from its interaction with other key variables (e.g.debt, family savings, government transfers) that influence post-secondary enrolments in educational institutions. However, thenet effect of negative population growth in the Atlantic region,coupled with Nova Scotia's significantly higher femaleparticipation rates than the rest of Canada, would suggest thatNova Scotia may need to recruit greater numbers beyond itsAtlantic borders for educating its future health disciplines. 85.

Inaddition, there are a number of private career colleges offering arange of health education and training programs. In addition to education and training its own health care workers, several Nova Scotia educational institutions have asignificant regional role. Nova Scotia has Provincial, Maritimeand Atlantic health discipline programs (Table 5.3). A provincialprogram would typically produce graduates for the Nova Scotialabour market, whereas Atlantic or Maritime programs wouldgive priority to Maritime and Atlantic students, and producegraduates for the same regions.Table 5.3: Selected Health Discipline Programs Delivered in N.S.

Theremaining five institutions provide between two and sevenhealth programs each. 5.3.2 Programs not Offered in Nova Scotia Among the health discipline programs not offered in Nova Scotiaare (Table 5.4): entry-level programs for medical radiationtherapy, medical laboratory technology, optometry, midwiferyand chiropractic. As well, much of the education and training forthe various assisting occupations (associated with physiotherapy,occupational therapy, dietetics, audiology, etc) which typicallyproduce certificate or diploma trained graduates are not offeredlocally.Figure 5.2: Distribution of Students Enrolled in Health Related Programs by Institution Universities 89%NSCC 11%NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDY 73Table 5.4: Selected Health Programs Not Offered in Atlantic Region Formal Agreement Program Location Established Chiropractic CMCC; UQTR No Optometry Waterloo, UQAM No Paramedic (P3) PEI Yes Medical Laboratory Technology * NBCC Yes Medical Radiation Therapy Michener Yes Midwifery McMaster, Ryerson, No Trois-Rivieres, UBC * Entry level diploma program Where no provincial education programs exist, Nova Scotia obtains its supply by recruiting graduates from other provincesor by sending local students to education programs at schoolsoutside the province. For some, government or employerspurchase seats from education institutions outside the provinceto guarantee spots for Nova Scotia students. Examples of seatpurchase agreements include: The DOH purchases 25 seats each year from the New Brunswick Community College to train medical laboratorytechnologists. Bursaries of $8,000 ($4,000 per year) are providedfor each student, with a two-year return for servicecommitment. Employment following graduation is notguaranteed. The Queen Elizabeth II (QEII) purchases 4 seats each year from Michener Institute in Ontario to provide education and trainingfor medical radiation therapists. Students are provided with a$500 bursary each month they live in Toronto (first two years ofthe program) and have their full tuition paid by the QEII. Thereis a two-year return in service agreement and employment isguaranteed upon return. There are several challenges associated with out-of-province health programs with subsidized seats. First, it is not clear whois responsible for recruiting Nova Scotia students into theseprograms to ensure adequate student representation from NovaScotia. Secondly, there has been little or no formal follow upprocesses established to determine how many Nova Scotiastudents return to practice in the province once they graduate. As noted previously, lack of an entry level education program has been noted as a concern for medical laboratorytechnologists. 86In the meantime, government increased thenumber of seat purchases in the New Brunswick community college program to 25. To address historically high attrition rates,the following strategies have been proposed: 87 Introduction of an $8,000 bursary for the 25 students ($4,000 per year), with a one-year return for service commitment; Improved screening of students; and Work placements for students in local labs and hospitals. The lack of a provincial education program for midwives was also noted as a concern. 88With an increasing role contemplated for midwives in the delivery of primary care services in Nova Scotia,adequate access to education and training programs for midwivesbecomes an important consideration. In Canada, there arecurrently five universities offering baccalaureate degrees inmidwifery. 89 Three are located in Ontario, one is in Qu\u00e9bec and one is located in British Columbia. Although Nova Scotia has not traditionally had an education program for Advanced Care Paramedics (ACP), a partnership wasintroduced in 2001 between NSCC, PEI's Holland College andNova Scotia's Emergency Health Services, to deliver a trainingprogram locally. The first 20-month ACP class was introduced inthe fall of 2001. There were 43 students training in threecampuses around the province (Truro, Dartmouth andMiddleton). The NSCC also hopes to introduce a program inCape Breton. In 2003, the provincial government will build uponthe bursary program offered by Emergency Medical Care (EMC),by offering bursaries for up to 13 advanced paramedics whoagree to work in Nova Scotia. Unrealized opportunities may exist in Atlantic Canada to create educational and training programs for a number of assistantlevel occupations. For instance, there is currently no localprogram available for physiotherapy or other rehabilitationsupport personnel in Nova Scotia. There is a program at theCollege of North Atlantic in Newfoundland, which offers acertificate for physiotherapists' assistants. It is noteworthy thatNew Brunswick has adopted a program that incorporateseducation and training for a number of rehabilitation assistantoccupations (e.g. physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speechlanguage). 5.3.3 Enrolment Characteristics of Nova Scotia Programs Figure 5.3 shows Dalhousie University as the dominanteducation and training location for publicly funded healthrelated programs, with 45% of total health related enrolments,encompassing over 50 different programs. The other fiveuniversities and the NSCC divide the remaining students fairlyevenly, with St FX having the next largest share, with a healthenrolment of 16%. 86. Health Canada.

Individual institutional enrolments in health relatedprograms range from 9% to 12% at SMU and NSCC, to 35% atDalhousie (Figure 5.4). As Table 5.5 indicates, there has been little increase in overall enrolment in health programs between 1991 and 2001, with onlyoccupational therapy and social work showing significantincreases.

While there has been no large shift in the age profile for postsecondary students overall in Canada, this has not been the casefor health professions in Nova Scotia. Table 5.6 shows enrolmentby age category for selected health programs in Nova Scotia attwo points in time, in 1991-92 and in 2001-02. About 45% ofstudents enrolled in the social workers bachelors program in2001-02 at Dalhousie were over 35 years of age, compared to 33%in 1991-92. As well, 55% of speech language pathology andaudiology students in 2001-02 were over 25 years of age,compared to 36% a decade earlier. Medical students were alsoolder, with 56% over 25 years in 2001-02, compared with 42% in1991-92. Similarly, pharmacy, occupational therapy andphysiotherapy had 26%, 28% and 30% of students 25 years in as compared to 11%, 15% and 19% respectively adecade earlier. Table 5.6: Selected Health Programs, NS, 1991-92 and 2001-02 <20 yrs 20 24 yrs 25 indication of the aging trend among students, all ofthe occupations shown in Figure 5.6 had a higher proportion ofolder students (25 years of age and over) enrolled in 2001-02 thanin 1991-92 academic years. Part of the explanation for this maybe related to the higher proportion of students entering healtheducation and training programs in Nova Scotia who have pre-existing degrees.Figure 5.3: Nova Scotia Health Source: Enroled in Health Related Programs in Public Sector Institutions, NS, 2000-01 20-24 yrs 47%25-34 yrs 24% 35+ yrs 16%NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDY 75Sex Reflecting the predominately female (86%) makeup of thosealready working in the health care field, enrolment in healthrelated programs at Nova Scotia's post secondary education andtraining institutions was over 77% female (Figure 5.7). A number of programs have increased the proportion of females, as compared to the supply of the workforce (Table 5.7). That gaphas helped to perpetuate feminization of the health industry,which has recently moved beyond the traditional femaledominated occupations of nursing or dental hygienist todisciplines like medicine, dentistry and pharmacy. Table 5.7: Female Proportion of Education Enrolments vs. Supply by Health Related Program, NS, 2001 Education Supply Program Proportion Proportion Medicine 52% 31% 65% Increasing numbers of female graduates becomes a planning issue for health disciplines, especially as it relates to femaleparticipation and productivity within the labour force. Somerecent research is indicating that practice patterns differsignificantly by age and by gender for healthcare providers. Based on today's gender mix within the Dalhousie MedicalSchool, an additional enrolment of seven students would berequired to maintain the same level of physician services (asmeasured by billing activity) within Nova Scotia as thepredominantly male (64%) graduating class of 1991. Geographic Origin In addition to educating and training its own health careworkers, Nova Scotia institutions have a significant regional role.The overall geographic origin for enrolments in these 90+programs was 71% from Nova Scotia, and 87% overall from theAtlantic region (Figure 5.8). Table 5.8 indicates priority is given to the education and training of Atlantic students for most of the health programs offered inNova Scotia. It is noteworthy that the psychology PhD intake fromnon-Atlantic provinces was at 44%. As well, the proportions ofInternational enrolments were higher for medicine and dentistry.

Governments provide core funding to colleges and universitieswhile students pay tuition. In Nova Scotia, government fundingfor post secondary institutions comes primarily through blockfunding from the Department of Education (DOE), based upon atargeted formula developed in 1998 that utilized a three year(1994-97) weighted average mix of Full-Course-Equivalents(FCEs). Core funding flows for the Maritime provinces are in accordance with the Regional Programs Agreement of the MaritimeProvinces Higher Education Commission (MPHEC), typicallybased on the number of students enrolled from their province oforigin. New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island annually haveregional transfers based upon the number of seats for studentsoriginating from their province. These regional funding transfersare directed into a government general revenue account. This differs from the arrangement for Newfoundland and Labrador, where Return for Service (RFS) agreements arenegotiated with students, and separate funding is typicallytransferred directly to the educational institution. 5.3.4.1 Declining Government Funding Over the last decade, overall government funding for post- secondary institutions in Canada has declined, even as enrolmenthas climbed. In 2001, the proportion of funding for Nova Scotiauniversities from government sources was somewhatdisproportionate relative to the rest of Canada. As a result, thecost to students of a health education, or indeed any postsecondary education, has increased significantly across thecountry (Figure 5.9). This trend is most pronounced in Nova Scotia. In terms of provincial university operating grants per student, it ranked inlast place among provinces. In fiscal 2002-03, tuition feesaccounted for significantly more of university and collegerevenue in Nova Scotia (26.2%) than the national average (19.2%).At the same time, Table 5.9 shows government transfers haveprovided significantly less.Table 5.9: University and College Revenues by Source, Canada and NS, 2002-03 Tuition Govt. Revenue Revenue % Tuition Revenue Statistics, July 2003 Over the past decade Nova Scotia tuition has increased 93%. In2002-03, Nova Scotia's tuition fees ($5,214) were 28% higher thanthe average tuition fees elsewhere in Canada ($3,738). 5.3.4.2 Health Funding Increases Crowding out Education Universities and colleges have consistently lost out in recent years to the health care industry in the competition forgovernment funding, as shown in Table 5.10. Table 5.10: Expenditures Nova Scotia, Health vs. m. 21% Post Seondary 262 m. 266 m. 276 m. 277 m. 6% Source: NS Dept. of Finance, budget documents 5.3.4.3 Universities Have Lion's Share of Public Funding in Nova Scotia A characteristic of the post-secondary education and training system in Nova Scotia is the dominance of the university sector.Table 5.11 compares the allocation of post-secondaryexpenditures in Nova Scotia versus Canada. Historically,university expenditures in Canada represent about threequarters of total post secondary expenditures, and communitycollege expenditures about 25%. This was not the case in NovaScotia however, where a decade ago over 90% of post secondaryexpenditures were associated with universities. In recent years,Nova Scotia has moved closer to the national norm. Table 5.11: Ratio of University to Community College Expenditures, Canada and NS, Selected Years Ratio per Year 1993-94 Canada, Education in Canada 2000 The imbalance in spending between universities and communitycolleges in Nova Scotia is primarily because there are significantlymore students enrolled in universities than other provinces. AsTable 5.12 shows, Nova Scotia's full and part time universityenrolment of 39.6 per 1,000 population is indeed the highest ofFigure 5.9: University Funding Sources, Nova Scotia and Canada, 2001 Source: SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDY 77any province in Canada, and 25% higher than the next nearest province. However, it is also noteworthy that Nova Scotia hadmore students enrolled in community college programs in 1998-99 than three other provinces. Table7.7: Full-Time and Part-Time Post-Secondary Enrolment/1000 Population, by Province, 1998-99 Province University Community College Newfoundland & Labrador 29.0 11.9 Prince Edward Island 20.9 14.3 Nova Scotia 39.6 7.8 New Brunswick 30.2 7.1 Quebec 31.6 23.6 Ontario 26.3 13.3 Manitoba 26.9 5.9 Saskatchewan 30.5 2.8 Alberta 24.9 16.8 British Columbia 19.1 21.6 Source: Statistics Canada, Education in Canada 2000 5.3.4.4 Government Funding for Health Related Programs inNova Scotia Approximately $52 million was allocated by the Nova Scotia Department of Education (DOE) in 2000-01 to undergraduate andgraduate health and health related programs. This representedabout one quarter of the total university funding from the DOEto the six universities with health related programs.Supplementary targeted funding toward education of healthprofessionals of an additional $20+ million from the DOH meantthat about one third of the public funding for universities inNova Scotia was targeted at health related programs. Dalhousie University had the highest proportion of funding directed at health related programs (Table 5.13). Of the $99.3million total operating grant allocated to Dalhousie from theDOE, approximately 45% of it was targeted funding for healthrelated programs.With funding for more than 5,000 full time equivalents for healthand health related programs, DOE funding represented nearly$10,000 per FTE. In comparison, with total enrolments of about30,000 FTEs, DOE funding represents approximately $6,220 per FTE over all program areas. On the basis of five FCEs representingan FTE, table 5.13 indicates that, with the exception of Dalhousie,universities received more funding for non-health relatedprograms than for health related programs. This is likely related to the funding of a higher proportion of undergraduate healthrelated FCEs at these other universities, relative to the makeup of their total program funding. Based upon the weighted funding formula, graduate health related programs in Nova Scotia require more funding per FTE than undergraduate programs, and Dalhousie accounts theoverwhelming majority of the graduate health programs in NovaScotia. As an example, dentistry programs received 10 times morefunding per FTE than undergraduate programs such as psychologyand gerontology. While 45% of Dalhousie's health related FTEscome from graduate programs, approximately two-thirds of itsgovernment funding for health was for its graduate programs. New health related programs introduced in more recent years and expansions to existing programs have been funded throughother sources. In addition, the DOH contributes targeted fundingof more than $20 million toward the education and training ofselected health programs, including medicine, nursing, and thehealth sciences programs at the QEII. NSCC received approximately $64 million in public funding (86% Provincial and 14% Federal Funding) in 2000-01. Approximately$12.3 million was spent in 2000-01 on certificate and diplomaprograms in the NSCCs School of Health and Human Services. Table 5.13: DOE Formula Based Funding to Universities, NS, 2000-01 Total Total Health FTEs Funded $/FTE University Funding Related Funding Health Related Health Related FTEs Department of Education, 2001 Note: Other schools included in the Total DOE $$ and FTEs (AST, NSAC, NSCAD, UKC, USA)78 NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDY5.3.4.5 Funding Model not Responsive to Change The current funding for post secondary education in Nova Scotia is derived from an outdated funding model, based upon aweighted average of 1994-1997 FCEs. Furthermore, there is noformal accountability framework, to monitor how funds areallocated and spent on health discipline programs within each ofthe educational institutions. The lack of cash flow for working capital and startup, coupled with a time lag in program funding, makes it difficult to transition toany program expansion model. Recent examples of successfulprogram expansion occurring without direct DOEw fundingsupport include: Dalhousie's introduction of a Masters expansion of its DistanceEducation Program; and Pharmacy's $1 million investment toexpand its existing infrastructure to allow an intake of up to 35%more seats. It speaks well of the innovation and effort of theeducational institutions to successfully progress despite thedeficiencies associated with the funding formula and its flow. 5.3.5 Clinical Placement and Preceptor Capacity Students in health programs spend a lot of time in the classroom.For some , up to 50% of their program consists of clinicalplacements, which are often supervised on a voluntary basis byclinical professionals or preceptors. The logistics of clinicalplacements in Nova Scotia are the responsibility of eachdepartment. Practices and resources vary considerably by healthdiscipline program. Dalhousie, the QEII, professional associationsand employers all assume various coordination roles, fromvolunteer to paid, depending upon the profession. A fundamental component for many of the Atlantic and Maritime health programs involves clinical placements outside of theprovince. Students apply their learning in various care settingswithin the Atlantic and/or broader geographic region. Dalhousiehas affiliation and clinical agreements with provinces in theAtlantic region and beyond. Clinical placements also vary geographically by year of program. While overall 22% of Occupational Therapy's clinical placementswere placed outside of the Atlantic region in 2000-01, more than80% of the third year clinical placements were outside of theAtlantic region. Many of the health programs, such as Pharmacy,tended to have clinical placement distribution proportionate tothe province of origin of enrolments (68% in Nova Scotia in 2000-01). Most of the provincial health programs at universities andcommunity colleges, such as nursing programs (BScN and LPN)have most, if not all, of their clinical placements in Nova Scotia. Clinical education is increasingly being identified as a barrier to increasing enrolments in certain programs. Key informantfeedback indicated there was insufficient resource (HR/financial)capacity, inadequate coordination of logistical arrangements, anda lack of infrastructure in the field to meet the existing and future demand for clinical placements. Dietetics, occupational therapy, dental hygiene and nursing all indicated availability of clinical placement sites or preceptors wasbecoming a bottleneck in sustaining or expanding programs. Inrecognition of this issue, the DOH recently funded an initiative toexamine the current and future role of clinical education forselected health disciplines. Competition exists for limited clinical placement and preceptor resources, especially within the hospital setting (nursing, medicalstudents, and paramedics in the ER setting). Other professionssuch as pharmacy, physiotherapy, nursing, dietitians, audiologyand speech language pathology indicated clinical placement sitedifficulties, some noting reductions of 30% to 50% in placementsat the QEII because of a lack of preceptor supervisory time. Another challenge facing clinical placements is aligning theory so it can be applied clinically in the field. The Medical School atDalhousie indicated a catch-22 situation for their clinicalplacements. They indicated they teach to the team philosophyconcept, but students cannot apply their learning in the field, asthey are often placed in silo practice environments. Anotherconcern raised by one of the rehabilitation disciplines was thetendency for some employers to continue with the apprenticeshipmodel, whereby the clinical placement was viewed as an extrapair of hands, rather than being given the opportunity formentorship and application of knowledge into learning. Some health occupations requiring placement in multiple practice settings (e.g. dietitians in community, hospital and LTC) indicatedthat the logistics of arranging placements has become very timeconsuming. As well, occupations requiring placement in multiplesectors of employment (e.g. health and education sectors)indicated there was not enough time to do justice to both healthsettings and other industry settings. 5.3.6 Recruiting for Health Discipline Programs in Nova Scotia Nova Scotia has no overall, coordinated student recruitment strategy for its health discipline programs. For the most part,university recruitment responsibilities are de-centralized todepartment heads for each of the health disciplines, resulting inrecruitment practices that vary considerably. Where centralizedrecruitment initiatives existed, there were common issues, such asinadequate representation at recruitment fairs. Each school istypically allowed only two representatives at recruitment fairs,irrespective of the volume of their program offerings or the size oftheir student bodies. There was a lack of agreement among key informants about the target market for recruitment efforts. For instance, should it behigh school students, first year students and/or undergraduates asper stated program entry requirements, or post-graduate degreestudents? With the continued inflation of entry requirements, anNOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDY 79unstated consensus may be emerging around the latter preference. Regarding the recruitment of students from the Atlantic provinces into programs with an Atlantic mandate, there were nostandardized arrangements between universities and provincialgovernments. One department representative indicated it was theindividual province's decision, while another wanted significantinvolvement in the selection process. As well, it was not clearwhether out-of-province individuals independently applying (i.e.those not wanting to enlist in a return-for-service program), wereconsidered part of the total quota allotment for that province. Many of the health discipline programs at Dalhousie have entry- level requirements of one year of university (e.g. Pharmacy,Physiotherapy, Occupational Therapy, Kineseology). However, thereare no inter-provincial agreements on who is accountable, bothlocally and regionally, to actively recruit from the pool outside ofDalhousie's first year students. There is no accountability framework with performance measures to ensure that neighboring provinces in the region canmeet their health education and training needs, nor is there amechanism for providing provincial authorities with feedback onthe cause of anticipated enrolment shortfalls. Such a processmight, for example, allow provinces to alleviate enrolmentshortages through a better recruitment effort at home. 5.3.6.1 Applicant to Enrolment Ratios An important recruitment measure reflecting potential interest in health discipline programs is the ratio of applicants to enrolments.Looking ahead, Table 5.14 illustrates applicant to enrolment ratiosfor some university and community college health disciplineprograms. These ratios are indicators of applicant interest andenrolment quality in education programs. Some of the Atlanticand Maritime programs have experienced declining applicant-to-enrolment ratios in recent years. Table 5.14: Applicant to Enrolment Ratios for Selected Health Programs Applicant to Enrolment Ratios % Change Program 1999-2000 2001-2002 99-00 to 01-02 Dental Hygiene 2.4 2.2 -9% Dentistry 7.2 4.4 -39% Health Services Admin (Master) 1.9 2.1 11% Human Comm.

For example,the Dalhousie School of Pharmacy undertook a recruitment drive aspart of their program expansion, as well as to revitalize studentinterest in their profession. In turn, in 2001-2002, the number ofpharmacy applicants increased by 156%, to 348 applicants, up from136 applicants in 2000-2001. Another example of successful recruitment effort occurred within the occupational therapy program, which experienced a 40% declinein applicants over a three-year period from 1999-00 to 2001-02. Aprogram recruitment effort resulted in a pool of applicants for 2002-2003 that was more than double the previous year. 5.3.6.2 Recruiting New Graduates into the Health WorkforceOne of the most significant challenges is recruiting new graduates into the local workforce. In 2001, 27% of occupational therapygraduates chose to license to practice in Nova Scotia, from agraduating class made up of 48% of students of Nova Scotia origin.In 2001, about 54% of nursing graduates registered to practice inNova Scotia, from a graduating class that was 82% of Nova Scotiaorigin. A recent survey of 2001 Dalhousie pharmacy graduates indicated that one year after graduation, 59% were employed in AtlanticCanada, from a graduating class comprised of 92% of AtlanticCanadians. About 19% were employed in Ontario, 5% elsewhere andthe remaining 17% were pursuing further education. However, withonly 4 students enrolled in the pharmacy residency program in2001-02, this suggested that some of the remaining seven studentsthat were pursuing further education were likely studying outside ofthe field of pharmacy. Suggested reasons graduates exiting included: Lack of local employment opportunities (Occupational Therapy) Wage disparity between provinces (Pharmacy) Lack of local full time positions (Nursing) Economic, lifestyle, labour market, demographic and cultural changes are resulting in rehabilitation and social sciencesprofessions such as audiology, speech language pathology,psychology, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, pharmacy, etctrending more and more toward private practice and industriesoutside of health services. 5.3.6.3 Recruiting Faculty Recruiting and retaining faculty was an expressed concern for some professions such as dentistry, speech language pathology andaudiology, pharmacy and medicine. In several cases, educators havebeen brought in from other provinces and the United States to coverthe delivery of programs. For others, a barrier to attracting facultywas said to be the disparity in compensation between industry andeducational institutions, especially for health occupations workingin the private sector. A concern for some schools is the need to recruit replacements for a large number of pending faculty retirements. More than 80% offaculty in Canadian universities are 40 years of age or older, and one80 NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDYthird are expected to retire in the coming decade. In the Maritime provinces almost half of all faculty (47%) were 50 years of age orolder during the 1998-99 academic year. The following chart showsthe average age for full time faculty by discipline in the Maritimeprovinces, indicating faculty teaching health programs were onaverage, 48 years (Figure 5.10). More specifically 41% of the faculty at the Dalhousie School of Medicine was over 50 years. Nearly one-half of these impendingretirees are appointed on a limited term basis, while tenure trackand CAPR track appointees are anticipated to account for 21% and 29% of retirees, respectively. 90Broken down by employment status, 51% of full time medical faculty and 31% of part time faculty were 50years of age or older.5.3.7 Continuing Education Life long learning is important to health professionals and to thepublic they serve. At present, some health professionals participatein continuing education development opportunities throughmembership in an organization, while others are required by law toparticipate as part of their license renewal. The delivery and coordination of continuing education varies between educational, regulatory and professional associations andindustry and employers. Various occupations have mandatorycontinuing education specified in both legislation and regulations.Other occupations, such as medicine, have not formally writtenthem into regulations, but their legislation specifies they are at thediscretion of the regulatory entity. Still other occupations such asmedical radiation therapists do not have continuing educationspecified in either legislation or regulation. Even with the availability of continuing education, existing workforce shortages make it difficult for individuals to take part, asthere is typically no additional staff or limited financial resources topay expenses or cover the workload of participating employees.Health care employers are expressing concern that lifelong learningrequires orientation, continuing education, and professionaldevelopment, all of which are priorities. Financial support for theseareas, however, is currently outside the scope of HRDCs fundingmandate. Career advancement and career laddering opportunities were noticeably nominal or absent for many of the health occupations.Speech language and audiology noted that in Nova Scotia andelsewhere, almost everyone works in the field, with fewer than 10%in management positions. Other occupations, such as dietitians,indicated limited management career path mobility within theexisting environment.Figure 5.10: Average Age of Full-Time Faculty by Principal Subject Taught, Maritime Provinces,1993-94 and 1998-99 1993-94Education Fine Arts Humanities Social Sciences Commerce Agric. & Biol.

As nationaland international competition for scarce health care resourcesintensifies, there is an increasing focus on determining themost effective recruitment and retention strategies. To date,the most popular or preferred strategies used to addresshuman resource shortages have been to 'produce more.' Thisis usually accomplished by increasing enrolments in educationand training programs and by recruiting more workers into theprovince from elsewhere. While these strategies are essentialcomponents of HHR planning efforts, they should not be thesole focus. The consensus emerging in the HHR literature suggests a high quality work environment, coupled with financial incentives, isequally important to attract and retain motivated andproductive health care workers. Individuals with weakemployment relationships have higher rates of turnover,higher absenteeism rates, lower workplace morale, and lack of skill development and use. 91This can, and does, have a negative impact on the productive use of available resources, and can even impact patient health.92 Work environment characteristics are especially important considering changes in service delivery underway in NovaScotia. The Report of the Nova Scotia Advisory Committee on Primary Health Care Renewal paints a picture of health care service delivery that emphasizes collaborative workingrelationships and evolving roles among health professionals.This will require a work environment that is flexible, adaptableto change and encourages innovation. Figure 6.1: Declining and Emerging Workplaces Declining Workplace Emerging Workplace Bureaucratic workplace Flexible Workplace Multi-layered silos, rigid hierarchy Flatter, fluid organizational form Top-down chain of command Employee participation in decision- making, Shared information Specialized division of labour Extensive work teams Driven by rules and regulations Delegated responsibility Training Continuous learning Vertical career mobility Horizontal and spiral career paths Work environment issues not important Healthy, supportive work environment Source: Derived from G. Lowe, Employer of Choice: Workplace Innovation in Government. CPRN Synthesis Report, 2001.It is within this context that the work life of health care workers in Nova Scotia should be examined. The followinginformation is intended to highlight some of the majoremployment-related issues and trends, to enable a betterunderstanding of Nova Scotia's health workforce and theidentification of possible priorities for future HHR planning. 6.1.1 Defining and Measuring Quality of Working Life in Health Care Most individuals everywhere care about being valued and, having control over their work and having greater flexibility inthe workplace. Consider the following top 10 jobcharacteristics which Canadian workers consider, in rank orderof importance, to be 'very important' in a job: 93 1. Treats them with respect2. Provides interesting work 3. Encourages good communications among co-workers4. Gives a feeling of accomplishment5. Allows a balance between work and family 6. Develops skills and abilities and allows a chance to develop professionally 7. Friendly and helpful coworkers8. Pays well9. Good job security10.Career advancement Interestingly, tangible issues such as compensation (#8) and job security (#9) were ranked well below dimensions of worksuch as respect (#1), interesting work (#2) and goodcommunication (#3). The health care sector faces particular challenges in this regard. A Canadian Policy Research Network Changing Employment Relationships Study noted that health professionals were least likely of all occupations surveyed to rate their workenvironment as 'healthy. 94Furthermore, while health occupations reported the highest commitment to the type ofwork they do, they reported the lowest commitment to theiremployers. 95Also, occupations in health were less likely to rate their job as allowing them to balance work and family orpersonal life. 96 Given the importance of work life quality to the overalloperation of the health care system, it is important to collectand report meaningful, reliable and standardized measures of work life quality. Unfortunately, most information on qualityof work life in Nova Scotia is anecdotal. There are currently no standardized measures of work life quality that can becompared across employment settings, occupational groupsand geographic areas. There is, however, work underway in this area. The Canadian Council on Health Services Accreditation (CCHSA) includeswork life as one of four dimensions of quality in its Achieving 91. G.

Provincially, the College of Registered Nurses of Nova Scotia has implemented a Practice Environment Collaboration Program (PECP), which provides a mechanism for organizations tomeasure and improve the practice environment and worklifefor nurses. The PECP follows a process in which organizationsassess the degree to which the following practice attributes arepresent and support nursing practice: care delivery process,communications systems, facilities and equipment, leadership,organizational supports, professional development systemsand response to external demands. In 2002, the Canadian Nurses Association convened a national workshop to develop quality of worklife indicators for nursesin Canada. The workshop recommended a set of eightindicators of worklife for nurses in Canada, and that theseindicators be incorporated into the CCHSA's 2004 AIMaccreditation program (Table 6.1): Table 6.1: Possible quality of worklife indicators Indicator Definition Span of control Average number of direct reports for each nursing supervisor Leadership Corporate nursing leader at senior level with budget line responsibility Overtime hours Percent of nursing staff earned hours that are overtime hours Full-time/part-time/casual ratios Percent of total nursing staff earned hours that are full-time, part-time and casual, reported annually Autonomy/scopes of practise Percent of nurses reporting in a staff survey that they have adequate control over their professional practice Professional development Percent of nurses participating in opportunities in-service training session and/or off-site education and training programs, with the average number of hours for each type of session, reported annually Absenteeism Average number of days absent per nurse or absenteeism as per cent of total earned hours Grievance Total number of unresolved grievances Source: CNA Quality of Worklife Indicators Workshop Report. While these indicators were derived for nursing practice in Canada, they are sufficiently broad to apply to otheroccupations as well. Current data availability for the healthworkforce in Nova Scotia allowed for the reporting on three ofthe former eight indicators at the provincial level: Absenteeism; Overtime; and Full time/part time/casual ratios (Employment Status). 6.2 THE 'HEALTH' OF NOVA SCOTIA'S HEALTH WORKFORCE 6.2.1 Absenteeism - Labour Force Survey People working in health care services are more likely to miss work than those employed in other industry sectors. Accordingto the Statistics Canada Labour Force Survey, in 2002 healthindustry employees in Nova Scotia lost, on average, 20.7 daysfrom work because of: illness and disability, maternity leave orfor other personal reasons. This was 60% higher than the 12.9days lost on average for people working in all industries in theprovince. It was also 1.5 days higher than the 19.2 days averagedby the Canadian health workforce as a whole (Figure 6.2). 97. Canadian Council on health Services Accreditation. (2002).

Lowe.University of Alberta. 3 June 2002.NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDY 836.2.1.1 Time lost to Illness and Disability People who work in health care in Canada and Nova Scotia are more likely to be absent from work because of illness ordisability than workers in other industry sectors. In 2002,Canadian health industry workers lost an average of 11.1 daysof work because of illness or injury, compared with 7.2 days forthe Canadian workforce as a whole (Figure 6.3). As Table 6.2 indicates, the health industry in Nova Scotia loses on average, 3.3 more days for illness and injury than otherindustries. Nova Scotia health care workers lost 11.9 days fromwork due to illness or disability, which was 38% higher thanthe 8.6 days lost in all industries. Another key difference between health and other industries is the higher number of days health industry workers lost due tomaternity leave. Because of a high proportion of femalesemployed in the health industry (86%), as compared to otherindustries (55%), the average days lost due to maternity leavewas considerably higher among health care workers (7 days)than among workers in all industry as a whole (2.7 days).Table 6.2: Average Days Lost per Full Time Health Care Employee vs. All Industries, NS, 2002 NS health Industry NS All Industries Days lost % of time lost Days lost % of time lost Illness/disability 11.9 57.5% 8.6 66.7% Maternity 7.0 33.8% 2.7 20.9% Other Personal 1.8 8.7% 1.6 12.4% Total 20.7 100.0% 12.9 100.0% The average of 11.9 days lost to illness or disability works out tojust about one day a month per employee. Based on a healthindustry workforce of 52,900, if days lost due to illness anddisability in health care were reduced to the rate of 8.6 days forall Nova Scotia workers, it would be like having an additional671 more health workers on the job in this Province. Days lost to illness or disability by Nova Scotian health workers in 2002 was just slightly higher (11.9 days) than thenational rate (11.1 days). Between 1987 and 2002, the averagenumber of days lost to illness and disability was higher inNova Scotia's health workforce in 9 of the 16 years. Figure 6.4shows, the national and Nova Scotia rates have beenconverging the last two years. Female health care workers in Nova Scotia have a higher rate of absenteeism due to illness or disability than their malecounterparts. As the Table 6.3 below shows, the average forfemales of 13.0 days lost (excluding maternity leave) was morethan double that of males - a differential far greater than thatwhich existed in industry as a whole in Nova Scotia.

Nationally, female health workers alsomissed more time than males, but the gap was lesspronounced, as Table 6.4 shows. The female-to-male ratio for time lost was 2.1 to one in Nova Scotia in 2002, compared with 1.5 to one in Canada as a whole,a pattern that has been consistent over the years.

This reflects the fact that healthcare workers, especially nurses, are vulnerable to musculoskeletalinjuries from lifting and moving patients. They may also besubject to other workplace hazards such as accidental needlestickinjuries, infection, illness, stress and physical and verbal abuse. 98 Consistent with the national picture, construction,manufacturing and transportation all had higher injury ratesthan the health sector in Nova Scotia. But with the addition offishing and forestry as major industries in Nova Scotia, thehealth sector in Nova Scotia ranked throughout the 1990s ashaving just the sixth or seventh highest injury rate among 15major industry sectors. 99 The Statistics Canada Labour Force survey does not breakdown time lost to illness versus time lost to disability.However, a reasonable approximation of the impact ofworkplace injuries on health industry workers can be made bystudying data from the Workers' Compensation Board (WCB). In 2000, there were approximately 38,000 health care workers covered under the Workers' Compensation Act in Nova Scotia, representing about 14.2% of the total workforce covered by theAct. The WCB registered 4,855 claims for health care workers in2000. These represented 14% of all claims registered, which was approximately proportional to the health workers' share of theoverall insured workforce. However, 30% of the claims registeredby health workers were time-loss claims, 100representing 16% of all time-loss claims, a slightly disproportionate share of time-loss claims paid by the WCB in 2000. As Figure 6.5 shows, registered claims and time-loss claims followed a similar pattern during the 1990s, falling from 1993to 1996, then beginning a steady rise in 1997. By 2000, bothtotal claims registered and time-loss claims were atapproximately the same levels as in 1991. However, there has been a significant drop in another indicator, the time-loss injury rate . This is the proportion of time-loss claims per insured worker. Figure 6.6 shows theinjury rate of time-loss claims in the health care industry hasdeclined since the early 1990's, and has leveled off since 1997.In other words, while the number of time-loss claims in 2000was at similar levels as in 1991, the rate of injury per insuredworker was much lower in 2000 (3.6%) than in the early to mid 90s (5.2% in 1993). 98. \"Canadian Institute for Health Information \"The Health of Health Care Workers,\" p.87 99.

This was 23% less than theaverage duration of 102.2 days for claims in all industries, aconsistent pattern since 1994. (Figure 6.7). Although the average duration in the health industry has recently been lower than the average for all industries, it has nonetheless,increased. From 1997-2000, the average claim duration for thehealth services sector increased from 59.8 to 82.9 days (a 39%increase). The total number of days lost provides a sense of time lost from work due to workplace injuries. In 2000, there was an estimated 84,420total days lost in the health industry. 102This represented approximately 2.2 days lost for every insured worker in the healthindustry in Nova Scotia. Figure 6.8 illustrates that the total days lostper insured worker in 2000 (2.2 days) was less than one-half that of1991 levels (4.8 days). 6.2.2.2 Benefit Payments In 2000, there was $9,570,881 paid in total compensation and services to injured workers in the health and social servicesindustry. Short-term disability benefits represented the highestproportion of total benefit payments (46%), followed by long term disability benefits (28%), health care services (24%), rehabilitationservices (1.8%) and survivor benefits (0.3%). Figure 6.9 illustrates total benefit payments in the health and social services industry from 1991-2000. Total benefit payments declinedfrom $8.9 million in 1993 to $5.0 million in 1997 (44% decline). Since1997 total claim payments have increased steadily, going from$4,998,000 in 1997 to $9,570,000 (a 96% increase) in 2000. 6.2.2.3 Claims by OccupationThe WCB indicated that details on claim information at the occupational level should be used with caution. Information on the occupation of injured workers is not a required field in the WCBssystem for claim payment purposes. Another limitation of the WCBdata is that the coding of classifications for nursing occupations,did not accurately distinguish registered nurses from licensedpractical nurses. Therefore, the WCB information presentedrepresents the aggregate of these two nursing occupations. Bearing in mind these limitations, Table 6.5 summarizes the data provided by the WCB, based on claim payments made in 2000. Thisinformation is based on all claim payments made in 2000,regardless of the claim open date. For the purposes of this analysis\"Nurse Graduate\" and \"Nursing/therapy/related\" were included as'nurses'. Nurses, the largest component in the health careworkforce, accounted for the largest proportion of claims andpayments made in 2000, with 76% of claims and 79% of totalpayments.

In 2000, 43%of total claims and 66% of total payments made on claimswere for sprain or strain injuries. 6.2.2.4 Claim Payments by Type of Employer The WCB classifies employers using Statistics Canada's Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes. Table 6.6indicates 42% of the total claim payments in 2000 were forinjured workers employed in nursing homes. This percentageis high considering only about 20% of health care workers areemployed in nursing homes. Hospitals were the next highestat 33%, followed by home care with 15% of the total.

It does not break down data by specific occupation orby public or private provider, nor does it tell us whether dayswere lost because of illness or injury. To get a morecomprehensive picture of the health of the health careworkforce additional field work was carried out, and primaryand secondary data were collected from the Nova ScotiaDepartment of Health (DOH), the Department of CommunityServices (DCS), the District Health Authorities (DHAs), longterm care nursing home (LTC) facilities, home care and homesupport agencies (HC/HS), residential care facilities (RCFs),community based options (CBOs) and other sources. 6.2.3.1 Sick Time- Acute CareAs we have seen, in 2000 the WCB paid out nearly $9.6 million in compensation to injured workers in the health and socialservices industry. However, most absences from work,especially short-term ones, do not result in a WCB claim.Instead, the costs are recorded on employers' books as sickpay. The nine DHAs and the IWK Health Centre, whichbetween them employ close to 40% of Nova Scotia's totalhealth workforce, paid out the equivalent of over $19 million insick pay in 2000-01 to health care workers in the acute caresector alone.Sick pay reported by DHAs in 2000-01 amounted to 3.7% of earned compensation. The proportions ranged from a low of2.8% in DHA 8 to 4.6% at the IWK (Table 6.7). Table 6.7: Sick Pay Percentage and Cost by DHA, 2000-01 District Percentage Pro-rated to Total Analysis of data from the DHAs and other sources indicated that in 2000-01, sick pay disbursed to 26 health occupationalgroups in Nova Scotia's acute care sector totaled $15,369,628,amounting to 3.8% of the $407,856,261 compensationassociated with those occupations (Table 6.8).

Assuming a 7.5-hour work day, the 4.4% average number of sick hours across the 26 occupations translated into anaverage of 6.1 days. As the next Table shows, sick days rangedfrom a high of 9.7 days per year for operating room assistantsto 2.6 days per year for dietitians (Table 6.10).

As would be expected given occupational sizeand their relatively high rates of sick time, most of the \"sickFTE's\" were among registered nurses, licensed practical nurses,nursing assistant and orderlies and medical laboratorytechnologists and technicians (Table 6.11).

Based on limited information madeavailable by continuing care institutions, sick pay accounted forabout 3.5% of the total compensation paid to employees ofcontinuing care facilities in 2000-01, versus 3.7% in acute. Sickpay reported ranged from 1.3% in Residential Care Facilities to3.8% among Nursing Homes (Table 6.12). Table 6.12: Sick Pay by Type of Continuing Care Facility, 2000-01 Facility % of Compensation % of Total Hours Nursing Homes 3.8% 4.0% Home Care/Home Support 3.5% 4.3% Facilities 1.3% 1.8% Average 3.5% 3.6%88 NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDY6.2.4 Employment Insurance Human Resource Development Canada (HRDC) provides three types of benefits under its Employment Insurance (EI)program: Regular benefits paid to people who have lost their job through no fault of their own and want to return to work Sickness benefits paid to people who are unable to work because of sickness, injury or quarantine Maternity benefits payable to the birth mother, and Parental benefits payable either to the biological or adoptive parents while they are caring for a new-born or an adopted child. On average, there was one EI claim filed for every 2.9 full time equivalent health care workers in 2000. 103Comparing selected health occupations, the number of FTEs per claimranged from one claim for every 2.0 FTE opticians to one claimfor every 34.6 Table 6.13: EI Claims per FTE by Selected Health Occupations, NS, 2000 Occupational Group # FTE/Claim Opticians 2.0 Occupational Therapists 2.2 Audiologists & Speech Language Pathologists 2.2 Dietitians & Nutritionists 2.3 Respiratory Therapists 2.3 Medical Radiation Technologists 2.4 Registered Nurses 2.5 Licensed Practical Nurses 2.8 AAvveerraaggee 22..99 Physiotherapists 3.3 Pharmacists 4.5 Medical Laboratory Technologists 4.7 Paramedics 5.7 Psychologists 6.0 Denturists 6.5 Medical Sonographers 14.4 Dentists 34.6 Of the selected health occupations included in the analysis, the average EI claim was $3,191 in 2000.Table 6.14 shows the type of EI claims paid to selected health care workers in 2000. On average, maternity benefits accountedfor 43% of EI claims, regular EI accounted for 41% and sicknessaccounted for 16% of claims. Comparing occupations: Pharmacists, respiratory therapists, physiotherapists, medical radiation techs, psychologists, occupational therapists andaudiologists and speech language pathologists had higherproportions of EI claims as maternity benefits; Licensed practical nurses and medical laboratory techs had higher than average proportions of claims as regular EI benefits(66% and 56% respectively, versus 41% on average overall); Registered nurses had higher than average proportions of claims as EI sickness benefits (20% versus 16% on averageoverall). Table 6.14: Use of EI Claims, Selected Nova Scotia health Occupations (Female*), 2000 Occupational Group Maternity Regular Sickness Audiologists & Speech 16% * Only those occupations where females account for at least 2/3 were analysed. Table 6.15 illustrates the distribution of EI claims by region for selected health occupations. On average, these selected healthcare occupations had 16.6 EI claims per 1,000 Nova Scotians.There were more EI claims per 1,000 population made in CapeBreton and the South Shore, and lower numbers of claims per1,000 population in both the Halifax Regional Municipality andthe Annapolis Valley region, comparable to the unemploymentrates in these regions during the same period.

In the health care industry, Statistics Canada's Labour Force survey suggests health care workers are less likely to workovertime than workers in other industries. Almost one in fivehealth care workers (19.6%) in Nova Scotia worked paid orunpaid overtime in 2002. This was slightly higher than theproportion of health care workers in Canada who workedovertime (18.6%). However, non-health workers in Nova Scotiaand Canada were somewhat more likely to work overtime;21.3% of workers in Nova Scotia and 22% of Canadian workersworked overtime in 2002. Health care workers also worked less overtime in 2002, on average, compared to the workforce as a whole. According tothe 2002 Labour Force Survey, of those who worked overtime,health care workers in Nova Scotia averaged an extra sevenhours of paidor unpaid overtime (Figure 6.10). In the Nova Scotia workforce as a whole, those who worked overtime in2002 put in on average 8.8 hours per week extra. Health careworkers in Canada as a whole who worked overtime loggedslightly less extra time than their Nova Scotia counterparts,6.8 hours versus seven. The same was true in the Canadianworkforce as a whole, where those who worked overtime in2002 spent, on average, 8.6 hours extra per week at work,slightly less than the 8.8. hours in Nova Scotia.6.3.1 Overtime - Acute Care (hospitals) Table 6.16 reflects information gathered from DHAs and IWKin acute care (hospitals), showing overtime represented, onaverage, 2.4% of total compensation paid to health careworkers in 2000-01. Table 6.16: Overtime as Percentage of Compensation by DHA, 2000-01 DHA Percentage of Compensation 1 0.9% 2 1.4% TOTAL 2.4% * derived estimate Table 6.17 shows the percentage of overtime worked for eachoccupation in acute care, as well as work hours attributed toregular vs. overtime work, and what that translates into inFTEs. The proportion of hours attributed to overtime for selected health occupations in acute care varied from 0.1% to 4.3%.The overall average attributed to overtime was 2.4% ofcompensation, and 1.8% of hours. Overtime hours for operatingroom assistants, respiratory therapists and registered nursesand counselors were above average, at 4.3%, 3.3%, 2.6 % and2.0% respectively. Almost half (11) of the 26 occupations hadless than 1% of their work hours attributed to overtime. On average across the 26 occupations, for every one hour of overtime, there were 42 hours of regular time worked. Thisequates to approximately one hour of overtime worked perweek for an employee in a acute care setting in Nova Scotia.Figure 6.10: Overtime (hrs/week) of Those People Working Overtime, All Industries vs. Health/SocialServices, NS and Canada All Industries Source: Labour Force Survey, 2002Hours/week Health/Social Services10 86420 Nova Scotia Canada90 NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDYTable 6.17: Overtime as Percentage of Total Hours, Ratio to Regular Hours Worked, by Acute Care Occupation, 2000-01 Regular Hours : Equivalent Occupation Overtime OT Hours FTEs Operating Room Assistant 4.3% 17:1 1.9 Respiratory Therapist 1.2% 67:1 70:1 1.1% 72:1 10.2 Psychology Assistant 1.1% 76:1 .4 Recreation Therapy Assistant 1.0% 83:1 0.9% 87:1 134:1 .7 0.5% 178:1 .1 Psychologist 0.1% 891:1 .1 Table 6.17 also illustrates the hours associated with overtime, translated into equivalent FTEs (where 1 FTE = 1950 hours).The FTEs attributed to RNs (based on overtime hours) totaled121.2 FTEs. However, for 15 of the 26 selected healthoccupations, overtime equated to less than one FTE for theentire year. For these 26 acute care occupations, a total of168.5 FTEs were attributed to overtime hours. It is importantto remember that while an hour of overtime is equivalent to aregular worked hour, the overtime hour will actually cost thesystem more than the regular hour (typically 1.5 to 2 times).6.3.2 Overtime - Continuing Care The overtime rate in continuing care was lower than it was inacute care, averaging just over one per cent of payroll. As withsick time, the higher rates were experienced by CBOs and LTC- 1.4% and 0.9% respectively (Table 6.18). Table 6.18: Overtime Pay by Type of Continuing Care Facility, 2000-01 Facility % of Compensation Community Based Options 1.4% Long Term Care Nursing Homes 0.9% Home Care/Home Support 0.5% Residential Care Facilities 0.2% Average 1.0% 6.4 EMPLOYMENT STATUS People working in health care are much more likely to beemployed on a part time or casual basis than other Canadianworkers. A special Workplace and Employee Survey 104published by Statistics Canada in 1999 found that in 1998 only 52% ofworkers in health care had full time positions, compared with74% of Canadians working outside the health field. 105 The picture is the same for Nova Scotia health workers.Information obtained from acute care facilities, mental health,public health and addiction services indicated that in 2000,55% of workers were employed full time, 30% had part timework and 15% were employed on a casual basis. Full timeemployment was harder to find in continuing care, as itaccounted for only 41% of employment. Part time employmentaccounted for 30% and casual for 28% (Figure 6.11). Figure 6.11: Employment Status, Nova Scotia Health Workers, 2000 Full TimePercentage Casual60% 50%40%30%20%10% 0% Acute Care, Mental Health, Public Health, Addictions Continuing CarePart Time 104.Workplace and Employee Survey, Statistics Canada, 1999 105.Canadian Institute of Health Information, \"Canada's Health Care Providers,\", p. 41NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDY 916.4.1 Acute Care, Mental Health, Public Health and Addiction Services Figure 6.12 shows the employment status of workers employed in acute care (hospitals), mental health, public health andaddiction services. In acute care hospitals, mental health, public health and addiction services in 2000 approximately 55% of workers wereemployed full time, 30% had part time work and 15% wereemployed on a casual basis. As the figure shows, the highestpercentage of full time work was in public health (80%), mentalhealth (71%), and addiction services (68%). However, thesethree areas employed less than 2000 workers. Acute carehospitals employed 53% of its more than 18,000 workers on afull time basis. This helps to account for the prevalence of parttime employment in the health sector. Analysis of data from acute care settings revealed that casual employment was highest among younger workers, reflectingthat it may take several years to work into full time positions.Over one-half (56%) of workers under 25 years of age, and one-third (33%) of workers between ages 25-29 years, worked incasual positions in acute care hospital settings in 2000. As people move into full time jobs, a much lower percentage work casual. The proportion who worked casual reached a lowof 9% for those between 45-49 years of age. However, thepercentage of workers employed casual starts to increaseagain among workers 50 years and older. By 60 years of age,35% of workers in acute care were employed on a casual basis.A possible explanation may be that some workers opt for pre-retirement by working casual, or they return to the workforcefollowing retirement to work on a casual basis.Figure 6.13 shows the resulting 'U' shape distribution of casual employment among younger and older age groups. 6.4.2 Continuing Care Based on limited returns from data sources, 38% of CBOs and47% of LTC facilities, part time work appears to dominate theemployment picture in continuing care, particularly in LTC andCBOs, where almost 80% of continuing care jobs existed. Bearing in mind the limitations of the response, workers in continuing care were employed 42% full time, 30% part timeand 28% casual or relief. Figure 6.14 shows the employmentstatus of workers employed in these settings, based on theinformation reported. The figure shows the following: The highest percentage working full time was in RCFs (49%). Part time employment ranged from 26% in CBOs to 39% in RCFs. Casual employment was in CBOs (31%) and lowest in RCFs (12%).Figure 6.12: Employment Status of Acute Care (Hospitals), Mental Health, Public Health andAddicition Services, NS, 2000-01 Acute CarePercentage80% 60%40%20% 0% Full Time Part Time CasualMental Health Public Health Addicition Services Figure 6.14: Continuing Care Employment Status, NS, 2000-01 Long Term CarePercentage50% 40%30%20%10% 0% Full Based OptionsFigure 6.13: Casual/Relief Status by Age Group, Selected Health Occupations in Acute Care, NS, HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDY6.4.3 Employment Status by Occupation Of the 31 occupations profiled for this study, about 65% (13) of the workers profiled had employment status informationavailable. As Table 6.19 shows, they ranged from a high of 98%full time employment for paramedics to a low of 39% forpersonal care workers.

The following occupations eachhad close to one in four working casual: Community residential workers (30%) Personal care workers (30%) Licensed Practical Nurses (25%) Home support workers (23%)Analysis of registered nurse employment status information between 1998 and 2002 revealed a noteworthy trend. In 1998,the vast majority of younger registered nurses worked incasual employment; 83% of registered nurses 25 years of ageand under, and 58% of registered nurses between 25-29 yearsof age, worked in casual jobs in 1998. Furthermore, only 7% ofRNs under 25 years of age worked full time. The lack ofavailable full time employment upon graduation wasconsidered to be a contributing factor to the outflow of recentgraduates moving elsewhere in search of jobs. Since 1998 there has been a considerable change in the proportion of younger RNs working full time. There werenearly 8 times as many full time jobs for younger RNs in 2002as compared with 1998. It is noteworthy that older nurses are increasingly more likely to work on a casual basis. The proportion of older workers (i.e.65 years and older) working on a casual basis increased from19% in 1998 to 46% in 2002, indicating that RNs approachingretirement age are not necessarily leaving the workforce. 6.4.3.1 Acute Care OccupationsFollowing is an employment status summary for selected health occupations in acute care hospitals in Nova Scotia. Itshows that for the 26 selected occupations, full-timeemployment in 2000-01 was 55%, slightly higher than for theacute care workers as a whole. Table 6.21 shows occupations with high full time employment included: health executives (83%) and operating roomassistants/technicians (72%). In contrast, respiratory therapyassistants,licensed practical nurses and nursingassistants/orderlies all had less than 45% full time employmentAs well, occupations such as recreation therapy assistants,occupational therapist assistants and dietitian/nutritionists hadover 40% employed on a part time basis. On average, 15% ofthese selected health occupations in Nova Scotia hospitalsworked on a casual/relief basis, including over 20% of thelicensed practical nurses, nursing assistants/orderlies, cardiologytechs and counsellors.NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDY 93Table 6.20: Employment Status for Selected Health Occupations, NS Hospital Setting, 2000-01 Employment Status Occupation Full Time Part Time Cas./Rel. TRENDS AND ISSUES A number of employment trends and issues were identified as a result of consultations and the literature review to have thepotential to impact future planning, recruitment, and retentionof the health workforce.6.5.1 Changing Lifestyle Expectations Health care workers are increasingly thought to value a morebalanced, healthy lifestyle, including more time to spend withtheir families. During consultation with key informants,physicians in particular mentioned 'lifestyle related issues' as an important consideration among doctors. 106 Many physicians want to work fewer and more predictablehours. For instance, in a 2001 survey close to one in five familyphysicians in Nova Scotia (18%) indicated they planned toreduce the number of hours they worked during 2001-2003. Only2% indicated they planned to increase the hours they work. 107 This is understandable considering the high number of hoursthat family physicians in Nova Scotia work each week. The 2001National Family Physician Workforce Survey (NFPWS) 108found that physicians in Nova Scotia worked, on average, a 78-hour week.Of this total, 56.3 hours were for regular hours and 21.8 werefor on-call hours. This was 13% higher than the hours workedby Canadian family physicians overall, who worked 52 regularhours and 17 on-call hours, for a total of 69 hours per week. On-call service was a particular concern in rural areas. The NFPWS showed 86% of Nova Scotia family physicians providedon-call service, compared with 74% of family physicians inCanada. Of those who provided on-call services, familyphysicians in Nova Scotia worked 84 hours per week in 2001,made up of 58 regular and 26 on-call hours. Changing lifestyle expectations has been mentioned as a possible reason medical students may be avoiding familyphysician practice. 109There may also be a perception among medical students that specialists are paid better, have moremanageable practices and are valued more highly in the healthcare system, which could be contributing to fewer medicalgraduates choosing family practice. 110Lifestyle expectations may also be partly responsible for physicians moving towardsgroup practices, which is increasingly sought after by youngerand female physicians. 111 In addition to physicians, health service managers suggestedthat the impact of personal lifestyle sacrifices, increasinglevels of stress, burnout and long working hours of health careleaders may be a potential disincentive to attracting futureleaders into management positions. 106.College of Physicians and Surgeons and the Nova Scotia Medical Association ranked lifestyle as priority issue during key informant interviews 107.2001 National Family Physician Workforce Survey (NFPWS)108.National Family Physician Workforce Survey (NFPWS), 2001109.National Physician Planning Report. Phase 1.110.Key informant interview, Dalhousie Faculty of Medicine.111.National Physician Planning Report. Phase 1.94 NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDYAn indicator of challenges health service managers face in balancing personal and working lives was highlighted by dataobtained from the DHAs occupations to take their allowablevacation entitlement. In 2000 health care managers took only 60% of their allowable vacation time, banking 40%. Thiscompares with other health occupations taking 71% of theirallowable vacation. Key informants in continuing care suggested that changing lifestyle expectations of younger job seekers has maderecruitment more challenging. 112Several employers suggested competition from other sectors, such as call centers, has madeit increasingly difficult to attract young, college-trainedworkers to continuing care. Furthermore, there was a feelingamong some front-line workers that younger workers are notadequately prepared for the work environment, including thenature of the health needs of clients and scheduling demandsof working in continuing care. The perception that caring for elderly patients is an unattractive career choice, particularly among students andthose entering practice, was a concern for registered nurses.New nurse graduates were thought to prefer working in acutecarel settings over long term care and home care/homesupport. As noted in 6.4.3, recruitment of younger RNs intocontinuing care settings will increasingly be of concern, sincethe workforce caring for elderly patients is itself approachingretirement, with almost half the gerontology RN workforceover 50 years of age in 2002. This represents an aging ofgerontology RNs since 1993, when 30% were 50 years of age or older and 13% were under 30 years of age (Figure 6.15). 6.5.2 Workload Issues Workload of health care providers was frequently raised as asignificant concern. The importance of manageable workloadwas cited throughout literature as a key factor in recruitment,retention and productivity. For instance, high workload hasbeen mentioned as a key factor in high staff turnover, poor employee morale, burnout, lowered levels of productivity andincreased potential for client harm. 113 Addressing high workload was of concern to the majority ofhealth occupations interviewed for this study. Some of thechallenges identified by health occupations included thefollowing: Shifting population demographics with an increasing number of elderly Nova Scotians has affected patient acuity, andincreased demands for certain kinds of services and added toworkload. Patients in virtually every employment settingwere presenting with more complex problems, requiringgreater time and resource commitments than in the past; Restructuring of the health care system has had an impact on workloads in many employment settings. For instance,the impact of shorter length of stays in acute care hospitalsettings was thought to result in patients moving intocommunity and long term care settings more quickly,affecting the workload demands of workers in these settings; Concerns raised over the possible impact of increasing workloads included potential for error and delays in service,lower standards of practice, less confidence that patientscan adequately care for themselves following discharge, highlevels of overtime, increasing challenges in scheduling (i.e.getting vacation time booked off) and more stress, burnoutand sickness; The measurement of workload remains a challenge. There are no national standards for measuring workload for manyhealth occupations. Existing systems, such as the provincialManagement Information System (MIS), have been mostlylimited in use in acute care, and to date have not beenexpanded to include other practice settings, such ascontinuing care. Workload measurement tools are not beingused consistently across employment sector and healthdistricts, making comparisons difficult; and Acceptance of workload measurement systems among some occupations was hampered by the view that there is no wayto accurately quantify workload considering the broad arrayof variables involved, such as patient acuity, support systems,skill and experience level of health care providers,technological innovations, and so on.

Canadian HealthServices Research Foundation and the Change Foundation.NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDY 956.5.3 Public and Professional Identity A recurring problem in continuing care relates to the image of personal care workers ,home support workers and community residential workers as representing less 'professional' work than in other health settings. These workers often expressfrustration that their contribution and role in health care isnot valued and respected by fellow colleagues and members of the public. 114 Social workers also expressed concern about the public's perception of what they do. Downsizing and the restructuringof services has resulted in the redefinition of social workerroles, with social work functions sometimes being carried outby those in other occupational categories. Key informants alsovoiced concern that the societal support of the field of socialwork appears to be weakening, perhaps as a part of a broaderdecline in societal commitment to support the mostvulnerable. Establishing roles and recognition of 'fit' for socialworkers within emerging health care service delivery modelswas seen as an important step in renewal for the profession. Several other occupations indicated they felt their professional roles are not well understood, either by the public or otherhealth care providers. For instance, therapeutic recreation professionals suggested that the role and benefit of therapeutic recreation in health is still not widely understood by manyhealth occupations and members of the public. Although theyare actively involved in the full continuum of health careservice delivery, including acute care and rehabilitationsettings, community-based care, adult day care, transitionalcare and mental health, among others, they are typically notmentioned as part of the team delivering health care services. Moreover, key informants suggested that the skills and competencies of therapeutic recreation professionals willlikely be increasingly important as the provincial populationages. Therapeutic recreation professionals play an importantrole in the treatment of older adults, including stroke, cardiacdysfunction, cancer, Alzheimers disease and psychiatricdisorders. Furthermore, a variety of positive outcomes forolder adults have been associated with therapeutic recreationinterventions, above and beyond those associated withphysical rehabilitation. 115 As noted in 6.1, increasing numbers of Nova Scotians areavailing themselves of complementary or alternative servicessuch as chiropractic care, massage therapy, homeopathy,herbal remedies, reflexology and traditional Aboriginal orChinese medicine.While the public has mostly greeted these new disciplines positively, the acceptance of alternative and complementaryservices within the established health care community hasbeen hampered, to some extent, by a perception that thesedisciplines lack a sufficient research base. Proponents of'scientific validation' generally view these professions ashaving insufficient evidence-base foundations to allow otherhealth occupations and the public to better understand theefficacy and effectiveness in treating various healthsymptoms. Despite its growing popularity, the benefits of massage therapy have not been extensively documented. Furthermore, researchfrom the past has yielded inconsistent results and the scientificcommunity has often criticized studies as methodologicallyflawed. 116Therefore, many health care providers view massage therapy as something that 'feels good,' but may not necessarilybe aware of the health benefits. Given the public's interest in alternative and complementary therapies, there will be pressure on health care providers tobecome better educated on available information. Forinstance, a recent Pharmacy Practice Survey indicated 99% ofretail pharmacies carry at least some herbal and homeopathicremedies, and drug stores are the most common purchaselocation for these products. This survey indicated that 61% ofrespondents expected their pharmacists to be able to provideguidance on herbal remedy selection, but almost half of thepharmacists surveyed felt they did not have adequateknowledge to counsel consumers on these products. 117It is noteworthy that herbal therapy is now an integral part of thecurriculum at the College of Pharmacy at Dalhousie. Chiropractic care is likely the most established complementary health care service. Over the past 25 years, there have beennumerous, and ongoing government inquiries and scientificstudies that support chiropractic care as a safe, efficacious,and cost-effective treatment for specific health conditions,such as relieving muskuloskeletal symptoms. 118 Despite this research, some chiropractors feel there continuesto exist a misunderstanding and bias from the medicalcommunity and in health care planning, against the use ofcomplementary approaches in the delivery of health careservices. Chiropractors believe the lack of recognition of theproven benefits of chiropractic care, coupled with the siloapproach to public health care, has hampered the integrationof chiropractic care into primary health care, particularly inthe early stages of treatment. 114.For instance, see Human Resource Issues Study, Continuing Care Sector for the Health Care Human Resource Sector Council, 2002 Consensus Report.

This was 2.6% lower than the $848 average weekly wageamong Canadian workers in the same occupations. Amongthose employed full time, average weekly earnings in NovaScotia was $936, 1.8% less than the average for Canada ($954).Average weekly wages of those working part time was 8.3%lower in Nova Scotia ($491) than the average for part timeCanadian health care workers ($532). The average weekly wage of technical, assisting and related occupations in Nova Scotia (total) was $508, which was 8% less than their Canadian counterparts ($549). Among thoseemployed full time, average weekly earnings for technical andassisting occupations in Nova Scotia was $570, 12.6% lower thanthe average for Canada ($642). Average weekly wages of thoseworking part time was 8.3% lower in Nova Scotia ($491) than theaverage for Canadian part timers ($532). Although average weekly wages were slightly lower in Nova Scotia as compared with the average for Canada, Nova Scotia hasseen more rapid growth in wages from 1998 to 2002. Forinstance, the total average weekly wage of professionaloccupations in health, nurse supervisors and RNs, increased 30%in Nova Scotia, compared with 23% increase in Canada. Thetotal average weekly wages for technical, assisting and relatedoccupations also grew by a high percentage in Nova Scotia (23%)compared to Canada (7%) (Table 6.21).

Historically, most physicians billed theprovince for each service they provide to patients, known as a'fee for service' system of payment. Some argue that thetraditional fee for service system of paying physicians is anoutdated concept. The most common criticism is that fee forservice provides incentives for inappropriate and moreexpensive care, and no incentives for personal wellness andprevention. Furthermore, it fails to capture physicians' timespent on other work activities, such as research, teaching,management and administration, on call, and professionaldevelopment activities. Fee for service is therefore anincomplete measure of physician workload and use ofphysicians' services in Nova Scotia. A concern with on-call arrangements is that the fee-for-service billing system does not reimburse physicians appropriately forthe hours they are actually on call. The current contract withthe Nova Scotia Medical Society, has addressed the on-callissue to some extent, with the inclusion of specific clauses for\"remote practice on call\" and \"facility on-call\". However, thereare many physicians in Nova Scotia today that are notreimbursed for \"stand by\" call. In nearly every province and territory in Canada, provinces are trending toward non-fee-for-service payment systems. In 1990,about two thirds (68%) of physicians responding to the CanadianMedical Association's Physician Resource Questionnaireindicated they received all their remuneration from fee-for-service. By 2001, the percentage of physicians in Canadareceiving all remuneration solely from Fee for Service was downto 59% of physicians. A Physician Resource Survey 119conducted by the Canadian Medical Association in 1997 also noted a shift inphysicians' desired method of payment, as those stating fee-for-service as preferred method of payment went from 50.4% in1995, to 37.9% in 1997. Nova Scotia has demonstrated national leadership in moving away from fee for service as the sole type of physicianpayment. Table 6.22 shows 42% of physicians in 2000-01received some combination of fee for service and alternativefunding, and 20% were deriving their income solely fromalternative funding sources. Only 38% of physicians in NovaScotia derived their income solely from fee for servicepayments compared to 59% of physicians in Canada. 119.Canadian Medical Association, \"The CMA Physician Resource Survey - Taking the Pulse 2001\", CMA, Ottawa, 1997NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDY 97Table 6.22: Physicians by Payment Type, by Specialty, 2000-01 Specialty 42% 6.5.4.3 Compensation Issues in Continuing Care During a study of issues in the continuing care sector, front- line providers were asked which critical factors, if addressed,would make a significance contribution to a sustainableworkforce. Fair wages and benefits, accounting for over 45% ofall points assigned by participants during this exercise 120were considered to be important recruitment and retention issues. Determining the value of work in continuing care is a common issue. There are equity issues perceived and/or real whenworkers compare their pay scales with people working in otherindustries. Inequities also may exist across sectors in healthcare and, even, across employers within continuing care. This issue manifested in Nova Scotia in the Spring and Summer of 2003 when residential rehabilitation workers(RRWs) employed within some group and small option homesin Metro Halifax went on strike claiming wage parity withdevelopmental workers at the Nova Scotia Hospital.As was shown previously, several occupations in continuing care have high rates of part time and casual employment. 23% of HC/HS workers employed in publicly-funded home support agencies were employed on a casual basis and 22%were employed part time in 2002 121 30% of CRWs working in facilities funded by DCS were employed on a casual basis and 27% worked part time in2002 122 32% of personal care workers were reportedly employed on a casual or term basis, and 28% were employed part time in2001. 123 For many, this means no guarantee of consistency in workedhours. For others it means an absence of employment benefitssuch as retirement pensions, vacation pay, long term disabilitybenefits, dental benefits, and so on. Casual workers are notmembers of a bargaining unit and are not covered by theconditions of collective agreements. Compensation for travel expenses was an issue for some workers, who often spend a considerable amount of time andexpense traveling to and from work every day. For instance,home care/home support workers often must travel longdistances to reach clients, resulting in longer than averagework hours, particularly those working in rural areas. Oneissue associated with travel time for home support workers isthat compensation for time on the road is not standardizedfrom employer to employer. Some home support workers arefully reimbursed for both travel time from client to client anddowntime between clients, while others are not. 124 6.5.5 Public - Private Competition Some occupations have been moving into private practicesettings. For instance, in 2001, 44% of Nova Scotia'sphysiotherapists were employed in private settings,up from 28% in 1992. 125 According to key informants, many physiotherapists moved tothe private sector because of downsizing and restructuring inthe public sector. Budget constraints resulted in salary levelsnot keeping pace with the labour market, and employmentopportunities were limited to part time. De-insurance ofpreviously covered public insurance for rehabilitation relatedservices was considered to be another driving factor. 126 120.Human Resource Issues Study, Continuing Care Sector for the Health Care Human Resource Sector Council, 2002 Consensus Report.

Home Support in Nova Scotia: Implications of a Standard Wage Rate 125.Canadian Physiotherapy Association (CPA) membership statistics, May 2001126.Key informant interview98 NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDYIn some provinces, there is increasing competition among public and private sectors for medical radiation professionals.The private sector in radiology in Alberta, for instance, offerscomparable wages, but usually better working hours andconditions. As a result, Alberta has seen an exodus ofdiagnostic imaging technologists to the private sector.However, demand in the public sector has not diminished,overburdening employees who remain in the public sector. Dentistry representatives noted challenges in recruiting faculty due to private sector competition. A key informant suggestedthat incentives are often not sufficiently attractive to recruitnew faculty to the dentistry program, due to differences inearnings potential between private and public sectors. 6.5.6 Professional Development Beyond formal post-entry education, health care workers haveongoing learning needs. Some health care workers participatein continuing education opportunities as part of their licenserenewal. Others participate in order to further their careersand keep their skills fresh. Regardless of the reasons, lifelonglearning and professional development is a significant factorin retaining productive health care providers. A common challenge reported by key informants was that employers are becoming less willing and able to grant the timeoff work (paid or unpaid) for professional developmentbecause staff shortages means there is no one available tocover shifts. Occupations reporting this problem included:registered nurses, dietitians, physiotherapists, speech languagepathologists and audiologists, medical radiation technologistsand occupational therapists. Finding time to travel and participate in continuing medical education has traditionally been a barrier for physicians,especially for those located in rural areas. With the advent ofvideoconferencing and computer-based programs,participation in continuing medical education is thought to beincreasingly easier for physicians. For instance, the DalhousieContinuing Medical Education (CME) Unit has introduced anumber of online courses, including the Online ShortPrograms. As well, the Canadian Medical Association offers avariety of user pay CME modules, virtual conferences and aselection of articles and tests for specific specialties. A challenge mentioned by several occupations was the fact that once entering practice, there are limited careeradvancement options, or a career ladder, over time. Forinstance, home support workers and personal care workersreportedly have little opportunity for career laddering withinhome support agencies and LTC facilities. 127There also appears to be limited opportunities for dental assistants to advance to related occupations, such as dental hygienist, primarily due to the time and financial commitmentinvolved. Progression from a dental assistant to a dentalhygienist requires upgrading to the equivalent completion of1st year of university, and then applying to the two-yearprogram, leading to a diploma in Dental Hygiene. Currently noformal prior learning assessment is in place at Dalhousie fordental assistants seeking to enroll in the dental hygieneprogram. Limited advancement into management positions was noted as a concern for speech language pathologists , as the majority work in the field, with less than 10% in managementpositions. 128A similar concern was noted for dietitians .K e y informants suggested that changes over the last decaderelated to health care reform have translated into cutbacks inmiddle management positions, including assistant directorsand administrative positions, leaving fewer paths for careeradvancement. Occupational therapists suggested that those who become managers, consultants, researchers or educators may nolonger retain the title occupational therapist. This was seen asa professional image/identity issue for the profession. 6.5.7 Orientation to Care A period of orientation is an essential beginning point in allemployee/employer relationships. A planned orientationprogram is essential for health care providers to functionsafely and competently in new practice settings, to accept newresponsibilities, and to assume new roles. Orientation assiststhe employee to fulfill the employer's expectations for thatrole and is therefore an important employer responsibility. For some occupations, such as speech language pathologists and audiologists , little formal orientation is offered. For others, the extent of orientation programs and practices variessignificantly between practice settings and employers. Feedback from employers hiring new continuing care assistant (CCA) graduates was that their employees were requiring moreonsite training. Directors of home support agencies haveindicated they are spending more time, effort and dollars onnew recruits than in the past, in determining how compatiblethey are with their agency/work setting. 129Screening of workers for employment has become problematic for someemployers, as they are no longer the primary educator. TheNova Scotia Community College (NSCC) and private careercolleges do not routinely screen students for \"care qualities\" inthe same way a home support agency does. This was seen asan important component of recruiting and retaining new CCAgraduates. 127.Key informant interview128.Key informant interview 129.Key informant interviewNOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDY 99Nova Scotia has introduced initiatives to improve the orientation of registered nurses into the workplace. The Nova Scotia Nursing Strategy provides funding to employers to helpcover orientation costs for nurses newly entering the workforceor for those transferring to new positions within the sameplace of employment. Furthermore, a survey of employers'orientation practices was recently conducted by the NSprovincial nursing network, resulting in the drafting oforientation guidelines for employers. 6.5.8 Scopes of Practice Health care workers' roles are constantly changing. Societalexpectations regarding the kinds of services provided (and thehealth care providers who deliver them), innovations andadvances in technology, shortages of health care providers andthe economic issues facing the health care system - all ofthese factors are challenging traditional boundaries of practicefor most health care providers. There is a growing breadth of research in the area of expansion of health care worker roles, 130such as that involving the practice of nurse practitioners and midwives . In a review of research in this area, the Office of Technology Assessment in the United States concluded that when practicing in their area ofcompetence, these workers were able to provide primary healthcare delivery as well as physicians, and in some cases, morecost effectively. 131Another review of research comparing nurse practitioners and family physicians found that patients weremore satisfied with care from a nurse practitioner with nodifferences in health outcomes. 132 In Nova Scotia, there are nurse practitioners practicing undercollaborative practice agreements with physicians, to lessenphysician workloads and to improve patient access. This rolewas officially recognized with the introduction of changes tothe Registered Nurses Act in 2001, which provided formal legislative authority and licensure requirements for nursepractitioners to practice in Nova Scotia. An increasing role for midwives in the delivery of primary care services in Nova Scotia has been recommended by the AdvisoryCommittee on Primary Health Care Renewal. The AdvisoryCommittee suggested that this could be achieved through theestablishment of collaborative practice agreements betweenmidwives and physicians. However, since midwifery is not aregulated occupation in Nova Scotia, there is no legislativerecognition of midwives. Therefore, they are unable to formally establish their scope of practice, ensure protection of title andenforce various quality assurance mechanisms. Furthermore,occupational regulation plays an important role in legitimizingthe practice of midwifery to many consumers, governments,third party-insurers and other health care providers. One reason for the lack of legislation for midwives appears to be an issue of critical mass. Practically, there are too fewmidwives practicing in Nova Scotia to warrant self-regulation,particularly considering the requirements for establishingdisciplinary procedures under self-regulation. Therefore,alternative options for regulation of this profession may needto be considered if this occupation is to take on a greater rolein primary care delivery. In addition to nurse practitioners and midwives, research has noted unrealized potential for expanding roles of other healthcare providers. For instance, a 1994 Canadian study foundevidence that a number of occupations can safely provideexpanded roles that are typically provided by health careproviders with considerably more training, including licensedpractical nurses, dental hygienists, pharmacy technicians, nurseanesthetists and chiropractors. 133Another study found that some of the work performed by rehabilitation professionals,such as audiologists, speech language pathologists,physiotherapists and occupational therapists, could safely bedelegated to rehabilitation assistants or technicians. 134 In Nova Scotia, licensed practical nurses (LPNs) are increasingly practicing to the full extent of their education, training andexperience. In some settings, their roles have expanded. Forinstance, LPNs scope of practice recently expanded in theHemodialysis Unit and in the Transitional Care Unit at the QEIIthrough additional employer training and testing. Despite these advances, key informants suggested that LPNs are still not being used consistently to their full scope ofpractice. For instance, some LPNs were allowed to dispensemedications in nursing homes but not in hospital settings.Furthermore, LPNs are not employed in some practice settingswhere they previously worked, such as obstetrics/gynecologyin hospitals, and not from working in practice settings theyfeel enabled to, such as pediatric hospitals. 135The College of Licensed Practical Nurses noted the need to educate employersthroughout the province regarding the LPNs evolving scope ofpractice. 130.For a summary of research on Provider Roles and Role Substitution see Building a Stronger Foundation: A Framework for Planning and Evaluating Community-BasedHealth Services in Canada.

The Nova Scotia College of Pharmacists indicated that in the United States, many states allow some type of collaborativepractice agreements in which physicians delegate patientprescriptive rights. 137The Nova Scotia government is considering pharmacists' prescriptive authority for emergency contraception.Some non-traditional activities pharmacists may be involved in,as suggested by the College of Pharmacy 138included: Selecting, initiating, modifying and monitoring patient drug therapy; Performing and interpreting laboratory related tests; Administering immunizations; and Disease management models. Key informants also noted there was unrealized potential to expand the role of pharmacy technicians , particularly in community pharmacy settings. For example, pharmacy technicians are quiteadvanced in hospital settings, where procedures such as a 'tech-check-tech' system have been used for years. In this system, onetechnician will fill a prescription and another technician willprovide the final check prior to releasing the drug from thepharmacy for use. This frees up the pharmacists' time to focus onscreening prescriptions against the patient's health profile,verifying medication orders and providing clinical services. The practice of pharmacy technicians and assistants is not as developed in community pharmacies. Pharmacy technicians arenot covered in the Pharmacy Act , and there is no explicit statutory authority for a 'tech-check-tech' system. It should be noted,however, that clause 77(1)(s) of the new Pharmacy Act allows regulations regarding \"supervised practice and the delegation ofany part of the practice of pharmacy and the persons to whom itmay be delegated.\" However, to date, no regulations have beenenacted. Furthermore, although the pharmacist may choose todelegate to an assistant, some pharmacists may be reluctant togive their technicians and assistants a wider range ofresponsibilities for fear of personal liability. 139Another emerging trend involves the use of multi-skilled workers who are cross-trained to perform procedures and functions intwo or more disciplines. For instance, having medical laboratory technologists cross-trained in X-ray functions would be particularly relevant in rural areas. 140Studies on multi-skilled workers have revealed that cost-effectiveness, staff flexibilityand efficiency are among the main reasons employer usemulti-skilled workers. 141However, there is still an absence of detailed research demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-skilled workers, particularly in community based settings. 142 Opticians in some provinces have been seeking the authority to do sight testing, a privilege now limited to optometrists. Sitetesting, or refraction, is \"a non-invasive, mechanical processthat uses instruments to assess the refractive power requiredto bring the individual's vision to an acceptable level...the endresult of which is a set of numbers that indicates the power oflens(es) required to cause light to come to a point of focus onthe retina.\" 143 The Canadian Association of Optometrists points out that thesource of blurred vision is not always a refractive error.Diseases such as glaucoma, diabetes, mellitus, cataract andmacular degeneration may be the cause of blurred vision.Without an eye examination by an optometrist, they note thepotential exists for harmful ocular diseases to be overlooked. Conversely, opticians suggested that people who cannot afford to see an optometrist, or do not wish to go through theappointment protocol and waiting time, may end up 'self-prescribing', by maintaining their current prescription, orbuying the wrong prescription, such as reading glasses,available at retail stores. Opticians noted the potential healthrisk from self-prescribing consumers, who may be postponingpersonal contact with an eye care professional, until trauma oreye disease becomes a problem. Another occupational group with a scope of practice-related issue was dental hygienists . In Nova Scotia there is a legislative requirement of supervision 144by a licensed dentist for dental hygiene practice. Although most dental hygienists and dentalassistants practice within dentists' offices, the Dental Act allows them to provide care outside of a dentists office under 136.See pages xxvii, 106-7, 120, and chapter 9 137.Key informant interview 138.Ibid.139.Ibid.140.Health Canada.

This was not a common occurrence, as there were only six institutions where such oralhealth programs existed. 145 Some dental hygienist organizations contended thatindependent practice would enhance access to oral healthcare. A report released by the Canadian Dental HygienistsAssociation 146suggests that the traditional 'gatekeeper privileges' of dentists, as outlined in the legislativerequirements for supervision, limits public access to dentalhygienists care and generates substantial costs to society. Thereport recommends that provincial governments eliminateregulations that prohibit direct public access to dentalhygienists. The rationale is that such a reform would result in: Greater access to oral health care for population groups with potentially unmet need for oral health services; Potentially lower costs for patients; Greater opportunity for integrating oral health care with other health services; An increase in the prevention and earlier detection of oral disease, and awareness in oral health promotion; Greater equity in income and opportunity between male and female-dominated professions; More experimentation and innovation in cost-effective oral health care delivery systems; and Greater and genuine freedom of choice for consumers. 147 In British Columbia, dental hygienists are permitted to practiceindependently in alternative settings without the supervisionof a dentist. However, a patient seeing a dental hygienist musthave seen a dentist in the previous 365 days. Dentists'concerns with this trend include its potential impact on co-ordinated, integrated oral health care, and the costs that mayresult, arising from the need to maintain separate equipmentand administrative staff. Among regulated health occupations 'scope of practice' defines the key tasks that workers are legally authorized, bystatute and license, to perform. A large portion of services inthe continuing care sector are delivered by unregulated healthoccupations, such as continuing care assistants (currently known as home support workers and personal care workers ) and residential care workers . Job functions performed by these workers are not specified in occupational legislation. As such, no scope ofpractice statements are defined in occupational regulation toguide their practice. Rather, their roles and job duties are oftendescribed as their 'scopes of employment.' A 2002 study of human resource issues in continuing care found that unregulated health occupations in this sector workunder a myriad of employer policies and practices, and therewas variability in workers' autonomy across practice settingsand employers. For instance, in some HC/HS settings workerswere not permitted to look after clients' practical necessities,such as getting the mail from the end of the driveway orgrocery shopping, whereas in other settings they looked after abroad range of clients' personal care needs. 148 The study also noted there were aspects of personal care forwhich home support workers felt qualified, but were notallowed to perform. Despite having certification in first aid andCPR, in some settings home support workers were notpermitted to wash a client's hair, apply/change dressings, usesuppositories for bowel movements or remove a band aid. 149 These acts needed to be performed by an LPN or an RN. The study also noted that RNs in some nursing homes may not be practicing to the full extent of their education andexperience. In some cases, nursing home residents were sentto hospital for suture removal, despite having staff in thesesettings that were trained to remove sutures. Some occupations spend a substantial amount of time on non-clinical activities outside of their professional scope ofpractice. For instance, pharmacist representatives indicatedthey spent too much time on administrative tasks such asphone inquiries to confirm prescriptions, and not enough timeadvising patients. Although there was no quantifiable dataavailable, representatives estimated pharmacists can spend upto 30% of their time solving administrative issues. 150 Excessive documentation, paperwork, rules and protocols werealso mentioned as concerns among people working incontinuing care. 151In some employment settings the level of documentation was considered excessive and duplicative,detracting from time spent with clients. Although manysuggested that rules and standards in many areas have beengood for clients/ residents, others noted the lack of flexibilityand strict adherence to rules and protocols was making it muchmore difficult to get simple things done. 145.Nova Scotia Dental Association and Provincial Dental Board of Nova Scotia 146.\"The Political Economy of Dental Hygiene Practice in Canada\" by Pran Manga, MHA Program, University of Ottawa 147.Executive Summary \"The Political Economy of Dental Hygiene Practice in Canada\" by Pran Manga, MHA Program, University of Ottawa148.Human Resource Issues Study, Continuing Care Sector for the Health Care Human Resource Sector Council, 2002 Consensus Report.

Wayne Marsh, Gail Boone,December, 2002.102 NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDY6.5.9 Leadership Development A leadership symposium held in Toronto in 2000, sponsored by the Canadian Council of Health Service Executives, identified anumber of key issues relevant to Health Service Executives, withloss of leadership control mentioned by 88% of respondents. Leaders in health organizations voiced concern that they havelittle control over the environments they manage. Factors suchas political and government micro-management, the power andinfluence of unions, the need to focus on 'putting out fires'rather than proactively addressing problems, and increasingpublic expectations contribute to loss of leadership control. Leadership development was also mentioned as a priority issue for registered nurses, who regard it as essential to the provisionof quality nursing care. RNs demonstrate leadership by: applyingtheir professional standards to ensure accountability foroutcomes and evidence-based decision-making; mentoring,empowering and motivating other nurses; applying evidence ofbest practice to the delivery of services; and helping to establishthe conditions necessary for healthy and productive workplaces. The importance of nursing leadership was evident in research that shows RN leadership behaviors are important to staffretention. 152Effective leadership styles that empower nurses can also reduce occupational stress and increase workeffectiveness. 153Research on 'magnet hospitals' has shown that nurse managers in these organizations possess uniqueleadership characteristics. These leaders: Are visionary and enthusiastic; Are supportive and knowledgable; Maintain high standards and staff expectations; Value education and professional development of all nurses within the organization; Hold positions of power and status; Are responsive and have open lines of communications with staff nurses; and Are involved in professional organizations. 154 Leadership development is a priority for the College of Registered Nurses of Nova Scotia (CRNNS). The CRNNS offers a two-day workshop - Leadership in Professional Practice - to enhance RNs' leadership skills. Other leadership-related eventsthat occurred in 2003 included a Leadership Institute, jointlysponsored by the CRNNS, the Department of Health, the NovaScotia Association of Health Organizations, Dalhousie School ofNursing, the IWK and Capital District Health Authority. The goalof this event was to facilitate leadership development amongnew graduates, experienced nurses and nurse managers.7.0 BRINGING IT TOGETHER - MOVING TOWARDS INTEGRATEDHHR PLANNING Health human resource (HHR) planning is about ensuring health care workers, with the right skills and knowledge deliver healthcare services, in the right place and at the right time, to care forthe health needs of Nova Scotians. Effective health workforceplanning is increasingly viewed as becoming critical, givenreports of a looming crisis in the numbers of health care workersworldwide available to deliver services. In many respects, what has been most lacking to date is the absence of good information for HHR planning. Basicinformation on the numbers and distribution, demographic andemployment characteristics, and education and training ofhealth care workers across the province, has been absent formost health occupations. Human resource decisions withoutsound information can potentially lead to unreliable estimates ofcurrent and future human resource needs, and can create thepotential for inefficient allocation of resources. This baselinereport has taken a step toward improved HHR planning byproviding baseline information about the NS health workforce,its education and training, and employment characteristics andhuman resource issues for future HHR planning. Another challenge in planning for the future health workforce is that to date there has been no planning framework thatintegrates HHR planning with the broader forces shaping changein the health care system. HHR planning does not occur in avacuum. The nature of health care service delivery structures ischanging, as are the skills and competencies needed to deliverhealth care. Environmental factors such as technologicaladvances, demographic changes, regulatory structures, changingpublic expectations, and economic forces, must also beconsidered as part of the planning picture. The long-term HHR planning framework conceptualized from this study (Figure 7.1) represents an adaptation of variousother HHR planning models that have recently been proposed, aswell as the experiential knowledge and learning that resultedfrom having undertaken the process of this study. It suggestsHHR planning should be integrated with broader service deliveryand financial planning processes. It assumes planning effortsshould be built around health care service needs of the NovaScotia population and the skills required for delivering them.And service planning for meeting these health needs mustutilize the full HR continuum (self care, family, unpaid, paid) ofresources. 152.Cullen, K.

Canadian Policy Research Networks, Inc. Summary Reportprepared for the Commission on the Future of Health Care in Canada 2002.NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDY 1037.1 CHALLENGES FOR FUTURE PLANNING 7.1.1 Articulation of Service Delivery Requirements to Guide HR Planning A critical component required for future human resource planning is the articulation of provincial service delivery requirementswithin key care settings. At the present time, this is a work inprogress at the Department of Health (DOH). Clinical servicesplanning for new models of care, such as primary care, are still intheir infancy. Knowing the 'what' and 'how' of health services willenable the determination of the appropriate competencies/skillsets required to meet our future service needs. For example, the absence of clearly articulated requirements for future care delivery makes it particularly difficult to guideeducation planning for the health disciplines. This may helpexplain why divergent points of view existed among post-secondary institutions concerning which health disciplinesshould get priority to best meet the province's health care needs.In the absence of this vision, educational institutions are left totheir own devices to determine their enrolments, addressfunding shortfalls and other capacity related (clinicalplacements, infrastructure, etc) issues.7.1.2 Effective Linkages and Co-ordination The success of planning efforts will depend, to a large extent,on effective co-ordination and linkages among the variousstakeholders involved in planning the health workforce at anational, provincial, regional and local level. For HHR planningto be most effective key stakeholders such as regulatory,industry/employers, education and government need to beinvolved in the planning process. This ensures the oftenconflicting viewpoints of those affected by plans are fullyconsidered. Unfortunately, in many instances the existinginterfaces are fragmented, and some are simply not workingtoo well. In recent years, a number of provinces have introduced advisory committees and working groups as a way of improvingcollaboration in ongoing HHR planning activities. Thecommittees, comprised of key stakeholder representatives, serveas a resource to provide proactive advice to government toensure provincial HHR planning efforts are optimized. A positive example of such a committee in Nova Scotia is the Provincial Nursing Network. This committee, established in April2000 to serve as a resource and to provide advice to government,Figure 7.1: Long Term Health Human Resource Planning Conceptual Framework Environmental Factors Technology Economic Human Resources for Health Self Care Family Unpaid PaidCompetency Education & TrainingRegulatory /Legislative Regulatory AssociationsGlobalization Demographic Funding Public PrivateUtilization Employers Industry Foundational FeaturesEnhanced Data Informed Decisions Collaborative Linkages Sustainable Process(es)Population Needs Health determinants Health status Community priorities DemographicsTargetOutcomes Population (health) Provider (satisfaction) System (effectiveness)DefiningServiceRequirements ServiceDeliveryModels ActualOutcomes Population (health) Provider (satisfaction) System (effectiveness) PerformanceManagement/AccountabilityPolitical ServicePlanning104 NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDYis comprised of practicing nurses, professional associations, regulatory bodies, employers, unions and educators, amongothers. Another example is the Continuing Care EducationRoundtable (CCER), formed in October 2002 to promotepartnerships and bring forward effective leadership within thecontinuing care sub-sector. 7.1.3 Improving Data and Accountability Measures As indicated previously, limited information was available on thehealth workforce in Nova Scotia to support proactive workforceplanning. Improving the availability, accessibility, and quality ofdata on the health workforce in Nova Scotia is thereforeessential to the success and sustainability of future HHRplanning efforts. The major data-related challenges wereoutlined in Chapter 1. To ensure ongoing collection and analysisof data for planning, there is a potential leadership role for theDOH to: develop an ongoing data collection process and a centralized data repository for HHR, with standardized data elements,definitions and structure; maintain confidentiality agreements and a memorandum of understanding with key data stakeholders ensuring fullcompliance with privacy guidelines; establish guidelines for the internal use and external publication of HHR information; standardize job criteria to enable consistency and comparability of health occupations across geographic andpractice settings; standardize education and training data elements, definitions, timing and frequency of data collection; conduct ongoing, periodic environmental scanning and labour market analyses and maintaining a qualitative issues databank to input and inform HHR planning and policy processes; interface between educational, regulatory, government and employer/industry stakeholders to collaborate on HHRstrategies and best practices to inform planning, policy, andaccountability frameworks.7.2 NEXT STEPS - WHERE TO FROM HERE? This report provides a baseline picture of HHR in Nova Scotia -the number, mix and distribution of people working in eachhealth occupation and health care setting; education andtraining programs and statistics; key workforce demographic,education and employment characteristics, and key HHRmanagement related information such as workplace injury andillness. The report also highlights the key priority HHR issuesfrom various dimensions. A better understanding of the key HRpriority factors affecting each health occupation will enable thedevelopment of better response strategies for planning,producing and managing our human resources for health. Proposed activities for completing this study include: Examining occupational requirements (focusing on short term) for HHR planning; Conducting a gap analysis and identifying options; Providing recommendations for future HHR planning; Disseminating study findings and results; and Providing assistance to the DOH with integration of data and set up of processes to enhance HHR planning.NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH HUMAN RESOURCES STUDY 105CONTRIBUTING CONTACTS EDUCATION/TRAINING Dr. Joy Armson, Director, School of Communication Disorders, Dalhousie Dr. Wanda Thomas Bernard, Director, Maritime School of Social Work, Dalhousie Dr. Richard Brown, Chair, Department of Psychology, DalhousieMs. Elizabeth Buffett, Professor and Chair, Department of Nursing, Joint UCCB/StFX Nursing Program Ms. Glenda Butt, Assistant Professor, School of Dental Hygiene, DalhousieDr. Rita Caldwell, Director, College of Pharmacy, DalhousieDr. Vic Catano, Professor and Chairperson, Department of Psychology, SMU Ms. Jane Palmer Cayford, Registrar, AcadiaDr. Elizabeth Chard, Registrar, SMUMr. Brian Christie, Executive Director, Department of Economics/Institutional Affairs, Dalhousie Dr. Susan Clarke, Senior Executive Director, Higher Education & Adult Learning, DOE Dr. Joanne Clovis, Professor, School of Dental Hygiene, DalhousieMs. Deanne Dennison, Registrar, DalhousieMs. Pam Dimock, Assistant Donahoe, Registrar, Academic Services, NSCCDr. Barbara Downe-Wamboldt, Director, School of Nursing, DalhousieMs. Sue Drapeau, Manager, Institutional Research & Analysis, NSCCMs. Alison C.
