Energy-based therapies involve a very light touch either directly on the clothed body or around the body. Healing Touch incorporates numerous techniques from a variety of sources, all with the intent of obtaining harmony and balance in the energy system. How does healing touch work? Every person is composed of a physical body as well as an energy system. This energy system flows through and surrounds the physical body and consists of three parts: an energy field, energy centers and meridians. Healing touch experts believe that blockages in the flow of energy lead to imbalances not only in the physical body, but also in the emotional and spiritual aspects of a person's life. Healing touch practitioners have been trained to assess the state of the energy system and use specific techniques to change and optimize the flow of energy.

Reiki Reiki is a healing practice that promotes overall health and well-being. It is a safe therapy with no reported side effects, which may help you if you are seeking relief from disease-related symptoms or the effects of medical treatments such as chemotherapy. Reiki originated in Japan during the early 1900s and came to the West in the 1930s. During a Reiki session, the practitioner places her hands lightly on or just above you to support your body's innate healing abilities. You will remain clothed during the session. Scientific studies are under way to prove the effectiveness of Reiki. Its current applications include the following: - Relaxation - Stress and anxiety reduction - Chronic pain relief - Surgical recovery - Lessening of chemotherapy side effects - Promotion of peace and tranquility for those who are dying and their families Patient experience: The Power of Reiki The following testimonial is from John S., who underwent Reiki at TriHealth Integrative Health & Medicine. I felt a great deal of mental anxiety after having two major abdominal surgeries in three days. The physical pain and stress were significant. It was difficult to breathe, sleep or relax the tension in my body. When Mira Shukla [Reiki master] visited me in the hospital and described Reiki, my wife and I were skeptical, but I decided it certainly could not hurt to try it. My wife and I were amazed at the difference it made immediately. After each treatment, I felt much less pain, and the release of tension made it much easier to breathe and sleep. In the weeks after my second surgery, Mira and I focused on healing the wound and preparing my body for a final surgery to take down an ileostomy. My third surgery went as well as it could have, according to my doctors. I got out of the hospital ahead of the usual time frame, and I quickly recovered my normal bowel functioning. My body has healed very well, and I am no longer under any medical treatment or restrictions. I think the Reiki treatments I received and the knowledge Mira shared with me have been a tremendous benefit in relieving the pain and stress of surgery and in recovering and maintaining a healthy and balanced system. Thank you, Mira. References Hover-Kramer, D., Mentgen, J., Scandrett-Hibdon, S. (1996). Healing Touch: A Resource for Health Care Professionals. Delmar: Albany Slater, V.E. (1996).
