Please note, the terms of a customer's particular benefit plan document may differ significantly from the standard benefit plans upon which these Cigna / ASH Medical Coverage Policies are based. In the event of a conflict, a customer's bene fit plan document always supersedes the information in the Cigna / ASH Medical Coverage Policy. In the absence of a contr olling federal or state coverage mandate, benefits are ultimately determined by the terms of the applicable benefit plan document. Determinati ons in each specific instance may require consideration of: 1) the terms of the applicable benefit plan document in effect on the date of service 2) any applicable laws/regulations 3) any relevant collateral source materials including Cigna-ASH Medical Coverage Policies and 4) the specific facts of the particular situation Cigna / ASH Medical Coverage Policies rel ate exclusively to the administration of health benefit plans. Cigna / ASH Medical Coverage Policies are not recommendations for treatment and should never be used as treatment guidelines. Some information in these Coverage Policies may not apply to al l benefit plans administered by Cigna. Certain Cigna Companies and/or lines of business only provide utilization review services to clients and do not make benefit determinations. Referenc es to standard benefit plan language and benefit determinations do not apply to those clients. GUIDELINES Under many benefit plans, coverage for cognitive rehabilitation is subject to the terms, conditions and limitations of the applicable benefit plan's Short Term Rehabilitative Therapy benefit and schedule of copayme nts. Coverage for cognitive rehabilitation therapy varies across plans. Refer to the customer's benefit plan document for coverage details. Additionally, cognitive rehabilitation therapy coverage may be subject to state mandates. If coverage for cognitive rehabilitation is available, the following conditions of coverage apply. Medically Necessary An individualized program of cognitive rehabilitation is considered medically necessary for EITHER of the following: stroke/cerebral infarction moderate to severe traumatic brain injury Cognitive Rehabilitation (CPG 270) Page 2 of 34 when ALL of the following requirements are met: A documented cognitive impairment with related compromised functional status exists. Neuropsychological testing or an appropriate assessm ent has been performed and these test or assessment results will be used in treatment planning and directing of rehabilitation strategies. The individual is willing and able to actively participate in the treatment plan. Significant cognitive improvement w ith improved related functional status is expected. Outpatient is usually the most medically appropriate setting for cognitive rehabilitation. Cognitive rehabilitation provided in an acute inpatient or skilled facility may be considered medically necessar y if the individual independently meets coverage criteria for that level of care. Cognitive rehabilitation provided in a residential facility is considered medically necessary when the individual requires a 24 -hour a day supervised environment because of cognitive impairment due to recent brain injury criteria listed above, manifested by severely impaired impulse control, judgement or executive function and cannot be safely managed in the home environment. Co verage for the residential facility placement i s subject to benefit plan provisions. Continuation of cognitive rehabilitation is considered medically when both of the following criteria are met: The criteria listed above are met There is documented progress toward the quantifiable, attainable short - and long- term goals. Not Medically Necessary Cognitive rehabilitation to improve academic or work performance is considered not medically necessary. Experimental, Investigational, Unproven Cognitive rehabilitation for ANY other indications is considered experimental, investigational or unproven. Examples include but are not limited to: Cerebral palsy Attention deficit disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder Pervasive developmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorders Learning disabilities Developmental delay Epilepsy Schizophrenia Dementia Mild traumatic brain injury, including concussion and post -concussion syndrome Coma stimulation for any indication, including coma or persistent vegetative state, is considered experimental, investigational or unproven. DESCRIPTION Cognition refers to information- processing functions carried out by the brain that include, attention, memory, executive functions (i.e., planning, problem solving, self -monitoring, self -awareness), comprehension and formation of speech, calculation ability, visual perception, and praxis skills. Cognitive processes can be conscious or unconscious and often are divided into basic level skills (e.g., attention and memory processes) and executive functions. Cognitive function pertains to the mental processes of comprehension, judgement, memory, and reasoning, as contrasted with emotional and volitional process. Cognitive dysfunction (or cognitive impairment) can be defined as functioning below expected normative levels or loss of ability in any area of cognitive functioning. Cognitive training focuses on guided practice on a set of tasks that reflect particular cognitive functions, such as memory, attention or pr oblem -solving. Cognitive rehabilitation is intended to improve cognitive functions and functional abilities, and increase levels of self -management and independence Cognitive Rehabilitation (CPG 270) Page 3 of 34 following neurological damage to the central nervous system. It focuses on identifying and addressing individual needs and goals, which may require strategies for taking in new information or compensatory methods such as using memory aids. Cognitive dysfunction may occur across the lifespan and may be associated with a wide range of clinical conditions. Cognitive dysfunction comes in many different forms and can come and go, remain over time, progress, be very specific or general and can range from mild to severe and affect different areas of life; like social participation, well- being, intellect , employment and functional performance. Cognitive impairments are typically categorized by severity or clinical conditions that cause the dysfunction. When rehabilitation therapy practitioners provide intervention to improve cognitive functioning (i.e., c ognitive rehabilitation), the therapeutic goal is always to enhance some aspect of occupational or daily activity performance. Occupations refer to \"everyday activities\" that are important to the individual and that help define the individual to himself or herself and others and that serve an individual's life roles (AOTA, 2013). GENERAL BACKGROUND Cognitive rehabilitation is a systematic, goal -oriented treatment program designed to improve cognitive functions and functional abilities, and increase levels of self -management and independence following neurological damage to the central nervous system. Although the specific tasks may be individualized to patients' needs, treatment generally emphasizes restoring lost functions; teaching compensatory strategies to circumvent impaired cognitive functions; and improving competence in performing instrumental activities of daily living (ADL) such as managing medications, using the telephone and handling finances. The term cognitive rehabilitation may be used to describe a variety of intervention strategies or techniques that are intended to help patients reduc e, manage or cope with cognitive deficits. Cognitive rehabilitation may be provided as an integrated holistic program, or as a separate component used to treat a specific cognitive defect. Restorative and compensatory approaches are utilized in cognitive rehabilitation. The restorative approach, also referred to as direct intervention or process -specific, is based on the theory that repetitive exercise promotes recovery of damaged neural circuits and restores lost function. Restorative cognitive rehabilit ation targets specific internal cognitive processes in an effort to generalize improvements to real -world settings. Interventions typically involve exercises designed to isolate specific components of impaired cognition (e.g., selective attention, visual perception, prospective memory) and to rebuild cognition skills in a hierarchical manner. Restorative techniques include auditory, visual and verbal stimulation and practice, number manipulation, computer -assisted stimulation and practice, performance feedback, reinforcement, video feedback and meta- cognitive procedures such as behavior modification. The compensatory approach, also referred to as the functional approach, focuses on teaching patients to employ various strategies to cope with underlying cognitive impairments and accompanying social deficits. The compensatory approach is based on the assumption that lost neurological functioning cannot be restored. The goal, therefore, is to teach strategies to circumvent impaired functioning, and encourage an d reinforce intact abilities and strengths. Compensatory techniques generally focus on activities of daily living and social interactions. Group therapies may be important to strengthen the patient's ability to interact effectively with others. Memory impa irment may be addressed by external and internal methods of rehabilitation. External aids include memory notebook systems, electronic memory devices, alarms, calendars, posted reminders, and standardized locations for necessary items. Internal aids include learning of mnemonic strategies (e.g., acronyms, peg word systems, and associated imagery). Compensatory cognitive rehabilitation may involve modifying the physical or social environment in a way that cues a specific behavior and eliminates distraction or unwanted behavior. Although the compensatory approach to cognitive rehabilitation has been more widely accepted than the restorative approach, these techniques are not mutually exclusive. Many therapeutic programs employ both techniques. A number of cognitive rehabilitation approaches have been proposed to address the issue of cognitive impairment such as: attention process training, integrated psychological therapy, cognitive enhancement therapy, neurocognitive enhancement therapy, and cognitive remediat ion therapy, the neuropsychological educational approach to remediation, errorless learning approaches, and attention shaping. Each approach shares the goal of enhancing cognitive processes or circumventing cognitive impairments in an effort to improve functional outcomes (Velligan et al., 2006). Cognitive rehabilitation may be provided by various professionals, including speech/language pathologists, occupational therapists, psychiatrists, psychologists, neuropsychologists, psychiatric nurses, cognitive remediation therapists, and physical therapists. None of these disciplines provide specific training guidelines for Cognitive Rehabilitation (CPG 270) Page 4 of 34 cognitive rehabilitation, however. Cognitive rehabilitation is usually provided on an outpatient basis, although other settings may be indicated depending on the patient's stage of recovery and acuity level. Prior to initiation of a cognitive rehabilitation program, patients generally undergo comprehensive neuropsychological testing to evaluate and identify specific baseline deficits and impair ments as well as to direct a treatment plan and develop measurable goals. There is substantial variation in the delivery of cognitive rehabilitation with respect to essential components, program design and emphasis. Cognitive rehabilitation interventions should be structured, systematic, goal - directed (long - and short -term goals ), individualized and restorative. There is no evidence in the medical literature to support a specific treatment intensity or duration for cognitive rehabilitation. Cognitive rehabilitation should be evaluated on the basis of goal achievement, including quantifiable rates of improvement in functional abilities and documented treatment outcomes. There is an expectation that some improvement can be demonstrated through documentation within two weeks. Contraindications to cognitive rehabilitation include the inability of the patient to participate in a treatment plan (i.e., orthopedic, medical, psychosocial or behavioral issues). Cognitive rehabilitation often involves the services of a multidisciplinary team. Although cognitive rehabilitation has been propos ed for numerous other conditions that may cause impaired cognitive function, there is insufficient evidence to support its use for conditions other than moderate to severe TBI or stroke Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and Stroke A number of classification sy stems have been developed for assessment of neurological damage following head injury. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is generally used in the initial evaluation of the head injury. The initial GCS score helps determine prognosis and the extent of injury. GC S classifications are as follows: GCS 3- 8, severe; GCS 9- 13 (alternately, 9- 12), moderate, and GCS 14- 15 (alternately, 13- 15), mild or minor. A GCS of 13-15 has traditionally been defined as a minor TBI, but many patients with a GCS of 13 have outcomes mor e consistent with moderate TBI, so some authorities now consider minor TBI as that producing a GCS of 14- 15. Mild or minor TBI is a temporary and brief interruption of neurologic function after head trauma, and may involve a loss of consciousness. A conc ussion is a type of minor TBI usually caused by acceleration -deceleration or rotational injury to a freely mobile head, and is commonly associated with collision sports. Almost all -patients with minor TBI will have rapid and complete symptom resolution; wi th no long -term sequelae. A small percentage of patients may report persistent symptoms (e.g., headache, sensory sensitivity, memory or concentration difficulties, irritability, sleep disturbance, depression) for extended periods after trauma. These sympto ms are referred to as postconcussive syndrome (Biros and Heegaard, 2009). Other conditions contribute to the degree of severity, including posttraumatic amnesia (PTA). PTA is defined as the interval between injury and return to day -to-day memory, and can be assessed during the subacute stage of recovery by testing orientation and memory. Scores include mild (< 24 hours), moderate (24 hours to 7 days), and severe (7 days or more). The Rancho Los Amigos Cognitive Functioning Scale (RLAS) is a commonly used method to characterize and stage TBI recovery in rehabilitation settings. RLAS cognitive levels range from I, no response, to VIII, purposeful and appropriate (Evans, et al., 2007; Arciniegas, 2008, Koehler, et al., 2011). Patients with moderate or severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) may experience both cognitive and non- cognitive problems, including behavioral and emotional issues. Cognitive rehabilitation therefore is often provided as part of a comprehensive, holistic program that is focused on treatment of the cognitive, psychosocial, and behavioral issues associated with TBI. Most holistic programs include group and individual therapy in which patients are encouraged to be more aware of and accept their strengths and weaknesses, improve their social relatedness, and are provided with strategies to compensate for cognitive difficulties. Dementia Dementia is the development of cognitive impairments that diminish social, occupational, and intellectual abilities. It can be grouped into four major categori es: degenerative (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease), vascular (following stroke), infectious (HIV Type -1 associated dementia), and metabolic diseases (Wilson's disease) (Small and Mayeux, 2005). Schizophrenia Cognitive Rehabilitation (CPG 270) Page 5 of 34 Schizophrenia i s a severe and persistent debilitating psychiatric disorder that affects approximately 1% of the world's population. It is characterized by disturbances in perception, cognition, mood, thought process, expression of language, and relationships with others. Symptoms can include delusions, hallucinations, and thought disorder. Neuropsychiatric changes often include impairments in information processing. Multiple Sclerosis Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurologic condition that involves a disruption of the flow of information with the brain and between the brain and the body. The progress, severity and specific symptoms of MS in any one person is variable and inconsistent. Most people with MS are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50, with at least two to three times more women than men being diagnosed with the disease. It involves an immune- mediated process that causes damage to the central nervous system (CNS), which inclu des the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves. The inflammation caused by the immune system damages the myelin, or fatty substance that surrounds and insulated the nerve fibers, the cells that produce myelin, and the nerve fibers themselves, This damage caus es scarring and creates altered nerve conduction, which results in a variety of neurological symptoms. These symptoms will vary among and within individuals with MS, and can include muscle weakness, spasticity, vision problems, numbness and tingling, fatigue, cognitive and emotional changes, dizziness, and/or gait disturbances. The cause of MS is not known, but it is hypothesized to involve genetic susceptibility, abnormalities in the immune system, and environmental factors that combine to trigger the disease. People with MS typically experience one of four disease courses. Coma Stimulation Sensory stimulation, also referred to as coma stimulation, coma arousal therapy, multisensory stimulation and coma care, is intended to promote awakening and enhance t he rehabilitative potential of coma patients. It has been proposed that with intense and repeated stimulation and precise protocols, a patient could be awakened earlier from coma and returned to a higher level of functioning. Protocols may involve stimulat ion of any or all of the following senses: visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, cutaneous, and kinesthetic. The intensity of coma stimulation programs varies. Programs can range from one or two cycles of stimulation daily (approximately one hour each) t o hourly stimulation cycles, lasting approximately 15 -20 minutes, for 12- 14 hours per day, six days a week. Professionals who perform the protocols include nurses, occupational therapists, physical therapists and speech -language therapists. Treatment may b e delivered in the hospital, the patient's home, or a skilled nursing facility. Due to the intensity of the program, the patient's family may be trained in the techniques and given the primary responsibility for providing the therapy to ensure program cont inuation. LITERATURE REVIEW Cognitive rehabilitation interventions for persons with stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and dementias have the most published empirical data (references below), and persons with these conditions are among the most frequently seen by rehabilitation therapy practitioners. Additionally, they may address cognitive barriers to functioning resulting from developmental disorders, environmental factors, or disease. Specifically, these populations include those experiencing cogni tive dysfunction related to: Genetics and/or development (e.g., environmental deprivation, fetal alcohol syndrome, learning disabilities, pervasive developmental disorders) Other neurologic disease, events, injuries, and disorders (e.g., Parkinson's and H untington's diseases, HIV/AIDS, Alzheimer's disease and related dementias) Mental illness (e.g., schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, substance use disorders) Transient or continuing life stresses or changes (e.g., stress -related dis orders, pain syndromes, anxiety disorders, grief and loss) Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and Stroke Most published evidence evaluates cognitive rehabilitation for treatment of cognitive deficits resulting from moderate or severe traumatic brain injury (TBI ) and stroke/cerebral infarction. The available evidence, although not robust, indicates that cognitive rehabilitation may improve functional outcomes for some patients with moderate or severe TBI. Evidence is limited due to the heterogeneity of subjects, interventions and outcomes studied, small sample size, failure to control for spontaneous recovery, and the unspecified confounding effects of social contact. Evidence from available studies indicates, however, that cognitive rehabilitation may reduce anxiety, improve self -concept and relationships for people with TBI, and may improve memory, attention and executive skills. There is insufficient evidence in the published medical literature, however, to support the use of Cognitive Rehabilitation (CPG 270) Page 6 of 34 cognitive rehabilitation for patient s with mild TBI, including concussion and post -concussion syndrome. Patients who sustain a stroke may exhibit symptoms similar to those experienced by TBI patients, with cognitive deficits in the areas of memory, reasoning and perception. Both TBI and stroke may result in impairment of localized, higher -order, sensory and motor function corresponding to affected anatomic structures, but may also result in loss of a variety of functions that are not clearly localized, such as the ability to abstract and to r eason. Although the evidence supporting the use of cognitive rehabilitation to treat cognitive deficits following stroke is limited, there is some evidence that it contributes to visuospatial rehabilitation and improvement in aphasia and apraxia. In additi on, the medical community has recognized cognitive rehabilitation as a standard treatment modality for stroke as well as for TBI. National Academy of Neuropsychology (NAN) published an official statement on cognitive rehabilitation that supports empirically and rationally based cognitive rehabilitation techniques that have been designed to improve the quality of life and functional outcomes for individuals with acquired brain injuries (NAN, 2002). In 2005, the cognitive rehabilitation tas k force of European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS) provided an updated statement and recommendations regarding the clinical effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation for patients with TBI and stroke. The task force concluded that the current evidence is inconclusive due to methodological quality, insufficient sample size, failure to compare treatment methods, and inability to determine outcomes at the disability level. The authors stated that adequately designed randomized trials with patient homogeneity and treatment standardization are needed to evaluate the efficacy of cognitive rehabilitation for TBI ( Cappa, et al., 2005) . A systematic review by Koehler et al. 2011 found limited, and in some cases, modest evidence that cognitive rehabilitati on is effective for treating some deficits related to TBI, including attention, executive function, social communication, and memory. A systematic review of 112 studies (Cicerone, et al., 2011) for cognitive rehabilitation following TBI and stroke the rev iew indicate that regarding stroke that the evidence supports visuospatial rehabilitation after right hemisphere stroke and interventions for aphasia and apraxia after left hemisphere stroke and that based on the current meta- analysis, together with prior reviews, there is sufficient information to support evidence- based protocols and implement empirically -supported treatments for cognitive disability after TBI and stroke. Chung et al. (2013) investigated how effective cognitive rehabilitation interventions are at improving executive function after brain injury in a Cochrane review. Thirteen studies were included consisting of 770 participants in the meta- analyses (417 traumatic brain injury, 304 stroke, 49 other acquired brain injury) which reduced to 660 participants once non -included intervention groups were removed from some studies. Three studies (134 participants) compared cognitive rehabilitation with sensorimotor therapy. Six studies (333 participants) compared cognitive rehabilitation with no treatment or placebo. Ten studies (448 participants) compared two different cognitive rehabilitation approaches. They also explored the effect of restorative interventions (10 studies, 468 participants) and compensative interventions (four studies, 128 participants) and found no statistically significant effect compared with other interventions. They found no evidence that cognitive rehabilitation interventions were helpful for people with executive dysfunction for any other outcomes. Authors identified insufficient high- quality evidence to reach any generalized conclusions about the effect of cognitive rehabilitation on executive function, or other secondary outcome measures. Further high- quality research comparing cognitive rehabilitation with no intervention, pl acebo or sensorimotor interventions was recommended. The American Academy of Neurology (AAN)published an evidence- based guideline update on the evaluation and management of concussion in sports in 2013. Regarding the question of what interventions enhanc e recovery, reduce the risk of recurrent concussion, or diminish long term sequelae, the authors stated that on the basis of the available evidence, no conclusions can be drawn regarding the effect of postconcussive activity level on the recovery from spor t related concussion or the likelihood of developing chronic post - concussion complications (Giza, et al., 2013). Turner -Stokes et al. (2015) investigated multi -disciplinary rehabilitation for acquired brain injury in adults of working age in a Cochrane r eview. Authors identified 19 studies (3480 people). Twelve studies were of good methodological quality and seven were of lower quality. Within the subgroup of predominantly mild brain injury, 'strong evidence' suggested that most individuals made a good recovery when appropriate information was provided, without the need for additional specific interventions. For moderate to severe injury, 'strong evidence' showed benefit from formal intervention, and 'limited evidence' indicated that commencing rehabilitat ion early after injury results in better outcomes. For participants with moderate to severe ABI already in rehabilitation, 'strong evidence' revealed that more intensive programs are associated with earlier functional gains, and 'moderate evidence' sugges ted that continued outpatient therapy could help to sustain gains made in early post - acute rehabilitation. The context of multi -disciplinary rehabilitation appears to influence outcomes. 'Strong Cognitive Rehabilitation (CPG 270) Page 7 of 34 evidence' supports comprehensive cognitive rehabilitation in a therapeutic environment that involves a peer group of patients. 'Limited evidence' shows that specialist in- patient rehabilitation and specialist multi - disciplinary community rehabilitation may provide additional functional gains. In conclusion, for mild brain injury, information and advice were usually more appropriate than intensive rehabilitation. Patients with moderate to severe brain injury who received more intensive rehabilitation showed earlier improvement and earlier rehabilitation was better than delayed. It also supports that cognitive rehabilitation be provided in an environment where patients receive group- based therapy with peers facing the same challenges. Park et al. (2015) investigated the overall effect of occupation- based cognitive reha bilitation on patients' improvement in cognitive performance components, activity of daily living (ADL) performance, and values, beliefs and spirituality functions of patients with TBI. Evidence from this meta- analytic study suggests that occupation- based cognitive rehabilitation would be beneficial for individuals with TBI for improving daily functioning and positively be able to affect their psychosocial functions. Kumar et al. (2017) evaluated whether cognitive rehabilitation for people with TBI improves return to work, independence in daily activities, community integration and quality of life. Nine studies with 790 participants were included. Authors state that there is insufficient good- quality evidence to support the role of cognitive rehabilitation w hen compared to no intervention or conventional rehabilitation in improving return to work, independence in ADL, community integration or quality of life in adults with TBI. There is moderate -quality evidence that cognitive rehabilitation provided as a hom e program is similar to hospital - based cognitive rehabilitation in improving return to work status among active duty military personnel with moderate- to-severe TBI. An Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) comparative effectiveness review was conducted to determine the effectiveness and comparative effectiveness of multidisciplinary postacute rehabilitation for moderate to severe traumatic brain injury TBI in adults (Brasure et al., 2012; 2016). Twelve studies assessed a primary outcome and eig ht assessed secondary outcomes and four of these were considered to have a high risk of bias and were excluded from analysis. Studies of multidisciplinary postacute rehabilitation programs often do not define interventions sufficiently. Although newer studies provide more useful definitions, it remains difficult to decipher what the individual components of the program entailed and how, when and why individuals received specific therapies. The review found that currently available evidence is insufficient t o draw conclusions about the effectiveness of multidisciplinary postacute rehabilitation for moderate to severe TBI. Although the authors found stronger evidence on the comparative effectiveness of different approaches to multidisciplinary postacute rehabi litation for participation outcomes, there were a limited number of eligible studies and no clear demonstration that one approach was superior to another. The authors stated that future research to identify and test hypothesized combinations between patient types and intervention approaches would have important clinical implications. Recommendations for brain injury rehabilitation in adults from the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) (2013) include: Assessment and treatment of mild brain injury Patients presenting with non- specific symptoms following mild traumatic brain injury should be reassured that the symptoms are benign and likely to settle within three months. Cognitive rehabilitation: Patients with memory impairment after TB I should be trained in the use of compensatory memory strategies with a clear focus on improving everyday functioning rather than underlying memory impairment. For patients with mild -moderate memory impairment both external aids and internal strategies (e. g. use of visual imagery) may be used. For those with severe memory impairment external compensations with a clear focus on functional activities is recommended. In the post -acute setting interventions for cognitive deficits should be applied in the contex t of a comprehensive/holistic neuropsychological rehabilitation program. This would involve an interdisciplinary team using a goal -focused program which has the capacity to address cognitive, emotional and behavioral difficulties with the aim of improving functioning in meaningful everyday activities. American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA): AOTA published occupational therapy practice guidelines for adults with traumatic brain injury (Wheeler, et al., 2016). The recommendation for occupational therapy interventions for adults with TBI include: Interventions to Improve Occupational Performance of People with Cognitive Impairments: Cognitive Rehabilitation (CPG 270) Page 8 of 34 General memory interventions (involving restorative and/or compensatory approaches) to improve memory (A) Attention reg ulation interventions with or without goal problem -solving training to improve attention and executive functioning (A) Executive function strategy training such as goals management training and meta- cognitive strategy instruction to improve attention and e xecutive functioning (A) Training in encoding techniques to improve recall (A) Training in use of cognitive assistive technology (except voice recorders and navigation devices) to improve memory (A) Various memory -specific compensatory approaches to improv e memory (A) Use of compensatory interventions to improve multiple cognitive domains (B) Cognitive interventions to improve self -awareness (B) Computer -based interventions to enhance occupational performance (I) General restorative and/or compensatory appr oaches to improve attention and executive dysfunction (I) Interventions to Improve Occupational Performance of People with Visual and Visual -Perceptual Impairments Scanning training to improve search skills when measured with digit search, computer tests, and a functional search task (A) Cognitive rehabilitation to improve performance in neuropsychological measures focused on visual perception (A) Scanning training accompanied by a visual and/or auditory stimulus to improve visual search ski lls and reading performance (B) Vision therapy to remediate oculomotor signs and symptoms (C) Cognitive compensatory strategies such as pacing, chunking, and self -talk to improve activity of daily living (ADL) performance (C) Fresnel 40 -diopter prism to im prove visual field awareness and functional mobility (C) Scrolling text to improve reading performance of people with reading difficulties as a result of hemianopsia (C) Cognitive strategies focused on social skills training to improve the ability to name basic emotions, interpret comments, and determine whether a person is lying or being sarcastic (I) Scanning as a standalone intervention to improve reading (I) Interventions to Improve Occupational Performance of People with Psychosocial, Behavioral, or Emotional Impairments Cognitive -behavioral therapy (CBT) interventions to address psychosocial, behavioral, and emotional impairments and to improve occupational performance (A) Goal -directed outpatient rehabilitation to improve ratings of self -performance and satisfaction (A) Goal -directed outpatient rehabilitation to improve goal attainment, occupational performance, psychosocial reintegration, and adjustment levels (B) Aquatic exercise to improve tension, depression, anger, vigor, fatigue, and confusion ( B) Functional skills training to improve social participation, community reintegration, independent living, emotional well -being, and quality of life (B) CBT modified to include mindfulness -based cognitive therapy (MBCT) to decrease depression and motivati onal interviewing to improve anxiety (C) CBT administered in the virtual context to address psychosocial and emotional distress, anxiety, and depression (C) Aerobic exercise to improve self -esteem, depression, quality of life, and community activity (C) Strength of Recommendation A-There is strong evidence that occupational therapy practitioners should routinely provide the intervention to eligible clients. Good evidence was found that the intervention improves important outcomes and concludes that benefit s substantially outweigh harm. B-There is moderate evidence that occupational therapy practitioners should routinely provide the intervention to eligible clients. There is high certainty that the net benefit is moderate, or there is moderate certainty that the net benefit is moderate to substantial. Cognitive Rehabilitation (CPG 270) Page 9 of 34 C-There is weak evidence that the intervention can improve outcomes. It is recommended that the intervention be provided selectively on the basis of professional judgement and patient preferences. There is at le ast moderate certainty that the net benefit is small. I-There is insufficient evidence to determine whether or not occupational therapy practitioners should be routinely providing the intervention. Evidence that the intervention is effective is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting and the balance of benefits and harm cannot be determined. D-It is recommended that occupational therapy practitioners do not provide the intervention to eligible clients. At least fair evidence was found that the intervention is ineffective or that harm outweighs benefits. Note: Criteria for level of evidence and recommendations (A, B, C, I, D) are based on standard language from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (2012). Suggested recommendations are based on the available evidence and content experts' clinical expertise regarding the value of using it. The Stroke Council of the American Heart Association endorsed the Veterans Administration/Department of Defense guidelines for stroke rehabilitation (Duncan, et al., 2005). The panel was made up of experts from the Department of Veterans Affairs and the United States Department of Defense. The panel evaluated published literature through 2002. Recommendations were based on randomized clinical trials, uncontrol led studies, or consensus expert opinion if definitive data were lacking. The guidelines were developed as a means of direction for clinicians and also to assist researchers in identifying areas in need of further investigation. In the area of cognitive rehabilitation, the recommendation was that all patients be assessed for cognitive deficits and be given retraining if any of the following conditions were present: attention deficit, visual neglect, memory deficits, and executive function and problem -solvin g difficulties. das Nair and Lincoln (2007) reviewed cognitive rehabilitation for memory deficits following stroke in a Cochrane review. Only 2 trials, involving 18 participants, were included. One study compared the effectiveness of a mnemonic strategy tr eatment group with a 'drill and practice' control, while the other compared the effectiveness of an imagery mnemonics program with a 'pragmatic' memory rehabilitation control program. Authors conclude that there was no evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of memory rehabilitation on functional outcomes, and objective, subjective, and observer -rated memory measures. This review of two trials involving 18 participants found that there was little evidence to support the effectiveness of cognitive re habilitation for memory problems after stroke and more research in this area is needed. das Nair et al. (2016) then published an updated Cochrane review for cognitive rehabilitation for memory deficits after stroke. The review included 13 trials involving 514 participants. The review found that participants who received cognitive rehabilitation for memory problems following a stroke reported benefits from the intervention on subjective measures of memory in the short term. The effect was not, however, obser ved in the longer term. There was limited evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of memory rehabilitation with the evidence limited due to the poor quality of reporting in many studies, lack of consistency in the choice of outcome measures, and sm all sample sizes. There is a need for more robust, well -designed, adequately powered, and better -reported trials of memory rehabilitation using common standardized outcome measures. Hoffman et al. (2010) conducted a systematic review to determine whether i nterventions for cognitive impairment following stroke may improve functional performance of basic and/or instrumental activities of daily living (ADL). The authors concluded that the small number of high quality trials did not allow recommendations that s upport or refute the use of specific cognitive retraining interventions to improve functional outcomes following stroke. Loetscher et al. (2013) reported on a Cochrane review that examined cognitive rehabilitation for attention deficits following stroke. The authors noted that there was limited evidence that cognitive rehabilitation may improve some aspects of attention in the short term, but there was insufficient evidence to support or refute the persisting effects of cognitive rehabilitation on attentio n, or on functional outcomes in either the short or long term and they concluded that the effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation for this condition remains unconfirmed and that while the results suggest there may be a short -term effect on attentional abilities, future studies are needed to assess the persisting effects and measure attentional skills in daily life. Chung et al. (2013) reported on a Cochrane review for cognitive rehabilitation for executive dysfunction in adults with stroke or other adult non-progressive acquired brain damage. The review noted that there was insufficient high- quality evidence to reach any generalized conclusions about the effect of cognitive rehabilitation on any outcomes, for all comparisons and that further high -quality r esearch comparing cognitive rehabilitation with no intervention, placebo or sensorimotor interventions is recommended. Bowen et al. (2013) authored a Cochrane review on cognitive rehabilitation for spatial neglect following stroke. Authors included 23 RCTs with 628 participants. Most studies measured outcomes using standardized neglect assessments. Meta- analyses demonstrated no Cognitive Rehabilitation (CPG 270) Page 10 of 34 statistically significant effect of cognitive rehabilitation, compared with control, for persisting effects on either ADL (five stu dies, 143 participants) or standardized neglect assessments (eight studies, 172 participants), or for immediate effects on ADL (10 studies, 343 participants). In contrast, they found a statistically significant effect in favor of cognitive rehabilitation c ompared with control, for immediate effects on standardized neglect assessments. The effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation interventions for reducing the disabling effects of neglect and increasing independence remains unproven, thus no rehabilitation approach can be supported or refuted based on current evidence from RCTs. However, there is some very limited evidence that cognitive rehabilitation may have an immediate beneficial effect on tests of neglect which justifies further high quality clinical t rials of cognitive rehabilitation for neglect. Gillespie et al. (2015) provided an overview of the evidence for the effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation for patients with stroke and to determine the main gaps in the current evidence base. Data arising from 44 trials involving over 1500 patients was identified. Though there was support for the effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation for some cognitive impairments, significant gaps were found in the current evidence base. All of the Cochrane reviews identified major limitations within the evidence they identified. Authors concluded that there is currently insufficient research evidence, or evidence of insufficient quality, to support clear recommendations for clinical practice. Cicerone et al. (2019) conducted an updated, systematic review of the clinical literature, classify studies based on the strength of research design, and derive consensual, evidence- based clinical recommendations for cognitive rehabilitation of people with traumatic brain injury (TBI) or stroke. Articles were reviewed by the Cognitive Rehabilitation Task Force (CRTF) members according to specific criteria for study design and quality, and classified as providing class I, class II, or class III evidence. Of 121 studies, 41 were rated as class I, 3 as class Ia, 14 as class II, and 63 as class III. Recommendations were derived by CRTF consensus from the relative strengths of the evidence, based on the decision rules applied in prior reviews. CRTF has now evaluated 491 articles (109 c lass I or Ia, 68 class II, and 314 class III) and makes 29 recommendations for evidence -based practice of cognitive rehabilitation (9 Practice Standards, 9 Practice Guidelines, 11 Practice Options). Evidence supports Practice Standards for (1) attention deficits after TBI or stroke; (2) visual scanning for neglect after right -hemisphere stroke; (3) compensatory strategies for mild memory deficits; (4) language deficits after left -hemisphere stroke; (5) social -communication deficits after TBI; (6) metacognit ive strategy training for deficits in executive functioning; and (7) comprehensive- holistic neuropsychological rehabilitation to reduce cognitive and functional disability after TBI or stroke. The results support moderate evidence for cognitive rehabilitat ion effects on function after TBI and CVA. Niemeijer et al. (2020) evaluated benefits and harms for computer based cognitive rehabilitation (CBCR) on working memory impairment after stroke. Literature was limited and reported effects of CBCR on working mem ory after stroke were very heterogeneous. A meta -analysis was not performed as all studies used different measures of working memory. An additional analysis was performed in order to cautiously estimate the difference between the control interventions (whether passive or active) and CBCR interventions. The analysis revealed no meaningful differences in increase of working memory measures between control conditions and intervention conditions. However, this additional analysis should be interpreted with caut ion as it does not take the heterogeneity of outcome measures or the differences in sample sizes between studies into account. No harms were observed. Authors concluded that there is insufficient evidence to conclude if CBCR is beneficial for patients with working memory deficits after stroke. Nie et al. (2021) sought to determine the effectiveness of computer -assisted cognitive rehabilitation in improving cognitive function in patients with post -stroke cognitive impairment in a systematic review. Thirty -two studies comprising 1837 participants were included. Compared with conventional therapy alone, the addition of computer -assisted cognitive rehabilitation significantly improved the global cognition of patients, evaluated using the Montreal cognitive assessment, mini- mental state examination and Loewenstein occupational therapy cognitive assessment. The therapy also significantly improved activities of daily living, assessed using the Barthel index, modified Barthel index and functional independence measur e. Authors concluded that computer - assisted cognitive rehabilitation significantly improved the cognitive function and activities of daily living of patients with post -stroke cognitive impairment. Cisneros et al. (2021a) evaluated the impact of a 12- week, 24- session multimodal group cognitive rehabilitation intervention, the Cognitive Enrichment Program (CEP), on executive functioning and resumption of daily activities after traumatic brain injury (TBI) in older individuals as compared with an active control group that received individual holistic rehabilitation as usual care. In total, 37 patients with a TBI and aged 57 to 90 years were assigned to experimental (n = 23) and control (n = 14) groups in a semi -randomized, controlled, before -after intervention trial with follow -up at 6 months, with blinded outcome measurement. The CEP's executive function module included planning, problem solving, and goal management training as well as strategies focusing on self -awareness. Efficacy was evaluated by neuropsychological tests Cognitive Rehabilitation (CPG 270) Page 11 of 34 (Six Elements Task -Adapted [SET -A], D -KEFS Sorting test and Stroop four -color version); generalization was measured by self -reporting questionnaires about daily functioning (Dysexecutive Functioning Questionnaire, forsaken daily activities). ANCOVA results showed significant group- by-time interactions; the experimental group showed a statistically significant improvement on Tackling the 6 subtasks and Avoiding rule -breaking measures of the SET -A, with medium effect sizes. The generalization measure, the Dysexecutive Functioning Questionnaire, showed a significant reduction in experimental patient -significant other difference on the Executive cognition subscale. The number of forsaken daily activities was reduced in the experimental versus contr ol group, which was not significant immediately after the CEP but was significant 6 months later. Authors concluded that older adults with TBI can improve their executive functioning, with a positive impact on everyday activities, after receiving multimodal cognitive training with the CEP. Cisneros et al. (2021b) evaluated the impact of a 12- week, 24 -session multimodal group cognitive intervention, the Cognitive Enrichment Program (CEP), on episodic memory in older adults with traumatic brain injury (TBI) compared to an active control group that received usual care in the form of individual holistic rehabilitation. In total, 37 patients with a TBI who were 57 to 90 years old were assigned to experimental (n = 23) and control (n = 14) groups in a semi -rando mized, controlled, before -after intervention trial with follow -up at 6 months, with blinded outcome measurement. The CEP's Memory module consisted of memory strategies to promote encoding. Efficacy was evaluated by using Face- name association, Word list re call, and Text memory measures, and generalization was assessed with the Self -Evaluation Memory Questionnaire (SEMQ), the Psychological General Well -Being Index, and a satisfaction questionnaire. ANCOVA mixed model repeated- measures analysis revealed a str ong group- by-time interaction, with the experimental group showing statistically significant improvement on the Face -name association test, with a large effect size. They also found a statistically significant group- by-time interaction on 3 dimensions of t he SEMQ generalization measure: the experimental group showed increased memorization of the content of Conversations, reduced Slips of attention, and increased memory of Political and social events, with medium to large effect sizes. The group also showed clinically significant improvements in psychological well -being. Scores on the satisfaction questionnaire indicated a perceived positive impact on daily life habits requiring memory abilities. Authors concluded that CEP is a promising cognitive rehabilitat ion program for older individuals with TBI, showing high satisfaction in participants, that could improve their episodic memory functioning as well as enhance their psychological well - being. Xiao et al. (2022) compared the rehabilitation efficacy of virtu al reality (VR) and computer -assisted cognitive rehabilitation (CACR) for patients with post -stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI). The primary outcomes of the included studies contained at least one of the following clinical outcome measures: Mini -mental state examination (MMSE) or Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). A total of 21 randomized controlled trials were included, including 1,047 patients. The results of network meta- analysis showed that under MMSE index, VR group and CACR group tended to be super ior to the conventional therapy group, but it was not significant. Both the VR and CACR groups had significantly better outcomes compared to the conventional therapy group in terms of MoCA. The ranking results under both indicators showed that CACR had the best treatment effect, followed by VR. Authors concluded that, in general, VR and CACR have superior efficacy compared with conventional therapy, in which CACR may be the best treatment option. Radomski et al. (2022) provided a summary of the findings f rom systematic reviews developed in conjunction with the American Occupational Therapy Association's Evidence -Based Practice Program. Eleven articles were included in the review related to cognitive interventions to improve a specific cognitive impairment for adults with TBI. Interventions were found to address specific cognitive impairment, multiple cognitive impairments, and cognitive -emotional symptoms associated with concussion. This systematic review provides evidence in support of individual, group, and computer - and virtual -realitybased (VR) intervention approaches to help adults with a range of injury severity associated with TBI to improve on measures of cognition, self -awareness, and quality of life. Evidence regarding the impact of the interventions described here on occupational performance is limited, and the use of domain- specific measures of cognitive information processing may not be adequate to indicate the adoption of such interventions by occupational therapy practitioners. According to the authors, occupational therapy practitioners may consider combining such interventions with therapeutic approaches intended to translate improved cognition to improved occupational performance. Zhou et al. (2023) evaluated the effects of computerized cognitive training on the cognitive functions of stroke patients in a systematic review and meta- analysis. With increased publications on computerized cognitive training, a meta- analysis is essential to determine the effects of computerized cognitive training among stroke Cognitive Rehabilitation (CPG 270) Page 12 of 34 patients. A total of 622 patients with 17 studies were included. Computerized cognitive training significantly improves global cognition, working memory, attention and executive function of stroke patients. However, there was inadequate eviden ce to demonstrate any effects of computerized cognitive training on activities of daily living and depression. Authors concluded that computerized cognitive training improves the cognitive functions of stroke patients. However, further research studies are needed to confirm its efficacy in activities of daily living as well as on alleviating depression. Jeffay et al. (2023) provided an update to the INCOG 2014 guidelines for the clinical management of debilitating and enduring impairments of executive func tioning and self -awareness caused by moderate- to-severe traumatic brain injury (MS -TBI). Recommendations relative to cognitive rehabilitation include the following: EXEC #1: Self -monitoring and feedback to enhance selfawareness 1a. Strategies that encourage self -monitoring of performance and involve feedback should be used with individuals with TBI who have impaired self -awareness. 1b. Consider self -awareness trainin g such as video feedback to improve the ability to recognize and correct errors during task performance. Level A evidence. EXEC #2: Metacognitive strategy instructions (eg, goal management training, plan- do-check -review, and prediction performance) should be used with individuals with TBI for difficulties with a range of executive functioning impairments that may include problem -solving, planning and organization, and other elements of executive function. Common elements of all metacognitive strategies are self- monitoring, incorporating feedback into future performance, and emotional self -regulation training. These strategies should be focused on everyday problems and functional outcomes of personal relevance to the person. Level A evidence. EXEC #3: Stra tegies to improve the capacity to analyze and synthesize information should be used with individuals with TBI who have impaired reasoning skills. Level A evidence. EXEC #4: Group- based interventions should be considered for remediation of executive and p roblem - solving deficits after traumatic brain injury. Level A evidence EXEC #6: Where available, we recommend clinicians consider the use of virtual reality programs, in addition to inperson visits to provide timely and equitable access to care for individuals with a TBI with executive dysfunction. Level A evidence. EXEC #7: One -to-one remotely delivered interventions (eg,for goal management training), set up according to established telere habilitation guidelines, are recommended if remote delivery is the most convenient or the only mode of reaching the person. Level C evidence. EXEC #8: Telerehabilitation- delivered group- based treatments of executive function may not achieve the same outcomes as in person and require further evaluation. Therefore, they are not recommended at this time. Level C evidence. Togher et al. (2023) reports the updated INCOG 2.0 recommendations for management of cognitive - communication disorders. As social cognition is central to cognitive communication disorders, this update includes interventions for social cognition. Recommendations relative to cognitive rehabilitation include the following: Cognitive -communication #1: Rehabilitation staff should recognize that levels of communication competence and communication characteristics may vary as a function of their communication partners, Cognitive Rehabilitation (CPG 270) Page 13 of 34 environment, communication demands, communication priorities, fatigue, physical and sensory issues (eg, vision, hearing), psychosocial variables, behavioral dyscontrol, emotional variables, and other personal factors Level B evidence Cognitive -communicat ion #2: A cognitive- communication evaluation and rehabilitation program for individuals with TBI should be culturally responsive and take into account the person's premorbid physical and psychosocial variables, including gender identity; native, first, and preferred languages; literacy and language proficiency; cognitive abilities; communication style considering expectations in the person's cultural linguistic background and tradition; and gender identity Level C evidence. Cognitive -communication #4: A person with TBI who has a cognitive- communication disorder should be provided with interventions and intervention materials that are both grounded in the principles of cognitive -communication rehabilitation and individualized, taking the person's context int o account to maximize communication competence Recommended cognitive- communication interventions can be direct or indirect at any level of impairment and include: o Communication partner training (level A), o Communication strategy and metacognitive awareness training (level A), o Reintegration to daily functions, productive activities, participation and competence, modification of the communication environment, and assistance with adjustment to impairments (level C), o Communication coping treatment (level C), o Focus on confidence, self -esteem, and identity formation (level C), and o Provision of education and information regarding the nature of acquired cognitive - communication disorders to both the patient and close other and communication partners (level C). Level A -C evidence. Cognitive -communication #5: A cognitive- communication rehabilitation program for individuals with TBI should provide the opportunity for practicing and using communication skills in situations appropriate to the context in which the pe rson will live, work, study, and socialize. Goal attainment scaling is recommended as a method to measure person -centered intervention outcomes Level A evidence. Cognitive -communication #6: Individuals with severe communication disability following TBI s hould be provided with proper assessment to determine the appropriate augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) intervention by trained clinicians. The individual and close communication partners should be provided with training to effectively use A AC aids. This training should be ongoing as needs change and technology evolves Level C evidence Cognitive -communication #7: Clinicians should consider group therapy as an appropriate means of remediation of cognitive- communication training when social c ommunication impairments exist post -TBI. Where aligned with their communication goals, clinicians should consider group therapy. Level A evidence Cognitive -communication #8: Telerehabilitation is as efficacious, feasible, and acceptable for communication partner training compared to in- person intervention. Level B evidence. Social cognition #1: Clinicians should consider evaluating aspects of social cognition ability, including emotion perception, theory of mind (ToM), and emotional empathy. Interventions , which aim at improving emotion perception, perspective taking, ToM, and social behavior, are recommended. Computerized social cognition treatments are not recommended given lack of evidence of generalization to real -life activities. Cognitive Rehabilitation (CPG 270) Page 14 of 34 Level A evidence. Velikonja et al. (2023) reviewed interventional research primarily focused on mild to severe memory impairments in episodic and prospective memory. Recommendations relative to cognitive rehabilitation include the following: Memory #1: Teaching internal compensatory strategies may be used for individuals with TBI who have memory impairments. Their use tends to be most effective with individuals who have mild -to-moderate memory impairments and/or some preserved executive cognitive skills. They include instructional strategies (eg, visual imagery, repeated practice, retrieval practice, and Preview, Question, Read, State, Test [PQRST]) and metacognitive strategies (eg, self -awareness and self -regulation). Using multiple strategies is considered effective. They can be selected separately or combined in a structured program. Strategies can be taught individually or in a group format. With severe memory impairment, internal compensatory strategies that are effective may be used in conjunction with external memory c ompensatory strategies Level A Evidence. Memory #2: Environmental supports and reminders (eg, mobile/smartphones, notebooks, and whiteboards) are recommended for individuals with TBI who have memory impairment, especially for those with severe memory impairment. Individuals with TBI and their caregivers must be trained in how to use these supports. The selection of environmental supports and reminders should take into account the following factors: Age Severity of impairment Premorbid use of electronic and other memory devices Cognitive strengths and weaknesses (eg, executive cognitive skills) Physical comorbidities Affordability, portability, and reliability Level A evidence. Memory #3: Cognitive skills training for moderate to severe (MS) -TBI, across all levels of memory impairment, should be strategy -focused and conducted by a TBI -experienced therapist who can facilitate the functional integration of the strategy being practi ced into meaningful and practical tasks. There is little evidence for using restorative techniques such as computerized cognitive training (CCT) alone. Level B evidence. Memory #4: There are several key instructional practices that can promote learning f or individuals with TBI memory impairments, which include: Clearly defining intervention goals Selection of and training of goals that are relevant to the person with TBI (ie, ecologically valid) Allowing sufficient time and opportunity for practice Breaking down tasks into smaller components such as task analysis when training multistep procedures Use of distributed practice Teaching strategies using variations in the stimuli/information being presented (eg, multiple exemplars) Teaching stra tegies to promote effortful processing of information/stimuli (eg, verbal elaboration and visual imagery) Use of techniques that constrain errors (eg, errorless, spaced retrieval) Consider the use of behavioral memory strategies with a focus on context and imagery in the acquisition phase of learning. Level A evidence. Memory #5: Group- based interventions may be considered for teaching memory strategies with individuals with MS-TBI, but there is no evidence that it is more effective than individually oriented rehabilitation. Consider reducing heterogeneity in group membership, encourage participation for an adequate number of sessions, and teach generalization of learned skills Level A evidence Cognitive Rehabilitation (CPG 270) Page 15 of 34 Ponsford et al. (2023) reviewed evidence published from 2014 and developed updated guidelines for the management of attention in adults, as well as a decision- making algorithm, and an audit tool for review of clinical practice. This update incorporated 27 studies and made 11 recommendations. The team recommends scree ning for and addressing factors contributing to attentional problems, including hearing, vision, fatigue, sleep -wake disturbance, anxiety, depression, pain, substance use, and medication. Metacognitive strategy training focused on everyday activities is re commended for individuals with mild -moderate attentional impairments. Practice on de- contextualized computer -based attentional tasks is not recommended because of lack of evidence of generalization, but direct training on everyday tasks, including dual tas ks or dealing with background noise, may lead to gains for performance of those tasks. Authors note that evidence for interventions to improve attention after TBI is slowly growing. However, more controlled trials are needed, especially evaluating behavior al or nonpharmacological interventions for attention. Dementia: In a meta -analysis of the literature regarding cognitive training (CT) and Alzheimer's disease, Sitzer et al. (2006) reviewed 19 controlled trials, 14 of which were RCTs. The authors used Cohen's description of effect size magnitude (0.2=small, 0.5=medium, 0.8=large) to measure outcomes. A small effect size for CT in general was reported but, more specifically, there were negative or minimal effects on visuospatial functioning and language, sm all effects on motor speed and visual learning, medium effects on executive functioning, and large effects on verbal and visual learning. The authors did note that the large effect size for verbal and visual learning was the result of one study and not aggregate scores. Only a few studies reported follow -up data suggesting that gains may be maintained an average of 4.5 months after discontinuing treatment. Many limitations in the studies were identified such as: the limited number of well -controlled studies , small sample sizes, and the variable outcome measures and techniques used. The authors concluded that CT may improve the cognitive and functional abilities of patients with Alzheimer's disease, but further research is needed, including effectiveness studies in various settings and the use of performance -based measures to evaluate the effects of treatment on daily functioning. Clare et al. (2010) conducted a single- blind randomized controlled trial to compare cognitive rehabilitation (n=23) to relaxation therapy (n=24) and no treatment (n=22) in participants with a diagnosis of Alzheimer Disease (AD) or mixed AD and vascular dementia. Cognitive rehabilitation consisted of eight weekly individual sessions consisting of personalized interventions to address relevant goals, supported by components addressing practical aids and strategies, techniques for learning new information, practice in maintaining attention and concentration, and stress management techniques. Relaxation therapy included the same amount of therapist time and equivalent level of between- session practice. Participants were taught progressive muscle relaxation and breathing exercises and encouraged to practice these strategies when experiencing anxiety. Six - month follow -up was completed in 16 participants in the cognitive rehabilitation group, and 20 in both the relaxation and no- treatment groups. The primary outcomes were goal performance and satisfaction as assessed by the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM). At six months, rati ngs on the COPM scale indicated improvement in perceived performance (p<0.001) and satisfaction (p<0.001), and improvements were corroborated by therapist observation -based ratings of performance. It is difficult to draw conclusions from this study due to the small number of participants and significant numbers lost to follow -up. A Cochrane review (Bahar -Fuchs, et al., 2013) evaluated the effectiveness and impact of cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation for mild Alzheimer's disease or vascular d ementia. Eleven randomized controlled trials of cognitive training were considered in the review. The overall quality of the trials was low to moderate. Cognitive training was not associated with any positive or negative effects for any reported outcomes. One randomized controlled trial of cognitive rehabilitation was included that allowed evaluation of effect sizes, but no meta- analysis could be conducted. Results of this trial were promising but preliminary in nature. Well -designed studies of cognitive tr aining and cognitive rehabilitation are required to obtain more definitive evidence. Clare et al. (2019) sought to determine whether individual goal -oriented cognitive rehabilitation (CR) improves everyday functioning for people with mild- to-moderate dem entia. Participants allocated to CR received 10 weekly sessions over 3 months and four maintenance sessions over 6 months. The primary outcome was self - reported goal attainment at 3 months. At 3 months, there were statistically significant large positive effects for participant -rated goal attainment. These effects were maintained at 9 months. The observed gains related to goals directly targeted in the therapy. There were no significant differences in secondary outcomes. Authors concluded that CR enables people with early -stage dementia to improve their everyday functioning in relation to individual goals targeted in the therapy. More studies are necessary to confirm results. Cognitive Rehabilitation (CPG 270) Page 16 of 34 Wang et al. (2022) performed a systematic review to re- assess the efficacy of cognitive intervention for the patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cognitive intervention includes cognitive stimulation, cognitive training, and cognitive rehabilitation. Twenty studies (2012 participants) were eventually included. For global cognitive function, the combined mean difference (MD) in eight studies was 1.67 for the short term. The pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) of six RCTs was 1.61 for the medium term. The pooled SMD of seven studies was 0.79 for the long term. Cognitive training m ay show obvious improvements in global cognitive function whether after short, medium, or long- term interventions. However, the positive effect of the intervention on general cognitive function did not seem to persist after intervention ended. There is sti ll a lack of reliable and consistent conclusions relevant to the effect of cognitive stimulation and cognitive rehabilitation on observed outcomes, cognitive training for memory or other non- cognitive outcomes. Schizophrenia: Eack et al. (2010) evaluated the one -year durability of the effects of cognitive enhancement therapy on functional outcomes in patients with early schizophrenia (n=28) or schizoaffective disorder (n=20). Functional outcome was measured using the Social Adjustm ent Scale -II (SAS- II) and the Major Role Adjustment Inventory (MRA). Patients were randomized to receive cognitive enhancement therapy (CET) or an Enriched Supportive Therapy (EST) control. CET consisted of 60 hours of computer -based training in attention, memory, and problem -solving, integrated with 45 1.5 hour social -cognitive group therapy sessions. EST is a personalized, individual approach including illness management and psychoeducation. Participants met individually with a clinician to learn about sc hizophrenia, effects of stress and how to develop and apply healthy coping strategies. Significant differences in effects favoring CET on overall social adjusted persisted at one- year follow -up and no significant decreases in adjustment were observed in CE T patients during the follow -up period. Patients treated with EST showed a slight but significant level of continued improvement in overall adjustment at one year post -treatment. Maintenance of CET effects was found on social functioning in relationships o utside the household and participation in social leisure activities, as well as on major role adjustment and overall ratings of global functioning. The authors concluded that the beneficial effects of CET on functional outcome in early schizophrenia can be maintained a year after completion of treatment, and that CET has the potential of a lasting impact on the early trajectory of the disease. The authors acknowledged limitations of the study, including the lack of durability data on cognition, as well as t he use of non- blinded raters. McGurk et al. (2007) conducted a meta -analysis of 26 randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effects of cognitive remediation on cognitive performance, symptoms and psychosocial functioning in 1,151 patients with schizophrenia. The authors reported a medium effect size for cognitive performance (0.41), a slightly smaller effect size for psychosocial functioning (0.36), and a small effect size for symptoms (0.28). According to the authors, the impact of cognitive remediation on function was moderated by several factors including the addition of adjunctive psychiatric rehabilitation, cognitive training method, and patient age. They also noted there was a lack of data regarding long term effects as only six studies examin ed if results were maintained at a post treatment follow -up (average of eight months). The authors concluded that cognitive remediation may have a moderate effect on cognitive performance and when combined with psychiatric rehabilitation, may improve funct ional outcomes. Retention of benefit beyond eight months was not explored. Wykes et al. (2007b) conducted a single -blind randomized controlled trial of 40 young early onset patients with schizophrenia to evaluate the efficacy of cognitive remediation the rapy (CRT) in alleviating cognitive deficits compared to treatment as usual. Twenty -one patients received CRT and 19 received standard care. Primary outcome measures included: cognitive flexibility (measured on the Wisconsin Cars Sort Test [WCST]), memory (measured on Digit Span), planning (measured on the Modified Six Elements Test). Secondary outcomes included: symptoms, social contacts and self -esteem. Assessments took place at baseline, post -treatment (week 14) and follow -up (week 28). The only measure that reached statistical significance when compare to the standard care group was the WCST scores (p = 0.04). The authors stated that larger trials that evaluate the long- term maintenance of the effects of CRT are warranted. Wykes et al. (2007a) conducted a randomized controlled trial to evaluate if cognitive remediation improved cognition in people with schizophrenia. Eighty -five participants with schizophrenia and cognitive difficulties were randomized to 40 sessions of cognitive remediation (n=43) or t reatment as usual (n=42). Outcome measures included working memory, cognitive flexibility, and planning. Evaluations took place at 1, 14, and 40 weeks. For working memory, 21 in the therapy group and 18 in the control group had abnormal working memory scor es at baseline. After the intervention, the authors reported a significant advantage to the therapy group at the 14- week post-therapy assessment (p=0.037), but at the time of the 40- week follow -up, there was no longer any statistical Cognitive Rehabilitation (CPG 270) Page 17 of 34 significance (p=0.10). There was no difference between the two groups for cognitive flexibility, and there was no statistically significant difference at any point in time for planning. The authors noted that there was a significant group by medication interaction, suggesting t hat medications may hinder or enhance the effects of cognitive remediation. Methodological considerations, according to the authors, included: some improvement may have been due to increased social interaction, medications may have affected the outcomes, blinding was not maintained, and the sample size was small. Although most of the improvements did not obtain statistical significance, the authors stated that cognitive improvement was noted in many areas. Velligan et al. (2006) conducted a literature rev iew to examine research findings on the eight evidence- based approaches to cognitive rehabilitation, as listed in the 2005 Training Grid Outlining Best Practices for Recovery and Improved Outcomes for People with Serious Mental Illness, developed by the Am erican Psychological Association Committee for the Advancement of Professional Practice, for patients with schizophrenia. The eight approaches included: attention process training, integrated psychological therapy, cognitive enhancement therapy, neurocogni tive enhancement therapy, cognitive remediation therapy, the neuropsychological educational approach to remediation, errorless learning approaches, and attention shaping. According to the authors, the studies that were included varied considerably in areas such as criteria for study inclusion, the conceptual organization of studies, and interpretation of findings. The authors stated that few approaches had more than three data- based studies supporting their efficacy in schizophrenia and that there are no agreed upon guidelines for levels of intensity or duration of training. The authors concluded that the findings of this review were not uniformly positive but encouraging, which is what they would expect at this stage of cognitive rehabilitation development. Multiple Sclerosis: Rosti -Otaj\u00e4rvi and H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen (2014) addressed neuropsychological rehabilitation for multiple sclerosis in a Cochrane review. The aim of this review was to evaluate the effects of cognitive (neuropsychological) rehabilitation in MS through consideration of the effects of rehabilitation on cognitive test performance and everyday cognitive performance, as well as on depression, fatigue, personality/behavior disturbances, anxiety and quality of life. Twenty relevant studies comprising a total of 986 participants (966 MS participants and 20 healthy controls) were identified and included in this review. Low -level evidence was found that neuropsychological rehabilitation reduces cognitive symptoms in MS. Cognitive training was found to improve memory span and working memory. Cognitive training combined with other neuropsychological rehabilitation methods was found to improve attention, immediate verbal memory and delayed memory. However, small sample sizes and some methodological weaknesses reduce the rating of the evidence to a low -level. And there was no evidence of an effect of neuropsychological rehabilitation on emotional functions. In conclusion, this review found low -level evidence for positive effects of neuropsychological rehabilitation in MS. The interventions and outcome measures included in the review were heterogeneous, which limited the comparability of the studies. New trials may therefore change the strength and direction of the evidence. Messinis et al. (2017) studied the efficacy of a computer -assisted CR intervention in relapsing -remitting MS (RRMS) patients. Fifty -eight clinicall y stable RRMS patients with mild to moderate cognitive impairment and relatively low disability status were randomized to receive either computer assisted (RehaCom) functional cognitive training with an emphasis on episodic memory, information processing speed/attention, and executive functions for 10 weeks or standard clinical care. Only the intervention group showed significant improvements in verbal and visuospatial episodic memory, processing speed/attention, and executive functioning from pre - to post -assessment. Also, treated patients rated the intervention positively and were more confident about their cognitive abilities following treatment. Mani et al. (2018) investigated the efficacy of group compensatory cognitive rehabilitation (CR) in patients with MS -related cognitive impairment. CR intervention consisted of eight 2 -hour sessions of comprehensive group CR over a 4 -week period that focused on improvement of memory, attention, and executive function. As placebo, the control group received the sam e number of non- therapeutic group sessions. Assessment of cognitive function was performed before intervention (pretest), at the end of intervention (post -test), and 3 months later (follow -up). Results demonstrated significantly higher scores in the CR group for memory and executive function. Authors concluded that this study supported the efficacy of group CR in the improvement of cognitive function in patients with MS. Mousavi et al. (2018) evaluated the effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation on ever yday memory in multiple sclerosis patients. A total of 60 multiple sclerosis patients with cognitive impairment were randomly assigned to three groups, experimental, placebo and control. The results indicated that a Cognitive Rehabilitation (CPG 270) Page 18 of 34 cognitive rehabilitation program had a positive effect on the everyday memory of patients in the experimental group post -intervention. However, there was no significant effect of intervention 5 weeks post-intervention. Authors concluded that this study demonstrated that cognitive rehabilitation had a positive effect on the everyday function of the multiple sclerosis patients. However, the effect did not last, and that everyday memory function returned to its pre -intervention level. Rilo et al. (2018) aimed to determine the efficacy of the integrative group- based cognitive rehabilitation program, REHACOP, on improving cognitive functions in multiple sclerosis (MS). Forty -two MS patients were randomized to the treatment program or waiting list control condition. The REHACOP group received cognitive rehabilitation in group format for three months focused on attention, processing speed, learning and memory, language, executive functioning, and social cognition. Patients receiving REHACOP showed improvements in several cognitive domains. Authors suggest ed that this study provided initial evidence for integrative group -based cognitive rehabilitation efficacy in MS patients through the implementation of the REHACOP cognitive rehabilitation program. Stuifbergen et al. (2018) sought to determine the effect iveness of a novel computer -assisted cognitive rehabilitation intervention MAPSS- MS (Memory, Attention, Problem Solving Skills in MS) in a multi -site trial with persons with MS. Persons with MS with cognitive concerns were randomly assigned to either the 8 -week MAPSS- MS intervention or usual care plus freely available computer games. Results demonstrated that both groups improved significantly on all outcome measures. The intervention group outperformed the comparison group on all measures, and there were s tatistically significant differences on selected measures. Dardiotis et al. (2018) aim to quantitatively investigate the effect of computer - based cognitive rehabilitation on the neuropsychological performance of patients with MS. In total, 9 studies fulfil led the criteria for inclusion. Authors concluded that computer -based cognitive training was found to improve the performance in the memory domain of MS patients compared to control interventions. Goverover et al. (2018) updated the clinical recommendation s for cognitive rehabilitation of people with multiple sclerosis (MS) in a systematic review. Fifty -nine articles were selected for inclusion after initial screening. Forty studies were fully reviewed and evaluated. Authors concluded that substantial progr ess has been made since the previous review regarding the identification of effective treatments for cognitive impairments in persons with MS. However, more research is required with better methodology to support this therapy for patients with MS. Brochet et al. (2021) reviewed all blinded RCTs on CR in MS published since 2013. After the exclusion of some papers not specifically focused on CR, a final list of 26 studies was established. The papers belong to three main categories: individual specific rehabi litation (8studies), group rehabilitation (4 studies), and computerized training (CT) (14 studies), while one study combined group rehabilitation and CT. Among the individual rehabilitation studies, 5 were devoted to memory, and most of the 19 other select ed studies were about several cognitive domains. Most of the studies mainly concerned RRMS patients, except for 2 studies that were carried out exclusively in progressive forms. Despite the methodological limitations of some studies and the great heterogeneity of the protocols, the results are generally in favor of the efficacy of CR in neuropsychological tests. Authors concluded that recent blinded RCTs about CR in MS show promising results. Chen et al. (2021) provided a brief overview of cognitive rehabil itation in MS. There is limited evidence that disease -modifying therapies are effective in treating cognitive dysfunction. Cognitive rehabilitation is a promising approach to treat cognitive dysfunction in MS, gaining empirical support over the last 10 years. Overall, there is evidence that cognitive rehabilitation programs (either restorative or compensatory) are efficacious in treating MS - related cognitive dysfunction. Clinicians should consider this low -cost, low -risk, yet effective treatment approach for their patients. Longley (2022) outlined the evidence supporting cognitive rehabilitation in MS. More intensive compensatory and restorative cognitive rehabilitation interventions can be effective in MS. Choosing an intervention will depend on the patients' goals, which may range from specific everyday activity/participation goals to preserving existing cognitive functioning by building up cognitive reserve or delaying further cognitive decline by slowing the underlying neurobiological changes. Both compensatory and restorative forms of cognitive rehabilitation interventions can improve a patient's everyday cognitive functioning, quality of life, mood and/or coping with cognitive impairments in daily life, not just improve their performance on cognitive tests. General practitioners can best assist their patients by understanding the treatment options and facilitating their patients' access to the most appropriate cognitive rehabilitation services available. Cognitive Rehabilitation (CPG 270) Page 19 of 34 Nauta et al. (2023) investigated the effectivenes s of cognitive rehabilitation therapy (CRT) and mindfulness - based cognitive therapy (MBCT) on patient -reported cognitive complaints in MS. In this randomized -controlled trial, MS patients with cognitive complaints completed questionnaires and underwent neuropsychological assessments at baseline, post -treatment and 6- month follow -up. Patient -reported cognitive complaints were primarily investigated. Secondary outcomes included personalized cognitive goals and objective cognitive function. CRT and MBCT were c ompared to enhanced treatment as usual (ETAU). Patients were randomized into CRT (n = 37), MBCT (n = 36) or ETAU (n = 37), of whom 100 completed the study. Both CRT and MBCT positively affected patient -reported cognitive complaints compared to ETAU at post -treatment (p<.05), but not 6 months later. At 6 -month follow -up, CRT had a positive effect on personalized cognitive goals (p=.028) and MBCT on processing speed (p=.027). Patients with less cognitive complaints at baseline benefited more from CRT on the C ognitive Failures Questionnaire (i.e. primary outcome measuring cognitive complaints) at post - treatment (p=.012- .040), and those with better processing speed at baseline benefited more from MBCT (p=.016). Authors concluded that both CRT and MBCT alleviated cognitive complaints in MS patients immediately after treatment completion, but these benefits did not persist. In the long term, CRT showed benefits on personalized cognitive goals and MBCT on processing speed. These results thereby provide insight in the specific contributions of available cognitive treatments for MS patients. Parkinson's Disease D\u00edez-Cirarda et al. (2018) performed a critical review to present up -to-date neurorehabilitation effects of cognitive rehabilitation in Parkinson's Disease (PD ), with special emphasis on the efficacy on cognition, quality of life aspects, brain changes, and the longitudinal maintenance of these changes. Thirteen studies were reviewed, including 6 randomized controlled trials for the efficacy on cognition, 2 randomized controlled trials regarding the brain changes after cognitive training, and 5 studies which evaluated the long -term effects of cognitive treatments. Authors concluded that cognitive rehabilitation programs have demonstrated to be effective on improv ing cognitive functions, but more research is needed focusing on the efficacy on improving behavioral aspects and producing brain changes in patients with PD. Moreover, authors state there is a need of randomized controlled trials with long- term follow -up periods. Alzahrani and Venneri (2018) reviewed the existing literature on the efficacy of cognitive rehabilitation in PD. Authors identified 15 articles that examined the effects of cognitive rehabilitation in PD and met inclusion criteria. The main outcom es of this review indicated that, although previous studies used different CR methodologies, all studies reported cognitive improvements on at least 1 cognitive domain. Additionally, the most frequent cognitive domains showing improvements were executive f unctions and attention. The authors concluded that this review reported the outcomes of studies that examined the effectiveness of CR in PD. It also pointed out the drawbacks of the studies indicating the limited availability of follow -up data on the long -term effects of CR. The review also high- lighted the fact that some of the studies did not include a PD group who did not undergo training. Thus, these researchers noted that there is a need for longitudinal studies to examine the potential long- term b enefits of cognitive training. In addition, future investigations should determine if any disease characteristics such as disease stage, degree of cognitive impairment and/or the dominant side (right/left) or specific motor symptoms (rigidity/tremor) infl uence treatment efficacy. Svaerke et al. (2020) evaluated effects of computer -based cognitive rehabilitation (CBCR) on working memory (WM) in patients with PD. Only six studies were included despite broad inclusion criteria. Study results were heterogeneous, and the risk of bias in study methodology was either unclear or high. Two studies were eligible for meta- analysis. A meta -analysis was not performed, because these studies used different measures of WM which were not rated as equally valid and reliable. Authors concluded that the existing literature is sparse and provides insufficient evidence to conclude if CBCR benefits WM in PD patients. Sanchez -Luengos et al. (2021) performed a systematic review and meta- analysis regarding the effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation in non- demented PD patients. Twelve articles were selected according to PRISMA guidelines. The systematic review showed that attention, w orking memory, verbal memory, executive functions and processing speed were the most frequently improved domains. Meta- analysis results showed moderate effects on global cognitive status and working memory; small significant effects on verbal memory, overall cognitive functions and executive functions; small non -significant effects on attention, visual memory, verbal fluency and processing speed; and no effect on visuospatial and visuoconstructive abilities. Depressive symptoms showed small effect and quali ty of life showed no effect. A meta- regression was performed to examine moderating variables of overall cognitive function effects, although moderators did not explain the heterogeneity of the improvement after cognitive rehabilitation. The findings sugges t that cognitive rehabilitation may be beneficial in improving cognition in non- demented PD patients, although further studies are needed to obtain more robust effects. Cognitive Rehabilitation (CPG 270) Page 20 of 34 Gavelin et al. (2022) aimed to investigate the efficacy of Computerized cognitive trai ning CCT on cognitive, psychosocial and daily function, and assess potential effect moderators in people with PD without dementia. Randomized controlled trials of CCT were included in multivariate meta- analyses and meta -regressions. Seventeen studies (16 t rials) encompassing 679 participants were included. The pooled effect of CCT relative to control was small and statistically significant for overall cognitive function. There was robust evidence for benefit on clinical measures of global cognition across 10 trials, especially in PD with mild cognitive impairment (PD - MCI), as well as on individual cognitive domains. Greater CCT dose and PD -MCI population were associated with larger effect sizes, but no statistically significant differences were found between subgroups. There was no significant difference in the efficacy of home- based compared to supervised training. Authors findings suggest that CCT is associated with cognitive benefits in PD, including when delivered remotely. Larger, well -powered trials are warranted to examine what specific CCT regimens are most likely to promote cognitive and everyday functioning in the long- term. Brain Tumors Weyer -Jamora et al. (2021) reviewed the effectiveness of post -acute cognitive rehabilitation across the continuum of care for adult patients with a brain tumor. Most treatment focus has been on acute rehabilitation, but emerging evidence supports outpatient and post -acute settings. The cognitive impairments including processing speed, attention, memory, and executiv e function resulted in positive outcomes with a multidisciplinary approach to treatment. Ongoing development of cognitive screenings and planning during the medical course of care are suggested to improve cognitive rehabilitation outcomes and supported in the clinical practice of treatment of this population. Although additional research is warranted to differentiate the specific outcomes resulting from cognitive rehabilitation for varying tumor grades and stages, authors conclude that the multidisciplinar y approach and cognitive intervention was beneficial for cognitive outcomes in patients diagnosed with a brain tumor across programs. Additional Conditions: Cognitive rehabilitation has been proposed for numerous other conditions that cause, or may cause, impaired cognitive function, including: cerebral palsy attention deficit disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder pervasive developmental disorders, including autism learning disabilities developmental delay There is insufficient evidence in the published medical literature to support the use of cognitive rehabilitation for these conditions. The role of cognitive rehabilitation for the treatment of conditions other than moderate to severe traumatic brain injur y or stroke/cerebral infarction has not been established. Coma Stimulation The American Academy of Neurology in a 1995 summary statement (reaffirmed 2006), \"Practice Parameters: Assessment and Management of Patients in the Persistent Vegetative State,\" makes no reference to sensory stimulation as a treatment modality. Karma and Rawat (2006) conducted a randomized controlled trial of 60 patients to determine the efficacy and benefits of early stimulation therapy in pediatric patients who were in a coma. P atients were randomized to the study group, who received stimulation to each of the six senses five times a day for two weeks (n=30) or to the control group, who received no stimulation (n=30). The level of consciousness was measured using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and AVPU scale prior to and after stimulation therapy. The authors reported statistically significant improvement in coma in the treatment group compared to the control group, as measured by GCS and AVPU. The authors reported that when the sti mulation started less than 15 days from onset of coma, the results were better than when the stimulation was initiated after 15 days from onset. The authors concluded that stimulation therapy can reduce the duration for children in non-traumatic coma, but acknowledged the small sample size and short duration of follow -up as limitations of the study. A Cochrane systematic review (Lombardi, et al., 2002) was conducted to assess the effectiveness of sensory stimulation programs in patients in a coma or veget ative state. The Cochrane review evaluated randomized controlled trials and nonrandomized controlled clinical trials comparing any type of stimulation programs to standard rehabilitation in patients in a coma or vegetative state. Three studies (one randomi zed controlled trial Cognitive Rehabilitation (CPG 270) Page 21 of 34 [Johnson, 1993] and two nonrandomized controlled trials [Kater, 1989; Mitchell, 1990]) with 68 traumatic brain- injured patients in total, met the inclusion criteria. The overall methodological quality was poor, and the studies differed widely in terms of study design and conduct. Also, due to the diversity in reporting of outcome measures, a quantitative meta- analysis was not possible. None of the three studies in the Cochrane review provided useful and valid results on outcomes of clinical relevance for coma patients. The Cochrane researchers concluded that there is no reliable evidence to support or rule out the effectiveness of multisensory programs in patients in a coma or vegetative state. The researchers further stated that the need to improve knowledge in this field and the lack of effective treatments indicates that treatment interventions based on sensory stimulation should be provided only in the context of well -designed, adequately sized, randomized controlled trials. The AOTA published occupational therapy practice guidelines for adults with traumatic brain injury (Wheeler, et al., 2016). The recommendations for individuals in a coma or persistent vegetative state include: Interventions to Improve Arousal and Alertness of People in a Coma or Persistent Vegetative State Multimodal sensory stimulation to improve arousal and enhance clinical outcomes (A) Auditory stimulation, especially when completed in a familiar voice, to increase arousal in the short term (B) Increased complexity, rather than intensity, of stimulation to increase intervention effectiveness (C) Median nerve stimulation to improve arousal and alertness (I) Strength of Recommendation A-There is strong evidence that occupational therapy practition ers should routinely provide the intervention to eligible clients. Good evidence was found that the intervention improves important outcomes and concludes that benefits substantially outweigh harm. B-There is moderate evidence that occupational therapy practitioners should routinely provide the intervention to eligible clients. There is high certainty that the net benefit is moderate, or there is moderate certainty that the net benefit is moderate to substantial. C-There is weak evidence that the interventi on can improve outcomes. It is recommended that the intervention be provided selectively on the basis of professional judgement and patient preferences. There is at least moderate certainty that the net benefit is small. I-There is insufficient evidence to determine whether or not occupational therapy practitioners should be routinely providing the intervention. Evidence that the intervention is effective is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting and the balance of benefits and harm cannot be determined. Note: Criteria for level of evidence and recommendations (A, B, C, I, D) are based on standard language from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (2012). Suggested recommendations are based on the available evidence and content experts' clinical expert ise regarding the value of using it. Li et al. (2021) performed a literature review on the progress of sensory stimulation (SS) to enhance coma arousal after traumatic brain injury. They included all original studies published in English with patients presenting severe disorders of consciousness due to traumatic brain injury who had received SS and whose behavioral/neural responses had been measured. Authors compared data on ten selected studies and analyzed the SS effects in comatose patient outcomes aft er TBI. They concluded that the literature suggests the SS program improves coma arousal after TBI. However, high- quality clinical trials are needed to establish standard SS protocols. Weaver et al. (2022) People examined the effectiveness of interventions to improve arousal and awareness of people with disorders of consciousness (DoC) following a TBI. Twenty -seven studies were included and grouped thematically. Multimodal sensory stimulation, familiar voices telling structured stories, and transcranial direct current stimulation had a moderate level of evidence. Multimodal sensory stimulation had the strongest evidence in support of its use in clinical practice.
