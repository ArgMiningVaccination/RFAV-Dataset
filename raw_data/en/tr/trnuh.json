VIII Preface to the 2nd revised edition of the S3 Guidelines \"Diagnosis and Treatment of Eating Disorders\"1 Stephan Herpertz The eating disorders anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN), as well as binge eating disorder (BED), OSFED ( other specified feeding or eating disorder) and ARFID (avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder) , the latter two of which were introduced in 2013 as new eating disorder categories in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM -5; American Psychiatric Association, APA 2013), are especially significant in the first half of life. The incidence of both AN (Smink et al., 2012; Steinhausen & Jensen, BN (Currin et al., 2005; Zerwas et al., 2015) has remained relatively stable in the last few decades, although studies in children and adolescents indicate a rise of AN i n this age group (Smink et al. 2012; Favaro et al. 2009; Steinhausen and Jensen 2015). Together, AN and BN were categorized as the twelfth leading cause of disability -adjusted life years (DALYs) among 15-19-year-old females in countries with a high gross d omestic product, out of over 300 physical and mental illnesses (Hoek 2016). The treatment outcomes for eating disorders, especially AN and BN, are not satisfactory. For instance, in the treatment of AN, recovery rates of just under 50% over the lifetime a re achieved (although considerably higher among adolescents). The number of patients in remission increases with the length of follow -up periods, but so too does the death rate, which amounts to approximately 6.0% in the first 10 years after diagnosis (Arc elus et al. 2011; Hoang et al. 2014). Guidelines - historical overview In the year 2000, the German Association for Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics (DGPPN) published a guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of eating disorders in Germany for the first time (Fichter et al. 2000). This was followed the same year by a guideline from the German Society of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Psychosomatics and Psychotherapy (DGKJP; Herpertz -Dahlmann et al. 2000). Both guidelines corresponded to de velopment stage 1, i.e. , they were developed by expert groups from the respective professional societies with the aim of making recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of eating disorders, which had previously been approved by the board of the resp ective professional societies. In the autumn of 2003, a conference of members of the German Society for Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy (DGPM) decided to develop an evidence -based guideline for eating disorders in Germany according to development stage 3. This led, in the spring of 2004, to the first meeting of a group of interested physicians and psychologists in Berlin, with the aim of forming a working group to develop an evidence -based guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of eating disorde rs in Germany. 1 Text passages are adopted from the German -language article: Herpertz S. & IX The working group was represented by five professional societies DGKJP, Section for Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy of the German Psychological Society (DGPs), DGPM, DGPPN, and the German College o f Psychosomatic Medicine (DKPM) . The individual members of the working group were authorized by their respective societies to act as elected representatives for the development of the scientific guidelines for the Association of the Scientific Medical Societies in Germany (AWMF) (http://www.a wmf.org/leitlinien/aktuelle -leitlinien.html). In 2010, the S3 guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of eating disorders was made available online by the AWMF (Register -No. 051/026; http://www.awmf.org/leitlinien/detail/ll/051 - 026.html); in the same ye ar, it was also published in book format (Herpertz et al. 2011). With the aim of communicating the contents of the evidence -based guideline to patients and their families, in 2015, the patient guideline was published both online and in book form, this time under the auspices of the German Society for Eating Disorders (DGESS ; Zeeck & Herpertz 2015). In addition to reformulating the scientific guideline to be comprehensible for laypersons, the patient guideline also addresses care structures and supports comm unication with professional care providers in the health care system, from family doctors to medical or psychologic al (child and adolescent) therapists. With regard to the revision of the S3 guideline, i.e. , its second edition, the elected representative s of the individual professional societies, as well as patient spokespersons, took part in a two -day consensus conference in Essen on the 23rd and 24th of November, 2017 led by the AWMF. The thematic structure of the guideline broadly corresponds to the fi rst edition and covers chapters on epidemiology, diagnostics, the therapeutic relationship, AN, BN, BED, physical sequelae, and methodology. In line with the DSM -5 (APA, 2013), two new eating disorder categories have been added: \"other specified feeding or eating disorder\" (OSFED), which also \"night eating syndrome\", and \"avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder\" (ARFID), together with replace the old category of \"eating disorders not otherwise specified\" (EDNOS). With regard to therapy studies on AN, BN, and BED, meta -analyses were performed based on a systematic literature search and assignment of pre -determined quality criteria (evidence level 1). The problem of evidence The development of guidelines is oriented to the principles of evidence -based medicine. However, evaluating the efficacy of psychotherapy, which is the treatment method of choice for eating disorders, according to the principles seen as standard in somatic medicine is not a straightforward undertaking. Hermeneutics (ancient Gre ek hermeneuein: \"explain\", \"interpret\", \"translate\") and thus processes of construction and reconstruction, are attributed with great importance in psychotherapy, in contrast to somatic medicine. The concept of understanding in the sense of an inner experience, which is relevant in psychotherapy and dates back to Dilthey (1974), broadly lacks scientific objectiv ity and particularly falls short regarding the criterion of testability, which is essential in the natural sciences. The diagnostic and therapeutic concepts in psychotherapy are incumbent upon two fundamentally different models. Psychotherapy is based on t he \"psychological model\", which is distinguished by the following characteristics: X Tendency to emphasize psychological and social factors Tendency for dimensional thinking Tendency to view disorders as an extreme of normal functioning Tendency to prioritize psychologically grounded interventions, and finally Emphasis on the importance of the therapist as a person and on the therapeutic relationship By contrast, the \"medical model\", which is built on research from the natural sciences, emphasizes b iological factors in the etiology and genesis of a disease. This is linked to a categorical thinking and a view of disorders as clearly delimitable pathological states - ideally against the background of transparent causalities. Moreover, the results of ps ychotherapy research increasingly raise the question of whether individual interventions are the decisive \"active ingredients\" (Lambert 1992, Grawe et al. 1994, Lambert and Ogles 2004; Lambert and Barley 2002). For instance, the specific technique (psychot herapeutic approach) only accounts for 15 -20% of all influencing factors with respect to the treatment outcome (Lambert 1992). The outcome of therapy is influenced much more strongly by, above all, patient variables (such as attractiveness, socioeconomic s tatus, expectations regarding the treatment, degree of defensiveness, demographic characteristics, intelligence, severity of mental disorder, social support etc.). Besides the therapist, however, so -called \"general influencing factors\" found in all psychot herapeutic approaches are important, such as the quality of the therapeutic working relationship or the imparting of hope. Against this background, the following questions need to be given clearly greater consideration in the future: Which approach is most helpful for which patients, with which characteristics (psychological, social and biological -genetic), and in which stage of their illness? And with which therapist? As yet, we are still unable to answer these questions. In addition to psychotherapy, pha rmacotherapy plays a major role in the treatment of mental disorders. Specifically for the four eating disorder categories, its relevance has been determined in meta -analyses, especially in comparison to the outcomes of psychotherapy. The outpatient care of patients with eating disorders in Germany does not only take place in the form of individual and group psychotherapy according to the German directives for psychotherapy. Both guided and non -guided structured self -help manuals, the majority of which are based on cognitive -behavioral therapy, are increasingly employed to treat patients with eating disorders. The efficiency of such manuals also needs to be critically examined in order to derive recommendations from them. Evidence -based guidelines are the result of a systematic process of development, and constitute both scientific (empirical) and practice -oriented recommendations for action. They pursue the objective of supporting care providers and patients within the health care system in making decision s regarding questions of diagnostics and treatment. Accordingly, guidelines serve the XI purpose of quality development within the health care system. Guidelines are characterized by practical recommendations that are the result of a thorough scientific and t hus transparent analysis of the current state of the art. At the same time, however, they also contain evaluations of study results in terms of their clinical relevance and applicability (Muche -Borowski und Kopp 2011; Qaseem et al. 2012). The German Assoc iation of the Scientific Medical Societies (AWMF) speaks of \"corridors for action and decision -making\", within which the diagnostics and especially the therapy of the individual patient operate, but also within which the patient's preferences are determine d and need to be considered in the framework of participatory decision -making. With regard to the quality development of diagnosis and treatment of eating disorders, we hope that with these guidelines, and especially the second, revised edition, we have ma de a meaningful contribution which will help to improve the successful recovery and quality of life of our patients with eating disorders.

XIV Special note: Medicine is subject to a perpetual process of development; therefore, all information, especially relating to diagnostic and therapeutic methods, can always only reflect the state of knowledge at the time the guidelines went to print. With respect to the provided recommendations pertaining to therapy , and the selection as well as dosage of medications, the greatest possible care has been taken. Nevertheless, the user is encouraged to consult the package insert and specialist information of the manufacturer for checking purposes, and in the case of dou bt, to consult a specialist. We ask that in the general interest, if questionable discrepancies arise, the user contacts the editorial team. The user retains responsibility for any diagnostic and therapeutic application, medication and dosage. Off-label u se: In the guideline texts and recommendations for medication, reference is made in the respective chapters to the possible use of medications that are not approved for the respective area of indication (off -label use). Such use is only permissible if the following criteria are met: 1. proven efficacy 2. favorable risk -benefit profile 3. lack of alternatives - compassionate use Accordingly, off -label use is only permissible for illnesses when there is no treatment alternative. Based on the current state of scientific knowledge, there must be a reasonable prospect of treatment success. Furthermore, there is also a specific duty to inform the patient, pointing out the fact of off -label use and the resulting liability consequences. A shared decision - making is necessary. Use of pronouns: Predominantly women suffer from AN and BN. Therefore, the members of the guideline working group decided to use the female pronoun throughout, although a large number of men are also affected by BED. Each subchapter ends with treatment recommendations, which are oriented to the respective levels of evidence according to the Oxford Centre of Evidence Based Medicine (2001). The strength of the treatment recommendation is divided into A (\"We recommend\"), B (\"We (\"Good Clinical Practice\"). Levels of evidence, Oxford Centre of Evidence Based Medicine (2001) Level Studies on therapy / prevention / etiology 1a 1b 1c Systematic review of randomized controlled trials RCT (with narrow confidence interval) All-or-none principle 2a 2b 2c Systematic review of well -planned cohort studies One well -planned cohort study or one RCT of lower quality Outcome studies, ecological studies 3a 3b Systematic review of case -control studies One case -control study 4 Case series or poor -quality cohort/case -control studies 5 Expert opinion without explicit appraisal of the evidence or based on physiological models / laboratory research XV Harbor, R., Miller, J. (2001) A new system for grading recommendations in evidence based guidelines BMJ . 323(7308):334 -336 Wording of recommendations Recommendations in this guideline were classified as A\" (very strong recommendation), B\" (strong recommentation), O\" (weak recommendation) and GCP (good clinical practice). Recommendations were based on the available empirical evidence (see methods section), and could be up - or downgraded after discussion in the expert team according to their clinical relevance, the risk -benefit -ratio, ethical and economic considerations, practicability in everyday life / in different areas of care and the applicability in the German healthcar e system. The wording in the German guideline used soll\" for a very strong recommendation, sollte\" for a strong recommendation, and kann erwogen werden\" (as an example) for weak recommentations. It proved to be difficult to translate these terms adequat ely into English. Therefore, the English wording that was used is explained in more detail: If there is a legal duty to apply a recommendation or if there might be serious consequences of not following the guideline, the recommendation was formulated using must \" or has to be [done/conducted]\". If there is a very strong recommendation due to good empirical evidence or high clinical relevance, should be offered \" or should be provided \" was used. If the empirical evidence and clinical relevance is less stro ng, but a recommendation should be seriously considered, weighing up benefits and harms, it was formulated with the wording should be considered \". If a recommendation is weak, it was formulated with the wording it is recommended \" or it can be justified \". Here, weighing up benefits and harms is necessary in each individual case. 1 Contents I.

New developments and explanation of terms Since the publication of the first AWMF S3 Guideline \"Diagnosis and treatment of eating disorders\", the new US psychiatric guidelines have been published in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM -5; German edition 2015). In the DSM -5, (childhood) feeding disorders are subsumed in one area in the chapter \"Feeding and Eating Disorders\". The DSM -5 manual contains diagnostic criteria for the following disorders: pica, rumination disorder, avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (all th ree of which predominantly occur in childhood), as well as anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN) and binge eating disorder (BED). The diagnostic criteria, for instance for AN, BN, and BED, have also changed - they have become somewhat broader. This h as a direct influence in terms of a moderate rise in incidence and prevalence rates. The change in the diagnostic criteria from the DSM -IV to the DSM -5 is also relevant for other reasons: Most scientific works on incidences and frequency of mental disorder s were conducted on the basis of the DSM criteria. In Germany, on the other hand, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) criteria are relevant both clinically and for the health and pension insurance companies. Terminology: In order to underst and the statements made in epidemiological studies, several terms are important. One important term is the population about which a statement is to be made. A population needs to be defined very precisely, for example all citizens in Germany who are eligib le to vote, or all adults who have their primary residence in a particular district on a given day. Such populations can be specified even further, e.g. all adult women aged 40 - 49 years who have their primary residence in a particular district on a given d ay. As it is often not possible in scientific investigations to capture a whole population using questionnaires or interviews, the concept of the representative sample was developed. According to this concept, parts of the population can be captured, e.g. one in ten or a random sample, so that the sample drawn from the population is representative of this population. For instance, in the area of eating disorders, there are studies which examined students in a grammar school; the findings of such studies wou ld not be representative of all young people of that age, as a selection occurred. Once we have established a sample from a clearly defined population, it is necessary within a scientific study to capture the relevant characteristics of interest in a relia ble and valid manner. For instance, it is necessary to examine persons with anorexia nervosa in the sample and to assess the relevant diagnostic criteria using a questionnaire or an interview conducted by people who are trained in administering the employe d instruments ( case identification ). Other important terms within epidemiology are incidence, prevalence and mortality rates. Incidence means the number of new cases of a particular disease in the population in a specified period of time. The incidence rate was standardized as the number of new cases of a disease per 100 000 people in the population per year. Incidence and prevalence rates, and the changes 7 therein over time, also help to draw conclusions about the etiology of a disease. Prevalence refers to the frequency of a disease (e.g. of anorexia) in the population. Based on the period of time to which a prevalence rate occurs, one speaks of point prevalence (today) period prevalence (e.g. one year) or lifetime prevalence (prevalence over the total n umber of years lived so far). Prevalence rates are also important for planning within the health care system. Anorexia is the mental illness with the highest mortality rate in the young adult years (Fichter & Quadflieg, 2016). Mortality rates are considera bly higher for anorexia than for schizophrenia or depression. BN and BED have substantially lower mortality rates than anorexia. The \"crude\" mortality rate means the percentage of deceased persons in the examined sample or population. To draw any meaning f rom statements about mortality, the number of observed deaths among persons with a particular disease has to be related to the expected death rate in the comparison population (same gender, same age). In that case, one speaks of the standardized mortality ratio (SMR). When considering incidence, prevalence, and mortality rates over time, the problem arises that different diagnostic criteria were used over time and the respective rates are consequently not directly comparable. Questions which laypeople are prone to ask (\"Are eating disorders on the rise?\") are thus often quite difficult to answer on an epidemiological -scientific basis. BN was described for the first time by Russell in 1979 and was included in the diagnostic criteria of the DSM -III in 1980, meaning that there are no epidemiological studies on BN prior to this time. Similarly, BED was first defined in the DSM -IV in 1994. 1. There are different approaches to achieve as representative a sample as possible. The arguably \"cleanest\" way is to draw a representative population sample from the residents' registry, which is easily possible in Scandinavian countries and in Germany because all citizens are obliged to register their place of residence. 2. Assuming that sick persons will at some point seek out a doctor or hospital (which cannot be seen as a given in the case of eating disorders), various case registers have been developed and in some cases maintained over many decades. Based on the statistics of the case register, it is then possible to provide details on the incidence - and prevalence -defined disease. 3. Some countries, such as in Scandinavia, possess outstanding disease statistics which go far beyond pure diagnostic statistics. The advantage here is that all patients are covered who were diagnosed and treated on an outpatient or inpatient basis. However, these registers do not include those sick persons who did not consult a doctor or hospital, which is often the case with eating disorders due to the doctor -averse behavior of a considerable number of sufferers. 4. In some countries, like Great Britain, the health system is structured such that almost all citizens are registered with a \"General Practitioner\" (GP). In many studies from Great Britain, GP registers were used to calculate prevalence and in cidence rates, which are thus relatively informative. 8 2. Incidence In order to determine the incidence of anorexia, case register studies play an important role. Due to the structure of the health care system in Great Britain, British studies with Gen eral Practitioners (GPs; family doctors) show a fairly strong resemblance with the methodology of register studies. In table 1 (in the appendix) as well as figure 1, the incidence rates are mainly presented for cases per year per 100,000 persons in the pop ulation. As such, the figures provided are comparable. The higher the incidence, the greater is the rate of new cases of AN or BN. The surveys on AN by Theander (1970, 1985) reach back to 1931. Over the examined time period from 1931 to 1960, a clear incre ase in treated cases of AN is apparent among women in Southern Sweden. The Monroe County case register in the USA by Jones, Fox, Babigian and Hutton (1980) also shows a corresponding increase in incidence for the 1 970s compared to the 1970s. The same applies for the Zurich case register (Milos et al., 2004). In the Danish case register, the incidence rate was still low in 1970, and then increased substantially in 1980 and 1989. For the archive of medical records of a clinic in Rochester/USA for the period from 1950 to 1989, Lucas, Crowson, O'Fallon and Melton (1999a) also reported a gradual increase in incidence rates for anorexia. The reported data for the years 1935 to 1949 fall outside of this pattern and possibly constitute a methodological artifact. According to Milos e t al. (2004), the incidence of first -time hospitalization due to AN in the Swiss Canton of Zurich rose steadily from 4.0 per 100,000 residents (1956 to 1958) to 16.5 per 100,000 residents (1973 to 1978), before rising less sharply to 19.7 per 100,000 resid ents (1993 to 1995). According to Currin, Schmidt, Treasure and Jick (2005), the incidence rate in England from 1998 to 2000 also remained constant at this level, at 20.8 per 100,000 residents. In a larger Dutch sample of male and female patients under GP care, Van Son, Hoeken, Bartelds, van Furth and Hoek (2006) found an incidence rate of 7.4 for the period from 1985 to 1989 and of 7.7 per 100,000 person years from 1995 to 1999. Keski -Rahkonen et al. (2007) reported on a twin cohort of girls aged from 15 to 19 years, and found a high incidence rate of 270 per 100,000 person years (95% confidence interval =180 -360). This finding was substantially outside of the expected range. Table 1 and figure 1 indicate that the incidence rate of AN has increased since 1930 - and principally in the 1960s - from 0.1 to approx 5.0 per 100,000 persons in the population. In the decades since 1970, the incidence rate of AN has remained relatively stable (Smi nk et al., 2016) - without a further increase. For BN, by contrast, a tendency for an increase can be discerned in Western Europe over the last three decades Scotland case registerNetherlands GP register Netherlands Fig. 1 Change in the annual incidence rate (per 100,000 persons) of anorexia nervosa in Western Europe over the decades (modified from Hoek, 2016) , Sweden (hospital statistics); Northeast Scotland case register; Netherlands; GP register Netherlands There are few available data on the incidence of BN. Currin et al. (2015) reported results over time in women aged between 10 and 39 years. The annual incidence rate rose continuously from 1989 to 1993: the highest annual incidence rate (over 60 per 100,000 inhabitants) occurred in 1996; in the following years it declined substantially. Zerwas et al. (2015) reported an incidence rate for BN in young women of 66.3 per 100,000 residents (national Danish research register). Data on BED and Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (EDNOS) are very limited. 3. Prevalence An overview of selected important studies on the prevalence of AN, BN and BED as well as eating disorder not otherwise specified can be found in table 2. Particularly for AN and BN, the prevalence figures are a great deal higher for women tha n for men. Moreover, there appears to be an issue of selectivity in terms of the treated prevalence, insofar as men with BN and AN are less likely to seek treatment than women. Due to different sampling methods and different assessment instruments, the pre valences in this table are not immediately and directly comparable. 10 3.1. Anorexia nervosa For women with AN, the 12 -month prevalence rate for the risk age between 15 and 35 years lies at approx. 0.4% (DSM -5). Only the aforementioned study by Keski -Rahkone n et al. (2007) in a Finnish twin cohort reported substantially higher lifetime prevalence (2.2%) and incidence rates. 3.2. Bulimia nervosa The 12 -month prevalence for BN in adult women in North America lies at approx. 1.5 % (Hudson, Hiripi, Pope & Kessle r, 2007). In men, the prevalence is around ten times lower. The prevalence of BN among adolescents (e.g. because the age at onset has not yet been reached) is lower than that of adults (Swanson, Crow, Le Grange, Swendsen & Merikangas, 2011; Kessler et al., 2012; Piazza et al., 2016; and in Germany Nagl et al., 2016 and Hammerle, Huss, Ernst & B\u00fcrger, 2016). Overweight in adolescence constitutes a risk factor for BN (Flament et al., 2015). 3.3. Binge eating disorder For BED, the 12 -month prevalence in adult s lies at 1.6% for women and 0.8% for men. Accordingly, the proportion of men is not as vanishingly small compared to many other eating disorders. BED is more frequent among persons who have received treatment for overweight or obesity (Davis, 2015). In No rth America, BED occurs with the same frequency in black and white persons - which is not the case for anorexia and bulimia nervosa. The lifetime prevalence of BED in childhood and adolescence lies at 1.6%; the onset of the disorder was found to lie at a median age of 12.6 years (Swanson et al., 2011). As with BN, prevalence rates of BED also rise with increasing age (Stice, Marti, Shaw & Jaconis, 2009; Allen, Byrne, Oddy & Crosby 2013). In overweight individuals taking part in weight loss programs, the pre valence of BED is increased (Glasofer et al., 2007). Girls are somewhat more frequently affected than boys (Nicholls, Chater & Lask, 2000; Marcus & Kalarchian, 2003). In a study of adolescents taking part in a long -term rehabilitation measure due to extrem e obesity, 57% of the girls and 35% of the boys suffered from binge eating (Ackard, Fulkerson & Neumark -Sztainer, 2007). In investigations which also included children and referred exclusively to inpatient measures, up to a third of children and adolescent s reported binge -eating episodes. Thus, the risk of binge eating is higher in sufferers who require a more intensive (inpatient) treatment. In the framework of a large epidemiological study which examined all five -year-olds born in one particular year, 2% of all participants and 6% of obese children (BMI 90th percentile) showed binge -eating behavior (Lamerz et al., 2005). There are no useable epidemiological results on rumination disorder according to the DSM - 5 (Delaney et al., 2015). 11 In the DSM -5, pica and Avoidant/ Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) are defined as feeding or eating disorders included in the chapter Feeding and Eating Disorders of the DSM - 5 criteria. Both are essentially attributed to feeding disorders and predominantly concern the area of child psychiatry. Nevertheless, pica can also occur in adult women during pregnancy or the postpartum period (Fawcett, Fawcett & Mazmanian, 2016). With regard to ARFID, at the time of writing, there was virtually no well -grounded literature on the frequency of this disorder. It appears to be rather infrequent, although there are hints that disorders with avoidance or restriction of food intake in the broader sense are by no means rare (Kurz, van Dyk, Dremmel, Munsch & Hilbert, 2016). 3.4. Eatin g Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (EDNOS) The residual group of eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS) according to the DSM - IV criteria is the largest group, covering 60% of all eating disorders (Fairburn & Bohn, 2005). The prevalence rates vary widely here due to the specific group compo sition: the residuals of the three main eating disorders AN, BN and BED, but additionally above all \"subclinical\" eating disorders which nevertheless often require treatment. In a large epidemiological survey of female students aged 12 to 23 years in Portu gal, the point prevalence of EDNOS amounted to 2.37%. EDNOS accounted for 77% of all eating disorder diagnoses in this study (Machado, Machado, Gon\u00e7alves & Hoek, 2007). In a Spanish study, the prevalence of EDNOS among 13 - 15-year-old adolescents lay at 4.9 % for girls and 0.6% for boys (Rodriguez -Cano, Beato - Fernandez, Belmonte -Llario, 2005). A study in Greek females and males aged 12 -21 years examined the presence of an eating disorder in the home country (Veria, N=2920) and in Germany (as children of \"gues t workers\"). Female Greeks in Greece had a lifetime prevalence of EDNOS of 19.4% (female Greeks in Germany 13.8%); the prevalence of EDNOS was substantially lower in boys (2.7% in Greece and 0.0% in Germany) (Fichter, Quadflieg, Georgopoulou, Xepapadakos & Fthenakis, 2005). 3.5. Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder according to DSM -5 (OSFED) As the EDNOS category in the DSM -IV was so broad and expansive, in the DSM -5 criteria, other specified feeding or eating disorders have been defined more succin ctly. These are: 1. Atypical AN (all criteria for AN are met, with the exception that body weight lies within or above the normal range). 2. BN of low frequency and/or limited duration with less frequent symptoms. 3. BED of low frequency and/or limited duration 4. Purging disorder , i.e. recurrent purging behavior in order to influence weight or shape (e.g. self -induced vomiting, abuse of laxatives, diuretics or other medications) in the absence of binge eating. Purging disorder: Munn -Chernoff et al. (2015) reported a prevalence rate of 3.77 % for a twin study and Micali et al. (2017) found a 12 -month prevalence rate of 0.23% in women in a population -based sample over a period of 10 years. However, the section on purging disorder requires clearer diagnostic criteria. The 12-month prevalence for milder forms of eating disorders among middle -aged women 12 amounted to 0.35% for atypical AN, (subthreshold) (subthreshold) (Micali et al., 2017). 5. Night Eating Syndrome , recurrent episodes of nighttime eating in the form of eating after nocturnal awakening or of excessive food intake following the evening meal. Sufferers are aware of the eating and are able to recall it. The nighttime eating c an be better explained by external influences, e.g. changes in the individual sleep/wake rhythm or regional social norms. In a study of Swedish twins, Tholin et al. (2009) reported a prevalence of night eating syndrome of 4.6% in men and 3.4% in women. Sufferers with night eating syndrome showed increased obesity an d sleep problems. The DSM -5 developments have stimulated research into night eating syndrome (Sara\u00e7h et al., 2015). The prevalence of night eating syndrome is especially high in obese patients in whom bariatric surgical interventions are planned. In a popu lation sample of 2,460 persons (aged 14 -92 Germany, de Zwaan, M\u00fcller, Allison, Br\u00e4hler and Hilbert (2014) found a prevalence of 1.1% based on the \"Night Eating Questionnaire\" (NEC). 4. Mortality According to a meta -analysis, the mortality rate for AN is considerably higher than that for depression and schizophrenia; indeed, for AN, it is the highest of all mental disorders (Harris & Barraclough, 1998). A distinction is made between a \"Crude Mortal ity Rate\" (CMR; percentage of deaths in a sample) and the much more meaningful \"Standardized Mortality Ratio\" (SMR). To calculate the SMR, the mortality rate of the age group and for the respective time period are also considered, with values above 1.0 ind icating above -average mortality and values below 1.0 indicating below -average mortality. Birmingham, Su, Hlynski, Goldner and Gao (2005) reported an SMR of 10.5 (95 % CI: 5.5 -15.5) for 326 Canadian AN patients. In 524 AN patients in Northeast Scotland, Mil lar et al. (2005) found an SMR of 3.3 (95 % CI: 2.2-4.9). Fichter, Quadflieg and Hedlund (2006) reported a CMR of 7.7% in 103 female AN patients for a 12 -year period. In a Swedish study, the CMR of hospitalized AN patients was longitudinally compared acros s two time periods (Lindblad, Lindberg and Hjern, 2006). The AN mortality rate for the period from 1977 to 1981 amounted to 4.4%, and decreased to 1.2% for the later time period from 1987 to 1991 (possibly due to improved treatment options in Sweden). Howe ver, a Norwegian study found an increase in \"AN -related deaths\" for the period from 1992 to 2000, from 6.5 to 9.9 per 100 000. In general, conventional death certificates have been found to be of limited reliability for studies on the cause of death. More recent investigations show that mortality rates for bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder are substantially lower than those for AN (Fichter et al., 2006; Fichter, Quadflieg and Hedlund, 2008). In a meta -analysis of 43 follow -up BN studies, Nielsen (20 03) found an aggregated SMR of 1.6% (95 % CI: 0.8 -2.7). In a recent, very large and important study, Fichter & Quadflieg (2016) reported on a very large longitudinally examined clinical sample with mortality data on eating disorders. The standardized morta lity ratio (SMR) adjusted according to population data showed the following results: The SMR was strongly increased for AN, at 5.35 (normal = 1.0); for BN, an SMR of 1.49 was calculated, and for BED, the SMR was 1.50. Mortality is thus excessively increase d for AN and substantially increased for BN and BED. 13 5. Specific risk groups A series of studies have shown that black women in the USA are much less likely to develop anorexia than white women, even though they are exposed to a similar pressure to be thi n, at least on the part of the media. Apparently, therefore, there are particular subcultural factors that play a protective role here. Bulimia nervosa is also substantially more frequent in white women than in black women in the USA. By contrast, binge e ating disorder and other forms of binge eating appear to be equally as widespread among blacks and whites in the USA (Striegel -Moore et al., 2003; Striegel -Moore et al., 2005) . Persons at risk include first, adolescent girls in Western industrialized countries. Button, Aldridge and Palmer (2008) reported on a very large sample (N = 2554) from one region over a period of 21 years starting in 1987, and found fairly constantly that approx. 5% of those treated for eating disorders were male. Further risk factors are being overly conformist in childhood and a lack of development of positive self -esteem and body image. These girls or young women are therefore particularly sensitive to societal norms and are more likely to yield to the pressure to be thin than women with positive self -esteem. Due to their excessive conformity and lack of self -esteem, persons at r isk are more likely to go on diets or try to lose weight in another way, and may therefore ultimately develop an eating disorder. Compared to men, women between the ages of 12 and approx. 35 years have a substantially increased risk (at least 12 -fold) of suffering from AN or BN. In samples of persons who have been treated for eating disorders, men are even scarcer, in population samples somewhat more frequent than the ratio of 1:12. In a population -based study in the USA, Husdon et al. (2007) found a lifet ime prevalence of 0.5% for BN in adult men (women 1.5%). In a North American study, the proportion of men showing BN was found to be higher than in earlier studies (Hoek & van Hoeken, 2003). Although women are also more frequently affected by binge eating disorder (BED) than men, in adults, the proportion of men nonetheless lies at 30 to 40%. A particular risk of disorder has further been shown in some specific groups. This applies to people who undertake excessive exercise or competitive sport, as well as those who partake in serious classical ballet or competitive dancing (Arcelus, Witcomb & Mitchell, 2014). For such people, there is a greater focus on a lower body weight, which increases the risk of developing AN (see review by Sundgot -Borgen , Fasting, Brackenridge, Torstveit & Berglund, 2003). Dancing with a high physical effort, as is the case for instance with ballet dancing, requires a strong degree of physical fitness, thi nness and bodily control. Jockeys who take place in horse races also have an increased risk, as a lower body weight is a clear advantage for reaching the finish line first. Boxers and wrestlers are divided into weight classes and it is not uncommon for the m to try to starve themselves down into a lower weight class before competitions. According to a study by Klungland Torstveit and Sundgot -Borgen (2004), athletes who take part in \"leanness sports\" competitions are at greater risk of eating disorders than a thletes whose competitions take place in \"nonleanness sports\". In the sports sciences, there is the concept of a female athlete triad . Healthy athletes show an optimal supply of energy from food, eumenorrhea and a healthy bone structure. Through increased (athletic) energy consumption or reduced calorie intake, this triad can move in the direction of 1) lower availability of energy 14 with or without eating disorder, 2) osteoporosis, and 3) functional hypothalamic amenorrhea. Nattiv et al. (2007) wrote a revie w on behalf of the American College of Sports Medicine, which found that competitive athletes are at risk of a lower availability of energy if they a) undertake calorie reduction diets, b) exercise excessively over a longer period of time, c) are vegetaria ns, or d) substantially limit their range of nutrition (Cobb et al., 2003; Manore, 1999). Sundgot -Borgen and Klungland Torstveit (2004) examined 1620 competitive athletes of both genders as well as 1696 controls in Norway with regard to the emerging likeli hood of an eating disorder using a two -stage approach. The prevalence of eating disorders was higher in competitive athletes than in controls. Among competitive athletes, it was higher in women than in men. Among the different types of sports, the prevalen ce of eating disorders was relatively highest for sports that showed a dependency on thinness and body weight. The same results were found by Byren & McLean (2002) in Australia. Sundgot -Borgen and Klungland Torstveit found a subclinical or clinical eating disorder in 13.5% of all competitive athletes and in 4.6% of controls. Eating disorders were found particularly among women in esthetic sports, at 42% (compared to endurance sports, technical sports or ball sports). For men, eating disorders were most freq uent in \"anti -gravity sports\" (22%). A new frequently asked question refers to the relationship between eating disorders and diabetes mellitus . A distinction is made between type I diabetes (onset mostly in adolescence, destruction of -cells of the pancreas with consequent absolute insulin deficiency) and type II diabetes, which normally occurs in the second half of life and is frequently linked to obesity. In patients with type I diabetes, this generally occurs before the emergence of the eating dis order, in patients with type II diabetes generally afterwards. According to Herpertz (2008), anorexia and type I diabetes do not co -occur more frequently, but type I diabetes and bulimia nervosa do co-occur more often. \"Insulin purging\" refers to the reduc tion in the (generally evening) insulin dosage in order to lose weight. It is described as \"vomiting over the kidneys\". In persons with eating disorders and type I diabetes, \"insulin purging\" is not infrequent, which can considerably complicate the treatme nt both of the diabetes and of the eating disorder (Neumark -Sztainer et al., 2008). 6. Do anorexia and bulimia exist in developing c ountries? There are empirical studies from Singapore (Lee, Pathy & Chan, 2005), Hong Kong and Japan (Pike & Mizushima, 2005) which indicate that also in Eastern industrialized regions, eating disorders are approximately as frequent as in Western industria lized nations. There are also hints that eating disorders are on the rise in relation to the industrialization and urbanization in Arabic countries and in the not yet highly developed Asian countries (Pike, Hoek und Dunne, 2014). An increase can also be fo und overall especially in developing or emerging countries. Studies have been conducted on the Fiji Islands (Becker, Gilman & Burwell, 2005), among black people on Cura\u00e7ao, in Morocco, Mexico and in Malaysia: In these places, the frequency of eating disord ers is a great deal lower than in Western industrialized nations (Keski - Rahkonen, Raevuori & Hoek, 2008). If anorexic and bulimic eating disorders do occur in these developing countries, they are predominantly found in affluent families - thus in families where 15 there is an abundance of food. As an example, a study conducted on the Caribbean island of Cura\u00e7ao (Hoek et al., 2005) found a relatively low overall incidence of AN, at 1.82 (95 % CI: 0.74-2.89) per 100,000 person years. Among black people, who make up the majority of the island's inhabitants, not a single case was found.

Diagnosis of Patients with eating disorders should receive help at the earliest opportunity. To achieve this, it is necessary to identify the disorders in a timely manner, and not wait until the patient herself or persons close to her show an active desire for change or obvious complications have arisen. Early detection is facilitated by the public availability of valid information about the psychopathology of eating disorders and treatment options. At the beginning of their illness, patients with eating disorders often have no contact with physicians for psychiatry, psychosomatic medicine and psychotherapy, psychological psychotherapists or child and adolescent psych otherapists, but they do have contact with specialist physician groups in the areas of general medicine, dentistry, gynecology and obstetrics or pediatric and adolescent medicine. Therefore, it is important that all of these professional groups are alert t o the symptoms of eating disorders. If any respective indications are evident, a physician or psychologist should consider the possibility of an eating disorder, determine body height and weight, and ask screening questions to identify suspected cases. Ea ting disorder -related questionnaires can provide support in the realm of early detection (see below). Particular attention should be paid to the following groups of people: Patients with a low body weight or significant weight loss Patients with obesity an d/or significant weight gain Patients with amenorrhea or infertility Patients with dental damage Patients who have attended a consultation due to worries about their weight but who are of normal weight Overweight patients Patients with gastrointestinal sy mptoms which cannot be clearly attributed to another medical cause Children and adolescents with faltering growth Patients who work in the entertainment, fashion or food industry Competitive athletes 2 Harriet Salbach -Andrae was a co -author of an earlier version of this chapter. 3 Parts of chapters 1.1 and 1.2 have been previously published in a similar form in the following book chapter: Schweiger, U. (2015). Diagnostik von Essst\u00f6rungen. In und Ad ipositas (S. 36 -42). Berlin: Springer. 29 Children and adolescents whose parents are worried about their weight and eating behavior. For early detection, the primary physician should ask the patient about eating behavior and weight course in a targeted and age -appropriate manner (GCP). 1.2. Physical and psychological characteristics 1.2.1. Underweight or overweight For a more detailed diagnosis in the case of a suspected eating disorder, the patient should be weighed and measured in underwear and without shoes using a calibrated instrument. The interpretation and evaluation of the measurement values should be undertaken using appropriate formulae (BMI = kg/m2), normal ranges or age -related percentile curves (for more details, see the S3 guideline \"Prevention and treatment of obesity\"; Wirth, Wabitsch, & Hauner, 2014) . In addition to the current weight, the weight course (e.g. speeed of weight loss) is important. 1.2.2. Body weight and self -esteem To be able to correctly evaluate the patient's account of her eating behavior and the associated cognitions (i.e. intensive preoccupation with food and food -related themes, fear of being fat, desire to lose weight etc.), it is also important to be aware of the normative age -related attitudes and the cultural background. Restrictive eating behavior can be motivated by esthetic or sporting ideals, but also by ascetic ideals, i.e. the n otion of approaching spiritual goals through self-control and abstention. However, restrictive eating behavior can also be motivated by associated aversive experiences or disinterest in food. From a differential diagnostic perspective, it is necessary to d iscuss a genuine lack of appetite or an increased appetite, for instance in the framework of severe depressive episodes or physical diseases. A self -appraisal as being \"too fat\" is also common among healthy women and men as well as girls and boys in the We stern world (Cooper, Deepak, Grocutt, & Bailey, 2007) . The inappropriate or pathological aspect does not arise solely from this self -appraisal, but also from the fact that such thoughts occupy considerable space (e.g. in the form of time -intensi ve processes of worry), the sufferer is unable to gain any critical distance from them (cognitive fusion), the thoughts substantially reduce the sufferer's self -esteem, or they trigger dysfunctional behavior (e.g. vomiting). 1.2.3. Restriction of caloric intake Eating disorders typically encompass a range of target -oriented behaviors which serve to reduce weight or to maintain it at a low level: 30 Checking behavior, i.e. highly frequent weighing, in order to closely monitor changes in body weight, highly f requent checking of the circumference of body parts using measuring tape, of skin fold thickness, or checking one's appearance in the mirror including with the aim of maintaining the motivation for food restriction. Avoidance of high -calorie, fatty or carb ohydrate -based foods Skipping meal components such as dessert or skipping a whole meal Chewing and spitting out food Balancing meals by acquiring knowledge about calories and calorie counts and weighing all foods Avoidance of foods whose calorie count cannot be clearly determined, such as complex dishes prepared by others Use of sweeteners, fat substitutes and \"diet\" products Use of pharmacological appetite suppresants, nicotine, cocaine or other stimulants for appetite control Changes in mealtime sched ules, for instance by limiting intake to one mealtime per day or through a self -imposed structure with a multitude of small meals Excessive fluid consumption before meals in order to limit food intake Fluid restriction in order to limit food intake, e.g. t hrough mouth dryness Selection and consumption of unattractive foods or foods rendered inedible, for example by adding salt or hot spices Use of disgust conditioning in order to block the intake of attractive foods (e.g. by imagining that chocolate has bee n contiminated by mouse droppings) Not eating in the company of others in order to avoid distraction when eating or other social influences Use of constricting abdominal belts, restrictive clothing or tensing the muscles in order to generate a premature f eeling of fullness Use of tongue piercings or self -injuries in the oral cavity in order to impede food intake. 1.2.4. Binge eating The term \"binge\" describes an episode of food intake in which the usual control over eating is lost or not practiced. In an objective binge eating episode, an amount of food is consumed that goes beyond the realm of a normal meal in terms of the amount of calories. The diagnostic manuals of the DSM and ICD do not define a precise calorie threshold. The average number of calories, which was measured in binge eating episodes under controlled conditions, lies in the range between 3000 and 4500 kcal (Wolfe, Baker, Smith, & Kelly -Weeder, 2009) . Food intake that is unplanned, uncontrolled or undesired but which does not constitute an objectively unusual amount can also be subjectively perceived as binge eating (Fairburn & Wilson, 1993) . Binge e ating typically involves foods which the person usually forbids herself from eating. In the case of a long -term eating disorder, binge eating epsiodes are often precisely planned, i.e. foods suitable for bingeing are bought and stored and it is ensured tha t nobody will disturb the person during the binge (Abraham & Beumont, 1982) . 31 1.2.5. Compensatory behavio r Compensatory behavior refers to a range of target -oriented behaviors that serve to rapidly remove consumed energy or fluids from the organism. All measures that promote vomiting or diarrhoea are summarized in this regard as \"purging behavior\". Self-induced vomiting can take place following mechanical irritation of the pharynx, supported by chemical substances which promote vomiting (e.g. Radix, Ipecacuanha, saline solutions) or automatically Herbal or synthetically manufactured laxatives Herbal or synthetically manufactured diuretics Thyroid hormones (to increase the basal metabolic rate) Exercise and exposure to cold or heat (e.g. saunas) Skipping insulin in patients with type I diabetes in order to induce renal loss of glucose 1.2.6. Evaluation of behaviors Some behaviors which occur in eating disorders can also be observed in healthy women and men, but also even in girls and boys during childhood, and above all from adolescence (e.g. dieting, induced vomiting, intensive exercise for weight contro l). The evaluation of behaviors as clinically relevant can therefore not be solely based on frequencies or intensities. Rather, in each individual case, it is necessary to check whether the specific behavior gives rise to a relevant impairment or threat to physical health, psychosocial functioning or subjective distress. 1.3. Diagnosis If an eating disorder is suspected, it should be formally checked whether the criteria for an eating disorder are met according to an operationalized diagnostic system of th e respective current version of the ICD or DSM. Further diagnostics should include structured clinical interviews or checklists (see below). To adequately help all persons suffering from an eating disorder, it is important to also apply the diagnostic cate gories of atypical eating disorders or eating disorders not otherwise specified (EDNOS). Health care epidemiological studies show that the current main ICD categories only capture approximately 40 to 60% of patients with a clinically significant eating dis order. When applying the criteria of the DSM -5, the proportion of EDNOS diagnoses lies at around 25% (Fairburn & Cooper, 2011) . 1. If an eating disorder is still suspected following preliminary examinations, categorical diagnostics should be systematically performed using the current diagnostic criteria of the DSM or ICD, ideally using guidelines or validated diagnostic interviews. (GCP) 2. In the framework of differential diagnosis, a timely co -evaluation by a medical psychotherapist, psychological psychotherapist or child and adolescent psychotherapist should be performed. (GCP) 32 1.4. Approaches for the categorical and dimensional diagnosis of psychological symptoms At the beginning of treatment, a comprehensive valid and reliable diagnossis of the psychological symptoms is essential for determining indications and for treatment planning. The diagnosis of psychological symptoms also assumes an important role in the course of treatment and after trea tment completion, in order to assess the progress and outcome of therapy in the sense of quality assurance. First, this chapter therefore presents structured clinical interviews for diagnosis according to the ICD and DSM, with a focus on eating disorder - specific as well as general instruments. In addition to this approach of categorical diagnosis, the chapter also describes various self -report questionnaires which can be used to dimensionally quantify eating disorder symptoms and associated symptoms. The de scription of the eating disorder -specific procedures in text form is supplemented by a table which lists the procedures focused on in the text and further includes psychometric procedures for categorical and dimensional diagnostics (table 3). For each proc edure, the table includes sources, scale names, numbers of items and literature references to studies assessing the reliability and validity of the respective instrument.

General instruments 1.4.1.1. Instruments for categorical diagnosis in adults Diagnostic Interview for Mental Disorders (DIPS) The Diagnostic Interview for Mental Disorders (DIPS; Margraf, Schneider & 2017) is used for the assessment and diagnosis of the most important mental disord ers for the clinical domain. On the whole, the inter -rater reliability can be described as very good. The procedure is streamlined by the use of branch instructions. The administration of the DIPS requires training, reading of the manual and compliance wit h the rules contained therein. The particular benefit of the DIPS for the user in the framework of diagnosing eating disorders lies in the systematic assessment of comorbidity. The limitation of the procedure lies in the fact that it exclusively assesses d iagnostically relevant symptoms. The interview can also be administered in routine clinical practice. The questions on eating disorders refer first to body height, current weight, and highest and lowest weight in adulthood. Further questions include: \"Has there ever been a time when you weighed much less than other people thought you ought to weigh, or when you lost a lot of weight?\" or \"Do you have binge eating or phases of ravenous appetite in which you eat much more than other people would eat under simi lar circumstances?\". Subsequently, the criteria for anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder are assessed. The DIPS and the short version Mini -DIPS are now available in 37 adapted versions according to the DSM -5 (Margraf & Cwik, 2017; Margr af et al., from the following links: http://dips.rub.de ; http://mini -dips.rub.de Structured Clinical Interview for DSM -IV (SCID), Axis I and II disorders The Structured Clinical Intervi ew for DSM -IV (SCID), Axis I Wittchen, 1997; Scholz & Wittchen, 2006) is a comprehensive and complex diagnostic interview for the assessment and diagnosis of selected pschological syndromes and disorders as they are defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM -IV) on Axis I (acute mental disorders) and Axis II (personality disorders). In addition, coding options are provided for Axis III (physical disorders), Axis IV (psychosocial impairment) and Axis V (psychosocial functioning). The inter -rater reliability of the interview can be described as good to very good. Administering the SCID requires training, reading of the manual and compliance with the rules contained therein. The particular benefit of the SCID for the user in the fra mework of diagnosing eating disorders lies in the systematic assessment of comorbidity. The limitation of the procedure lies in the fact that it exclusively assesses diagnostically relevant symptoms. The interview can also be administered in routine clinic al practice. The questions referring to eating disorders are: \"Have other people ever said that you are too thin?\" and \"Have you ever had eating binges where you had the feeling that you could not control your eating behavior?\". In section H, the criteria for eating disorders, their subtypes and the stage of disease are then documented: H1 to H10 anorexia and H24 to H38 binge eating disorder. The procedure is streamlined through the use of branch instructions. There is no w an English -language version of the SCID adapted to the modified diagnostic criteria of the DSM -5 (First, Williams, Karg & Spitzer, 2015); a version of the SCID translated into German is currently being developed (Beesdo -Baum, Zaudig & Wittchen, 2019). International Diagnostic Checklists -10 (IDCL; Hiller, Zaudig, & Mombour, 1997) provide the possibility, for research and practice, to conduct a standardized and economical assessment of find ings according to the classification systems DSM -IV and ICD-10 (two sets of checklists/IDCL for ICD -10 and IDCL for DSM -IV). Particularly for diagnosticians who are already experienced in standardized interviews (such as the SCID), the IDCL enable an even quicker procedure. The test -retest reliability and the inter -rater reliability for all examined disorder groups are satisfactory to good. Each checklist refers to one diagnosis. The particular benefit of the IDCL for the user in terms of the diagnosis of e ating disorders lies in the systematic assessment of comorbidities with a simultaneously very high time -efficiency in routine clinical practice. The limitation of the procedure lies in the fact that it exclusively assesses diagnostically relevant symptoms. Due to the lack of branch instructions, the structure of the checklists does not allow for a complete implementation, meaning that experience with other, more highly structured diagnostic procedures is helpful in the preparation. 38 1.4.1.2. Instruments for categorical diagnosis in children and adolescents Diagnostic Interview for Mental Disorders in Children and Adolescents (Kinder -DIPS) The Diagnostic Interview for Mental Disorders in Children and Adolescents (Kinder -DIPS) is a supplement to the Diagnostic Interview for Mental Disorders (DIPS), which was designed for adults. It consists of a child version, in which the child or adolescent is surveyed directly, and a parallel parent version, in which a parent or other caregiver is surveyed (Schneider, Unnewe hr & Margraf, 2008). The Kinder -DIPS is seen as a reliable (Kappa values: .50 -.89, Yule's Y - values: .60 -.81 for the test -retest reliability of the major diagnostic categories) and valid instrument for diagnosis according to the criteria of the DSM -IV or IC D-10. Analogously to the DIPS, the use of the Kinder -DIPS requires training, reading of the manual and compliance with the rules contained therein. With respect to the diagnosis of eating disorders, the particular benefit of the DIPS lies in a reliable ass essment of psychological comorbidities. The Kinder - DIPS can be employed in practice and in research institutions. A limititation of the instrument lies in the considerable amount of time required for its administration. A version of the DIPS adapted to the DSM -5 is now available (Schneider, Pflug, In -Albon & Margraf, 2017) and can be freely accessed from the following link : http://kinder -dips.rub.de Kiddie -Sads -Present and German version (Delmo, Weiffenbach, Gabriel & Poustka, 2000) of the Kiddie -Sads - Present and Lifetime Version (K -SADS -PL; Chambers et al., 1985; Kaufman et al., 1997) is a semi -structured diagnostic interview which was developed to assess current and past episodes of mental disorders in children and adolescents according to the DSM -III-R and DSM -IV. An adapted revision for the DSM -5 is now available (Kaufman et al, 2016), and can be accessed from the homepage of the first author (https://www.kennedykrieger.org/pati ent-care/faculty - staff/joan -kaufman), although it is not available in the German language. To rate the symptoms, probes and objective symptom criteria are provided. Inter -rater reliability (93 to 100 % agreement) and test -retest reliability (Kappa values: .63-1) have been found to be good to excellent (Kaufman, Birmaher, Brent, Ryan & Rao, 2000). For a reliable and valid administration of the K -SADS -PL, special training is necessary. In terms of the diagnosis of eating disorders, the particular benefit of t he K -SADS -PL lies in the reliable assessment of psychological comorbidities. It can be employed in both inpatient and outpatient settings. Somatoform disorders cannot be diagnosed with the K -SADS -PL, which constitutes a limitation of the instrument. A furt her limitation lies in the high amount of time required to administer the K -SADS -PL. 1.4.2. Eating disorder -specific instruments 1.4.2.1. Instruments for categorical diagnosis in adults Through the use of interview guidelines such as the Diagnostic Interview for Mental Disorders (DIPS; Margraf et al., 2017) or the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM -IV (SCID; Wittchen, Zaudig & Fydrich, 1997), the reliability of diagnoses can be conside rably increased (cf. e.g. 39 Wittchen, Semler, Schramm & Spengler, 1988). However, the two most widely used interview guidelines for the area of mental disorders in the German -speaking area - the DIPS (Margraf et al., 2017) and the SCID (Wittchen et al., 1997 ) - often do not offer sufficient information for treatment planning, especially in the case of eating disorders. Therefore, guidelines have been developed which not only cover the diagnostic criteria of eating disorders but additionally also provide furth er, indirect treatment -relevant information, such as information about patients' individual diet rules (see also table 3). In contrast to questionnaire procedures, the number of interview guidelines in the area of eating disorders available in the German l anguage is very limited: Only for two interviews (Eating Disorder Examination [EDE] and Structured Inventory for Anorexic and Bulimic Disorders expert rating interview [SIAB -EX]) are detailed evaluation findings available which are valid for the German -speaking area. Eating Disorder Examination (EDE) The Eating Disorder Examination (EDE; Fairburn & is a structured expert interview for the diagnosis and assessment of the specific psychopathology in eating disorders which is widely and internationally used in research and practice. The specifically assessed eating disorder -related psychopathology comprises restrictive eating behavior, which might be e xpressed in fasting, slimming diets or in other restraint eating. Parameters of restraint eating, for example the attempt to avoid food intake for long periods of time or to follow diet rules, are captured in the EDE Restraint scale. Further abnormalities in the area of eating such as impaired concentration due to preoccupations with food or feelings of guilt when eating are described in the Eating Concern scale. A further central feature is disturbances in the evaluation of shape and weight (Shape Concern, Weight Concern). This is expressed in an increased level of importance placed on shape and weight for one's self -esteem, in inpaired concentration due to preoccupation with shape and weight, or in the fear of becoming fat(er) (see table 3 in Appendix). Be sides the items of the four scales of the EDE, 14 diagnostic items enable a differential diagnostic classificaiton of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa or binge eating disorder according to the criteria of the DSM -5 (in addition, diagnosis can also be made according to the ICD -10). Moreover, optionally, with the help of further items, sociodemographic data and characteristics on the development and maintenance of eating problems can be recorded. With regard to the psychometric properties of the EDE, the int er- rater reliability of the subscales lies between .92 r .99 and that of the items between .80 1.00 (Hilbert et al., 2004). The internal consistencies of the subscales lie at .73 Cronbach's .86 (total score: = .93). Thus, overall, the reliability of the EDE can be described as high. High correlations between the EDE subscales Shape Concern and Weight Concern and other self -report scales on body image speak in favor of convergent validity. The EDE subscales Re straint and Eating Concern show significant associations with the eating behavior recorded in food diaries, such as frequency of meals or binge eating, or of nutrient intake. The subscales of the EDE distinguish between groups with different eating disorde r diagnoses, which points to disriminant validity. Moreover, the subscales of the EDE are sensitive to changes through psychological psychotherapy. To administer the EDE, in addition to a detailed manual, there is also an interview guideline, a coding shee t, an evaluation sheet as well as a diagnosis sheet (Hilbert & Tuschen -Caffier, 2006a, 2016a). The materials are freely electronic form (http://www.dgvt -verlag.de/e -books/1_Hilbert_Tuschen - Caffier_EDE_2016.pdf ). The EDE is very well suited for the diagnosis of eating disorders in adults within clinical psychological practice and research. It takes approximately 45 minutes to administer. As is the case when performing expert interviews in general, a reliable and valid implementation of the expert interview is optimized if, in addition to working through the manual, special training is completed. An advantage of the interview lies in its specific focus on eati ng disorders, meaning that barely any redundancy arises when it is used in combination with the above -mentioned general structured interviews. Moreover, with a duration of 45 to 60 minutes, the amount of time required to perform the EDE is reasonable for p atients. If less time is available for diagnosis, it is further possible to limit the EDE solely to the diagnostic questions. Structured Inventory for Anorexic and Bulimic Eating Disorders Expert Interview (SIAB -EX) As an expert interview, the Structured Inventory for Anorexic and Bulimic Eating both the assessment of eating disorder -specific sympto ms and the asessment of symptoms which frequently accompany eating disorders, such as anxieties and impairments in social competence. Thus, in contrast to the EDE, the SIAB -EX is not exclusively targeted at the psychopathology of eating disorders, but is a dditionally geared towards associated symptoms of eating disorders. The SIAB -EX is suitable for the diagnosis of eating disorders in adults and adolescents within clinical - psychological practice and research. It takes between 30 and 60 minutes to administe r. The internal consistencies of the subscales indicate predominantly homogeneous subscales (total score for current diagnoses: Cronbach's = .92; past diagnoses: = .93). The subscale structure derived from principal components analysis supports the con struct validity of the SIAB -EX. Furthermore, convergent validity of the procedure has been demonstrated by correlations with conceptually related self -report scales. In part, the subscales of the SIAB -EX and the EDE show substantial convergence. Sensitivit y to change of the SIAB -EX is supported by significant symptom improvements following inpatient psychotherapy and weight loss. The instrument is very well suited for diagnosis, treatment planning and longitudinal assesments. To enable a reliable and valid administration of the expert interview, a comprehensive manual is available, with \"anchor examples\" from practice and definitions. 1.4.2.2. Instruments for categorical diagnosis in children and adolescents The Eating Disorder Examination for Children (ChEDE; German: Hilbert, 2016a; Hilbert Lask, 1996; Fairburn & Cooper, 1993 ) is an adapted version of the Eating Disorder Examination, for children and adolescents aged 8 -14 years (EDE; German: specific psychopathology using child -appropriate language with four subscales on restraint eating, and on concerns about eating, weight and shape (22 items). Fourteen diagnostic items al low for the diagnosis of eating disorders according to the DSM -5. Psychometric testing of the German translation of the ChEDE in samples of 8 -17-year-old 41 children and adolescents with anorexia nervosa, binge eating disorder, loss of control eating, overwei ght and obesity as well as chronically ill children and adolescents without eating disorders showed excellent inter -rater reliabilities both for the subscales (.98 ricc .99) and for the items (.80 ricc 1.00) (see Hilbert et al., 2013). The internal consistences lay at .70 Cronbach's .88 for all subscales apart from the Restraint scale, for which the internal consistency amounted to Cronbach's = .62, and were thus predominantly good. Convergent validity determined using correlations with conc eptually related self -report procedures lay in the moderate to high range. The subscales distinguished between children and adolescents with different eating disorders or eating disorder symptoms and those without eating disorders. These results indicate t hat the German version of the ChEDE is suitable for a reliable and valid assessment of eating disorder psychopathology in children and adolescents. The limitations of the ChEDE include the overall time required for its administration (approx. 45 minutes). For diagnostic purposes, this can be reduced by solely using the items relevant for diagnosis. The ChEDE manual, including interview guidelines, coding and evaluation sheets as well as diagnosis sheets, is freely available in electronic form ( http://www.dgvt -verlag.de/e - books/3_Hilbert_ChEDE_2016.pdf ). An additional ChEDE module on the diagnosis of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder, which was specified for the first time in t he DSM -5, is currently being prepared. 1.4.2.3. Instruments for dimensional diagnosis in adults In addition to the categorical or classification -based assessment of eating disorders, the symptoms of an eating disorder and associated characteristics can fur ther be dimensionally quantified by means of questionnaires, e.g. to estimate the degree of severity of particular symptom areas for the purpose of treatment planning or to measure the success of psychotherapy. In this respect, a substantial number of proc edures are available, of which only a selection are described in greater detail in the following. The selection of questionnaires was primarily based on whether the respective procedures are widespread, can be meaningfully and well implemented in the clini cal context, and on their availability. A brief description of these and further German -language questionnaires for the dimensional diagnosis of eating disorders and associated characteristics for adults as well as children and adolescents is presented in table 3, listed alphabetically. The instruments outlined in the table are available in German, are mostly disseminated internationally, and have been psychometrically tested (for a further review, see Steinfeld, Bauer, Vocks, 2017; Tuschen -Caffi er, Pook & Hilbert, 2005). The symptom areas associated with eating disorder pathology in the narrower sense, which are assessed in the listed questionnaires, include, for example, body image disturbances in anorexia and bulimia nervosa (for a more detaile d overview, see Steinfeld, Bauer, Waldorf, Hartmann & Vocks, 2017) or the motivation to change/ambivalence regarding the eating disorder (for a more detailed overview, see H\u00f6tzel, von Brachel, Schlossmacher & Vocks, 2013; von Wietersheim & Hoffmann, 2011). Eating Disorder Examination -Questionnaire (EDE -Q) The Eating Disorder Examination -Questionnaire Br\u00e4hler, 2012) is the questionanaire version of the structured expert interview Eating Disorder Examination (EDE; Fairburn & Cooper, 1993). Analagously to the EDE, the EDE -Q assesses features of the specific psychopathology of eating disorders with four subscales. The Restraint scale and the Eating Concern scale describe problems with eating behavior, such as restricting food intake by following dieting rules or feelings of guilt when eating. The Wei ght Concern scale and the Shape Concern scale ask about characteristics of a negative body image, such as an increased level of importance attached to shape and weight for self -esteem. The 28 items of the EDE -Q correspond to the compulsory questions of the EDE. All items refer the the past 28 days. Like in the EDE, 22 items are allocated to the four subscales. Frequencies and/or intensities are rated on 7-point anchored rating scales (0 = no days/not at all to 6 = every day/markedly). A further six items w hich are not allocated to scales assess the occurence and frequencies of diagnostically relevant core features such as binge eating, self -induced vomiting or abuse of diuretics and laxatives. The EDE -Q is suitable for adults and adolescents and allows for the assessment of self -report of the specific eating disorder psychopathology in clinical - psychological practice and research. The EDE -Q can be employed descriptively or as an initial screening instrument in a multistage diagnostic process. Compared to the EDE, the use of the EDE -Q can be seen as particularly indicated if a structured expert interview like the EDE cannot be administered for economical reasons. The EDE -Q generally takes less than 15 minutes to complete. The EDE -Q is evaluated by calculating subscale mean scores and evaluations of individual diagnostic items; an overall (mean) score from the 22 items of the subscales can be calculated. The psychometric evaluation showed good internal consistencies of the subscales, from .80 Cronbach's .93 (cf. Hilbert et al., 2007, 2012). Over a period of three months, the test -retest reliability of the subscales lay at .68 rtt .74. The reliability of the EDE -Q can therefore be described as good. The factor structure of the EDE -Q has been broadly r eplicated. Normative values for the German population were established based on a representative sample of men and women aged 14 years and over (Hilbert et al., 2012). A short form for the assessment of global eating disorder pathology with eight items has been developed and validated in two representative samples (Kliem et al., 2016). Limitations pertain to the fact that - as with all self - report scales - the EDE -Q cannot be used for clinical diagnosis, but is employed solely as a screening instrument and to depict the course of eating disorders from the patient's perspective. The EDE -Q cannot be used as a substitute for a structured expert interview for diagnosis (EDE or SIAB -EX). The EDE -Q is freely available electronically, including the short form and t he necessary materials for evaluation ( http://www.dgvt -verlag.de/e -books/2_Hilbert_Tuschen - Caffier_EDE -Q_2016.pdf ). Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI, EDI -2) The Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI; Garner, Olmstead & Polivy, 1983; German translations by Paul & T hiel, 2004; Rathner & Waldherr, 1997 among others) aims to assess symptoms which are frequently linked to the disorders of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa. The most recent version available in German (EDI -2; Garner, 1991) comprises 91 items on 11 scale s [(1) Drive for thinness, (2) Bulimia, (3) Body dissatisfaction, (4) Ineffectiveness, (5) Perfectionism, (6) Interpersonal distrust, (7) Interoceptive awareness, (8) Maturity fears, (9) Asceticism, (10) Impulse regulation and (11) Social insecurity]. Thro ugh this expansion, ultimately only around 25% of the items now refer to the primary symptoms of eating disorders. There are several 43 versions of the EDE and EDE -2 (e.g. Paul & Thiel, 2004; Rathner & Rainer, 1997; Rathner & Waldherr, 1997), the most widespr ead of which is probably the version by Paul and Thiel (2004). Independently of item coding and translation variant, there is a high correspondence in the psychometric findings on the EDI (e.g. Rathner & Waldherr, 1997; Thiel et al., 1997). For instance, t he internal consistencies of the three scales (1) Drive for thinness, (2) Bulimia and (3) Body dissatisfaction are good to very good in clinical groups. In non -clinical groups, and especially in male participants, only the values on the scale \"Bulimia\" fal l into the suboptimal range. The discriminant validity of the three scales is demonstrated by mean differences between clinical and non -clinical groups. The findings on factorial validity, by contrast, are inconclusive. This might predominantly be attribut able to the fact that the \"Drive for thinness\" scale also captures aspects of dissatisfaction with shape, as shown by results on the construct validity. The sensitivity to change of the procedure is supported by a series of therapy studies demonstrating pa rtial improvements in the scale scores. The utility for routine clinical practice has been demonstrated particularly for the eating disorder -oriented subscales \"Drive for thinness\", \"Bulimia\" also show good psychome tric properties. The EDI -2 by Paul and Thiel (2004) has also been psychometrically tested in adolescents (Salbach -Andrae et al., 2010). The values for internal consistency can be rated as high for the group of patients and as satisfactory to adequate for t he female and male control groups. Comparisons of mean scores on the individual scales of the EDI -2 between patients with eating disorders and control participants demonstrated that the EDI -2 can differentiate well between the different groups of adolescen ts. Limitations of the EDI -2 lie in the fact that not all subscales show good psychometric properties. Moreover, it is a self -report instrument, bringing the commonly associated limitations (e.g. response tendencies). In the English -speaking area, there is already a revised and extended version (EDI -3; Garner 2004), although a German translation and validation has not yet been published. Three 1989) is the German version of the Three -Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ; Stunkard & Messick, 1985). The questionnaire comprises 44 items which are answered dichotomously with \"true\" or \"false\", 13 items which are rated on a 4 -point scale from \"never\" to \"always\", and three questions with six to eight response options. The procedure enables the assessment of the three factors of eating behavior \"cognitive restraint\", \"disinhibition\" and \"hunger\" . The questionnaire has good internal consistency. Reference values are available for large population samples. However, the factor structure of the questionnaire is a matter of debate, with only the factor \"cognitive control\" being well -recognized. Overall, the TFEQ is the most commonly emplo yed questionnaire for examining eating behavior across the world. The questionnaire is suitable for quantifying the extent of restrictive eating behavior and the disturbability of eating behavior in the course of therapy. Structured Inventory for Anorexic and Bulimic Eating Disorders Self -Report (SIAB -S) The Structured Inventory for Anorexic and -Report by Fichter and Quadflieg (SIAB -S; 1999a, 2001) is the questionnaire version of the expert interview SIAB -EX. Using this proced ure, both symptoms of eating disorders and symptoms of mental disorders which are frequently associated with eating disorders can be assessed from the 44 perspective of the patients. The 87 items of the SIAB -S correspond to the items of the expert interview ( SIAB -EX), with the difference that they are formulated in order to be generally comprehensible to laypersons. The subscale allocation also broadly corresponds to the SIAB - EX. For each item, the respondent is first asked about the current extent of a sympto m referring to the past three months; subsequent questions pertain to the more distant past. The SIAB -S is suitable for the diagnosis of eating disorders in adults and adolescents in clinical -psychological practice and research. It takes 30 minutes to comp lete. The internal consistencies of the subscales of the SIAB -S can be predominantly evaluated as satisfactory. In part, the subscales of the SIAB -S are substantially correlated. The convergent validity of the SIAB -S has been confirmed by a series of conte nt-based plausible correlations with conceptually related self - report questionnaires and the EDE. Furthermore, the subscale structure of the SIAB -S derived from principal components analysis indicates the construct validity of the procedure. The content -logical validity of the procedure is given. The diagnostic sensitivity of the SIAB -S in terms of differentiating between defined eating disorders (anorexia and bulimia nervosa) and eating disorders not otherwise specified has been demonstrated. The sensitivi ty to change of subscales of the SIAB -S and the total score is supported by significant changes following inpatient psychotherapy and after follow -up periods of several years (e.g. Fichter & Quadflieg, 1997, 1999b; Fichter, Quadflieg & Gnutzmann, 1998). Re ference values are predominantly available for women. Limitations emerge - as with all self -report scales - through the fact that while the procedure can be used as a screening instrument and to quantify the course of eating disorders, it cannot be used as a substitute for expert rating using structured diagnostic tools (e.g.. EDE or SIAB -EX). Munich Eating and Feeding Disorder Questionnaire (Munich ED -Quest) The Munich Eating and Feeding Disorder Questionnaire (Munich ED -Quest) by Fichter, Quadflieg, Gier k, Voderholzer and Heuser (2015) was specifically developed to take into account the reformulation of the DSM -5 (and ICD -11) for diagnostic purposes and to assess the symptom severity of eating and feeding disorders in clinical practice and research. The questionnaire is available in its original German version and in an English translation. It can be used for persons between the age of 12 and 65 years. Using 65 items, the questionnaire captures attitudes and behaviors which frequently occur in persons with eating or feeding disorders. Several items are broken down into subquestions. Most of the items are rated on a severity scale from 0 (not at all or never) to 4 (very severe or very often). Moreover, the frequency of binges and compensatory measures are a ssessed. Most of the items assess the current state (last three months) and the worst state in the past from prepuberty to 3 months before completion of the questionnaire. As such, the worst state over the lifetime is assessed. The three subscales are calculated as scale mean scores and are differentiated according to these time periods. The subscale \"preoccupation with figure and weight\" captures the preoccupation with shape, body weight and weight loss. The subscale \"bingeing and vomiting\" refers to the s everity and frequency of binges, their emotional consequences, as well as vomiting and nighttime eating. The subscale \"inappropriate compensatory behavior\" assesses behaviors such as the use of laxatives and diuretics with the aim of avoiding weight gain, including insulin abuse. For the following diagnoses of eating disorders according to the DSM -5 (ICD -11), there is a standardized algorithm which was validated through an expert interview: anorexia nervosa (restricting type and binge -eating/purging type), bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, 45 avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (criteria A and C without exclusion criteria), rumination disorder, atypical anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa (of low frequency and/or limited duration), binge eating disord er (of low frequency and/or of limited duration), purging disorder, purging disorder according to the criteria of Keel and Striegel -Moore (2009), night eating syndrome. The Munich ED -Quest was validated in 605 women and men with eating disorders. The inter nal consistencies of the subscales yielded very good values, from .89 to .98 (Cronbach's ). The test -retest reliability was very high, with values of at least .89, and the questionnaire also showed a high sensitivity to change. Comparison and norm values (means/standard deviations, percentiles) are available for the 605 men and women treated for eating disorders - also separately for anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. In addition, data are also available for clinical control persons (patients without ea ting disorders but with psychosomatic illnesses) and for 547 young women without eating disorders. The Munich ED - Quest and all documents necessary for its evaluation are available in German and English at http://www.klinikum.uni -muenchen.de/Klinik -und-Poliklinik -fuer-Psychiatrie -und- Psychotherapie/de/forschung/forschungsfelder/ essstoerungen/evaluation/index.html 1.4.2.4. Instruments for diagnostics in children and adolescents Eating Disorder Examination -Questionnaire for children (ChEDE -Q) The Eating Disorder Examination & Czaja, 2008; English version TODAY Study Group, 2007) is an adapted version of the Eating Disorder Examination -Questionnaire EDE -Q (Germ an version Hilbert 2016b; English version Fairburn & Beglin, 1994), for children aged 8 -14 years, based on the Eating Disorder Examination for Children (ChEDE; German: Hilbert, 2016a; English: Bryant -Waugh et al., 1996; Fairburn & Cooper, 1993). Using 22 items formulated in child -appropriate language, the ChEDE -Q assesses the specific eating disorder psychopathology on the four subscales Restraint, Eating Concern, Weight Concern and Shape Concern. Six diagnostic items provide infor mation about the extent of core diagnostic features, for example binges or self -induced vomiting. The German translation of the ChEDE -Q was psychometrically tested in a population -based sample of 8 -13-year-old children and adolescents as well as in subsamp les of children with versus without loss of control eating (Hilbert et al., 2008). Subscales and the total score of the ChEDE -Q were predominantly found to be internally consistent and stable over a period of 7.5 months. The factor structure of the ChEDE -Q was reproduced for the most part. The parameters of the ChEDE -Q were significantly correlated with those of the ChEDE as well as with conceptually related questionnaires. Furthermore, the ChEDE -Q showed good discriminant validity in distinguishing between children and adolescents with and without loss of control eating. A short form of the ChEDE -Q, which assesses global eating disorder psychopathology with eight items, has been developed and validated (Kliem et al., 2017). The German -language version of th e ChEDE -Q is thus suitable for the reliable and valid dimensional assessment of eating disorder psychopathology in childhood and adolescence. A limitation is that while the instrument assesses the specific eating disorder psychopathology, it cannot act as a substitute for a structured interview for diagnosis. The ChEDE -Q, including the short form and materials 46 necessary for its evaluation, are electronically available ( http://www.dgvt -verlag.de/e - books/4_Hilbert_ChEDE -Q_2016.pdf ). A parent version of the procedure (in the sense of parental assessment of the child's eating behavior) is currently in preparation. SCOFF questionnaire The SCOFF questionnaire (Morgan, Reid & Lacey, 1999) contains five items for the screening of eating disorders. The name is an acronym of the five key questions of the English -language original ( Sick, Control, One Stone, Fat, Food). In clinical patient populations and especially in female parti cipants up to the age of 40 years, the SCOFF shows high sensitivity and specificity in terms of identifying eating disorders in the general population. In a meta -analysis of 15 studies examining the use of the instrument in different age groups (Botella, S epulveda, Huang & Gambara, 2013), the authors calculated a pooled sensitivity of .80 and specificity of .93. In representative samples from the general population (Richter, Strauss, Braehler, Adametz & Berger, 2017; Solmi, Hatch, Hotopf, Treasure & Micali, 2015), the questionnaire likewise showed a high specificity (.94 and. 97, respectively). However, in both studies, the sensitivity of the instrument was substantially lower, at .54 (Solmi et al., 2015) and .26 (Richter et al., 2017, age group 14 -95 years) , meaning that due to the associated rate of false negative assessments, the questionnaire may be less suitable as a screening instrument in the general population. For the German -speaking area, translations are available both for children and adolescents and for adults. In a subsample ( n =1895) of the largest representative study on the state of health of 11 -17-year-old children and adolescents conducted in Germany to date, the KiGGS study, 29.4% of female respondents and 14.4% of male respondents answered at least two of the five questions positively (BELLA -Studie, Herpertz -Dahlmann, Wille, H\u00f6lling, Vloet & Ravens testing of the questionnaire in 12 -year-old boys (N = 382) and girls ( N = 425) in the Federal state of Thuringia w ith the EAT -26D as reference (cut - off: 20 points) showed a satisfactory test -retest reliability (.73) with a maximum accuracy (AUC) of 82%, sensitivity of .79 and specificity of .74 (Berger et al., 2011). In a six -year follow - up investigation of the BELLA cohort, a higher SCOFF score at the baseline assessment proved to be a significant predictor for a higher SCOFF score at follow -up and for the development of overweight and obesity, independently of the BMI at baseline and the BMI of the parents (Herpertz -Dahlmann, Dempfle, Konrad, Klasen & Ravens -Sieberer, 2015). Due to the shortness of the questionnaire, it is very economical to administer and evaluate. The translation used for children and adolescents is freely accessible online, including at the followi ng address: a multidimensional questionnaire for the parents' (or caregivers') assessment of eating disorder symptoms in children and adolescents. The test consists of 30 items which are answered by the parents (or caregivers) in a closed response format on a 3 -point scale. All 30 items are entered into the scale evaluation, which are allocated to three subscales. 16 items are allocated to the subscale \"Unusual eating behavior\", seven items to the subscale behavior\" and seven items to the subscale \"Hyperactivity\". Additionally, the three subscales are aggregated into a total score. The mean internal consistency of the German -language version (Cronbach's ) for the total scale as well 47 as the three subscales lay between = .75-.95 across the whole samp le. By means of confirmatory factor analysis, the three -factor structure proposed by Vandereycken and Meermann (2003) was confirmed for the German version of the ABOS. Moreover, testing of criterion validity showed that parents of patients with eating diso rders reported significantly higher scores compared to parents of the control group (Salbach -Andrae et al., 2009). Due to its clarity and short time to implement (5 to 10 minutes) and evaluate (10 minutes), the questionnaire is quick and easy to administer and does not require special training. The advantage of the instrument lies in the quick assessment of parent reports of the specific eating disorder psychopathology, which is especially essential in childhood and adolescence. The ABOS can be used in clin ical practice and within clinical -psychological research. A limitation lies in the lack of standardization of the instrument. A short form of the ABOS comprising 10 items is now available, the Eating and Activity Questionnaire for Parents (EAQP) (Thiels & Schmitz, 2009). Eating Disorders in Youth -Questionnaire (EDY -Q) The Eating Disorders in Youth -Questionnaire (EDY -Q; van & Dyck, Munsch & Hilbert, 2015, 2016) is a self -report questionnaire for assessing restri ctive eating problems in 8 -13-year-old children. The 14 items are based on the criteria for avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder defined in the DSM -5, on the clinical \"Great Ormond Street\" criteria for this eating disorder (Bryant -Waugh & Lask, 1995) and on the literature on early -onset restrictive eating problems. Twelve of the 14 items of the EDY -Q capture symptoms of ARFID, including its three proposed variants (Bryant -Waugh, Markham, Kreipe & Walsh, 2010) : food avoidance emotional disorder, selective eating and functional dysphagia. Two additional items assess pica and rumination disorder and two others asse ss early -onset feeding or eating disorders which are described in the DSM -5. Each item is rated on a 7 -point Likert scale ranging from 0 = \"never\" to 6 = \"always\". Scoring can take the form of a total mean score or dichotomized for the presence of symptoms of ARFID including its variants, or descriptively for pica and rumination disorder. Psychometric evaluations of the EDY -Q in children aged 8 - 13 years (Kurz et al., 2015, 2016; van Dyck et al., 2013) showed an acceptable internal consistency for the total mean score and confirmed the factor structure with the three proposed variants of ARFID. Findings on convergent, divergent and discriminant validity are available. A limitation of the EDY -Q is the still limited database for this instrument. Moreover, as with all self -report scales, while the EDY -Q can be employed to assess cen tral symptoms of ARFID, it cannot be used as a substitute for expert rating in the framework of structured diagnosis (e.g. ChEDE). The EDY -Q and the materials necessary for scoring are freely available online (http://nbn -resolving.de/ urn:nbn:de:bsz:15 -quco sa-197236 ). A parent version of the procedure (in terms of the assessment of the child's eating behavior by the parents) is currently being developed. 48 References Abraham, S. F., Beumont, P. J. V. (1982).

Diagnosis of physical symptoms Ulrich Schweiger & Ulrich Hagenah Medical diagnostics serves the purpose of assessing immediate risk and detecting possible complications of the eating disorder. Further aims are the diagnosis of relevant medical causes of weight loss and vomiting (differential diagnosis) and the diagnosis of rele vant comorbid medical diseases. 2.1. Recommended initial diagnostics Anthropometry Height Weight Pulse Blood pressure In children and adolescents: pubertal status (according to Tanner stages) Internal examination Auscultation of the thorax Palpation of the abdomen Assessment of vascular status Inspection of the oral cavity, salivary glands Inspection of the skin surface Ultrasound of the abdomen Electrocardiogram Possible echocardiography Neurological examination Higher cortical functions (e.g. memory, arithmetic, praxis) Stance and gait Cranial nerves Motor system Fine motor skills and coordination Sensitivity Muscle reflexes Autonomic nervous system Laboratory Differential blood count ESR, C -reactive protein Glucose 57 Electrolytes (sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, phosphate) Renal status (creatinine) Liver status (e.g. ALT, AST, ALP, CK, GGT, total and direct bilirubin, PT and PTT) Amylase, lipase Urine status TSH. In selected patients, the determination of iron, ferritin, vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin B12, folic acid, \u00df -carotine, zinc, copper, selenium, as well as immunochemical or chromatographic drug screening can also be considered. Further diagnostic steps can result from pathological findings in this initial diagnostic process. Depending on the initial findings and the level of symptoms (underweight, purging behavior), intervals for follow -up examinations can be determined. These intervals can range from daily examination for severely ill patients to an interval of one year. In the case of abnormal findings and clinical signs pointing to comorbid or differential diagnostically relevant medical diseases, the diagnostic paths recommended within the respective diso rder guidelines should be followed. 2.1.1. Anthropometry Body Mass Index (BMI) In the case of a BMI below 15 kg/m\u00b2 in adults, a disorder -oriented inpatient treatment with hospital -typical remedial methods should be considered. A very low BMI constitutes a particular risk factor in terms of mortality (Rosling, Sparen, Norring, & von Knorring, 2011) . It is important to measure weight using a calibrated instrument, preferably by the attendin g physician or psychologist him/herself. The patient should be weighed and measured in her underwear without shoes. Delegating this task to assistants or using information provided by the patient herself carries a significant risk of inaccurate evaluation (for instance underestimation of the risk through underweight due to an erroneously low indication of height, or weighing after consuming large amounts of fluids). As a benchmark for evaluating body weight, the BMI is used. It is calculated according to th e formula BMI = body weight (kg)/height (m2). Accordingly, a person who weighs 60 kg and is 1.70 m tall has a BMI of 20.8 kg/m2. The literature presents detailed information on the distribution of BMI in various reference populations and age groups and on the relation between BMI and various health risks. For clinical purposes, BMI in adults of both genders can be interpreted using the following classification (WHO Global Database on Body Mass Index, WHO technical report 854): Severely underweight class III BMI 40 kg/m2 From a clinical perspective, severe underweight can be further subdivided into two classes: severe underweight class I, with a BMI of 13.0 to 15.99, and severe underweight class II, with a BMI < 13.0 kg/m2. The rationale for this lies in the su bstantially higher mortality in patients with anorexia nervosa who have a BMI below 13.0 kg/m2 When using the BMI to evaluate the health risk, the following limitations need to be kept in mind: The BMI correlates highly, but not very highly, with fat and m uscle mass. The most important moderator of this relationship is exercise. Persons who do intensive weight and endurance training can be overweight or even obese, without having a greater fat depot. Conversely, underweight, physically inactive patients can have a smaller muscle mass than hyperactive patients with anorexia nervosa. When evaluating the health risk associated with a higher BMI, it should be noted that the BMI does not depict the fat distribution between the visceral and subcutaneous fat depot. Accordingly, even normal -weight persons can have an increased visceral fat depot and overweight persons can have a normal visceral fat depot. To evaluate risk inherent in underweight, it needs to be considered that a stable underweight is less risky than a rapid weight loss with regard to cardiovascular risks. Moreover, one must take into account that an increase in the fluid depot, for example in the case of edemas, can mask the risk in the case of underweight. In children and adolescents, due to age -depe ndent changes in body proportions, risk is evaluated with the help of age -based BMI percentile tables (Kromeyer -Hauschild et al., 2001) . Respective websites to calculate the percentile values are available online (www.pedz.de). In the treatment of anorexia nervosa in children and adolescents, a primary treatment aim is the restoration of a healthy body weight for an age -appropriate growth, as well as menarche or resumption of menses. However, consensus is lacking with regard to the definition of a healthy body weight. Recent studies indicate that a BMI on the 25th age percentile constitutes a necessary prerequisite for the resumption of menses (Dempfle et al., 2013; Faust et al., 2013) . Therefore, reviews suggest the 25th age percentile as a benchmark for the desired target weight of a treatment, and where possible at least the 10th age percentile (Herpertz -Dahlmann, 2017) In the guidelines of the professional society, a fall below the 10th BMI percentile is defined as a criterion for extreme underweight and a fall below the 3rd BMI percentile as a criterion for an indication for inpatient treatment for children and adolescents (DGKJPP, 2007). Chapter 1.2 Diagnostic criteria addressed the problems of the 5th BMI age percentile as suggested in the preparation of the ICD -11 as a criterion for underweight in greater de tail. In children and adolescents with a high starting weight or overweight/obesity prior to disorder onset, the level of acute risk can be significantly underestimated: While they have often not yet reached the threshold for underweight, or may only fall slightly below this threshold, the often more pronounced weight loss means that they nevertheless show equally severe physical and psychological symptoms (e.g. level of bradycardia, circulatory instability, psychological comorbidity, suicidal risk) to pati ents with typical anorexia nervosa (Sawyer, Whitelaw, Le Grange, Yeo, & Hughes, 2016) . 59 In line with the guidelines of the European Childhood Obesity Group (ECOG), the Working Group of Obesity in Childhood and Adolescence recommends the use of the 90th and 97th percentile of the aforementioned reference data as the threshold for defining overweight and obesity, respectively (Wabitsch & Mo\u00df, 2009) . Extreme obesity is defined as a BMI > 99.5th percentile. This purely statistical specification of the cutoffs enables, when using the new reference sample for German children and adolescents, an almost continuous transition to the aforementioned fixed thresholds in adulthood. Heart rate, blood pressure and orthostatic test Bradycardia with a heart rate below 40/minute, tachycardia with a heart rate above 110/minute, a blood pressure below 90/60 mmHg, a decline in blood pressure of > 20 mmHg or a n increase in heart rate of > 20 in the orthostatic test are risk indicators in which the necessity of inpatient treatment should be assessed. Approximately 43% of patients with anorexia nervosa have a heart rate below 60/minute and around 17% below 50/min ute. Body temperature Up to 22 % of patients with anorexia nervosa show hypothermia, with a temperature below 36.0\u00b0C. A centrally measured body temperature of 36.0\u00b0C or lower constitutes a risk indicator and should lead to an assessment of the necessity f or inpatient treatment. Pubertal status In patients with an early, especially prepubertal onset of anorexia nervosa, the poor nutrition over time frequently leads to a delay or even an irreversible arrest in growth, as well as an absence of the hormonal a nd physical changes linked to puberty. A pubertal status that does not correspond to the patient's age generally suggests that the illness is not recent. Early menarche is more frequent among early -onset bulimic disorders (Day et al., 2011) . 2.1.2. Internal examination Thorax A mitral valve prolapse is more frequent in anorexia nervosa. However, it is not possible to derive specific therapeutic consequences from this. Arrhythmogenic effects of a mitral valve prolapse represent an additional risk factor in patients with pronounc ed underweight. Pericardial effusions, albeit mostly without hemodynamic relevance, are frequently found both in adults and adolescents with anorexia nervosa (Oflaz et al., 2013) . Abdomen Changes in the gastrointestinal motility are frequent in all forms of eating disorders. An acute abdomen, for instance in th e case of acute dilatation of the stomach, is rare. This constitutes an acute life -threatening danger. Particular attention should also be paid to symptoms of chronic inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease. Especially in the presence of diarrhea and chronic stomach pain, the corresponding diagnostic paths should be followed. 60 Vascular status Acrocyanosis is frequent in anorexia. When exposed to cold, these patients are at increased risk of frostbite. Oral cavity, salivary glands Patients who vomit a re particularly likely to show dental damage with characteristic patterns of erosions, changes in the oral muscosa and enlargement of the parotid glands and salivary glands at the base of the tongue. The concentration of salivary amylase in serum is increa sed in patients with an eating disorder, depending on the extent of vomiting. Sufferers require regular dental checks, treatment and targeted advice on dental care. The pronounced dental damage can lead to a severe and lifelong health burden. The enlargeme nt of the parotid glands and the salivary glands at the base of the tongue is an important element of visual diagnostics in eating disorders. Skin surface Dry skin, hair loss, acne, disorders of skin pigmentation, yellowing of the skin in the case of hypercarotenemia, petichiae, neurodermatic changes, Livedo vasculitis, intertrigo, generalized itching, skin infections and Striae distensae are observed in all forms of eating disorders. Patients with underweight frequently have typical Lanugo hair. Patie nts who induce vomiting can have calluses on the back of the dominant hand (Russell's sign). Sufferers often do not make the link between the eating disorder and skin changes, sometimes interpreting them as \"allergies\". Diets derived from this can exacerba te the eating disorder. Bone density Bone density is considerably prematurely reduced in anorexia nervosa. A routine examination of bone density cannot be recommended as this does not result in specific further diagnostic or therapeutic consequences. The indication emerges from spontaneous fractures. 2.1.3. Laboratory Blood count Around 34% of patients with anorexia nervosa show a mild leucopenia; a more severe leucopenia is rare. Thrombocytopenia is present in approximately 5% of cases. Hematocrit and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) mostly lies in the lower reference range. Marked changes in the blood count are risk indicators. Inpatient treatment must be considered. In a randomized comparison trial of different feeding protocols with very underweight adol escents (BMI at treatment start < 78% mBMI), low numbers of leukocytes prior to treatment start correlated significantly with the phosphate nadir over the course of treatment, and possibly represent a risk marker for the development of hypophosphatemia an d a refeeding syndrome (O'Connor, Nicholls, Hudson, & Singhal , 2016) . Electrolytes In the case of intensive vomiting, but also refeeding, rapid changes in electrolyte concentrations can arise. Particularly with dehydration, potassium in serum may lie in the reference range, but 61 the intracellular potassium may be considerably reduced. App roximately 20% of patients with an eating disorder show hypokalemia, around 7% hyponatremia and around 6% show low concentrations of potassium. Hypophosphatemia occurs above all in the case of parenteral refeeding, but can also be a consequence of high car bohydrate consumption following a longer period of fasting. Similar associations also apply for hypomagnesemia. A potassium concentration of 3.0 mmol/l is a risk indicator, especially in conjunction with ECG changes. An inpatient treatment must be consider ed. Blood glucose Even in the case of severe malnutrition, the blood glucose is mostly in the lower reference range. In conjunction with other factors such as infectious diseases or intoxications, life - threatening hypoglycemia can arise. A glucose concent ration lower than 60 mg/dl is a risk indicator. An inpatient treatment must be considered. Kidneys Due to the reduced muscle mass, the concentrations of creatinine in anorexia nervosa typically lie in the lower reference range. Chronic hypokalemia, in par ticular with persistent vomiting and laxative abuse, can lead to kidney failure due to hypokalemic nephropathy in some patients with an eating disorder. Even if the upper reference range is only slightly exceeded, further diagnostics should be conducted. Liver Approximately 12 % of patients show an increased concentration of liver enzymes. An acute severe damage to the liver can occur in anorexia nervosa. If the reference range is exceeded, further diagnostics should be conducted. Adrenal glands The secreti on of the stress hormone cortisol is regularly increased in anorexia nervosa and in individual cases with other forms of eating disorders. A routine determination of cortisol cannot be recommended because no specific further diagnostic or therapeutic conse quences can be derived from this. Thyroid Reduced concentrations of triiodothyronine (\"low T3 syndrome\") are regularly present in anorexia nervosa and present in individual cases of bulimia nervosa. The recommendation to exclusively determine TSH pertains to the necessity to exclude thyroid diseases that are not directly related to an eating disorder (e.g. Hashimoto's thyroiditis). A routine determination of T3 cannot be recommended as no specific further diagnostic or therapeutic consequences can be derive d from this. Sex hormones In the case of anorexia nervosa, reduced concentrations of estradiol, progesterone and luteinizing hormone (LH) are regularly found. Disorders of sex hormone secretion are also frequently found in other forms of eating disorders. A routine determination of sex hormones 62 cannot be recommended, as no specific further diagnostic or therapeutic consequences can be derived from this. 2.1.4. Neurological examination Brain imaging Frequent findings in anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa are enlargements of the outer and inner cerebrospinal fluid spaces. There are no available data on binge eating disorder. Routine brain imaging (CT or MRT) cannot be recommended, as specific further diagnostic or therapeutic consequences cannot be derived from this. The indicatio n emerges from abnormalities in the neurological findings. 2.2. Differential -diagnostic considerations The diagnosis of an eating disorder is only rarely a diagnosis by exclusion. Anorexia nervosa is the most common cause of pronounced underweight in adol escence and young adulthood in Western society. A problem lies in differentiating anorexia nervosa with mild underweight from constitutional forms of underweight. In the case of constitutional underweight, the psychological characteristics of an eating dis order are lacking, endocrine functions are normal, and in particular, amenorrhea is not present. It is difficult to distinguish between binge eating disorder and overweight that is not caused by an eating disorder. Neurological or endocrine disorders that mimic the physical and psychological characteristics of a bulimic eating disorder are rare. For underweight patients, the following differential -diagnostic considerations should be made: Tumor diseases (brain, stomach, pancreas, lungs, lymphomas, leukemia ) Endocrine disorders the superior mesenteric artery, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis) Infectious diseases (tuberculosis, parasitoses, systemic mycoses, HIV) Other mental disorders (depression, anxiety and obsessive -compulsive disorders, somatoform disorders, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders) Drugs and substance abuse (multiple drug use, heroin , cocaine, amphetamines). For patients with vomiting, the following differential -diagnostic considerations should be made: Tumor diseases of the brain (especially hypothalamic tumors) Endocrine disorders (diabetes, emesis parasitoses, connective tissue disorders with involvement of the gastrointestinal tract such as scleroderma). However, the above -mentioned disorders rarely yield a similar temporal pattern of vomiting behavior to that found in a typical eating disorder. 63 In patients with overweight, the following potential determinants should be considered (Hruby et al., 2016; Schwartz et al., 2017) : Lack of exercise, sedentary lifestyle, large number of hours spent in front of a screen, unfavorable dietary composition, large food portion sizes, skipping breakfast Poor nutritional quality (junk food) Consumption of alcohol, cannabis or other appetite -increasing substances Endocrine disorders (Cushing's syndrome, insulinomas) to medial hypothalamus, craniopharyngioma) Genetic syndromes.

The therapeutic relationship with patients with an eating disorder diagnosis Stephan Herpertz, Brunna Tuschen -Caffier, Silja Vocks 1. General reflections A good therapeutic relationship plays a central role in the success of psychotherapy (Crits - Christoph, Gibbons & Mukherjee, 2013). But what does the term \"therapeutic relationship\" actually mean, and what are the markers of its quality? In the research lit erature, the therapeutic relationship is defined in classical terms as the collaborative and affective relationship between therapist and patient. The aspect of collaboration refers here to the agreement between patient and therapist with respect to the go als of the therapy and the techniques employed to achieve them. The affective component encompasses aspects such as trust, likability, respect and care between patient and therapist (Crits -Christoph et al., 2013). In accordance with this definition, the th erapeutic relationship is usually operationalized in classical terms using the Working Alliance Inventory (WAI; Horvath & Greenberg, 1989), which can be employed across different schools of psychotherapy and comprises the scales \"development of an affectiv e bond\", \"agreement between therapist and patient on the tasks of therapy\" and \"agreement on the goals of therapy\". In the framework of the directives for psychotherapy in Germany, psychotherapy is carried out as individual or group therapy, with the forme r representing the most commonly practiced form in Germany. While individual therapy concerns a dyad of therapist and patient, group psychotherapy involves a multi -person setting. Accordingly, with regard to the success of a psychotherapy, in the case of i ndividual therapy, it is necessary to take into account the patient variables and therapist variables, the \"fit\", the psychotherapeutic approach, as well as the therapeutic relationship. For group therapy, in addition to these variables, group -dynamic processes are also relevant. In psychotherapy process research, attention has traditionally also been paid to therapist variables when examining the therapeutic relationship (Crits -Christoph et al., 2013). To date, there is little research on therapist charact eristics which are associated with a positive outcome specifically in the area of eating disorders. Nevertheless, patient preferences have been researched. A qualitative study (Gulliksen, Espeset, Nordbo, Skarderud, Geller & Holte, 2012) reported that pati ents with AN prefer a therapist who shows acceptance and vitality/is active, focuses on resources, is supportive and shows expertise. Previous investigations also revealed that patients with eating disorders rather prefer female therapists, because the the mes of body image and sexuality are often important contents of the therapy (Vocks, Legenbauer & Peters, 2007). Nevertheless, it should be kept in mind that patient preferences regarding therapist characteristics can in no way be equated with therapist var iables which also foster the outcome. Equally little is known about the extent to which therapists who show the patients' preferred characteristics actually bring about a greater likelihood of a positive therapeutic relationship; there is a great need for research in this regard. 66 In the past, research predominantly focused on therapeutic approaches, based on the assumption that \"techniques\" can be understood as independent from the therapists and patients or the therapeutic relationship. However, differenc es in techniques are closely linked to differences with respect to therapist and patient variables. In this regard, there is broad consensus among psychotherapists that the therapeutic relationship is an important influencing factor in the treatment of men tal disorders. Based on the current state of research, however, the question of causality remains unclear (see below for further details). The American Psychological Association, Division of Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy also concluded that \"Effort s to promulgate best practices or evidence -based practices without including the relationship are seriously incomplete and potentially misleading\" (Norcross & Wampold, 2011). So far, the therapeutic relationship has predominantly been examined from a pati ent-oriented perspective, with a central focus on characteristics of the therapist such as the degree to which he/she understands and adapts to the patient (accurate empathy), an unprejudiced positive attitude or a non -possessive warmth and affection. On t he part of the patients, in the framework of the therapist relationship, their ability to productively engage with the therapy has often been evaluated. From the multitude of currently existing constructs of the therapeutic relationship, the reflections of Gaston (1990) can be emphasized: 1. the patient's affective relationship with the therapist, 2. the patient's ability to collaborate in the therapy, 3. the therapist's empathic understanding, 4. the therapist's involvement, 5. the patient -therapist agreement on the goals and tasks of psychotherapy. The relation between the therapeutic relationship and the therapy outcome has been examined within psychotherapy research in different treatment settings, both across different disorders and for specific disorders (Crits -Christoph et al., 2013), and has al so been the object of numerous studies in the area of eating disorders. The correlation coefficients range from r = .19 (psychotherapy in children; Shirk, Karver & Brown, 2011), through r = .25 (group therapy; Burlingame, McClendon & Alonso, 2011) to r = .26 (couple and family therapy; Friedlander, Escudero, Heatherington & Diamond, 2011). Despite numerous indications of the importance of the therapeutic relationship for therapy success in the context of AN (e.g. Stiles -Shields, Touyz, Hay, Lacey, Crosby, R ieger, Bamford & Grange, 2013) and BN (e.g. Accurso, Fitzsimmons -Craft, Ciao, Cao, Crosby, Smith, Klein, Mitchell, Crow, Wonderlich & Peterson, 2015), overall, the findings are inconsistent. In a systematic review (Brauhardt, de Zwaan & Hilbert, 2014), the authors reported an association between the therapeutic relationship and therapy outcome in around half of the reviewed studies in adult patients with eating disorders. In the context of family therapy, however, an association between the therapeutic r elationship and symptom reduction was consistently demonstrated. In spite of these indications of an association between the therapeutic relationship and treatment outcome, also in the context of eating disorders, the question of causality remains unclear . On the one hand, a good therapeutic relationship can be seen as an \"ingredient\" for a positive outcome; on the other hand, high expectations of the therapy on the part of the patient or also 67 (first) successes within the treatment might lead to a more pos itive evaluation of the therapeutic relationship. Moreover, it is conceivable that a third (unknown) factor (e.g. intelligence) influences both the therapeutic relationship and the therapy success (Brown, Mountford & Waller, 2013). First indications of a r eciprocity between the therapeutic relationship and the course of therapy in the context of eating disorder treatment were provided by a study which employed multiple measurements of both of these variables (Vrabel, Ulvenes & Wampold, 2015). It was also fo und that a more positive evaluation of the expected therapy success at the start of treatment predicted a positive therapeutic relationship at various time points over the course of treatment (Stiles -Shields, Bamford, Touyz, Le Grange, Hay & Lacey, 2016). 2. The therapeutic relationship in the treatment of patients with an eating disorder At the time of seeking psychotherapeutic treatment or at the first consultation, patients with an eating disorder diagnosis are mostly ambivalent about changing their eat ing problems (e.g. normalizing their eating behavior vs. restrictive eating behavior in order to maintain a low body weight, see below for further details). Moreover, the patient's readiness to openly express her thoughts and feelings associated with the e ating disorder is also ambivalent or low at the beginning of treatment - and partly also throughout the whole therapy process (e.g. a patient with AN can find it difficult to address her pride about her low body weight). Furthermore, according to clinical experience, it is not uncommon for patients to experience unsuccessful treatments in the course of their often chronic illness as confirmation of their negative view of themselves (e.g. feelings of low self -efficacy, hopelessness, self -esteem problems). In patients with AN, beliefs with an identity -conferring nature are often observed (e.g. \"If I resist eating, I am strong and can be proud of myself\"). Feelings of shame can often prevent patients with BN or BED from speaking openly about their eating disord er symptoms, the severity of the symptoms and the associated emotional problems. For men with eating disorders, the therapy motivation can be further impeded by the notion that they are suffering from a purportedly \"female\" disorder. These examples illustr ate that the building of the therapeutic relationship plays an important role for patients with eating disorders. 3. The building of the therapeutic relationship Given the often ambivalent therapy motivation of these patients, an empathic, nonjudgmental, non-reproachful attitude towards the patient's description of her problems is warranted, especially at the start of treatment. As long as the patient's physical and/or psychological situation does not necessitate direct intervention (e.g. guideline chapter VII \"Physical sequelae of eating disorders\" and guideline chapter and Chapter 2.3.8 \"Compulsory treatment\"), the development of a sustainable working relationship should be at the forefront (table 4). Due to the risk of eating disorders becoming chronic, and the associated physical and psychological complications, the treatment motivation is the focal point of the first conversations. This includes detailed and factual information about the eating d isorder including its risks, although without scaring the patient. 68 Especially in patients with AN, cognitive impairments due to cachexia need to be taken into account. Information about the clinical picture should contain in -depth information about symptom s, causes and course as well as potential complications and comorbidities. It is beneficial if the disorder model that is imparted is founded on the intended treatment in terms of content. In a first conversation, in which the patient is informed about tre atment options, the various alternatives of promising therapy options should already be outlined (see Chapter V \"Anorexia nervosa\", Chapter VI, \"Bulimia nervosa\", Chapter VII \"Binge eating disorder\"); regional accessibility also needs to be taken into acco unt here. 4. Therapy motivation A high level of ambivalence towards the eating disorder is especially characteristic for AN and BN (Gale, Holliday, Troop, Serpell & Treasure, 2006). On the one hand, the level of suffering of these patients is not inconsid erable, as they experience a severe limitation of their physical, cognitive and social capabilities, extending to a ubiquitous reduction in performance. On the other hand, the eating disorder often - at least in the short term - includes numerous positive facets for the sufferer, which are not to be underestimated (Legenbauer & Vocks, 2014; Serpell & Treasure, 2002). For instance, the eating disorder often constitutes a more or less efficient method of weight loss or stabilization, which due the high releva nce of shape and weight for the sufferer's self -evaluation, as also outlined in the diagnostic criteria of the DSM -5 (APA, 2013), is central. Besides stabilizing self -esteem, the eating disorder symptoms can also serve the purpose of emotion regulation, in particular the regulation of negative emotions, e.g. through binge -eating and purging ( Heatherton & Baumeister, 1991 ). Additionally, patients perceive the ability to renounce food, being thin, and the feeling of success and control as reinforcing (Cockell , Geller & Linden, 2003; Serpell, Treasure, Teasdale & Sullivan, 1999). These numerous positively perceived functions of the eating disorder explain the often low motivation for change and for psychotherapy, with the motivation to change often varying with respect to the different symptoms of an eating disorder (Vitousek, Watson & Wilson, 1998). For instance, sufferers are often prepared to cut down on the eating disorder symptoms, but the motivation to reduce or give up weight control strategies like restr ictive eating, excessive exercise and in part also self -induced vomiting, is substantially lower (Treasure, Katzman, Schmidt, Troop, Todd & de Silva, 1999). This varying motivation for change depending on the symptom area is also reflected in the fact that patients with AN tend to perceive their eating disorder as \"ego -syntonic\", i.e. commensurate with their goals, while patients with BN mostly have a substantially more negative view of their illness and perceive it rather as \"ego -dystonic\" (Bulik & Kendler , 2000; Vitousek et al., 1998). This ambivalence regarding the eating disorder symptoms, or low therapy motivation, is part of any treatment of a patient with an eating disorder; presumably, therefore, it is implicitly or explicitly an important aspect of any therapeutic relationship. A further reason for the high clinical significance of a low motivation to change in eating disorders lies in the fact that it predicts both treatment dropout (Bandini, and unfavorable treatment outcomes (Castro -Fornieles, Bigorra, Martinez -Mallen, Gonzalez, Moreno, Font 69 Cockell Devlin, 2001). A systematic review (Clausen, L\u00fcbeck & Jones, 2013) revealed that a higher pre -treatment motivation to change was associated with a stronger improvement in restrictive eating behaviors, bing eing behaviors, and cognitive and affective measures of eating disorder pathology, but not with purging behavior (e.g. vomiting). For this reason, the measurement of motivation to change - also specific to different areas - is an important part of the dia gnostics of eating disorders, both at the beginning and in the course of treatment (H\u00f6tzel, von Brachel, Schlossmacher & Vocks, 2013; von Wietersheim & Hoffmann, 2011). The described findings on the prognostic relevance of a low motivation to change also s uggest the employment of interventions which directly aim to increase the motivation to change. Such interventions are mostly based on the transtheoretical model of behavior change ( Prochaska & DiClemente, 1992) or Motivational Interviewing ( Miller & Rolln ick, 1991 ). These two forms of intervention have their roots in the area of addiction, and were conceptually and practically transferred to the area of eating disorders (cf. e.g. Dray & Wade, 2012). Interventions to foster motivation are carried out either prior to the actual psychotherapy (e.g. Gowers & Smyth, 2004) or in parallel to it ( Dean, Touyz, Rieger & Thornton, 2008 ). In terms of content, such programs target reflection on pro and con arguments regarding the eating disorder (cf. Legenbauer & Vocks, 2014). However, the empirical findings on the efficacy of these interventions in increasing motivation to change are inconsistent. While some studies demonstrated positive effects (H\u00f6tzel, von Brachel, Schmidt, Rieger, Kosfelder, Hechler, Schulte & Vocks, 2014), others yielded only moderate effects or were unable to demonstrate the superiority of such interventions over standard treatments ( Treasure et al., 1999 ). A systematic review of studies conducted up to 2012 found that these interventions were particularly able to increase the motivation to reduce binge symptoms, but only small affects were demonstrated in terms of giving up compensatory or restrictive behavior (Knowles, Anokhina & Serpell, 2013). Nevertheless, it should be noted that the method ological quality of the studies (e.g. due to an insufficient sample size) is not satisfactory. In terms of the concrete implementation of strategies to motivate the patient, in accordance with the reactance theory (for an overview, cf. Dickenberger, Gniec h & Grabitz, 1993; Eagly & Chaiken, 1993), it can be expected that the more the patient feels pressured by the therapist to change her attitudes or behavior, the more strongly she will defend her beliefs and goals. This means that the more the therapist tr ies to convince the patient through argument, the more she might combat this with her own line of thinking and argument, in the sense of a \"boomerang effect\". Especially with regard to food intake, patients feel observed, controlled and pressurized, for ex ample to empty their plate. Therefore, they often employ more or less obvious avoidance strategies (e.g. postponing or cancelling appointments); moreover, they frequently show reactance against the therapist's attempts at change, which they perceive to be unpleasant, for instance by not sticking to agreements (e.g. continuing to exclusively eat low -calorie foods). The aforementioned techniques of Motivational Interviewing derived from addiction therapy (Miller & Rollnick 1991 ) constitute appropriate methods to build up the intrinsic motivation for behavior change in this regard. Important goals of Motivational Interviewing are the exploration of discrepancies within the conflict of ambivalence and its resolution, often in one 70 particular direction. In this re spect, motivational strategies like contracts, rewards, etc, i.e. extrinsic methods, play less of a role. The main focus is on increasing intrinsic motivation. The ambivalent motivation to change (e.g. wanting to stop binge eating but not wanting to gain weight, see above) should be considered in the conversation throughout the entire treatment. The therapist should avoid slipping into the role of a punitive parent in his/her communication, and monitoring in a \"finger -wagging\" manner whether the patient is complying with his/her recommendations. Instead, he/she always makes it clear that ultimately, the patient herself is responsible for the therapy success and for the speed of changes. This so -called resistance can be constructively resolved if the therapis t takes the patient's thoughts, feelings, goals etc. seriously, puts his/her own position into perspective, and makes it clear that the patient's views are perfectly understandable. At the same time, information that can awaken the motivation to change can be imparted \"in passing\". Example: \"With any other patient, I would recommend changing their diet, because by experience, this clearly reduces the binges. But you're quite sure that it won't help you...And knowing you as I do, you're not just saying that, you're sure to have had experience or made observations that underpin your view. Let's talk about that first of all,...\" (Tuschen -Caffier & Florin, 2012, S. 46). An essential prerequisite for treatment success is consensus with the patient regarding the treatment modalities. To this aim, it is necessary to develop a treatment plan together with the patient. It is generally useful to explain to the patient that she will make the important therapy decisions and that the psychotherapeutic treatment is reliant on her desire to change and her cooperation. The building of the therapeutic relationship is also especially important in the treatment of children and adolescents with eating disorders. As the involvement of the parents or guardians in the therapeutic p rocess is seen as essential, the therapist takes care to build up a sustainable therapeutic relationship both with the child/adolescent and the parents, and where necessary further caregivers. Clinical experience suggests that it can be beneficial if the c hild or adolescent perceives that the relationship between parents/guardians and therapist is a positive one. At the same time, however, the therapist should always ensure that he/she is impartial. In other words, he/she should neither be an ally of the pa rents/guardian against the child nor vice versa (Borg -Laufs, 2009). Children and adolescents with eating disorders are often \"sent\" to treatment at the behest of their parents or guardians; thus, it cannot necessarily be assumed that the child or adolescent is already willing to change the eating disorder. It can even occu r that parents/guardians address the inappropriate eating behavior in great detail in front of their child. This can trigger feelings of shame and guilt on the part of the child/adolescent and should be prevented by the therapist. Moreover, family and frie nds often convey to children/adolescents how dangerous and unreasonable their eating behavior is. This, however, can lead to reactance on the part of the affected children/adolescents. Therefore - similarly to the treatment of adults - it is important that a child or adolescent suffering from an eating disorder learns that the therapist is able to understand her disordered eating and the associated behavior, and will not judge it. When 71 building the therapeutic relationship, the child's/adolescent's stage of development additionally needs to be considered. Generally speaking, the therapeutic stance should express a certain equanimity towards the symptoms. The eating disorder has generally already existed for months or even years, not least contributed to by the human organism's ability to compensate for starvation, which cannot be underestimated. An exception to this is acute physical or psychological risk situations, for example in patients with AN, which are often accompanied by an insufficient decision -making ability. In extreme cases, the therapist must consider the possibility of compulsory treatment (Thiel & Paul, 2008; see also chapter 2.3.8 \"Compulsory treatment\" in guideline chapter V \"Anorexia nervosa\"). Both outpatient and inpatient treatment of pa tients with eating disorders can currently still be described as insufficient in Germany, with the often long waiting times necessitating interim care. Generally speaking, it is the general physician who is tasked during this time, similarly to a case mana ger, with leading the patient through the various areas of care and possibly seeking treatment alternatives. At the same time, the general physician should endeavor to avoid the occurrence of further weight loss. Many patients wish to use such time to \"go it alone after all\". Such an attempt can be supported as long as the patient is somatically stable, but should realistically be accompanied by compulsory \"check -up appointments\", for example after four and eight weeks. This type of \"open approach\" which in corporates the patient's competencies, is often a prerequisite for building up a sustainable motivation for therapy. 5. Specific elements of the dialogue in the diagnostic phase Before the start of therapy, a detailed diagnosis of the eating disorder pat hology, the comorbid mental disorders and medical problems is conducted (see guideline chapter II \"Diagnosis of eating disorders\". The aim of the diagnostic interview, however, is also to develop a good and sustainable relationship with the patient. Furthe rmore, a first impression of the symptoms should be gained, after which the patient is informed about the further procedure (e.g. further diagnostic assessments, therapeutic strategies and process). To successfully develop a good rapport, in the first conv ersation (and throughout the entire therapy), the therapist employs conversational strategies which serve the purpose of depathologizing thoughts, feelings or behaviors which patients are generally reluctant to report, or which they only report under stron g feelings of shame or guilt (cf. Frank & Frank, 2009). Experience demonstrates that depathologization helps the patient to be able to speak more openly about difficult themes (e.g. binge eating, vomiting). Moreover, experience has also shown that the ther apist is perceived as someone who is obviously well -informed about eating disorders if he/she manages to provide detailed examples. Presumably, this fosters the development of a trustful therapeutic relationship. To round off the first conversation, the pa tient is informed that she will first have to undergo comprehensive medical and psychological diagnosis to clarify whether psychotherapy is likely to be successful. Likewise, it will only be possible to develop an individual therapy plan once the diagnosis has been established. The implementation of diagnostics thus does not yet imply an agreement for therapy. 72 Once the further diagnostic assessments have been conducted (see Guideline chapter II \"Diagnosis of eating disorders\"), the essential diagnostic fin dings are reported back to the patient and together, an etiological model of the (individual) eating disorder problems as well as the ability to change (therapy model) the problems is developed. When preparing for the psychotherapeutic treatment, the thera pist should consider a series of rules for conducting dialogue which can contribute to increasing the motivation for psychotherapy. For instance, it should be ensured that the patient has a good understanding of and is able to retain the explanatory model , that she finds it credible and is able to accept it for herself (Fiegenbaum, Freitag & Frank, 1992). When imparting a credible explanatory model, a broadly interactive approach is followed. The patient is guided to run through the explanatory model using her own examples. Through concrete questions, she is encouraged to draw her own conclusions, and importantly, is expressly asked to freely voice her reservations, doubts and questions and - if possible - to report on her own experiences which appear to be in conflict with the explanatory model. The therapist's task, following the method of guided discovery, lies in letting the patient answer the open questions herself and to work out the compatibility of her experiences with the model to explain the eating disorder. When conducting dialogue, the therapist takes care to anticipate possible objections and to integrate them into the explanatory model. This also applies to deriving the change model, i.e. for the therapy proposal. The patient is encouraged, irre spective of their practicability, to initially generate as many ideas for changing the problems as possible (e.g. continuing to diet but take vitamin tablets to \"compensate for\" nutritional deficiencies; eat a more diverse range of foods; do more exercise etc.). Following this, she is asked to imagine that from now on, she is going to change her eating behavior in a health -conducive direction (e.g. eating more regularly and eating a more balanced diet). Questions about her expectations regarding short - and long-term consequences are equally as important as questions relating to her ambivalence (e.g. \"which factors speak in favor of or against weight gain?\" etc.). At the end of the conversation, the therapist again summarizes the discussed advantages and disa dvantages of the therapy and - if the patient's health permits - allows some time for the patient to reflect, during which she can decide for or against the therapy. The autonomy of the decision, the repeated weighing up of advantages and disadvantages of the therapy on the basis of detailed information about the demands of therapy as well as possible consequences of non -treatment (e.g. continuation of the eating disorders; severe physical consequences such as cardiac arrhythmia or even cardiac arrest) have been found to be conducive to generating self -motivation and willingness to cooperate on the part of the patient. 6. Dialogue in the course of treatment The psychotherapeutic treatment of AN and BN is often a treatment of young people, specifically adolescent girls or young women. This brings with it important treatment implications, especially with regard to the therapeutic relationship (see Fichter & Her pertz, 2008). Adolescence and young adulthood constitutes a time of considerable psychosexual and social challenges. The formation of self -image (or self -esteem) is a continuous process which 73 begins in early childhood but certainly requires demanding devel opmental steps of the individual in the life phase of puberty, adolescence and young adulthood. In terms of shaping one's own \"private\" and professional life, it is a time of significant decisions and of the \"adult\" life experience that any decision also m eans, or at least can mean, a decision against something else, which can be felt in the most diverse areas of life. It is therefore all the more relevant to adopt a therapeutic stance which sees no insurmountable differences between a reflected, engaged pa rtiality and the necessary abstinence, and which can allow for a dynamic interplay of psychoeducational and genuine psychotherapeutic treatment strategies. Besides empathetic solidarity, this also includes \"putting one's foot down\" in the sense of providin g structure (e.g. that the regular participation in mealtimes is not discussed). The conflict between autonomy and dependency that is characteristic for this phase of life, and the associated ambivalent relationship towards the parents or guardians, is gen erally also reflected in the therapeutic relationship and can be utilized productively. Particularly the unspecific predictor variables of the psychotherapeutic process, such as interest, curiosity, commitment, authenticity and reliability are examined ver y critically against the background of the relationship with the parents/guardians (\"Are they really interested, is it genuine, can I rely on them?\"). Considerable conflicts with respect to self -esteem, which are characteristic for persons with eating dis orders, necessitate a psychotherapy in which the patient's resources are strengthened. The focus should be less on the deficits in the development so far, and more on the abilities and achievements. At the same time, it is necessary to work out the genesis of the problems with self-esteem, which is generally to be sought in interpersonal conflicts, especially with the parents (e.g. high achievement expectations, linking of recognition and affection with performance), in order to ultimately be able to gather corrective experiences. A transference relationship (e.g. paternal or maternal) which is benevolent and fosters the patient's resources provides the opportunity to make positive corrections to self -esteem, which can then be transferred from the therapy to other relationships. Therapeutic tasks, for example exposure to one's figure or the establishment of a changed eating style, are introduced as tasks through which the patient is able to discover, with the support of the therapist, to what extent the deve loped explanatory models are appropriate. Experience shows that such therapeutic tasks are linked to ambivalence (e.g. approach motivation on the one hand and avoidance motivation on the other), which can especially necessitate a motivating dialogue. Moreo ver, in the case of \"cumbersome\" therapeutic tasks (e.g. continuously filling out food logs), a style of dialogue is required which makes the necessity of the task clear to the patient without appearing to be \"lecturing\". For instance, the therapist can an ticipate the patient's feelings (e.g. annoyance) and behaviors (e.g. filling out the food logs retrospectively for the whole week) and emphasize that it is up to the patient whether she would like to choose the best therapy (i.e. tailored to her own proble ms) or the second - or third -best therapy. In this regard, it is important that the therapist has internalized this concept of self -responsibility for his/her therapy success as a therapeutic stance and is thus able to authentically impart it to the patient . Typical for the dialogue with patients with eating disorders is the active consideration of goals, wishes, feelings and thoughts throughout the course of the therapy. This also applies to the 74 phase of gradually ending the therapy (Hoffmann, 2009). Toget her with the patient, the therapist takes stock of the therapy goals which have been achieved and, if applicable, the therapeutic steps which are still necessary. Patients should become their own problem -solvers and should be actively included in the proce ss of ending the therapy. In the case of BED, an independent influence on the therapeutic relationship must be assumed with respect to the substantial overweight which is usually also present. In terms of the therapeutic process, these influencing variables have barely been examined in the past; however, psychotherapists are not immune to the (often unconscious) societal prejudices and discrimination against persons with obesity. Moreover, the understanding of the illness on the part of both the the rapist and the patient, especially if they diverge, is likely to have a decisive influence on the therapy process. Monocausal explanatory models (\"mind over matter\" vs. \"heavy -boned\") of both the therapist and the patient are not conducive to success and h arbor the risk either of discouraging the patient or of \"passing the buck\" in terms of relinquishing responsibility and thus also self -efficacy. For the psychotherapeutic work, it is much more important to determine, together with the patient, the framewor k within which weight loss and weight stabilization is possible (weight of parents and grandparents, age at onset of obesity, number of previous, frustrated weight loss attempts etc.). Furthermore, mental disorders and intra- and interpsychic problems in terms of cause and effect should be clarified in order to ultimately strengthen the patient's experience of self -esteem as a person with overweight or obesity. Particularly with regard to self -efficacy as an important determinant of the patient's self-esteem, a therapeutic stance which favors weight stabilization rather than weight loss is advantageous. 7. Informed consent vs. compulsory measures In rare cases, which almost exclusively concern patients with AN, the cognitive impairments and disorder sequel ae mean that it is no longer possible to assume a consequential decision - making ability on the part of the patient. In such cases, the responsibility for treatment decisions has to be assumed by other persons (generally by the physician). These compulsory measures (via placement according to the Mental Health Act, compulsory supervision or the involvement of psychosocial services, cf. Chapter 2.3.8 \"Compulsory treatment\" in the Guideline chapter V \"Anorexia nervosa\") should, of course, be explained to the p atient. All necessary treatment steps should likewise be explained to children and adolescents, and their consent should be sought. If minors refuse to participate in treatment, the treatment can also be initiated without explicit consent. However, the tr eatment then has to be approved by the family courts according to \u00a7 1631b of the German Civil Code (see Guideline chapter V \"Anorexia nervosa\" Chapter 2.3.8.4 \"Compulsory treatment of children and adolescents\"). 75 8. The role of family and friends An e ating disorder always also harbors interpersonal problems (impacts on family members, partner and friends). Frequently, dysfunctional patterns of interaction between the patient and other members of the family (of origin) can be assumed. Therefore, for all patients, it is necessary to clarify these reciprocal influences in the respective family context early on, during the diagnostic process. Family members and partners often feel helpless and desperate in the face of their loved one's eating disorder. This helplessness is often not a good guide in the attempt to behave \"correctly\" and helpfully, and often leads to strong feelings of guilt and/or aggressive, reproachful attitudes towards the patient. The integration of family and friends into the therapy sho uld be considered early on, irrespective of the therapeutic approach, under consideration of the patient's age, her interpersonal relationships (family, partner) and the degree of risk of the eating disorder. Moreover, the integration of family and friends provides the opportunity to obtain third -party anamnestic information. For children and adolescents, the integration of the parents into the therapeutic process is among the most important pillars of the treatment. Providing the family members with inform ation has an important, especially fear - allaying function for the treatment. Even prior to the therapy, family and friends require information in order to be able to cooperate effectively. Generally speaking, the information should be provided in the prese nce of the patient and can include: the causes of eating disorders the maintaining conditions prognosis and expected course physical risks and possible consequential damage appropriate treatment options individual treatment planning methods of psychotherapy risks and possible side effects of treatment recommendations for dealing with the patient The inclusion of family members can have positive, but also negative impacts on the therapeutic relationship and/or the psychotherapy (e.g. in the case of problematic family constellations such as sexual abuse, experiences of violence; in adolescent patients who want to emancipate themselves from their parents). In the individual case, it is necessary to clarify whether the inclusion of the family is use ful or whether it should be forgone despite the considerable positive evidence. In adolescence, the parents should be included in the therapy wherever possible. In the case of outpatient and day -clinic treatment, they are essential \"co -therapists\". If fami ly members are included in the treatment, it is necessary to adhere to the usual professional parameters (e.g. duty of confidentiality, communication with family members in the presence of the patient, avoiding the formation of coalitions). In 2015, the German Society for Eating Disorders (DGESS) published patient guidelines that also address the families of persons with eating disorders (Zeeck & Herpertz, 2016). The 76 Federal Centre for Health Education (BZgA) provides diverse information for families in t he form of brochures and on the Internet (www.bzga -essstoerungen.de). Information about themes relating to family members for a multitude of mental disorders is provided, for example, by the Federal Association of Families of People with Mental Illness (BA pK, http://www.bapk.de). Patient and family guides can also be found in bookshops. In many large towns and cities, there are contact points, information offices and advisory services in the area of self -help, which provide lists and contact details of self -help groups. Useful information can also be found on many internet portals. However, other internet portals should be viewed critically, especially if they trivialize or even glorify eating disorders, and extol them as a \"lifestyle\" (e.g. so -called \"Pro-Ana\" or \"Pro Halperin & Franko, 2016). In the case of psychological strain, feelings of being overburdened or mental disorders of one's own, professional help for family members can also be useful. Recommendations Within the framework of the diagnosis and psychotherapy of eating disorders, a sustainable therapeutic relationship should be established . Patients should receive information about their eating disorder (etiology, pathogenesis), t heir prognosis, as well as various forms of treatment including the effictiveness and side effects thereof (e.g. with regard to weight). Prevailing treatment standards of the respective institution should be described during a pre liminary discussion . In relation to the ambivalence towards changing the eating disorder symptoms, interventions to increase the motivation to change should be employed at the beginning of and/or during the treatment . For children and adolescents with an eating disorder diagnosis, the inclusion of famil y members should be considered . Table 1 : Example of aspects of dialogue within the strategy \"depathologization\" (cited from Tuschen -Caffier et al., 2005) Type of problem Examples for depathologization Failed attempts to lose weight in the case of obesity Reference to genetic aspects that make it more difficult to reach or maintain a certain weight. Dieting as a trigger for BN Dieting is widespread in our society, new diets are constantly being promoted in the media. Unwillin gness to talk about the eating problem in the case of AN If the patient has been sent by her parents (the doctor etc.), point out that the behavior is easy to grasp and understand. Verbalization of thoughts and feelings that 77 the therapist, for example, wou ld have if he was in the patient's shoes (e.g. anger towards the parents, skepticism whether the therapist is secretly an \"accomplice\" of the parents). Binge eating in the case of BN Point out that the body is reacting perfectly normally: If the body does n't always get enough food and is malnourished, it will catch up on what it needs. Stress as a trigger for binge eating in the case of BED Eating is initially a \"good\" problem solver; you're tired, you distract yourself from unpleasant feelings, food tas tes good.

Symptoms and diagnostic criteria 1.1. Symptoms In AN, the emergence or maintenance of underweight occurs due to a restriction of or insufficient increase in energy intake (in the case of growth / intensive exercise). The body weight lies below that expected based on the sufferer's gender, height and age. Despite being underwe ight, sufferers are afraid of being and/or becoming fat. However, they may not report or consciously perceive this fear. The whole body or parts of the body are deemed as \"too fat\", despite the underweight (body image disturbance). For most patients, self -esteem depends to a large degree on their shape and weight, and for others, controlling their weight represents success in exerting sufficient self -control. Food intake is restricted - generally by limiting the amount of food or by a selective choice of foods (avoidance of fats and/or carbohydrates). This may be compounded by excessive exercise, self -induced vomiting or abuse of laxatives, thyroid medications or diuretics. Some patients with type I diabetes accept high blood sugar levels in order to reduce the uptake of sugar into the cells. Many patients develop eating rituals, which most frequently consist of eating slowly, cutting food into small pieces and a highly selective combination of foods. In the course of the illness, bingeing occurs in some pati ents, which in most cases is accompanied by \"purging behavior\" (self -induced vomiting, laxative abuse etc.). The food restriction has consequences on the physical and psychological level. The malnutrition affects most of the important organs, potentially l eading to life -threatening states. Among other things, a disturbance of the endocrine system occurs, which in women and girls is reflected in a suspension of menses. Decreased bone density associated with altered hormone levels is often only partially reve rsible. In children, a delay in puberty with an absence of menarche and a stagnation of physical development and stunted growth can arise. On the psychological level, a positive feeling of lightness, control and euphoria often initially prevails, which lat er switches to indiffer ence, irritability and depressed mood. Often, rigid thinking, a strong need for control - extending to compulsive thinking and behavior - conflict avoidance and difficulties in dealing with negative affect (above all anger and rage ) as well as a lack of spontan eity are apparent. These traits can be strengthened in the case of pronounced underweight. A large proportion of patients with AN show problematic exercise behavior (Shroff et al., 2006) , which can range from a strong psyc homotor unrest due to starvation in the case of extreme underweight (Ehrlich et al., 2009) , through compulsive exerci se (Davis et al. , 1993; 82 Meyer & Taranis, 2011) to exercise addiction in the narrower sense (Cunningham et al. , 2016; Zeeck & Schlegel, 2013) . Patients' outwardly visible underweight leads to concerned reactions in their environment, especially from parents, teachers, friends and partners. These reactions - e.g. increased attention - can unintentionally become secondary reinforcers of the illness (Salerno et al., 2016) . The danger which the underweight entails is mostly negated by the sufferers themselves; many show little or no insight into their illness. This also explains why patients with AN ty pically do not seek help of their own volition, but often initially only at the urging of family, friends, teachers or superiors. As the disorder begins in most cases in puberty and adolescence, it leads to an impairment in psychological and physical devel opment during an important life phase (Herpertz -Dahlmann, 2015a) . Delays in school or professional development often arise. If the disorder progresses over many years, AN can become part of the individual's identity which she f inds difficult to relinquish. 1.2. Diagnostic criteria Table 4.1 presents the ICD -10 criteria for AN (F50.0), which are provisionally valid until 2022 They comprise underweight (BMI < 17.5 kg/m\u00b2 in adults or falling below the 10th age percentile for children and adolescents), body image disturbance, and the presence of an endocrine disorder (or a delay in the sequence of pubertal development steps). A distinction is made between a type with (F50.1) and without (F50.00) active measures for weight loss. In the ICD -11, underweight will be defined through a BMI < 18.5 kg/m\u00b2 in adults and falling below the 5th age percentile in children and adolescents (http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/revision/en/). Therefore, the new criteria includ e a substantially larger group of patients than previously. The underweight cannot be attributable to another illness or the unavailability of food. The revision will be oriented to the US classification system DSM -5. However, the weight criterion for chil dren and adolescents should be seen critically, as a lower threshold is set than for adults, even though the consequences of chronic starvation are more serious for children and adolescents4. Measures which hinder the restoration of a normal body weight ar e subsumed in a second diagnostic criterion - this includes restrictive eating, self -induced vomiting, laxative abuse and excessive exercise. A third criterion refers to body perception: Despite being underweight, the body is perceived either as normal/ \"t oo fat\" (body image disturbance), or body weight and shape are central for self - evaluation (see table 4.1). For the ICD-11, due to the prognostic relevance, a differentiation between two types according to the extent of underweight is suggested: AN with si gnificantly low body weight (BMI < 18.5kg/m\u00b2 and > 14.0kg/m\u00b2 or between the 5th and the 0.3rd percentile) as well as AN with dangerously low body weight (BMI < 14 kg/m\u00b2 or < 0.3rd age percentile), with a distinction between a restrictive type and a \"binge -purging type\" in each group. 4 For an adolescent who has just turned 18 years of age, the 5th BMI age percentile corresponds to approx. 17.6 kg/m\u00b2. For an 17 .11-year-old girl (162 cm, 48kg, kg/m\u00b2: 11th percentile. 83 The revised version of the \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual\" (DSM -5; American Psychiatric Association, 2013) contains the following changes from the DSM -IV (see table 4.1): The criterion of an endocrine disorder has been drop ped, as it is difficult to apply in female patients before the me narche, in men, and in women taking contraceptives. A fear of weight gain or of becoming \"fat\" does not necessarily have to be expressed - the criterion is seen as fulfilled if behaviors are observed which interfere with weight gain despite a low weight. Underweight is defined as \"significantly low body weight\", i.e. a weight which lies below the minimum of normal weight (the minimum of normal weight in adults corresponds to a BMI of 18.5 kg/m \u00b2). Furthermore, the DSM -5 no longer speaks of \"refusal\" to maintain a normal weight because this formulation implies a conscious, willful and controllable management of behavior (Hebebrand & Bulik, 2011) . The subdivision into two types (restrictive type, binge - eating/purging type) has been retained and additionally contains a time criterion: The respective behavior must have occurred during the last three months. In addition, a partial or full remission can be coded, as can a level of severity. The latter is primarily defined according to the degree of underweight. The severity of symptoms and the degree of functional impairment, however, should be included in the evaluation (see table 5). It should be noted here that there is not yet a uniform definition of the level of severity, and the criteria vary substantially: The DSM -5 already speaks of extreme AN from a BMI < 15 kg/m\u00b2, while for the ICD -11, a \"significantly low body weight\" at a BMI < 14 kg/m\u00b2 is currently being suggested. With the respect to the categorization of eating disorders, it should be kept in mind that in the course of illness, transitions between the different forms of eating di sorders can occur, which are not considered by the classification systems. It can be assumed that in approx. a third to a half of cases, AN later transitions into BN (Bulik et al. , 1997; Eddy et al., 2008) . Moreover, the question of the extent to which a division into subgroups of AN is appropriate currently remains unresolved (Peterson et al., 2016) . On a further critical note, male patients with anorexia nervosa are underrepresented in studies, and both the diagnostic criteria and the currently existing instruments to assess body image are oriented to females (Murray et al., 2017). 1.3. Comorbidity AN frequently shows comorbidities with other mental illnesses, particularly depression, anxiety disorders or obsessive -compulsive disorders (Milos et al. , 2003; O\u00b4Brien & Vincent, 2003) . An increased rate of personality disorders has further been found (Martinussen et al. 2017, Farstad et al. 2016). The few existing studies investigating psychological comorbidity in adoles cent patients with AN point to similarly high comorbidity rates (B\u00fchren et al., 2014; Salbach -Andrae et al., 2008; Swanson, 2011) . The assessment of addition al disorders provides important hints regarding etiology, type of eating disorder pathology, treatment success and prognosis (Lilenfeld et al., 2006) . However, the relationships between symptoms of anorexia and comorbid disorders are complex. To date, it remains unclear to what extent comorbid disorders are the cause or the consequence of AN, or else the result of a mutual predisposing fa ctor. In the course of illness, a reciprocal influence occurs, which needs to be taken into account during therapy. 84 Data on the prevalence of depressive disorders in AN vary strongly, from 31 to 89 % (Godart et al., 2007) ; overall, a lifetime prevalence of 40 % (compared to 15.9% in the population) is assumed. The state of starvation appears to play a role in the high prevalence rates, possibly also by exacerbating a predisposition to depressive reactions (O\u00b4Brien & Vincent, 2003) . Data on the prevalence of obsessive -compulsive disorders lie at 15 to 69 % for lifetime prevalence (Serpell et al. , 2002) and at 15 to 29 % for point prevalence in clinical samples (Herzog et al. , 1992; T hornton & Russell, 1997) . There appears to be a particularly high comorbidity of obsessive -compulsive disorders and AN in males. In a large Swedish register study, females who had first been diagnosed with obsessive -compulsive disorder had a 16 -fold inc reased risk of suffering from AN, whereas m ales had a 37 -fold increased ri sk (Cederl\u00f6f et al., 2015) . Around a third of patients with AN show a least one comorbid anxiety disorder (primarily social phobia), of whom around two thirds report that this preceded the AN and already existed in childho od (Godart et al. , 2002; 2008; Swinbourne et al., 2012) . The prevalence of alcohol abuse or dependency lies between 9 and 25 % and is typically found in the binge/purge subtype (Baker et al., 2010; Bulik et al., 2004; Root et al., 2010) . Moreover, patients with AN and their families show increased rates of autism spectrum disorders, although a shared genetic predisposition should not be assumed (Koch et al., 2015) . Furthermore, AN patients show an increased risk of dev eloping attention -deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and vice versa (Nazar et al., 2016) . In almost a half of adult patients, comorbid personality disorders are present. The four most frequent personality disorders, in descending order of frequency, are obsessive -compulsive, avoidant, dependent and borderline personality disorders 2016; Martinussen et al., 2017) . Besides cat egorical personality disorders, there are increased associations between AN and personality traits (dimensional), above all higher perfectionism, neuroticism, avoidance motivation and reward sensitivity as well as low levels of extraversion and self -regula tion capacity (Farstad et al., 2016) . It is assumed that the type of eating disorder is co -determined by premorbid personality traits. 1.4. Differentia l diagnosis Weight loss should always be taken as a serious indicator of a potentially severe physical disease. All diseases which are linked to weight loss are part of the differential diagnostic spectrum of AN. If psychological causes are present, in most cases, it is sufficient to identify the reasons for the weight loss and reduced food consumption. However, it is possible that a not yet diagnosed organic disease leads to a secondary disorder of eating behavior, meaning that even in cases in which th e psychological nature of the eating disorder initially appears to be obvious, differential diagnostic vigilance remains advisable. At this point, only those differential diagnoses are addressed which are especially liable to be confused with AN. In partic ular, gluten -sensitive enteropathy, termed \"celiac disease\" in its child and adolescent form, often gives rise to confusion (Grenet et al. , 1972; Leffler et al., 2007 a; Leffler et al. , 2007 b; Ricca et al., 200 6). This is due to the early and insidious onset of the disease and the interaction with the resulting nutritional disturbance and the parenting behavior of the parents. Celiac disea se leads not only to weight loss and delayed longitudinal growth, but often also to 85 disordered eating behavior. The occurrence of BN has also been observed in the framework of a gluten -sensitive enteropathy (Jost et al., 2005) . For differential diagnosis, the specific gliadin and endomysial antibodies alone are not sufficient. A duodenal biopsy to provide evidence of the characteristic villous atrophy should be carried out in any case of doubt. Often, the diagnosis of gluten -sensitive enteropathy is only made in adulthood, after many years. The onset of the chronic inflammatory bowel diseases Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis most frequently occurs between the ages of 14 and 26, and thus at an age when eating disorders are also at their most frequent. While ulcerative colitis is generally correctly identified due to the typical symptoms with bloody diarrhea, the symptoms of Crohn's disease are more diverse and can occasion ally be confused with AN. Endocrinological causes of underweight are not always easy to detect, but mostly show characteristic accompanying symptoms. These disorders include: Primary or secondary hypocortisolism Hyperthyroidism Panhypopituitarism Autoimmun e polyglandular syndrome Insulin -deficient diabetes leads to a very rapid weight loss, which cannot be sufficiently explained by reduced appetite and food consumption. The diagnosis is straightforward if the symptoms are correctly interpreted. Chronic lung or kidney diseases can also lead to an accompanying cachexia, which in individual cases can be confused with AN. A decrease in renal function with pre -uremia can also occur as a consequence of chronic volume loss and of hypokalemia. In such cases, the cre atinine levels can be misleading, as in the case of AN, they are correlated with the considerably reduced muscle mass. As pre -uremia is linked to a loss of appetite and a resulting reduction in food intake (Carrero, 2009; Carrero et al., 2008) , the joint occurrence of renal failure and anorexia can occasionally be causally related. In such mixed forms of AN and uremic anorexia, dialysis can lead to an improvement in eating behavior. 1.5. Etiology In etiological terms, AN can be assumed to be multicausal in nature, with an interaction of biological (genetic factors), psychological and environmental factors (family, cultural) (Trea sure et al., 2015; Zipfel et al. , 2015) . The examination of risk factors which are decisive for the etiological understanding is strongly impeded in the case of AN due to the low prevalence of the disorder. The majority of previous longitudinal investig ations do not allow for an evaluation of full -blown AN, or for a differentiated consideration of the individual eating disorder groups. Moreover, to date, little is known about the interaction as well as the specificity of individual risk factors. Sociocultural aspects AN appears to manifest independently of culture, although the prevalence is higher in Western industrialized nations than in non -industrialized countries (Hoek et al., , 2016) . In contrast to BN, the occurrence of AN on the 86 African and South American continent is rare, which also suggests differing genetic risks or gene -environme nt interactions (Kolar et al. , 2016; van Hoeken et al., 2016) . Sociocultural models of the etiology of eating disorders predominantly see the internalization of the thin beauty ideal propagated in Western countries, and the frequently associated dissatisfa ction with one's own body, as risk factors for disordered eating or a reduction in food intake ( (Stice & Whitenton, 2002) ; for an overview, see (Culbert et al. , 2015) ). Prospective follow -up studies show that young women who are dissatisfied with their own body have an increased risk of developing disordered eating behavior (Ghaderi & Scott, 2001; Killen et al., 1996; McKnight Investigators, 2003) . Furthermore, experimental studies have demonstrated that exposure to media which portray a thinness ideal leads to a slight increase in dissatisfaction with one's own body, e specially in risk groups (for a meta -analysis, see (Hausenblas et al., 2013) ). However, prospective studies hav e not yet been able to demonstrate that the risk of full -fledged anorexia nervosa also increases. According to cross -sectional studies, recreational and elite athletes in the esthetically characterized sport types such as gymnastics, ballet and dance, as w ell as in endurance sports (e.g. distance running) and sports with weight specifications (e.g. boxing, wrestling) can be seen as risk groups for the development of AN (Sundgot -Borgen & Torstveit, 2004; Tseng et al., 2007) . Genetic and neurobiological aspects The high transmission of AN in families suggests a shared genetic predisposition. Based on twin studies , the heritability of AN is estimated to lie between 48 and 76 % (e.g. (Bulik et al., 2006; Klump et al. , 2001; Kortegaard et al. , 2001) . Compared to women without a family predisposition, female first -degree relatives show an 11 -fold higher risk of also developing full - blown AN. Women have an approximately 10 -fold higher risk of developing AN compared to men (Jacobi et al. , 2004) . Moreover, there is mounting evidence that testosterone represents a protective factor in terms of the development of eating disorders, although the biological mechanisms underlying this association remain unclear (Culbert et al., 2015) . Preterm birth and perinatal complications appear to slightly increase the risk of developing AN. However, this relationship is subject to controversial debate in the literature, as previous studies have not sufficiently controlled for genetic and environmental factors (Krug et al. , 2013; Raevuori et al., 2014) . Molecular genetic investigations suggest that not one individual genetic defect, but rather numerous genes, and to differing extents, contribute to the development of the different phenotypical characteristics of AN (Yilmaz et al. , 2015) . For many years, the findings on candidate genes of AN were inconsistent, with two genome -wide association studies (GWAS) yielding no significant results (Boraska et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2011) . A GWAS published in 2017 (Duncan et al., 2017) , showed, for the first time, one significan t locus in a gene region on chromosome 12 (rs4622308), for which significant loci have already been found for type 1 diabetes and autoimmune diseases. Results on a comparison between an earlier GWAS on AN (GCAN, Borasko et al., 2014) and another on Body Ma ss Index (GIANT, Lock et al., 2015) point to possibly similar gene variants for a lower BMI which also predispose to AN (Hinney et al., 201 7). Similar comparative approaches (genetic correlations) yielded positive genetic associations with schizophrenia, o bsessive -compulsive disorders, neuroticism, autoimmune diseases and educational level, as well as indications of negative associations with metabolic 87 markers such as unfavorable lipid phenotypes (Bulik -Sullivan et al., 2015; Duncan et al., 2017; Mas et al., 2013) . Data from a Finnish register study supported the indications regarding autoimmune diseases (Raevuori et al., 2014) , although this association also seems to applies to other mental illnesses. The state of acute underw eight is associated with changed levels of a multitude of hormones and other signal peptides. For instance, leptin, sex hormones and thyroid hormones are strongly reduced, while cortisol and the appetite -stimulating hormones ghrelin and Agouti related Protein (AGRP) are increased (Merle et al., 2011; Schorr & Miller, 2016) . The extent to which these changes merely reflect an adaptation response to acute underweight or are predisposing factors for the disorder remains to be clarified. Besides the molecular -biological and endocrinological investigations, the structural and funct ional imaging of the brain (PET, structural/functional MRI) opens up new possibilities to gain a better understanding of the neurobiological aspects of AN. In persons with underweight, clear and relatively global reductions of grey (and presumably also whi te) matter are found, which are completely or partially reversible with weight gain (Bernardoni et al., 2016; King et al., n.d.; Seitz et al., 2016) . The results of studies using functional magnetic resonance tomography are heterogeneous, but there is increasing evidence of changes in brain regions that can be related to reward and cognitive control (O'Hara et al. , 2015; Phillipou et al. , 2014; Wierenga et al., 2014) . In recovered patients, changes have been found in the se rotonergic and domapinergic neurotransmitter system in the area of the prefrontal and medial temporal cortex as well as the ventral striatum, pointing to a possible dysregulation in the reward system and in affect regulation (Kaye et al. , 2013) . Individual and developmental -psychological factors Disordered eating behavior (e.g. feeding disorder) as well as increased gastrointestinal problems in infancy and toddlerhood are associated with a higher risk of developing AN (Kotler et al. , 2001; Marchi & Cohen, 1990; R\u00e5Stam, 1992) . Mainly based on retrospective studies, the following characteristics have been discussed as potential risk factors for the development of AN: increased drive for thinness and restrictive eating (Jacobi et al., 2004; Stice, 2002; Striegel - Moore & Bulik, 2007) self -esteem and a negative self -concept (Bulik al., 2006; 2003; 2016) anxious -avoidant Ranson, 2005; Lilenfeld et al., 2006) as well as insecure attachment patterns (Jewell et al., 2016) . According to a recent prospective longitudinal study, the combination of increase d drive for thinness and increased anxiety/depressiveness at the age of 16-17 years predicts increased occurrence of AN at the age of 19 -20 years (Pe\u00f1as -Lled\u00f3 et al., 2015) . Difficulties in expressing and processing socio -emotional signals and in affect regulation (Caglar -Nazali et al., 2014; Treasure & Schmidt, 2013) as well as a cognitive style characterized by cognitive inflexibility and a strong attention to detail (Lang et al. , 2014; Wu et al. , 2013) are also increasingly being discussed as potential risk factors. For instance, an impai red cognitive flexibility and a reduced ability to interpret socio -emotional signals was also found in first - degree relatives of AN patients (Holliday et al. , 2005; Kothari et , 2013) . From a developmental -psychological perspective, given the primary onset of the disorder in puberty, it is discussed whether girls who develop AN have greater difficulties in coping with age-typical developmental steps. Significant in this developmental stage are, among other 88 factors, dealing with physical maturation and the associated change in body image as well as the development of a sense of identity as a woman, the separation from primary caregivers and the development of an autonomous, adult self (Gander et al. , 2015) . Family -related factors The longitudinal studies conducted to date do not allow for a differentiation of the extent to which particular family structures and interactions constitute a risk for the development of AN, or are the consequence of the disorder (Button et al. , 1996; Calam, 1998; Holtom -Viesel -sectional studies suggest that pathological family structures and functions are assoc iated rather with the severity and chronicity of AN and are less of etiological relevance (Jacobi et al., 2004; Raenker et al., 2013) . See also \"Prognostically relevant factors\" in this regard. Prognostically relevant factors So far, there are no prospective investigations spe cifically examining the influence of prognostically relevant factors, or their experimental change, with respect to the course of symptoms. Information on prognostically relevant and maintaining factors are largely based on observational and intervention s tudies. Research on predictors has revealed that a lower BMI, a long duration of illness, and higher age at the time of the study are associated with an unfavorable course (Vall & Wade, 2015; Zerwas et al., 2013) . Among the psychosocial predictors which have been linked to a favorabl e course are purging behavior (or impulsivity), high self -esteem, a lower eating disorder psychopathology, a high treatment motivation and the lack of comorbid depression and trait anxiety (Berkman et al. , 2007; Vall & Wade, 2015) . Moreover, psychotherapy studies have indicated a lower response in patients with an avoidant personality disorder (Zerwas et al., 2013) . Insufficient weight gain in the early phase of treatment wa s linked to a lower remission rate after one year (Nazar et al., 2017) . Moreover, excessive -compulsive e xercise appears to be related to higher dropout rates, poorer treatment outcomes and higher relapse rates (Bratland - Sanda et al., 2010; 2001; Strober et al., 1997b) . Family therapy intervention studies have repeatedly shown that pathological family interactions - such as a high degree of parental criticism - are associated with a more negative outcome (Eisler et al. , 2007; Holtom et al. , 2016) . Furthermore, the consequences of starvation appear to substantially contribute to the maintenance of psychopathology and illness (Treasure et al., 2015) . 1.6. Course of illness Generally speaking, the course of illness reaches over several years and is highly va riable. Recovery in the first two years is rare. In a study by Herzog et al. (Herzog et al. , 1997) , the mean duration until recovery lay at six years. However, the available longitudinal studies refer to patients who utilized medical or psychological help. There are barely any data on untreated cases, meaning that the rate of spontaneous remission is largely unclear. A Finnish longitudinal study in twin cohorts showed that 50% of cases of AN were not even detected by the health care system. After five years, 67 % showed a normalized weight, were menstruating again, and 89 indicated neither binges nor self -induced vomiting (Keski -Rahkonen et al., 2007) . Nevertheless, many sufferers continue to show clear problems in the longer term even after remission, in the area of social integration and interpersonal relationships (Wentz et al. , 2009) . A review by Steinhausen (2002) , which included 119 studies with 5590 patients, reported recovery rates of just under 50 %, while 30 % of patients achieved partial remission and 20 % showed a chronic course. In the longer term, 60 -73% reached an appropriate weight. A further review by Berkman et al. (2007) included 22 longitudinal studies on AN: A prospective cohort study (Gothenburg study; N = 51) reported a good outcome according to the Morgan -Russell criteria (symptom severity was rated according to weight, menstruation status, psychological and social s ituation) in 50 % of patients; 10 % showed a chronic course after ten years. Case series which applied the same criteria found a good outcome i n 28 to 58 % and a poor outcome in 11 to 42 % of cases (follow -up periods between six and twelve years) (Berkman et al., 2007) . The comparability of studies is limited due to the different definitions of remission and treatment outcome (Pike, 1998) as well as the fact that in general, only treated patients wer e assessed. Overall, AN shows the highest mortality rate of all mental disorders, due to suicide and consequences of malnutrition. A meta -analysis revealed that the standardized mortality rate lies at 5.9% (Arcelus, 2011) . Worldwide, from among over 300 assessed physical and mental illnesses, AN and BN together la y in 12th place as a primary reason for disability -adjusted life years (DALY\u00b4s) among 15 -19-year-old girls (Erskine et al. , 2016; Hoek, 2016) . A Swedish study in patients in inpatient treatment indicated, however, that mortality rates are declining. The authors related this to an improved care in special ist units (including, among other things, nutrition management, suicide prevention) (Lindblad et al. , 2006) . The prognosis for young patients, or those with an illness onset before the age of 16 years, has clearly improved over the last two decades, and in most cases appears to be more favorable than in adult patients or those with an illness onset in adulthood (Herpertz -Dahlmann, 2015b) . However, there is only a limited number of follow -up studies. In individual cases, a complete recovery following a first episode can be observed, especially when the physical and social development has been unremarkable up until that point, and the development of the eating disorder was preceded by an identifiable, burdensome life event (e.g. loss of a family member) (North et al. , 1997) . In 10 -year follow -up studies (Herpertz -Dahlmann et al., 2001; Strober et al., 1997 b; Wentz et al. , 2001) and an 18 -year follow -up study (Wentz et al., 2009) , for the first time, no deaths were found in follow -ups of adolescent cohorts in first inpatient treatment. 2. Th erapy For the treatment of AN, there are essentially three possible treatment settings: the inpatient setting, the partial inpatient/day -clinic setting, and the outpatient setting. More intensive treatment settings (inpatient therapy, day -clinic treatment or a combination of therapy approaches in the outpatient framework, e.g. individual and group therapy as well as body psychotherapy) are indicated if the development process within outpatient psychotherapy has stagnated or a deterioration has even occurre d. This can refer both to weight development (which is the most important parameter) and to the psychological and/or social situation. 90 As the recovery process generally encompasses a period of many months - if not years (see section 1.6), an \"overall treat ment plan\" is necessary, in which different settings can constitute successive stages of therapy. Due to the danger of chronification, treatm ent should take place as quickly as possible and primarily have a psychotherapeutic orientation, but should also consider physical and nutrition -related problems in addition to psychological a spects (Hay et al., 2014) . As treatment should take place as early and in as timely a manner as possible, in the case of longer waiting times for outpatient psychotherapy, i t may be necessary to consider day - clinic or inpatient treatment in order to combat chronification. In individual cases, due to physical risks or a low insight into the illness, an inpatient treatment can be necessary as an initial treatment stage (Wilson et al. , 2000) , meaning that the principle of \"stepped care\" is not appropriate in all cases for AN. The treatment of AN almost a lways involves several treatment providers: besides psychotherapists (individual and family sessions), a general practitioner/family doctor or specialist physician, and where necessary social workers, nutri tionists , and special therapists (e.g. body therapists). A close coordination between these treatment providers is necessary - particularly in the outpatient area and across sectoral boundaries. However, due to the framework conditions of the health system in Germ any, this does not always take place to a sufficient degree. A continuity of treatment (as few changes as possible in the responsible contact partners) should be striven for. General practitioners/family doctors and specialist physicians play a key role i n the initial detection of AN and in the accompanying physical care. They should motivate sufferers to accept specialist psychological care. An additional social -therapeutic support can be helpful if there are problems regarding school, training, job or li ving situation. For children and adolescents, it should be carefully checked on a case -by-case basis whether patients are still physically capable, for instance, of taking part in physical education classes or of attending school. Incremental limitations a re often necessary in the framework of outpatient treatment in order to counteract a further weight loss. Any consulted nutritionist should have expertise in dealing with patients with AN. Patients themselves often have in -depth knowledge about nutrition ( especially calorie contents), but are not able to implement this in a healthy form in everyday life. Detailed counting of calories, or support of a diet rich in raw foods, which may be advisable in other persons, are counterproductive for patients with AN . In some cases, however, it can be difficult to differentiate between food intolerances, eating habits (vegetarians, vegans), or selective food choices caused by the eating disorder. Families and important caregivers are often heavily burdened. If there ar e no reasons to speak against it (e.g. lack of consent of the patient), these persons should be provided with sufficient information and support. For children and adolescents, it is essential to incorporate family members into the treatment. Advice center s offer low -threshold options for dialogue, which can be a first step in seeking help for patients with AN. In this respect, advice center employees are tasked with providing information and referral to psychotherapeutic treatment. Psychotherapeutic interv entions in narrower sense are reserved for licensed psychotherapists. The respective advice center should have experience in dealing with patients with anorexia and be subject to regular quality assurance. 91 Residential groups play a role in Germany particul arly in supporting adolescents and young adults as well as in caring for chronically ill patients. Placement in a therapeutic residential group should be considered, for example, if support in the home environment is not sufficient or conducive to health. A residential group can also be considered, however, if an eating disorder has become chronic, which has led to a pronounced social isolation and/or problems in coping with everyday life. Suitable residential groups should show a specific concept for carin g with persons with eating disorders. For adolescents, the youth welfare service is responsible, through \u00a7 35a SGB VIII of the German Social Code (integration assistance for minors with mental illness), which must be applied for by the caregivers to the yo uth welfare office of the place of residence (\"place of habitual residence\"). Children and adolescents are eligible. Over the age of 18, integration assistance as support for young adults (\u00a7 41 SGB VIII) can also be continued over the age of 21, but must f irst also be applied for by patients upon reaching legal adulthood. In the case of a threat of or already existing chronification, outpatient or inpatient integration assistance is necessary, if during the inpatient treatment, a stabilization of symptoms a nd of the living situation has not been achieved to the extent that a reintegration into the living environment existing before the illness is possible. Here, issues of jurisdiction often arise, which have to be solved on a case -by-case basis. Care gaps o r shortfalls exist in Germany with regard to specific offers for patients with a severe, long-lasting course of illness, in the treatment of severely underweight patients with a need for medical supervision (internal -psychosomatic medicine wards) and in te rms of specific offers for patients who first need to be motivated to undergo treatment (e.g. as they can be provided in the framework of specialized outpatient clinics). An observational study indicated that specialized outpatient offers contribute to red ucing the overall rates of inpatient admissions as well as of treatment costs (House et al., 2012) . 2.1. Treatment aims The aims of treatment for AN are as follows: a.) the restoration and maintenance of a body weight appropriate for the patient's age and height b.) a normalization of eating behavior c.) treatment of the physical sequelae of eating behavior and underweight d.) influencing the difficulties underlying the disorder on the emotional, cognitive and interactional level e.) fostering social integration, which is often linked to \"catching up\" on missed developmental steps. The procedure and objectives of treatment should be openly discussed against the background of the often fluctuating motivation and strong ambivalence (detailed information and education), t o enable, if possible, an agreement between patient, therapist and where necessary family members. In very rare cases, a treatment against the patient's will can be necessary (see section 2.1.2.). 92 In the case of a still short duration of illness , the norm alization of eating and weight is of the highest priority in order to prevent chronification. As insight into the illness is often limited - particularly in children and adolescents - guardians or close family members also need to assume, and often also en force, important tasks and decisions in the first treatment phase with regard to the treatment to be conducted. On the other hand, an important task of adolescence is to develop autonomy. This means that with increasing stabilization of weight and eating behavior, the patient's ability to deal with conflict and to set boundaries should be strengthened, and it is also necessary to address conflicts with close attachment figures. Despite intensive therapeutic efforts, the majority of patients show residual sy mptoms of the disorder following treatment, necessitating respective information prior to treatment and a good aftercare. The end of any AN treatment should include a \"relapse prevention\" (Fairburn, 2008) . Among other things, patients should be prepared for the fact that a renewed strengthening of their symptoms might occur following therapy, but that this does not have to spell disaster if they are able to draw on the coping patterns developed in therapy. Of central importance in AN is the consideration of deficits in social and/or school and professional integration. Interventions which can be helpful in this regard are t hose which foster (re-)integration, such as school visits or work trials when the patient is still in the clinic, the discharge from inpatient treatment t o a subsequent day -clinic treatment stage, an accompanying support by a social worker or supervision i n a residential group specializing in patients with eating disorders. For patients with a \" severe and enduring anorexia nervosa \" (Robinson et al. , 2015) , it is necessary to decide individually and together with the patient to what extent the aim of treatment can be a normalization of weight an d eating behavior in the sense of recovery (this can still be possible after many years of illness), or whether the primary focus should be on improving quality of life, social integration and physical state in the sense of reducing and limiting the negati ve consequences of the eating disorder (Hay et al., 2014) . This is a flexible (\"very small steps, achievable goals\") procedure that is aligned to the individual patient, which takes into account general influencing factors such as credibility, empath y, acceptance and understanding (Hay et al., 2014; Kaplan, 2002) . 2.1.1. Prerequisites for treatment Generally speaking, patients with AN are highly ambivalent towards changing their weight and eating behavior. The psychological consequences of hunger and underweight (e.g. cognitive impairments, rigidity, depressivity) additionally impair the ability to s how insight into the disorder, the treatment motivation and the collaboration in the therapeutic process (Treas ure et al., 2015) . The symptoms of the eating disorder are often largely perceived as ego -syntonic (Kaplan & Garfinkel, 1999; Vitousek et al. , 1998) . Accordingly, premature treatment dropout constitutes a frequent problem in the treatment of AN (Mahon, 2000) , and the motivation for change has proven to be a relevant predictor of treatment outcome (see e.g. Carter et al., 2012; McHugh, 2007) . In children and adolescents, the still limited ability for introspection and insight in this age group further reduces the willingness for treatment. At the same time, patients at the beginning of puberty reach a si tuation of physical danger more rapidly due to the still significantly lower 93 body fat percentage. Therefore , for this age group, the time frame for outpatient treatment - if eating and weight do not quickly improve - is narrower. In the case of an illness -related cognitive impairment due to the starvation process or severe weight phobia, a treatment also without explicit consent of the adolescent should be initiated even if there is not yet any immediate life -threatening danger (see chapter 2.1.2 \"Compulso ry treatment\"). This leads to an disorder -determined limitation of autonomy which must be tackled later on with the adolescent, but also with the family. In this age group, it is also important not to overlook the severity of illness in patients with atypi cal AN, if they do not fulfill the full criteria for AN despite considerable weight loss (premorbid overweight). These patients do not significantly differ from patients with typical AN in terms of severity of physical symptoms and psychiatric comorbidity (Sawyer et al. , 2016) . 2.1.2. Compulsory treatment If patients with AN are in physical danger and simultaneously unwilling to undergo medically necessary treatment, it needs to be clarified whether sym ptoms and disorder sequelae are impairing their cognitive faculty and deci sion-making abilities to such an extent that interventions against their will in the sense of compulsory treatment are necessary. Therapists' fears that such a step may endanger the therapeutic alliance and consequently the long -term prognosis can complica te and delay the decision to initiate compulsory measures. Reviews (Clausen & Jones, 2014; Elzakkers et al., 2014) as well as a follow -up approx. 20 years following compulsory inpatient treatment (Ward et al. , 2015) indicate that the overall effects of compulsory and non -compulsory treatments are comparable, and the mortality and suicide rates do not signi ficantly differ between the two groups. In the short term, compulsory treatment appears to be helpful (Elzakkers et al., 2014) ; little is known so far about longer -term effects. Clausen and Jones (Clausen & Jones, 2014) mention the following determinants for compulsory treatments in AN: longer duration of illness, higher psychiatric comorbidity, more previous hospital stays and more frequent self -harm. Compulsory treatment is evidently less a sole reaction to the severity of eating disorder symptoms and more a response to the complexity of an AN patient's situation as a whole. As compulsory treatment violates protected freedom and physical integrity according to German Basic Law Article 2 secti on 2, the presence of legal requirements needs to be carefully checked. For adult patients in Germany, the general conditions of compulsory treatment under civil law are regulated under the prerequisites of the \u00a7 1896 BGB in the \u00a7 1906 BGB and require the institution of guardianship through the guardianship court. Any present patient decrees need to be heeded according to \u00a7 1901a BGB. If patients are below the age of consent, the guardians (generally the parents) must apply to the family court for approval of treatment with deprivation of liberty according to \u00a7 1631b BGB. If considerable self -endangerment \"cannot be otherwise averted\", accommodations according to the legal foundations of the accommodation laws of the Federal states constitute an alternative. 94 Custodianship The institution of a legal custodianship represents a first step of external control if a patient with anorexia nervosa is not sufficiently able to care for herself. A custodian cannot be appointed against an adult's free will. A custodianship can also be considered if a patient has reached an average BMI during inpatient treatment after starting from a very low BMI, but is still underweight and has been discharged. In the case of a professional custodian, the custodian should be a person who has experience in the area of eating disorders. Due to the particular burden of the affected families and the often complex family dynamics, strong consideration should be given to whether a family member assumes the custodianship. In Germany, upon application of the le gal custodian, a compulsory treatment under inpatient conditions can be approved. According to the custodianship law, compulsory treatments are possible not only in psychiatric settings but also in other clinics and settings. Information on the practical p rocedure is provided by the responsible custodianship court at the local court as well as the public health authority and the social -psychiatric service. Compulsory hospitalization/closed accommodation If the eating disorder has reached a life -threatening extent or it must be feared that considerable damage to health has emerged (self -endangerment), a compulsory treatment needs to be considered. The approval of compulsory measures in accordance with \u00a7 1906 BGB in the framework of a remedial treatment presup poses that the patient is 1. incapable of consent, 2. previous attempts have been made (and documented) to convince her of the necessity of the medical treatment, 3. the compulsory medical treatment is necessary for the best interests of the patient in ord er to avert the threat of substantial damage to health, 4. the substantial damage to health cannot be averted by any other measure which is reasonable for the patient , and 5. the anticipated benefit of the compulsory medical treatment considerably outweigh s the anticipated adverse effects . Force feeding/restraint Force feeding can be necessary if patients in the stage of extreme starvation are impaired to such an extent that they are no longer able to perceive their risk , and at the same time have grave fea rs of consuming food. If the patient is no longer able to ensure sufficient food intake, and nutrition via a gastric tube cannot be tolerated, the safeguarding of nutrition is generally possible through the use of coercion (e.g. restraint). For patients wi th a longer -lasting necessity of tube feeding, a PEG can represent an alternative over time . In some patients, coercive treatments can be necessary despite a higher BMI due to other acute physical complications such as electrolyte imbalances following la xative abuse, cardiac arrhythmia, physical diseases such as diabetes mellitus or also in the case of alcohol or drug abuse and acute suicidal risk. The patient should be included in the decision on the type of food intake. Restraint should be limited to t he absolute minimum necessary degree and should be suspended as early as possible. At the latest when the patient is discharged, she should be capable of assuming responsibility for sufficient nutrition. 95 In situations in which an inpatient compulsory trea tment or nutrition takes place against the patient's will, the interventions should be conducted in a specialized setting, which is also able to ensure intensive internistic supervision and has experience in treating AN. A compulsory treatment sh ould be c onducted with the greatest possible respect for the patient's dignity and under careful consideration of all available alternatives. Compulsory treatment in children and adolescents Inpatient admission against the patient's express will is rarely necessary in adolescent patients. Preliminary outpatient discussions are often helpful in convincing guardians/close family members and the adolescents themselves of the necessity of inpatien t treatment. If nevertheless required, accommodation associated with deprivation of liberty according to \u00a7 1631b BGB must be applied for by the guardian (generally the parents ) to the responsible family court of the place of residence (\"place of habitual residence\"). If, despite immediate danger, the guardians refuse a necessary inpatient treatment, in order to avert child endangerment, there is a possibility for emergency placement according to \u00a7 42 SGB VIII through the youth welfare office, which in the case of immediate danger can also be implemented until the end of the following day against the adolescent's will with measures entailing deprivation of liberty. In such cases, however, the youth welfare office must procure clarification from the family co urt in this time window. When the age of maturity is reached during an inpatient treatment - if it can be assumed that treatment with liberty -depriving measures will be necessary beyond the 18th birthday - a precautionary appointment of a custodian accordi ng to \u00a7 1908a BGB can ensue, which comes into effect when the patient reaches the age of maturity. A compulsory treatment of children and adolescents with AN should take place in a department for child and adolescent psychiatry/psychosomatic medicine as we ll as, if necessary, in close cooperation with a pediatric and adolescent medical intensive care unit. 2.2. Treatment approaches and methods General efficacy of psychotherapeutic methods After it became widely recognized that psychological causes play a f undamental role in the development of AN, both psychodynamic as well as cognitive -behavioral and family therapy approaches were developed. Over the past few decades, new approaches have also emerged, and the interest in technology -based interventions (incl uding internet -based and mobile interventions) has strongly increased. An overview of treatment for AN is provided, for example, in reviews by Zipfel et al. (Zipfel et al., 2015) , Treasure et al. (Treasure et al., 2015) and Herpertz -Dahlmann et al. (Herpertz -Dahlmann et al. , 2015) . Most treatment approaches nowadays take all areas into consideration: behavioral problems (e.g. lack of mealtime structure, eating rituals, selective food choices) and cognitive distortions of patients, psychodynamic aspects (self -esteem and body -esteem, development of gender identity, dealing with affect, regulation of closeness and distance in relationships, obsessive -perfectionistic personality traits), the physical consequences, as well as family and other important relationships. It can be assumed th at beyond the various psychotherapeutic approaches, an approach specific to AN combined with a focus on weight normalization is an essential impacting factor. So far, there is no empirical evidence that female and male sufferers with AN 96 should receive diff erential treatment; however, gender -specific themes and needs should be considered in the therapy (Carlat et al. , 1997) . Overview: Empirical evidence on psychotherapeutic treatment A systematic literature search yielded 43 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the psychotherapeutic treatment of AN up until February 2017 (see t able 4.2). Six further RCTs examined mixed eating disorder samples (Dingemans et al., 2014; Salbach -Andrae et al., 2 009; Simon et al., 2013; Stein et al., 2013; Steinglass et al., 2014 a; Vocks et al., 2011) . Four studies investigated relapse prevention or an intervention following inpatient treatment (Fichter et al., 2012; Godart et al., 2012; et al., 2016; Pike et al., 2003) . Thirt een studies referred to inpatient or day -clinic treatment settings (Brockmeyer et al., 2014; Dalle et al., 2013 a; Eckert et al., al., al., al., al., 2015 b; Pillay & Crisp, 1981; Weizman et al., 1985; Whitney et al., 2012) or included a treatment arm with inpatient intervention (Crisp et al., 1991; Gowers et al., 2007) . Two Cochrane reviews summarize the evidence for outpatient psychotherap y (Hay et al., 2015) and for family -based interventions ( (Fisher et al., 2010) ; up to January 2008). Due to the in part very low methodological quality, particularly of the older studies, we conducted our own meta -analysis in which studies with very low quality were excluded (Zeeck et al., 2018) . This did not reveal any approach to be superior to others (outcome criterion: weight gain). For children and adolescents, studies on family -based approaches were predominant, for adults, approaches in the individual setting. Thirteen RCTs were entered into the analyses (studies in adults: 622 participants, studies in adolescents: 625 participants). To compare treatment outcomes in different treatment settings and age groups, naturalistic studies were also included (38 studies, 1164 participants). Weight gains were significantly higher in the studies of children and adolescents than in those which primarily included adult patients. With regard to treatment settings, significantly higher weight gains can be expected in the inpatient realm than in outpatient treatment (see below). As no previo us studies have compared specific therapeutic approaches with untreated control groups, however, the ability to evaluate the efficacy of specific procedures in AN is generally limited. Moreover, the study results could only be evaluated with regard to weig ht (BMI), as further parameters (eating disorder pathology, depressiveness, quality of life etc.) were at times not measured or were measured using different instruments. Overall, the evidence base has grown considerably in recent years, and studies with a higher methodological quality are now available (for the original version of the guidelines, a literature search yielded 23 RCTs up to mid -2008). For children and adolescents with AN, increasingly clearer evidence for the efficacy of family -based approach es can be found (larger number of RCTs which show positive effects of treatment over time), even though a comparison with an individual therapeutic approach in the meta -analysis based on the few studies that could be included did not yield a significant di fference (Zeeck et al., 2018) . With regard to adults, four manualized treatment approaches can be mentioned, for which moderate evidence is available and which have shown clear improvements in the relevant areas (weight, eating disorder pathology) (at least one RCT with good methodological quality and a sufficient number of cases: enhanced cognitive behavior therapy (CBT -E), focal 97 psychodynamic psychotherapy (FPT), Maudsley Model of Anorexia Nervosa Treatment for Adults (MANTRA) and Specialist Supportive Clinical Management (SSCM) (see also (Zipfel et al., 2015) ). So far, no approach has proven to be superior to the others (Hay et al., 2015; Zeeck et al., 2018; Zipfel et al., 2015) . Generally, patients with greater disorder severity (those with h igher levels of underweight) are treated in more intensive care settings (day clinic, inpatient): While the starting weights in outpatient psychotherapy studies lay at an average BMI between 16 kg/m\u00b2 and 17 kg/m\u00b2, inpatients began with a BMI < 15 kg/m\u00b2 (Zeeck et al., 2018) . In the outpatient framework. average weight gains of 0.04 BMI points (or 0.08 in adolescents) per week can be expected (this corresponds to 105 g/week at a height of 1.68 m or 195 g/week in adolescents with a height of 158cm). In inpatient treatments, a we ekly weight gain of 0.19 BMI points (corresponding to 537g/week) in adults and of 0.25 (615g/week) in adolescents is shown. Effect sizes and weight gains are overall higher in the treatment of children and adolescents (Zeeck et al., 2 018). 2.2.1. Approaches in line with the German directives for psychotherapy 2.2.1.1. Cognitive behavior al therapy Six studies were found which examined the efficacy of outpatient cognitive (CT, COT)5, behavioral (BT, EBT) or cognitive -behavioral (CBT) interventions number of cases N=95; Mitchell, al. et al., al. , 1999; Treasure et al. , 1995) . A study by Pike et al. (2003) examined cognitive - behavioral interventions as relapse prevention following inpatient treatment. Generally, a total of 20 outpatient sessions was offered. Overall, it is difficult to estimate the effects due to a lack of untreated control groups and insufficient follow -up periods as well as small case numbers. Some studies did not provide i mportant information about treatment outcome, or also included subsyndromal cases. Moreover, the procedures are not consistent across the examined treatment arms. In a group of patients with severe and enduring AN, Touyz and colleagues (2013) compared CBT -AN (case number N=31) with Specialist Supportive Clinical Management (SSCM, see 2.2.4). Although these two therapy approaches modified for this subgroup were similarly successful at the end of treatment, CBT -AN was superior 6 and 12 months post - treatment w ith regard to eating disorder -specific symptoms and social integration. CBT -E According to Fairburn (Fairburn, 2012) , CBT -E (Cognitive Behavior Therapy - Enhanced) is a development of cognitive behavior al therapy which is based on a \"transdiagnostic\" model of eating disorders. In a multicenter randomized -controlled psychotherapy trial in adult patients with AN stud y, (Zipfel et al., 2014) ), CBT -E found to be effective (case number CT=cognitive therapy: COT = cognitive orientation treatment; EBT = edu cational behavioral treatment. 98 N=80); regarding the achieved weight gain, however, no significant difference was found compared to a focal psychodynamic psychothe rapy (FPT, see 2.2.2) and an optimized6 treatment as usual (TAU -O). Nevertheless, compared to TAU -O, CBT -E led to a more rapid weight gain up to the end of treatment and a greater improvement in eating disorder -specific psychopathology. Due to the methodo logical quality of the study and the comparatively high case number, it can be assumed that CBT -E is highly likely to be effective in adult patients. For adolescence, there are not yet any randomized controlled trials for CBT -E. In addition to the compone nts employed for adult patients, CBT -E for adolescents also includes the caregivers. Two open studies with 46 outpatients and 27 inpatients, respectively, showed substantial improvements with respect to weight gain and eating disorder psychopathology (Dalle Grave et al. , 2013 al. , 2014) . 2.2.1.2. Psychodynamic therapy There are three older randomized controlled trials on psychodynamic therapy approaches, with small case numbers (total cases N = 44; (Bac har et al., 1999; Dare et al. , 2001; Robin et al., 1999) . These approaches focused less on concrete symptoms and more on their importance with respect to the life history, personal development and important relationships (including the therapist). The t hree trials examined different samples: The patients in the study by Robin and colleagues (1999) were children and adolescents without an average illness duration under one year, while Dare et al. (2001) examined adults with a n average illness duration of over six years. In a study with a larger number of cases (N=60) by Lock et al. (2010), an approach following the manual of Robin et al. (\"adolescent -focused therapy\", AFT) in the individual setting was compared with family -based treatment (age of patients: m = 14.4). No difference emerged with regard to the remission rates at the end of the therapy, but the family -based approach was found to be superior at follow -up (6 and 12 months). Patients who were treated with AFT achieved a higher weight at the end of therapy, although this difference was no longer present at follow - up. A further study by Crisp et al. (1991) compared a psychodynamic approach (individual therapy + inclusion of family, N=20), which integrated cognitive -behav ioral elements and nutritional counseling (Gowers et al. 1994), with inpatient therapy, outpatient group therapy and a group which received in -depth diagnostics (\"one -off\"). All three treatment regimes proved to be effective after one year, with significan tly higher weight gains than in the \"one - off\" group. Fundamentally, the studies indicate that psychodynamic therapy approaches are effective. Focal Psychodynamic Psychotherapy (FPT) A more recent manualized psychodynamic therapy approach conceived for ano rexia patients with moderate underweight (BMI > 15 kg/m2) (FPT; Friedrich et al. 2014), which comprises 40 outpatient sessions, was found to be effective regarding weight gain and in terms of a 6 TAU -O encompassed an intensive diagnostic clarification at the eating disorders center, motivation and support in the search for outpatient psychotherapy, regular GP monitoring and 4 intensive check -ups and follow -up assessments at the center. 99 combined outcome measure (weight and eating disorder -specific psychopathology) at 1 -year follow -up (case number N=80; (Zipfel et al., 2014) ). Although no significant difference in weight course emerged b etween the three investigated therapy arms (FPT, CBT -E, TAU -O), the FPT arm was superior to an optimized treatment as usual (TAU -O) with respect to remission rates after one year. Due to the methodological quality of the study and the comparatively large s ample size, FPT can be assumed to be highly likely to be effective. Psychoanalysis There is no empirical evidence on the efficacy of classical psychoanalytical treatment of AN. 2.2.2. Further (evidence -based) psychotherapeutic approaches 2.2.2.1. Family -based approaches The largest number of available studies pertain to family -based therapeutic interventions (case number up to February 2017, total N=796). Almost all studies on family -based therapy were conducted in samples of children and adolescents. The majority were or iented towards the concept of the Maudsley Hospital in London and actively addressed dealing with weight and eating within the families as well as the processes of autonomy typical for adolescence. The only study to include adults (age > 18 years) is the s tudy by Dare et al. (2001). Family -based interventions were examined in comparison with indvidual therapy approaches (Ball & Mitchell, 2004; Dare et al., 2001; Lock et al., 2010; Robin et al. , 1994; Russell et al. , 1987) , or different approaches were compared with one another: e.g. family discussions with the whole family vs. separate discussions with the patient and the rest of the family (Eisler et al., 2000; Le Grange et al., 2016; Le Grange & Eisler, 1992) . The studies by Russell et al. (1987) as well as Lock et al. (2010) provide evidence to suggest that in children and adolescents, family -based approaches are more successful than an individual therapy approach. The other studies showed no differences. In the study by Lock et al. (2010), an RCT with 121 adolescents, family -based therapy was compared with individual therapy (\"adolescent -focused therapy\", AFT). After 6 and 12 months, significantly more patients in the FBT group were in remission (defined by a normal weight and score s within one standard deviation in the Eating Disorder Examination procedure) compared to the AFT group (Lock et al., 2010). At 4 -year follow up, the number of remissions had substantially risen in the AFT group, meaning that a significant difference was n o longer present (Le Grange et al., 2014) . However, it was on ly possible to examine 65% of the original sample after 4 years. In the study by Russell et al. (Eisler et al., 1997; Russell et al., 1987) , family -based therapy proved to be more beneficial in patients with an illness onset 18 years of age, while patients with a later age of onset wer e more likely to benefit from an individual therapy approach. The studies by Eisler et al. (2000) and le Grange et al. (1992) showed, on average, no differ ence between an approach in which parents and children/adolescents were seen separately compared 100 to in joint sessions. However, a separated approach proved to be more beneficial in the subgroup showing a higher extent of maternal criticism (Eisler et al., 2007) . A further RCT study which compared parent -focused therapy (in which parents and child were treated separately) to family - based therapy (in which parents and child were treated together) did not reveal any discrepant therapy effects 6 and 12 months post -treatment (Le Grange et al., 2016) . The patient herself was monitored by a nurse, while the parents met with a therapist. Lock et al. (2005) compared different doses of family therapy interventions (10 vs. 20 sessions), and found no significant differences in the outcome. However, there were indications that patients from nonintact families and those with severe obsessive -compulsive features benefit more from longer -term treatment. Caregivers of patients who had not achieved sufficient weight gain after the first sessions of family -based therapy received additional in tensive coaching in a further controlled study (albeit with unbalanced randomization!). The patients with additional parental coaching achieved a similarly high recovery rate in this study to patients who had responded to the family -based therapy early on (Lock et al., 2015) The majority of the US -American studi es were conducted as outpatient therapy studies. In this respect, it must be noted that a considerable proportion of the patients had already been treated as inpatients before or durin g the family -based treatment. A not inconsiderable proportion additional ly received medications; in part, the randomization was unbalanced (Lock, 2015) . Moreover, the average BMI at study start in the American patients was higher than that in European studies. The group led by Eisler (Eisler et al., 2016) conducted the first randomized trial comparing family -based therapy (FBT: with one single family) with multifamily therapy (MFT). At the end of treatment, the MFT outperformed the FBT with respec t to recovery rate (Morgan & Russell criteria), although all patients had previously received family therapy, meaning that the results need to be interpreted with caution. At 18 -month follow -up, there was no longer a significant difference between the two treatments. An investigation (RCT) of systemic family therapy and FBT yielded no significant differences with regard to remission rates. However, FBT was linked to a quicker weight gain and lower costs (Agras et al., 2014) . Patients who suffered from obsessive -compulsive sym ptoms benefited more from systemic therapy. In a French study of 60 patients (Godart et al., 2012) , which compared systemically oriented therapy components in post -hospitalization trea tment with treatment as usual (TAU) revealed that the post -hospitalization systemic therapy was superior to TAU. Overall, family -based approaches can be assumed to be highly likely to be effective in children and adolescents. The vast majority of studies f ollowed the Maudsley approach. 2.2.2.2. \"Specialist Supportive Clinical Management\" combines supportive therapy with unspecific, but in -depth clinical management by an eating disorder specialist. Compared to CBT and IPT, SCCM focuses even more strongly on psychoeducation, eating behavior and weight (McIntosh et al., 2016) . In one st udy ((McIntosh et al., 2005) ; N=16), SSCM proved to be superior to two specific psychotherapy approaches (CBT and interpersonal therapy , IPT), although this could not be confirmed in a long -term 101 follow -up (Carter et al., 2011) . Another study (Touyz et al., 2013) found that patients with severe and enduring AN were able to benefit from SSCM (N=32). In a comparison of SSCM and a new outpatient treatment approach specifically conceived for AN, the Maudsley Model of Anorexia Ne rvosa Treatment for Adults (MANTRA, see 2.2.5), both groups ( (Schmidt et al., 2012) ; case number for SSCM N = 37) showed a similarly good prog ression. This was confirmed in a larger sample in the so -called MOSAIC trial (Schmidt et al., 2015, 2016) . SSCM can be considered as hig hly likely to be effective. 2.2.2.3. Maudsley Model of Anorexia Nervosa Treatment for Adults (MANTRA) MANTRA is a new, anorexia -specific therapeutic approach which was developed by the work group of U. Schmidt and colleagues at the Maudsley Hospital in L ondon. It is an empirically based, cognitive -interpersonal approach. According to MANTRA, the following 4 factors, linked to underlying obsessive -compulsive (or avoidant) personality traits, are of central importanc e in the maintenance of AN: 1. a rigid, d etail-focused style of thinking characterized by a fear of making mistakes, 2. problems in the socio -emotional area, 3. positive beliefs about the utility of anorexia, and 4. unfavorable reactions of friends and family. A first RCT ( (Schmidt et al., 2012) , case number for MANTRA N=34) found no significa nt differences between MANTRA and SSCM (see 2.2.4) in terms of outcomes, but found that MANTRA showed certain weaknesses (more frequent necessity for additional inpatient or day -clinic treatment). However, in the subsequent larger MOSAIC trial ( (Schmidt et al., 2015, 2016) ; N = 72), MANTRA was preferred by patients over SSCM. Although no significant difference emerged between the two groups with regard to weight gain, pa tients with more severe symptoma tology were able to achieve higher weight gain in the MANTRA group than in the SSCM group. MANTRA can be considered as highly likely to be effective. 2.2.3. Other psychotherapeutic approaches 2.2.3.1. Interpersonal therapy (IPT) Only one study in the outpatient setting was found for interventions with interpersonal therapy (total cases N = 21; (McIntosh et al., 2005) ). As t he study also included subsyndromal cases, did not include a follow -up, and the baseline data were not provided separately for the treatment arms, it is not possible to evaluate the effects. The study by McIntosh hinted at a superiority of the specialized therapy approaches (IPT7, CBT) compared to the control group (SSCM), but this was only significant in the completer analysis. So far, there is insufficient evidence for IPT. 7 IPT = Interpersonal Therapy 102 2.2.3.2. Client -centered psychotherapy No empirical evidence is available. 2.2.3.3. Integrative approaches There are two studies (total number of cases: N = 36; (Dare et al., 2001; Treasure et al., 1995) ) on an integrative psychotherapeutic approach (\"cognitive -analytic therapy\", CAT), which includes both cognitive -behavioral elements (addressing the function of behavior and dysfunctional thought patterns) and psychodynamic elements (tackling interpersonal difficulties and sense of self, work on the transference relationship (Ryle et al., 1 990). Both studies examined adult patients with AN. In the investigation by Dare et al. (2001), CAT and family therapy were superior to a \"routine treatment\". Treasure et al. (1995) showed that CAT performed better than an educational -behavioral approach according to the patients' subjective judgment; however, no significant difference emerged in the overall treatment outcome. In sum, there are in itial indications for the effectiveness of CAT. 2.2.3.4. Body -oriented methods Only one randomized controlled trial can be found which tested th e efficacy of body -oriented methods. The study was carried out in children and adolescents with an average ill ness duration of less than one year (case number: N = 13; (Wallin et al. , 2000) ). All patients received family therapy and the target group additionally received either \"body a wareness therapy\" or not. No additional effect of the body therapy was apparent. However, due to methodological limitations, no conclusions can be drawn from the findings. 2.2.3.5. Combination of distinct psychotherapeutic approaches Four studies explicitly chose a combination of approaches in order to compare them with one individual approach (total number of cases: N = 110; (Crisp et al., 1991; Gowers et al., 2007; Hall & Crisp, 1987; Wallin et al., 2000) ). Individual or group therapy was combined with family therapy and dietary counseling, or family therapy was combined with body awareness therapy. The studies did not yield any clear indicat ions for the superiority of a combined approach. However, it should be noted as a limitation that almost all studies on the treatment of AN employed additional elements apart from the approach being tested (short discussions, consultations with the fami ly practitioner, dietary counse ling, counseling of family members, temporary hospitalizations etc.). The \"pure\" treatment with one approach rather constitutes the exception, not only in clinical practice but also in the review of randomized controlled trials. 103 2.2.3.6. Technology -based approaches According to the review by Schlegl and colleagues (2015) , internet -based interventions can be applied for relapse prevention in AN. However, efficacy has only been demonstrated in one RCT so far (Fichter et al., 2012 , 2013) . The so -called \"VIA\" program encompassed nine modules plus email contact with a therapist over a period of nine months. In a pilot study (n=16), Giel et al. (2015) examined a post -inpatient relapse prevention program (RESTART) which is based on the Maudsley Model of Anorexia Nerv osa Treatment (see 4.2.2.2.3.) and includes 10 manualized video conference sessions. The program was easy to implement and was very well accepted by patients. Several case studies (Yager, 2001, 2003) suggest that internet -based interventions (e.g. email) can be an effe ctive therapeutic approach in the outpatient treatment of AN. 2.2.4. Other treatment approaches and methods 2.2.4.1. Cognitive remediation t herapy (CRT) A multitude of studies and several meta -analyses have demonstrated that AN is associated with a reduced cognitive flexib ility (\"set -shifting\") as well as a strong detail -oriented information processing (Lang et al. 2014; Wu et al. 2014) . CRT is a treatment module with which these cognitive funct ions can be improved in a targeted manner through exercises (quickly switching between various rules and demands; increasing the level of abstraction of complex information), behavior experiments (also in the form of homework) and meta -cognitive elements ( reflection on one's own thinking styles) et al. 2014; Danner et al. 2015; Lindvall Dahlgren & R\u00f8, 2014) To dat e, four small to medium -sized randomized controlled intervention trials and one controlled trial on CRT in AN have been published. These vary substantially regarding the examined samples (AN vs. mixed eating disorder sample, inpatients vs. outpatients, etc .), the applied dosage (8 -30 sessions), the comparison groups (CBT, TAU, food exposure, unspecific cognitive training) and the primary endpoints (neurocognitive parameters, eati ng disorder sympt oms, food intake, dropout rate). Two proof -of-concept studies revealed a short -term improvement regarding neurocognitive parameters (Brockmeyer et al. 2014; Lock et al. 2013) . In the largest study to date, which compared an adjuvant procedure to standard treatment with standard treatment alone, patients with eating disorders (not only AN) showed stronger improvements in quality of life at the end of treatment and in eating di sorder symptoms at 6 -month follow -up (Dingemans et al. , 2014) . Although overall, some of these results appe ar to be promising, the clinical utility remains to be demonstrated in larger randomized controlled trials. 104 2.2.4.2. Exposure -based approaches Given that food - and body image -associated fears are among the core symptoms of AN and that abnormal anxiety con ditioning processes are attributed with an important role in the etiopathogenesis of the disorder (Guarda et al., 2015) , exposure -based interventions represent a promising but so far under -researched approach to the treatment of AN (Koskina et al., 2013) . Long established in the treatment of bulimic eating disorders, food exposure in AN has only been examined in two small randomized controlled trials to date (Steinglass et al., 2014; Levinson et al., 2015) . These provided first hints that an exposure treatment leads to the consump tion of a larger amount of food during a test meal and to a greater reduction in associated anxiety. Moreover, an augmentation with D -Cycloserine may potentially strengthen the effects of food exposure (D -Cycloserine is an N-methyl -D-aspartate receptor ago nist which facilitates extinction learning) (Levinson et al., 2015) . Body image -related anxieties represent a further target for exposure -based approaches in AN (Koskina et al., 2013) . To date, however, there is only preliminary evidence from experimental studies that in -vivo exposure (mirror - or video -based), or else exposure approaches based on virtual reality scenarios, are associated with a short -term improvement in mood, self -esteem and body image -related symptoms, and the effects in part appear to be unspecific (Ferrer -Garcia & Gutierrez -Maldonado, 2012; Guti\u00e9rrez al., Keizer et al., 2016) . Moreover, processes of attentional control, re - evaluation and feedback -based correction of misperceptions probably pla y a greater role in body image exposure than habituation and extinction learning (Koskina et al., 2013; Luethcke et al., 2011; 2015) . . 2.2.4.3. Physical activity -related and exercise therapy interventions With regard to physical activity - and exercise -related interventions, the following approaches should be distinguished: physiotherapeutic interventions with the aim of strengthening the muscles, improving mobility and fostering bone structur e, programs which allow an incremental increase in physical activities adapted to the physical situation, as well as exercise therapy programs in the proper sense (Cook et al., 2016; Zeeck & Schlegel, 2013) . The latter include, besides guided physical activity, psychoeducation and targeted work on changing problematic exercise behavior (promoting positive, healthy body exper ience and reflection on dysfunctional attitudes , 2015) ). So far, the evidence is very sparse, but initial findings suggest positive effects (reduction of obsessive -compulsive -excessive exercise, favorable influence on eating disorder pathology as wel l as compliance; reviews (Cook et al., 2016; Hausenblas et al. , 2008; Zunker et al. , 2011) ). Overall, there are no indications that supervised exercise programs impair weight gain. 105 2.2.4.4. Self -help One Cochrane review has been conducted on self -help (Perkins et al. , 2006) , although this considers all eating disorders and does not include a single study on AN. In summary, the authors cautiously formulate that \" Self-help may have some utility as a first step in treatment \". In an RCT (n=354), a fully automated internet -based self -help program (\"featback\") using self- monitorin g and feedback in sufferers with self -reported eating disorder symptoms led to an improvement in eating disorder -related and comorbid psychopathology, but not with regard to anorexic symptoms (Aardoom et al., 2016). The authors conclude that the program is possibly more suitable for sufferers with bulimic symptoms. Summary: Evidence on treatment procedures and methods for AN Psychotherapy is the treatment procedure of first choice in AN (EL 1b; (Zeeck et al., 2018; Zipfel et al., 2015) ) There is moderate evidence that the following specific psychotherapeutic approaches are effective: in adults, enhanced cognitive -behavioral therapy (CBT -E), focal psychodynamic therapy (FPT), Maudsley Model of Anorexia Nervosa Treatment (MANTRA) as well as Specialist Supportive Clinical Management (SSCM); in children and adolescents, family -based therapy following the Maudsley approach (EL1b; (Zeeck et al., 2018) ). There is no suff icient evidence that one of these approaches is superior to another (EL 1b; (Zeeck et al., 2018) ). There is no sufficient evidence that for children and adolescents, one particular approach within family therapy (joint sessions with the patient or separate sessions with patient and parents) is more effective than the other (EL 1b; (Fisher et al., 2010; Zeeck et al., 2018) ); however, there are indic ations that in the case of a strong degree of critical parental comments, it may be more beneficial to see parents and patient separately (EL 1b; (Eisler et al., 2007 )). There is limited evidence that specialist services lead to a reduction in inpatient admissions and to a cost reduction (EL 3; (House et al., 2012) ). There is limited evidence that cognitive remediation therapy as an adjuvant procedure improves eating disorder symptoms as well as quality of life (EL 1b; (Brockmeyer et al., 2014; Lock et al., 2013) ). A low motivation to change the eating disorder is associated with lower treatment success and a higher risk of treatment dropout (EL 1a ; see, among others, systematic review by Vall & Wade, 2015; Carter et al. 2012; McHugh 2007) 106 2.2.5. Nutrition therapy Weight gain The restoration of a healthy body weight constitutes one of the most important therapeutic objectives in AN (cf. chapter 2.1). Both in adolescent and adult patients with AN, a higher weight gain during inpatient treatment or a higher weight at discharge re presents a favorable prognostic factor for the short -term and long -term course of illness (Baran et al., 2015) . However, there is not yet any uniform, e vidence -based approach with respect to nutrition management (Marzola et al., 2013) . Guidelines p ertaining to the refeeding of anorexic patients are differently interpreted and applied in different institutions and countries (see table 4.3) (Herpertz -Dahlmann et al., 2015) . The weekly weight gains strived for in Germany are listed for different target groups and treatment settings in chapter 2.2 (\"Empirical evidence\"). With regard to the desired rate of weight gain, the approaches in different countries currently differ substantially from one another: The moderate weakly increase of 500g/week which is practiced in Germany is in contrast to the Anglo -Saxon countries, which recommend an increase of 1 -2kg per week in the inpatient setting. Target weight The target weight represents a healthy weight for an individual, which should be strived for and maintained in the longer term. Adolescents As a basic principle, it can be stated that a healthy body weight has been achieved when menses resumes (American Psychiatric Association, 2006) . However, in many patients, amenorrhea endures at the end of treatment despite weight restoration, and younger patients as well as those with an illness onset before the menarche show a higher risk of longer -term amenorrhea (Dempfle et al., 2013) . For this reason, with the aid of scientific foundations, an individ ual target weight should be set for each patient by the therapist (Herpertz -Dahlmann et al., 2015) . In various studies, the achieve ment of the 15th -25th age -adjusted BMI percentile was associated with resumption (Dempfle et al., 2013; Faust et al., 2013; al., 2008; Herpertz -Dahlmann et al., 2014) . Instead of applying a strictly defined target weight, some clinicians prefer to define a weight range which lies close to the 25th BMI p ercentile (Herpertz -Dahlmann et al., 2015) in order to permit physiological weight fluctuations and take the focus away from a particular weight number. Adults A healthy weight in adults should lie in a range above the minimum weight of 18.5 kg/m2 defined by the WHO. As such, a normal weight stretches across a broad range (BMI 18.5 - 25 kg/m2). The resumption of menses can be seen as a crude measure of physical recovery in this regard. If, in adults, the eating disorder began after reaching physical maturity, the premorbid weight is a suitable indicator. A healthy weight is present if the body weight remains stable without restriction and compensatory behavior. 107 Start of refeeding, and refeeding syndrome The early phase of refeeding following a sustained period of starvation is seen as critical, as health problems can arise which are subsumed under the term \"refeeding phenomena\". \"Refeeding syndrome\" represents a serious metabolic dysregulation which b e fatal (Mehanna et al. , 2008) . Signs of this syndrome, which predominantly occurs in the first weeks of treatment, are shif ts in fluids and electrolytes which can occur as a consequence of the endocrine and metabolic changes at the beginning of refeeding (Mehanna et al., 2008 ). A central hallmark of the syndrome is hypophosphatemia, although further electrolytes, glucose metabolism and thiamine supply also play a role (Crook et al. , 2001) . The drastic malnutrition is accompanied by depleted intracellular phosphate stores. Upon refee ding, and the associated shift from catabolic fat burning to anabolic carbohydrate metabolism, phosphate is increasingly used. This causes a critical decline of the intracellular concentration of ATP and consequently the energy supply to the cells. The div erse resulting clinical consequences range from severe organ dysfunctions, through rhabdomyolysis, to seizures, delirium, coma and death. In the literature , several cases of refeeding syndrome in AN patients are described, for example by Norris et al. (Norris et al. , 2012) . However, refeeding syndrome is still lacking a precise definition. Due to this lack of definition, clear information on the prevalence of refeeding syndrome in the refeeding of patients with AN is scarce (Mehanna et al., 2008) . The incidence of hypophosphatemia in adolescent patients during refeeding was reported as lying at 14% in adolescents and 28% in adults (O'Connor & Nicholls, 2013; Ornstein et al. , 2003) . Awareness of the risk of undesire d refeeding phenomena, the appropriate steering of energy intake, as well as medical monitoring of electrolytes and their adequate supplementation during the early stage of refeeding are essential in order to avoid complications. Initial energy intake With respect to an appropriate initial energy intake, there is currently no general consensus, which leads to inconsistent approaches. This is evidenced by a considerable range of initial energy intake currently employed, from 125 to 3264 kcal/d (O'Connor & Nicholls, 2013; Pettersson et al., 2016; Slogan et al. , 1962) . Since awareness of the above -described refeeding syndrome, for a long time, a low initial energy intake was recommended for patients with AN (\"start low, go slow\"). However, this approach is coming under increasing criticism. A low initial energy intake leads, to begin with, to addition al weight loss and prolongs the duration of the hospital stay (Garber et al., 201 2, 2013). A scientific basis for the very restrictive feeding guidelines for the initial calorie intake is lacking, and presumably the starting BMI and a lower number of leukocytes are better predictors of complications than the level of initial calorie intake (O'Connor & Nicholls, 2013) . An RCT comprising 36 adolescent AN patients demonstrated that a higher initial energy intake was associated with a higher weight gain, but did not lead to a higher rate of complic ations (O'Connor et al. , 2016) . Similarly, in a cohort study of 800 cases, Redgrave et al. (2015) concluded that it is not the speed of weight gain, but rather the level of cac hexia that predicts refeeding phenomena. Study protocols in which a high initial calorie intake was compared with low -calorie feeding (e.g. 1764 vs. 1093 kcal/d; (Garber et al., 2013) ), or with a high energy intake in the first week of 3264+/ - 196kcal followed by a gradual reduction to 2622+/ -331kcal (Pettersson et al., 2016) showed no difference regarding the occurrence of refe eding phenomena, but that better weight progress was achieved in the 108 high-calorie variants. Moreover, in a review by Garber et al. (2016) , results of a systematic literature review on the different refeeding strategies at the st art of therapy were evaluated. Among other things, the authors derived the following recommendations: 1) For patients with mild to moderate malnourishment8 a low initial energy intake is too conservative. 2) Higher initial energy doses are not associated with an increased risk of refeeding syndrome provided that electrolytes , fluid balance and cardiovascular parameters are closely monitored and controlled . Nevertheless, it should be noted that in many of the cited works, the recommendations are based largely on studies from the Anglo -Saxon area, where hospital stays , linked to a quicker weight gain, are customary. It is unclear whether the findings from other countries can be transferred to Germany, and which of the approaches is linked to a better outcome in the longer term. Fluid balance In this regard, there are two sources of errors which need to considered particularly in the beginning phase in order to critically evaluate the weight development. Many patients have hypovolemia at the start of treatme nt (Caregaro et al. , 2005; Comerci, 1990) . Recurrent vomiting, abuse of laxatives and diuretics, as well as a reduced urge to drink, lead to dehydration, which can be clinically detected through lower serum sodium concentrations and a relatively high hematocrit. Appropriate water intake consequently leads, due to the fluid influx into the cells, to weig ht gain, without a corresponding increase in the fixed body mass per se. In addition, there is often a dysregulation in the renin -angiotensin -aldosterone mechanism et al. , 2005) , which leads to a strong tendency towards hyper - hydration (see also chapter 8). Weight gains particularly at the beginning of treatment often do not reflect a true increase in body mass, i.e. the intracellular body mass, but are rather caused by a disproportionate increase of the extracellular volume. Linked to this is a strong ten dency towards edema formation, occasionally also the development of ascites and pericardial effusions. Weight gains especially in severely underweight patients should therefore be accompanied by regular clinical testing of the edema tendency, and better st ill by measuring the body composition. For everyday clinical practice, multi -frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis is best suited to measuring the extracellular volume (Mika et al. , 2004) . 2.2.6. Nutritional management in patients with severe malnutrition Refeeding of patients with severe AN is complex, and requires a specialized, medical management by a trained team. When determining the initial calorie intake, it should be considered that especially in severely underweight patients, a sufficiently high energy intake to remedy the risky sequelae of cachexia (bone marrow depression, hepatopathy, renal dysfunctions, cardiovascular function) is necessary. As yet, there is no uniform procedure for 8 In this respect, not only the current BMI, but also the extent of malnutrition as well as the extent and speed of weight loss in the last months should be considered. 109 patients with an extremely low BMI. There is a current need for research in order to identify the biochemical, behavioral and anthropometric markers for a safe and appropriate procedure in the refeeding of severely malnourished patients. 2.2.6.1. Delivery form and food composition Delivery form Liquid food As far as possible, the refeeding should be delivered orally and with a diverse, mixed range of foods. However, problems frequently arise in this regard, which due to the often threatening physical constitution of the patients necessitate special measures to ensure a sufficient food intake. One treatment option which still remains close to the desired oral feeding is the use of liquid food (Imbierowicz et al., 2002) . Often, liquid food is given following oral food intake in order to balance the difference between expected and achieved energy amount (Garber et al., 2016) . The nutritional components fats, proteins and carbohydrates should be provided in a balanced form. The liquid food should enable a complete provision of electrolytes, micronutrients and vitamins. The different energy density of the products needs to be taken into account. For this reason, the food needs to be prescribed in a calorie -controlled rather than a volume -controlled manner. However, oral nutrition places high demands on digestion, which can be impaired due to the underweight. Liquid food offers the possibility to supply larger amounts of calories in a concentrated form. At the same time, the accruing volume of food is comparatively low. Moreover, the largely broken down nutritional components in liquid food are easy to digest. On the other hand, this type of feeding can maintain the avoidance of normal food (Hart et al. , 2013) . Tube feeding Nasogastric tubes are a further option with whi ch to ensure sufficient nutrition , also when the patient is not willing or able to feed herself orally to a sufficient extent. The use of nasogastric (NG) tubes is an invasive measure which requires th e patient's consent. Possible complications are incorrect positioning with aspiration, irritation in the nose and throat area and gastrointestinal intolerance reactions when the tube nutrition is applied too quickly. W hen placed for a longer period of time , mu cosal lesions can arise in the nose or in the posterior pharyngeal wall. The review by Garber et al. (2016) examined the utility of nasogastric tube feeding. Currently, it is unclear whether a combination of oral food intake and NG tube is superior to completely oral food intake. This uncertainty is predominantly due to methodological weaknesses of the studies conducted so far, which were not designed to determine an independent effect of the type of nutritional provision. Wh ile the NG tube is suitable for increasing energy intake, studies with and without NG tube showed a comparable weight gain. Presumably, the patient's acceptance of the tube plays a crucial role. A controlled trial by Rigaud (2007) tested normal 110 nutrition against tube nutrition o ver two months. After one year, the relapse rate was comparable in the two groups and the tube was well accepted. If forced feeding (see chapter 4.2.1.2) becomes necessary, nasogastric tubes are poorly tolerated by some patients. In such cases, a percutan eous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube offers an alternative. Although it is clearly more invasive than the nasogastric tube, PEG is seen as entailing few complications. For underweight patients with a poor general physical condition, as is the case with force -fed AN patients, however, complication rates are likely to be higher. This should be carefully considered when weighing up the risks of forced feeding. Although the PEG tube belongs to the range of treatment alternatives in the case of severe AN, the re are only a small number of case reports on its successful application (Malfi et al., 2006; Neiderman et al., 2000) . 2.2.6.2. Medical monito ring of critical electrolytes and vitamins in the refeeding phase Phosphate In renally healthy patients, phosphate can be provided during refeeding, for preventive purposes. There are many reports of critical situations during the refeeding of AN patients (Birmingham et al. , 1996; Cariem al. , 1994; al. , Sato et al. , 2004; Sheridan & Collins, 1983; Van Di , 1992; Wada et al. , 1992; Winston & Wells, 2002) . Ornstein et al. (2003) followed 69 adolescent patients with moderate to severe AN during inpatient treatment. 27% had hypophosphatemia according to laboratory tests, of whom 6% had more severe hypophosphatemia (serum phosphate < 2.5 mg/dl). All patients with more severe hypophosphatemia were also severely underweight. After one week of normalized nutrition, phosphate levels were back in the normal range in most patients. The symptoms of hypophosphatemia can develop very quickly and then rapidly become life -threatening, with myolysis, heart failure, arrhythmia and impairment of consciousn ess. For this reason, hypophosphatemia should be detected before symptoms emerge. It should be considered that the determination of serum phosphate does not provide reliable information about the available phosphate concentration in the cells. Phosphate is an electrolyte, which shows an approximately 14-fold higher concentration in the cells than in serum. Potassium and chloride Frequent vomiting, but also abuse of diuretics and laxatives, leads to considerable losses of potassium and chloride. Hypokalemia can lead to life -threatening cardiac arrhythmia. In this respect, the increas es in potassium stress between higher intracellular and lower extracellular concentration of this electrolyte is decisive for the associated cardiac ri sk. The chronic potassium d epletion in the bulimic form of AN and in bulimia nervosa frequently also lead to a decrease in the intracellular potassium concentration, such that even in the case of severe hypokalemia in serum, life -threatening arrhythmia can remain absent . The potassi um stress in the case of known serum potassium can best be determined with electrocardiogram recording. The visible signs of hypokalemia in the ECG correlate with the concentration difference (extra -111 /intracellular) (Bonne et , 1993; Koh et al., 1989) . Persisting hypokalemia is generally a sign of continued vomiting and should be discussed with the patient. H ypokalemia requires a balancing out until normokalemia is reached, and besides potassium, the chloride deficiency should also be balanced out. For this purpose, potassium chloride is more suitable than potassium carbonate. Sodium Depleted sodium levels ar e mostly a sign of polydipsia, which can be habitual but can also be consciously employed to suppress the feeling of hunger and for weight control. Depleted sodium levels should therefore be regulated through the normalization of fluid intake and not throu gh exogenous sodium intake. In some cases, hyponatremia also emerges through a SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic ADH secretion), caused by treatment with psychotropic drugs, especially SSRIs, SNRIs and neuroleptics. Due to this dangerous side e ffect, the corresponding medications should be halted in such cases. A forced (in the case of parenteral application) normalization of depleted sodium and potassium levels in the case of overhydration must not be conducted as this is linked to a risk of po ntine myelinolysis (Amann et al. , 2001; Sugimoto et al. , 2003) . The sodium concentration should only be increased by around 4 to 6 mmol/l per day (Ayus et al., 2015) . By contrast, an appropriate use of table salt in the framework of normal nutrition should be unproblematic. Magnesium Symptoms of hypomagnesemia re semble the symptoms of severe anorexia: muscle weakness, adynemia, constipation, cardiac arryhthmia and cramps. Magnesium deficiency is frequent in AN (Birmingham et al. 2004; Fonseca & Havard, 1985; Hay et al., 1989) . Therefore, checking the serum magnesium and possibly also oral ad ministration can therefore be useful. With regard to calcium metabolism and vitamin D metabolism (see chapter 8). Thiamine Thiamine is required in the mitochondria in order to transfer pyruvate as coenzyme A to the citrate cycle. With the restoration of e nergy supply to the cells, an increased need for thiamine thus also arises. Thiamine can only be stored in the body to a very limited degree. By contrast, no hypervitaminoses are known. Wernicke -Korsakoff encephalopathy is characterized by the triad of enc ephalopathy, disorders of the oculomotor system and ataxia of gait. It is caused, in a manner that is not yet completely understood, by a thiamine deficiency. Although thiamine deficiency and thus Wernicke -Korsakoff encephalopathy occurs most frequently in chronic alcoholism, it can also arise in other forms of malnutrition and undernourishment. The phase of refeeding is seen as especially hazardous. There are numerous case reports of vitamin B1 deficiencies in AN (Cooke et al. , 2006; Doraiswamy et al., 1994; Elmer al. , 2009) . Serum thiamine determination is unreliable and cannot dispel the suspicion of encepalopathy caused by thiamine deficiency. As such, a preventi ve oral administration of vitamin B1 is to be recommended in the case of a very low starting weight. 112 2.2.6.3. Macro - and micronutrients Macronutrients Patients with AN are undernourished not only quantitatively but also qualitatively. The macronutrient composition in current studies corresponds to that recommended for the general population (25 -35% fat, 50 -60% carbohydrate, 15 -20% protein; (Garber et al., 2016) ). In a review by Marzola et al. (2013) , the following, pragmatic recommendations are made: - Increase the variety of food and the energy density - Consume protein with a high biological quality - Choice of protein sources whi ch patients find less challenging (usually plant -based proteins, fish and chicken) - Ensure that essential fatty acids are consumed - Complex carbohydrates (bread, rice, potatoes) - Fruit, juices and vegetables A nutritional analy sis to precisely determine indi vidual nutritional deficiencies would require the use of targeted laboratory analyses and questioning of supplementation practices, in addition to retrospective and prospective nutritional records (Setnick, 2010) . This procedure is laborious and thus rarely feasible in everyday clinical practice. Therefore, common practice is to rather refrain from a separat e intake of individual nutrients, under the assumption that the reintroduction of a balanced diet covering the patient's needs is sufficient to counter the deficits in most cases. In the following, nutritional components are mentioned which need to be give n particular consideration and in some cases should be additionally supplemented. Micronutrients Besides the obvious lack of energy and dietary fats, various different vital micronutrients such as minerals and vitamins are also lacking (Hadigan et al., 2000; Rock & Curran -Celentano, 1994) . A review b y Setnick et al. (2010) addressed micronutrient deficiencies in patients with eating disorders. As each patient maintains her own dietary habits, frequently over long periods of time, there is no conclusive list of nutritional deficiencies common to all patients. Many patients predominantly avoid all fatty foods, which leads to a lack of fat -soluble nutrient s. Others, by contrast, additionally or predominantly limit their consumption of carbohydrates and/or sugar (\"low carb\"), while some avoid meat and dairy products, without supplementing the vegetarian diet with appropriate plant -based alternatives. In some cases, patients consume excessive amounts of certain foods (e.g. raw fruit and vegetables), or always and repeatedly eat a very restricted selection of foods, which can lead to an extremely high consumption of certain nutrients. Furthermore, many patients themselves supplement with vitamins or minerals. In view of these differing practices, it is hardly surprising that individual studies reach different results. In the following, only the trace element iron will be addressed (for zinc deficiency see secti on 4.2.2.7.3). Anemia is a frequent in AN (Devuyst et al., 1993) . Its true prevalence is possibly 113 underestimated due to hemoconcentration and hypovolemia. Anemia in AN ha s multifactorial causes: bone marrow depression, substrate deficiency, folic acid deficiency, vitamin B12 deficiency and also iron deficiency can all play a role. The role of each of these factors varies on an interindividual basis. Iron deficiency only plays a role in a smaller proportion of patients (Nova et al., 2006) . Iron consumption is especially reduced in patients with a vegetarian diet. On the other hand, iron loss is reduced due to amenorrhea. Vitamins Anorexia patients often have a one -sided diet, and many take particular care to consume foods that are rich in vitamins. Mostly, however, nutrition nevertheless remains so unbalanced that the findings on vitamin supply and on vitamin status of AN patients are contradictory and inconsistent (Mira et al., 1989; Thibault & Roberge, 1987; Van Binsbergen et al., 1988) . More recent investigations point to a greater deficiency above all of water -soluble vitamins, in particular from the B -complex (Hadigan et al., 2000; Levine et al., 2007; Moyano et al., 1998; Rock & Vasantharajan, 1995) . Many but by no means all AN patients show signs of reduced vitamin su pply of thiamine, niacin, riboflavin and folic acids. From the available findings, it is not possible to draw a general recommendation on vitamin substitution in the case of moderate underweight. An insufficient vitamin intake can generally be offset by a balanced and sufficient diet. 2.2.6.4. Refeeding during and at the end of therapy Increasing energy requirements in the course of therapy Due to different and interindividual metabolic changes, the energy requirements vary not only from patient to patien t but also in the different phases of treatment. The formulas for calculating the basal metabolic rate derived from normal -weight and overweight patients are therefore not suitable for application in AN. While the initial weight increase due to the reduced basal metabolic rate in the so -called \"hunger metabolism\" is often possible or indicated by low amounts of energy, the energy requirements usually rise substantially in the later treatment phase. As there are no evidence -based data on the concrete level o f requirements, the guidelines on this point are mainly based on clinical experience. Studies suggest that AN patients require between 5000 and 10000 excess calories in order to gain 1 kg of weight (Kaye et al. , 1988; Marzola et al., 2013) . However, the indication of requirements in the form of excess calories is limited, because the basal metabolic rate is strongly altered and cannot be reliably estimated in AN patients using the customary prediction formulas (Cuerda et al., 2007; Forman -Hoffman et al., 2006; Polito et al., 2000; Scalfi et al., 2001) . The range cited in various guidelines stretches from 5 -100 kcal/kg/kg. At the upper end of the range, this can be equated with an energy intake of up to 5000 kcal/d. The precise reasons for this broad range remain unclear, but the following factors have been discussed: physical activity, individual differences in the efficiency of energy utilization, thermoregulatory processes, composition of the s ynthesized tissue, fluid shifts, age and treatment phase (Marzola et al., 2013) . Besides the metabolic changes and the resultantly 114 high energy needs, however, a lack of compliance (restriction, compensatory behaviors) can also erroneously suggest a high need. Due to the difficulties in reliably calculating the energy requirements, in the later phase of refeeding, the estimation of the respectiv e requirement based on weight gain is useful: In the case of a lack of weight gain, an increase in energy intake is advisable. 2.2.6.5. Refeeding in the outpatient setting Nutritional therapeutic counseling to support patients in normalizing their eating behavior appears to be highly useful across all therapy phases and thus also in the outpatient setting. Especially at the end of inpatient therapy, it is important to adapt and consolidate the newly learned behaviors to daily life on an individual basis. Nutritional counseling can help the patient to select or prepare approp riate meals with the aim of eating a regular and balanced diet that covers her needs. 2.2.6.6. Vegetarian and vegan diets There are not currently any evidence -based specific nutritional recommendations for patients with AN (Marzola et al., 2013) . For the time bein g, therefore, it appears useful to draw on nutritional recommendations for the general population as a benchmark for patients with eating disorders. The German Nutrition Society (DGE) evaluates an ovo -lacto vegetarian diet as a suitable long -term diet both for adults and for adolescents, but emphasizes the need to select foods carefully, in order to avoid nutrient deficiencies especially in adolescents. If a patient has decided on a vegetarian diet, it is recommendable to explore the motives for this decisi on during psychotherapy. If children and adolescents eat a purely plant -based diet, in which they refrain completely from animal products, they are described as vegans. The DGE deems a vegan diet to be unsuitable for the whole of childhood (http://www.dge.de/presse/pm/kinder -vegetarisch - ernaehren -ja-oder-nein/ ). According to the DGE, adults who nevertheless wish to eat a vegan diet should take a vitamin B12 preparation on a long -term basis, ensure that they consume an adequate amount above all of the critical nutrients, and possibly use enriched foods and nutrient preparations. For this purpose, they should consult a qualified nutrition specialist, and the supply of critic al nutrients should be regularly checked by a medical practitioner. A further aspect that appears to make a vegan diet problematic for patients with eating disorders is that vegans have to constantly and comprehensively deal with the theme of nutrition, wh ich can hinder recovery from an eating disorder. 2.2.7. Pharmacotherapy Overall, the evidence on pharmacotherapy for AN is unsatisfactory, both for antidepressants and for antipsychotics. As the studies conducted to date differ strongly in terms of design (acute therapy vs. relapse prevention, controls against placebo vs. controls against other pharmaceuticals; considerable differences in the employed basic treatment), it is not possible 115 to conduct a meta -analysis. A primary endpoint was weight criteria: e xtent of weight gain, speed of weight gain, duration of treatment until weight restitution and number of patients who achieved a sufficient weight gain. With regard to antipsychotics, only studies with very small sample sizes are available. Only a small nu mber of studies employed longer follow -up observation periods, although these are necessary to be able to evaluate the clinical significance of weight effects under pharmacotherapy. Due to the low number of controlled trials, in the following, case studies are also included, although these usually describe much larger effects than those found in controlled studies. Only those substances are mentioned for which at least one controlled trial is available (table 4.4). 2.2.7.1. Antipsychotics More recent studies on the group of antipsychotics address second -generation antipsychotics (for reviews, see al., 2016) ). Among this group, the antipsychotic olanzapine particularly stands out with respect to the evide nce base. Thus, for the group of second -generation antipsychotics, first, a closer look at the study findings on olanzapine will be taken, while further substances in this group will be summarized. Subsequently, for the sake of completeness, an overview wi ll be provided of the state of evidence for first -generation antipsychotics. Second -generation antipsychotics Olanzapine Olanzapine belongs to the group of atypical neuroleptics. It can - especially at high dosages - cause extrapyramidal -motor symptoms (EPMS), but the risk of agranulocytosis is far lower than for clozapine. With indication -appropriate treatment, olanzapine very often leads to considerable weight gain in normal -weight or overweight patients. The assumption is that insulin action is impair ed and thus the carbohydrate metabolism is disrupted. There is no evidence that olanzapine acts directly on the hypothalamic regulatory mechanisms of body weight. Due to this favorable range of side effects for the treatment of AN, various clinical trials have been conducted on the use of olanzapine in AN. A series of uncontrolled case studies (Barbarich et al., 2004; Boachie et al. , 2003; Malina et Mehler et al., et al. , 2002; Wang et al. , 2006) have shown that olanzapine leads to a clear weight gain. In the case study with the highest number of described cases (Barbarich et al., 2004) , however, the weight gain was substantially lower than in all other case studies. In an RCT comparing ol anzapine with chlorpromazine, olanzapine was not found to be superior with respect to weight gain (Mondraty et al., 2005) . An RCT in adolescents found no superiority of olanzapine over placebo with respect to weight gain with a study duration of ten wee ks (Kafantaris et al., 2011) . A furth er controlled trial in which olanzapine was used as an additional treatment compared to treatment as usual for all study participants found no difference regarding weight gain (Brambilla et al., 2007) . However, the patients treated with olanzapine (comparison condit ion: treatment with chlorpromazine) showed a significant improvement in anorexia -typical cognitions (measured 116 with the Eating Disorder Inventory, EDI). In a further randomized controlled trial (Bissada et al., 2008) (N=34), both groups took part in an inpatient treatment program over ten weeks. The olanzapine group received differing doses of olanzapine. Com pared to the group which did not receive olanzapine, the group receiving olanzapine showed signi ficantly better weight gain and a greater decrease in obsessive symptoms. A further RCT found a significant superiority of olanzapine over placebo with respect to weight gain after a treatment duration of eight weeks, although this difference can only be described as marginal in terms of the extent of weight gain (Attia et al., 2011) . Olanzapine is generally initially used at a low dose of 2.5mg, which can be increased if necessary. Further second -generation antipsychotics For risperidone, there is one RCT (N=40), which examined the duration until achievement of a target weight as compared to placebo. Risperidone was not superior regarding weight -related outcome measures or regarding other psychometric variables (Hagman et al., 2011) . With regard to quetiapine, there is one RCT and one open study, whose quality was rated as low. A very small RCT on quetiapine found no difference betwe en verum and placebo regarding weight and eating disorder psychopathology (Powers et al. , 2012) . An open -label naturalistic study on quetiapine - in addition to treatment as usual - showed trends towards a better weight development and a good tolerability of the subst ance (Court et al., 2010) . For sulpiride, which occupies an intermediate position between first - and second -generat ion antipsychotics, there are two controlled trials, which independently showed a better weight gain in groups treated with sulpiride than with other psychotropic drugs (Ruggiero et al., 2001) or placebo (Vandereycken, 1984) . As a limitation, it should be mentioned that in the study by Vandereycken (1984) , the weight gain was only better initially, and not following the crossover of the treatment arms. In a study by Ruggiero et al. (Mondraty et al., 200 5; Ruggiero et al., 2001) , the weight gain, which was on average a little over 4kg, was significantly greater than for fluoxetine and clomipramine, but still unsatisfactorily low, and lower than in psychotherapy studies. First -generation antipsychotics Cassano et al. (2003) described the administration of halope ridol as an adjunctive treatment to standard treatment over a total of 6 months (N=13). Therapy effects that were solely attributable to haloperidol could not be identified. For pimozide (Orap\u00ae), an antipsychotic with a particularly adverse range of cardia c-related side effects and thus limited suitability for the treatment of AN, two smaller controlled studies (Vandereycken & Pierloot, 1982) did not show improved weight gain upon administration of pimozide. Overview antipsychotics Although weight gain is described as a side effect of many neuroleptics, it has not yet been demonstrated that this is also an - in this case desirable - effect o f antipsychotic treatment in the case of AN. Nevertheless, antipsychotics are utilized in many clinics and occasionally also 117 in outpatient treatment. The aims in this respect have more to do with the psychomotor - dampening main effects of this group of medi cations. They serve to reduce stress conditions, the often pronounced urge for movement and the circular thinking around eating disorder - related themes such as eating or shape and weight. From the available case studies, application reports and clinical pr actice, the following principles can be derived for antipsychotic administration in AN: 1. The required dosage is generally low. 2. The indication is derived from symptoms which accompany the AN. The necessary duration of pharmacological treatment thus depends on the course of these symptoms and not on the eating disorder diagnosis. 3. Antipsychotics with a low range of extrapyramidal si de effects are preferred. 4. Compliance is crucial for the utility of such medications. The benefit of the medication must be communicable to the patient. Summary: Empirical evidence on treatment with antipsychotics Overall, the state of study findings on t he treatment of AN with antipsychotics is highly unsatisfactory. There are five system atic reviews et al., 2016) , which show similar results. Olanzapine is described as the antipsychotic with the presumably clearest effect on AN, although an effect on the core symptoms of AN have not yet been conclusively demonstrated. However, olanzapine appears to have an effect on the associated symptoms such as compulsions. There is no evidence that neuroleptics con tribute to improved weight development in AN (EL 1a). There is limited evidence that obsessive -compulsive symptoms and circular thoughts are favorably influenced by olanzapine (EL 2a). 4.2.2.7.2. Antidepressants Tricyclic antidepressants Potential toxicity and the range of side effects are the main reasons why tricyclic antidepressants are nowadays rarely used in the treatment of AN. In more recent studies, these medications tend to rather play a role as a comparison condition. Clomipramine , a tricyclic anti depressant, is at least theoretically an interesting substance for the treatment of AN given its use in the treatment of obsessive -compulsive disorders. In a study from 1980, Lacey and Crisp (1980) did not find an improved weight gain compared to placebo in patients treated with 50 mg o f clomipramine. However, they did describe an improved appetite and larger food intake with simultaneously higher urge for movement in the verum arm. In a further study, however, clomipramine (average approx. 60 mg) performed worse than sulpiride with resp ect to weight gain (Ruggiero et al., 2001) . 118 Amitriptyline, which used to be one of the most frequently prescribed antidepressants for the treatment of depression, with a broad anticholinergic side effect profile and frequent weight gain, unselectively inhibits the reuptake of monoamines in the synaptic cleft. Bas ed on several case reports with a positive weight progression (Kendler, 1978; Mills, 1976; Moore, 1977; Needleman & Waber, 1976) , in 1985, Biedermann and colleagues (1985) conducted the first controlled trial (average dosage 115 mg) in AN. A better weight gain compared to placebo was observed. In a later study by Halmi et al. (1986) , ami triptyline (up to 160 mg) was employed as a comparison arm together with placebo compared to cyproheptadine (see below). In this study arm, there was a tendency for improved weight gain, but this was not significantly better than in the placebo arm, and poorer than under cyproheptadine. In a control led study, Brambilla et al. (1995 c) examined nortriptyline , the active metabolite of amitriptyline, compared to fluoxetine (see below) and did not find any differences between the two medications. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) Fluoxetine inhibits the uptake of serotonin from the synaptic cleft and has direct effects on 5 - HT 2C receptors. At very high doses, fluoxetine can also inhibit noradrenaline reuptake. In contrast to most other antidepressants, weight gain is not one of the typical s ide effects of fluoxetine. Fluoxetine has the longest half -life of all antidepressants (fluoxetine 4 -6 days, active metabolite norfluoxetine 4 -16 days) and a substantial interaction potential (inhibition of CYP2D6, to a l esser extent also inhibition of CYP3A4). Likely due to the established position of fluoxetine in the treatment of bulimia nervosa, there are several studies on this substance. Compared to placebo, Attia et al. (Attia et al. , 1998) found no improvement in weight development in a randomized controlled trial. Regarding the active form of AN, the weight effects of fluoxetine were not better compared to amineptine (Brambilla et al., 1995 c) (amineptine is an atypical tricyclic antidepressant, with a strong stimulating effect, which is now no longer manufactured.) The same research group likewise found no diff erence between fluoxetine and nortriptyline regarding the restrictive form of AN (Brambilla et al., 1995 a). However, these two controlled trials were very small (N= 6 vs. 7 active form of AN; N= 15 vs. 7 restrictive form of AN). Thus, for the initial weight gain, there is no evidence for a benefit of fluoxetine. Two controlled studies, by contrast, suggested advantages of fluoxetine administration for relapse prevention. However, for the study by Halmi et al. (1999), only six -month outcomes are available, although the study was designed for one year. In the study by Kaye et al. (2001) , the number of dropouts was very high, especially in the placebo group. At best, these two studies provide indications of a possible posit ive effect of fluoxetine in terms of relapse prevention. In a more recent, well -designed study by Walsh et al. (2006) , however, no benefit of fluoxetine treatment following weight normalization was found. This finding i s in accordance with a clinical longitudinal follow -up study over 24 months by Strober et al. (1997 a) of 33 patients, in which fluoxetine did not show better courses when retrospectively compared with the courses of other patients withou t fluoxetine. Pharmacologically plausible are case reports that AN developed upon administration of fluoxetine due to bulimia nervosa (Oliveros et al. , 1992; V az . This danger of an SSRI -induced anorexia may be present for other substances of this group (Sagduyu, 1997) . Citalopram has a much shorter half -life compared to fluoxetine and a more favorable interaction potential. In a study by Calandra et al. (1999) (N=6 patients with AN), citalopram 119 (20mg) was employed together with systemic therapy. In the uncontrolled study, the scale scores on the Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI) improved, but no systematic change in weight was found. In the only existing co ntrolled study on citalopram (Fassino et al., 2002) , compared to a waiting control group, significant changes in patients' psychopathological burden such as depressive symptoms were found , which were attributable to citalopram, but the weight development was comparable in both groups. The study was afflicted by a high number of treatment dropouts. Sertraline also has a low interaction potential and a favorabl e side effect profile compared to other SSRIs. There is only one controlled, but not randomized study (Santonastaso et al. , 2001) , which described an improvement in depressive symptoms, self -perception and perfectionism in the group treated with sertraline. Again, however, weight development did not differ from the control condition. Overview: Evidence on treatment with antidepressants Although the evidence base for antidepressants is somewhat better than for antipsychotics, it is still not sufficient for deriving recommendations for treatment with this class of medications. The efficacy of antidepressants, as suggested in a considerable number of case studies, is rather likely to be attributable to the concomitant treatments that were often conducted in parallel rather than to the antidepressants themselves. The study findings give no reason to hope that better studies with the respective substances would bring about a fundamental change to the conclusion: There is no evidence for a specific efficacy of antidepressants in the treat ment of AN if the focus is on weight -related criteria. Nevertheless, antidepressants are regularly used in anorexia treatment within clinical practice in order to treat concomitant symptoms of AN such as depressive disorders or obsessive - compulsive symptoms. The scientific basis for this is essentially extrapo lated from studies that were conducted in patients without eating disorders. There is no sufficient evidence to justify this practice. Depressive and obsessive -compulsive accompanying symptoms are also caused by the low body weight and can improve through weight gain even without an additional specific therapy (Dowson, 2004; Jordan et al., 2008; Meehan et al. , 2006) . Furthermore, the risk of side effects in antidepressant pharmacotherapy is increased in AN due to several specific factors: 1.) Body weight is lower; the volume of dis tribution is lower. 2.) Oral intake is rendered more diffi cult given the irregular eating behavior and the recurrent vomiting. 3.) Due to the already existing cardiac difficulties, cardiac side effects are more dangerous (see guideline chapter 8 \"Physical sequelae of eating disorders\"). 4.) Electrolyte imbalances are more frequent. Accordingly, the risk of overlooking an induced syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is higher. Specific considerations in children and adolescents Based on the available data, the treatment of depressive symptoms in children and adolescents with AN in the state of starvation is not recommended, as there are no indications that an additional administration of antidepressants in the case of underweight (< 10th BMI percentile) 120 accelerates or improves treatment progression (guidelines of the German Association for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Psychosomatics and Psychotherapy, 2007). There are barely any data on the safety of antidepressants in childr en and adolescents who are underweight. If depressive symptoms persist following sufficient weight rehabilitation, a supplementary treatment with a serotonin reuptake inhibitor can be considered. In Germany, only fluoxetine is permitted for the treatment o f moderate to severe depression in this age group. Summary: Empirical evidence on treatment with antidepressants The five available placebo -controlled studies (Attia et al., 1998; Biederman et al., 1985; Halmi et al., 1986; Lacey & Crisp, 1980; Walsh et al., 2006) did not find a superiority of antidepressants either with respect to weight change or for the broader area of eating disorder symptoms. The other three studies (Brambilla et al., 1995 b,c; Ruggiero et al., 2001) compared antidepressants with other antidepressants and did not find any differences. It is also unclear which dosages should be employed. While fluoxetine was given at the hi gh dose tested for bulimia nervosa, other SSRIs were given at the standard dose. In the controlled studies, tri cyclic antidepressants were employed at rather low doses. Overall, the evidence remains unchanged since the Cochrane review from 2006, which cons idered most of the aforementioned studies (Claudino et al., 2006) . There is no evidence for the specific efficacy of antidepressants in AN (EL 1a) 2.2.7.3. Other pharmaceuticals Appetite stimulants Cyproheptadine (Peritol\u00ae), a serotonin antagonist, was primarily developed as an anti -allergic medication. However, it emerged that it stimulates the appetite. Despite the well -evidenced weight -increasing effect of cyproheptadine in other nutrition disorders, the results for AN are ambiguous. As with the aforementioned group of psychotropic drugs, there are case reports suggesting a weight efficacy of cyproheptadine (Benady, 1970; 1971) . However, the controlled studies in this regard only found a weight -increasing effect for subgroups of AN (Goldberg et al., 1980; Ha lmi et al., 1986; Kibel, 1969) . For the group of cannabinoids, there are studies on Cannabinoids bind to receptors whose importance and function in the human organism is not yet completely understood. For AN, primarily the CB1 receptors are likely to play a role, which are found on nerve cells in the basal ganglia, cerebellum and hippocampus. As the brain regions in which the CB1 receptor is predominantly found play an important role in memory (hippocampus and cerebellum) as well as in the regulation of movement, it is reasonable to assume that endocannabinoids influence processes of learning and movement. Research findings show that the presence of the CB1 receptor is n ecessary for the extinction of negative memories. Therefore, it is suspected that endocannabinoids play an important role in anxiety disorders. For eating disorders, the role of 121 this receptor type is important with regard to the regulation of motility and appetite. An involvement of the endocannabinoid system in AN is demonstrated in the increased blood levels of endocannabinoids in AN (in contrast to BN) (Monteleone et al., 2005) . The re is only one controlled cross over study (N= 11) on the use of THC in AN (Gross et al., 1983) , which found no effect on weight gain. An RCT on the CB1 agonist dronabinol demonstrated, over a very short investigation period (4 weeks) in a small sample with a cross over design, a significant superiority of dronabinol over placebo regarding weight gain, although this was rather low from a clinical perspective (1 kg vs. 0.34 kg). Further publications from the work group examining this sample refer t o endocrinological changes or changes in motor activity (increase under dronabinol compared to placebo), which might limit the potential use of this substance (Andries, et al., 2014; 2015 a,b). Lithium Lithium has been used since the mid -20th century as a mood stabilizer in bipol ar affective disorders and as an antidepressant augmentation strategy. For use in the therapeutic area, the tolerability is good, but due to the low therapeutic index, there is a risk of potentially lethal lithium intoxication in the case of overdose. A kn own and frequent side effect of lithium treatment is weight gain, which suggests its use in AN. Besides two case reports (Barcai, 1977; Stein et al., 1982) , there is one smaller controlled study on the use of lithium in AN (Gross et al., 1981) . However, due to methodological weaknesses of the study, the reported improved weight gain in the lithium group has to be called into question. D-cycloserine D-cycloserine is a glutamatergic N -methyl -d-aspartate (ND MA) receptor agonist, which in experimental approaches can strengthen the effects of exposure therapy via the improvement of emotional learning. In an RCT with a pilot nature, a substantially higher weight gain under D-cycloserine with exposure was describ ed compared to a placebo condition (Levinson et al., 2015) . However, the study shows considerable methodological weaknesses, as only 19.4% of patients had a baseline BMI of less than 18.5 kg/m\u00b2 (mean baseline BMI of 20.24 kg/m2). Anxiolytics - Benzodiazepines Benzodiazepines bind to central nervous inhibiting GABA receptors and exert anxiolytic, muscle -relaxant, anticonvulsive and sleep -promoting effects. Due to the anxiolytic active component, there is at least theoretical reason to assume that administ ration will influence fears in relation to food intake in AN. However, a high potential for dependence and negative effects on learning processes, which play an important role in the therapy process, strongly limit this treatment approach. With regard to alprazolam , there is one controlled study (Steinglass et al., 2014 b) with an extremely short observation period (only two admin istrations at two mealtimes; N=20). No difference compared to placebo was found regarding amount of food and anxiety. 122 Nutritional supplements - Zinc Zinc is among the trace elements that are essential for the metabolism. The recommended daily intake amounts to 15 up to a maximum of 100 mg. If this maximum intake is exceeded, intoxication symptoms such as nausea, vomiting or diarrhea can arise. Zinc ful fills many different functions in the body. It is found in traces in numerous foods such as meat, fish, milk products, wholemeal products, oilseeds, and various salad types. Despite the multitude of foods containing zinc, the unbalanced and poor nutrition in AN frequently also leads to zinc deficiency (Ainley et al., 1986; Bakan, 1979; Bakan et al. Casper 1978 , 1980 ; Dinsmore et al., 1985; Humphries et al. , 1989; Katz et al., 1987; Lask et al., 1993) . Nevertheless, zinc deficiency was not found in every investigation (Van Binsbergen et al., 1988; Varel a et al. , 1992), meaning that a diagnosis of AN can in no way be equated with zinc deficiency. This is also corroborated in a recent work reporting that of 153 patients with AN, zinc deficiency was found in only 3 cases (2.1%) (Achamrah et al., 2017) . The symptoms of zinc deficiency are diverse, and include, for instance , growth disorders, anemia, hair loss, dry skin and brittle nails. Above all, however, zinc deficiency leads to hypogeusia up to ageusia9, to lack of appetite and to weight loss, and hence causes a clinical picture resembling that of AN. There are indicati ons that lack of appetite is linked to an attenuated release of the neuropeptide Y in the hypothalamus (Levenson, 2003) . There are a series o f studies (Bakan, 1979; Birmingham 2002; Yamaguchi et al. , 1992) which in part report dramatic weight gains following zinc substitution in AN. However, these m ay have been exceptional cases in which a manifest zinc deficiency contributed to malnutrition. Accordingly, a meaningful use of zinc substitution in AN would be limited to cases in which a zinc deficiency is actually present. In the thus far only controll ed trial on zinc supplementation, Birmingham et al. (Birmingham et al. , 1994) found that weight gain was twice as high for 100mg zinc/day compared to placebo, but the weight gain was nevertheless only moderately significant. Oxytocin Oxytocin plays a cen tral role in the neurobiological mediation of social behavior, appetite, anxiety and stress. In AN, a reduced concentration of oxytocin in the cerebrospinal fluid is found during starvation. In light of these findings, studies have investigated the effect of oxytocin on food intake and emotion recognition. The studies by the work group led by Kim et al. (2014 , 2015) on the effect of oxytocin in eating disorders found, in a double -blind within - subject crossover design, no effects of the hormone on calorie consumption and emotion recognition in AN , while oxytocin did elicit these effects in BN. Ult imately, the results were interpreted such that in the framework of starvation in AN, emotional processes are suppressed. However, the methodological quality of both of the studies by the work group were rated as low and very low, respectively. Combinatio n therapy There are no randomized controlled trials comparing a psychotherapeutic treatment of AN with a combination of psychotherapeutic plus psychopharmacological treatment. 9 Loss of taste functions 123 2.2.8. Experimental procedures Neuromodulation In light of the improved underst anding of the underlying neurobiological factors in AN, neuromodulatory methods to treat AN are increasingly being examined (Brockmeyer et al. , 2018; McClelland et al. , 2013 a). These include, above all, deep brain stimulation (DMS) as a minimally invasive procedure, and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) as well as transcranial direct -current stimulation (tDCS) as non -invasive procedures. In a non - controlled clinical study (n=16) on deep brain stimulation over one year, half of the examined patients with a severe, chronic course achieved a relevant weight increase (BMI > 17g/m\u00b2) and improvements in anxiety and obsessive (target region: subgenual cingulate cortex). However, several undesired effects were also observed, including seizure s and infections (Lipsman et al. , 2017) . Besides the subgenual cingulate cortex, in an individual case study and a small case series, the ventr al striatum and the nucleus accumbens were also selected as target regions for brain stimulation. So far, there are no published and only one ongoing small randomized controlled trial on DBS in AN. Moreover, it is largely unclear which brain regions are su itable targets for DBS in AN (Treasure & Schmidt, 2013) . For rTMS, two case series and one randomized placebo -controlled pilot trial (with a single therapy session) showed that th e intervention was associated with a short -term reduction of AN symptoms as well as an improvement in affect, although in all patients who were followed further, in part substantial weight losses occurred over time (van den Eynde et al., 2013; McClelland et al., 2016; McClelland et al., 2013b) . Further assessments of the efficacy of rTMS are currently underway within several ongoing randomized controlled trials. With regard to tDCS in AN, so far, there is only one case series, in which a sustained improvement in AN symptoms was observed in half of the patients following the intervention (Khedr et al., 2014) . To date, these are experimental approaches which only play a role within research contexts. 3. Treatment settings For an overview on treatment settings and the framework conditions in Germany , see also Chapter 2. So far, there are only two systematic reviews on a comparison of treatment settings (Madden et al., 2015 a; Meads et al., 2001) . Due to methodological shortcomings of the available original literature and the heterogeneity of studies, it is not possible to draw any definitive conclusions, although Madden et al. (Madden et al., 2015 a) interpret the evidence such that given the comparable effects, less intensive settings, which are more economical, are preferable in the treatment of AN. A corresponding recommendation was incorporated into the gui delines of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists (Hay et al., 2014) . It should be taken into account that framework conditions and programs of inpatient treatment can differ greatly between different countries, and the quality of outpatient care also does not necessarily correspond to that which is examined in randomized controlled trials. Thus, based on the current data, an evidence -based decision for a particular setting is only possible to a limited extent in the treatment o f AN; rather, the decision should be broadly based on clinical experiences and 124 expert opinion (Fairburn, 2005; Vandereycken, 2003) . The recommendations on indication criteria for day -clinic or inpatient treatment are presented in sections 3.2 and 3.3. 3.1. Outpatien t treatment See section 2.2 for treatment approaches and methods as well as the available evidence on their efficacy. 3.2. Day -clinic treatment Day-clinic treatment phases often follow the inpatient treatment phase in the therapy of AN, and serve the purpose of preparing the patient for the transition to outpatient treatment (\"step - down\" approach). While inpatient treatment means removing the pat ient from the context of her everyday life, a day -clinic treatment entails a daily switch between intensive treatment in the clinic and a return to the everyday life situation (Zeeck & Hartmann, 2008) . As such, a day - clinic treatment decreases the disadvantages and risks of a longer -term hospitalization and emphasizes the patient's personal responsibility through a substantially lower degree of external control and supervision and a constant confrontation with possible difficulties in the everyday life situation. Day-clinic treatments as part of specialized pro grams can also be considered in patients who can no longer be sufficiently looked after in the outpatient setting or whose outpatient therapy process has stagnated. As such, a day -clinic stay means a temporary intensification of an outpatient therapy proce ss. It enables complex interventions on the psychological and physical level, including support in nutrition (generally speaking, two main meals and two snacks are offered in the clinic, on 4 -5 days per week). A day -clinic treatment can be considered in pa tients at moderate risk with chronic AN, in whom an outpatient treatment is not sufficient to overcome interpersonal and social problems - especially if these patients have already repeatedly undergone inpatient treatments and should remain in close contac t with their everyday life situation. An overview of day -clinic treatment programs for eating disorders is provided by Zipfel et al. (2002) , Friedmann et al. (2016) as well as Hepburn & Wilson (2014) . As program elements and the underlying theoretical orientations vary greatly, these are difficult to compare with each other. Moreover, treatment intensity and treatment duration is also very variable, ranging from 6-12 hours per day, for 4 -7 days per we ek, over a total of 3 -26 weeks (most frequent: 10 -16 weeks, see (Friedman et al., 2016) ). Only a small number of empirical studies have compared day -clinic and inpatient therapy. A multicenter randomized controlled trial compared specialized inpatient treatment (average 14.6 weeks) in adolescents with a three -week inpatient and subsequent speci alized day -clinic treatment (average 16.5 weeks in the same setting) (Herpertz -Dahlmann et al., 2014) . A procedure following a \"step -down\" approach was not inferior to the continuous inpatient treatment regarding weight gain and reduction of eating disorders 12 months after the end of therap y, and also entailed lower costs. The inpatient -day-clinic group even showed greater improvements with respect to well -being and psychosexual development. One advantage lies 125 in preserving the patient's integration within the family and the social environme nt. The treatment in the \"step -down\" condition ensued in the same treatment team and with close integration of family members. So far, there are no randomized studies comparing day -clinic with outpatient treatment in AN. Most of the studies on day -clinic treatment are observation studies without a comparison or control group, which often do not report separate data for the different groups of eating - disordered patients (for overviews see (Friedman et al., 2016; Hepburn & Wilson, 2014) ). An exception to this is the small case -control study compar ing inpatient and day -clinic therapy (Zeeck et al. , 2006) . Overall, the available observation studies indicate that day -clinic treatment is effective in AN but that weight gains are lower than in the inpatient setting (Abbate -Daga et al., 2015; al. , 2008; et al., 2006) , see also a meta -analysis including naturalistic studies (Zeeck et al., 2018) . Stronger weight gains appear to be achieved when there is a high motivation, the patient has a short illness duration and a lower illness severity, or the setting resembles an inpatient treatment through the combination with supervised living groups, an intensive i nclusion of family members or a 7 -day program (Gerlinghoff et al. , 1998; Howard et al., 1999; Kaplan & Olmsted, 1997) . In terms of the questio n of the optimal dosage and treatment duration, there is not yet sufficient available evidence (Friedman et al., 2016) . Summary: Evidence on partial -inpatient/day -clinic treatment of AN There is limited evidence that day -clinic treatment within a specialized therapy program is effective (EL 4; (Friedman et al., 2016; Hepburn & Wilson, 2014) ). For adolescents (14 -18 years) with a short duration of illness, a combined treatment with short inpatient admission and subsequent specia lized day -clinic treatment (\"step - down\") is not to a continuous inpatient treatment (EL 1b; (Herpertz -Dahlmann et al., 2014) ). For adult patients with AN and substantial underweight, a day -clinic treatment appears to lead to lower weight gains compared to an inpatient treatment (EL 4; (Abbate -Daga et al., 2015; Treat al., et al., 2006) ). 3.3. Inpatient treatment Inpatient treatment is more often necessary in the case of AN than in other eating disorders. This applies especially to adult patients. The reasons for this are the physical risk and the continuous supervision of eatin g behavior often necessary due to the marked ambivalence and anxiety regarding weight gain (Bodell & Keel, 2010) , as well as the treatment in a multiprofessional team which work in close collaboration. A psychosomatic -psychotherapeutic hospital treatment or a psychiatric -psychosomatic hospital treat ment in children and adolescents is defined through particular characteristics and encompasses a combination of different interventions which are aligned to each other (see also Operation and Procedure Code 126 OPS)10, which need to be supplemented by disorder -oriented elements. A hospital tr eatment can also be necessary in patients with less severe underweight if they have a serious psychological comorbidity (e.g. trauma -related disorders, borderline personality disorders), a severe behavior problem (e.g. extreme \"purging\" behavior, excessive -compulsive exercise, self-harm) or were originally in a high weight range but have lost a lot of weight in a relatively short period of time. Further advantages of inpatient therapy are that the treatment takes place in a group and that it can enable scop e for development away from problematic family contexts. On the other hand - especially in children and adolescents - the risks inherent in a longer -term hospitalization and the interruption of regular schooling need to be taken into account (Gowers et al., 2000, 2010) . Towards the end of an inpatient therapy, it is of vital importance to prepare the patie nt to transfer the achieved changes to everyday life in a targeted manner, for instance through a day -clinic treatment stage following the inpatient phase (\"step -down\", see above) and a timely planning of the outpatient follow -up treatment. A main goal of inpatient treatment lies in physical stabilization, for which a sufficient weight gain is a prerequisite. Studies suggest that in the treatment of adult patients, as high a weight as possible (BMI > 18 kg/m\u00b2) should be strived for in order to reduce the ri sk of relapse (Baran et al., 1995; Howard et al., 1999; Steinhausen et al. , 2008) . For children and adolescents, an orientation to the 25th BMI age percentile taking into account premorbid BMI data is generally accepted. The aim is menarche or the resumption of menses (American Psychiatric Association, 2006; Dempfle et al., 2013; Golden et al., 2008) . An inpatient treatment enables an intensive psychotherapeutic accompaniment of the patient during weight gain, which is generally linked to strong fears, feelings of powerlessness and helplessness. Three ideal -typical phases of inpatient treatment can be distinguished: At the beginning of therapy , the focus is on motivating the pa tient and providing concrete help regarding eating and weight gain. In this phase, the treatment serves to provide support in the case of fears and strong ambivalence, to put dysfunctional beliefs into perspective, and to encourage the patient to change he r eating behavior. In the further course of treatment , there should be increasing work on the central psychological problem areas and their relation to the symptoms (Herzog & Zeeck, 2001; Pierloot et al. , 1982) . A stepwise intensification of the program must be oriented to the patient's resilience and approachability and h er physical situation. As relapses are frequent following inpatient treatment phases, the final phase should be sufficiently long and should concentrate on preparing the patient for discharge. This includes planning the outpatient follow - up therapy, the an ticipation of relapses and difficulties after discharge, practice elements (shopping, preparing meals, restaurant visit, weekend breaks) and experiencing a phase in 10 This encompasses for adults - if there is not a necessity for an integrated cl inical -psychos omatic - psychotherapeutic complex treatment (OPS 9 -642) or intensive treat ment (OPS 9 -61) due to physical risk - a therapy target -oriented treatment by a multiprofes sional team (physicians, psychologists, special therapists/social workers, nursing staff) with weekly team meetings and a minimum of 3 therapy units of individual and group therapies led by physicians and psychologists, as well as weekly visits from specia list physicians (psychosomatic -psychotherapeutic complex treatment, OPS 9 -63). For children and adolescents, OPS encompasses, as a regular treatment with mental and psychosomatic disorders and behavioral disorders in children (OPS 9 -656) and adolescents (O PS 9 -666) or with a risk of somatic decompensation as an intensive treatment (OPS 9 -672), a therapy target -oriented treatment by a multiprofessional team (physicians, psychologists, child and adolescent psychotherapists, special therapists, educational -nursing staff) with weekly visits and team meetings, and therapy units in the form of individual and group sessions led by physicians and psychologists with the children and adolescents as well as their parents and/or caregivers from the milieu of origin. 127 which weight is no longer continuously rising but can rather be maintained (Lay et al. , 2002) . There are indications that compared to adults, adolescents show a quicker weight gain and a stronger symptom improvement during inpatient treatment (Castro -Fornieles et al., 2007; Goddard et al., 2013; Zeeck et al., 2018) . Adult patients who are admitt ed with extreme underweight (BMI < 13 kg/m\u00b2) often do not achieve the otherwise aimed for target weight during an inpatient treatment. In these patients, a readmission following an appropriate period of time (in the sense of interval therapy) can be indica ted. For patients with a chronic course and who are very socially isolated, an inpatient (or also day - clinic) treatment can have the goal of achieving a stabilization on a level with a high quality of life by structuring the daily routine and rebuilding so cial contacts (see e.g. (R\u00f8 et al. , 2004) . For these patients, the concern regarding the physical situation is often not with normalizing weight but rather with a medical stabilization to the fullest possible extent. The therapy goals should be developed individually (see section 2.1). For patients with other mental disorders (e.g. borderline personality disorder, PTSD), a hierarchization of therapy aims may be necessary (oriented to the degree of risk from the respective symptom). In such cases, the therapeutic approach should contain elements that are aligned to the guidelines for the respective comorbid disorder. For children and adolescents, however, not least due to the physical and d evelopmental sequelae, the aim of weight normalization should not be deferred. The general conditions for inpatient treatments differ widely in the European countries (Richard, 2005) . Both in Great Britain and in Germany, the inpatient admission rates rose substantially in f emale adolescents with AN between 2010 and 2014 (National Health Service Statistics 2015, Bundesamt f\u00fcr Statistik , September 2015). In Germany, treatment days due to AN increased by approx. 5.5 days for 10 -14-year-olds and by approx. 3.5 days for 15 -18-year- olds between 2000 and 2013 (Bundesamt f\u00fcr Statistik, September 2015). Overall, the increasing economic pressure has led to a shortening of treatment times and discharge at a lower BMI (Suarez -Pinilla et al., 2015) . There are indications that this development is asso ciated with an increase in relapses and a reduction of inpatient therapy to \"weight and crisis management\" (Wiseman et al. , 2001) . Especially in the case of first -time hospitalizations, however, it should be ensured that patients reach an adequate weight in order to avoid rehospitalizations and chronification (Willer et al. , 2005) . Inpatient treatment should not be seen as a \"last resort\", but rather as a treatment option that encompasses specific therapeutic options (Vandereycken, 2003) . A naturalistic German multi -center study on the inpatient treatment of eat ing disorders showed that the risk of relapses was lower in patients treated in specialist clinics (Kaechele et al. , 2001; Richard, 2001; Richard, 2005 b). Treatment components Generally speaking, the offer of inpatient therapy programs in Germany is integrative and multimodal, meaning that it contains symptom -oriented components (agreement on a target weight, treatment contracts, weekly targets for weight gain, work with food di aries, mealtime 128 support and cooking support etc.), medical supervision, and components targeting the patient's psychological difficulties. A development away from inflexible, rigid programs towards procedures which consider the individual development of ea ch patient is apparent. Concrete work on eating behavior (\"mealtime support\"), which is often difficult to change, and on the fears associated with eating, is a cornerstone of inpatient anorexia treatment. This work includes the adherence to a mealtime str ucture, the stipulation of quantities of food as well as practice elements (relating to eating rituals and food selection as well as an increasing independence in terms of dealing with eating). Studies on exposure and response -prevention techniques (see section 4.2.2.4.2) have yielded first empirical hints for the efficacy of concrete work on anxiety - triggering eating situations. However, such work is time - and personnel -intensive. It requires experienced, further qualified staff and a sufficient staff -to-patient ratio. Depending on the extent of physical risk, patients should be regularly (generally 1 -3x/week) weighed in the morning, at approximately the same time, wearing light clothing (underwear). Additionally, it can be agreed that further weighing appo intments will take place unannounced, in order to uncover and address \"cheating\" (e.g. by drinking water). It is difficult to empirically assess which treatment components need to be included in inpatient treatment programs. However, there is consensus tha t they must contain medical supervision, nutrition management, body therapy approaches, elements specifically aligned to changing eating behavior and weight, therapy options with a non -verbal approach (creative/music therapy) as well as individual and grou p psychotherapy, which should be led by an experienced treatment team working in close collaboration with each other. In a cohort study, the introduction of symptom -oriented treatment elements and a structured treatment agreement with patients led to 70% o f patients achieving the specified target weight, compared to 20% previously (Herzog et al. 1996). In the treatment of children and adolescents, family -based interventions are essential (see section 4.2.2.2.1; (Espie & Eisler, 2015) ). Several randomized controlled trials have examined therapy components which were offered in addition to various \"standard programs\", such as particular types of nutrit ion management, behavioral therapy interventions (desensitization), social skills training, emotion skills training, cognitive remediation therapy (CRT), an additional pharmacotherapy or family therapy interventions (for an overview see: (Suarez - Pinilla et al., 2015) ). Studies on CRT as an \"add -on\" intervention showed that patients' cognitive flexibility improved in the short term ( (Brockmeyer et al., 2014; Davies et al., 2012) , see also section 4.2.2.4.1). In the treatment of children and adolescents, it can be assumed that family -based interventions contribute to therapy success by providing the caregiver with guidance in giving the patient concrete support (Herpertz -Dahlmann et al., 2014; Madden et al. , 2015 b). For patients with problematic exercise behavior (excessive, compulsive), a supervision of the exercise should take place and a tiered exercise program or sports therapy group should be offered ( (Calogero & Pedrotty, 2004) ; see also section 4.2.2.4.3). It can be assumed that a sport/exercise offer which is adapted to the physical situation also increases compliance in patients who tend to secretly circumvent exercise bans (Cook et al., 2016; Zeeck & Schlegel, 2013) . The offer of a body therapy can be especially beneficial in the phase of fear of weight gain. Two studies on mirror exposure poi nted to potential positive effects of such an intervention (Key et al., 2002; Vocks et al. , 2007) . Art therapy also plays an important role (Ganter et al. , 2009) . 129 Therapeutic contracts Therapeutic contracts are almost always part of specialized treatment programs (see e.g. (Godart et al., 2009; Zeeck & Hartmann.A, 2008) ). Generally, therapeutic contracts inc lude a target weight, targets for weekly weight gains, and possibly information on rules and participation in the therapy program. They appear to be superior to unstructured procedures with respect to weight gain (Herzog et al. , 1996) . For inpatient treatment, weight restitution should be sought, meaning reaching a BMI 18.5 for adults, and the 25th BMI age percentile for children and adolescents , but at least the 10th BMI age percentile (see also section 4.2.2.5). The target weight should generally be set within this range, although in justified individual cases (e.g. planning of interval treatment with an extremely low starting weight), it is possible to deviate from it. Programs that are too rigid, which insist on a strict adherence to w eight targets without tackling the patient's fears and ambivalence, should be avoided (Herzog et al., 2004; Touyz et al. , 198 4, 1987). They lead to a superficial adaptation of the patient, who often loses weight again following discharge. Internationally, weight targets of 500 -1000 g weight gain per week in the inpatient setting are recommended (American Psychiatric Association, 2006; National Institute of Clinical Excellence, 2004) . Investigations on characteristics of the weight curve progression indicate that weight development in the first weeks enables a good prediction of therapy outcome - and thus also the identification of risk patients who are ambivalent or who only have limited motivation (Boehm et al., 2016; Hartmann et al., 2007; Remschmidt & M\u00fcller, 1987; Wales et al., 2016) . The achieved weight should be maintained for a certain period of time prior to discharge in order to reduce the risk of later relapses and hospitalizations (Lay et al., 2002) . If patients do not adhere to the targets for weight gain over a longer peri od of time or lose substantial weight again prior to discharge, an early discharge for therapeutic reasons can be useful. However, this should always be linked to an offer of readmission following a preliminary discussion and renewed assessment of motivation (either in the sense of a short \"therapy break\" with predetermined du ration or in the sense of an \"interval treatment\"). Treatment duration Only a small number of studies have examined predictors of treatment duration (Maguire et al. , 2003; Nozoe et al., 1995; Strik Lievers et al., 2009) and predictors of the costs of an inpatient stay (Haas et al., 2012) . The findings suggest that a psychological comorbidity (personality disorder, affective disorder), previous inpatient stays and a lower BMI at admission are associated with longer treatment durations and higher costs. There is n o direct empirical evidence from which to derive the most beneficial treatment duration; however, there are indications that several factors need to be considered. An aim of an inpatient treatment episode should be the achievement of an adequate weight. Th erefore, treatment durations of several months can be expected when patients are admitted at a very low weight. The possibility of an \"interval treatment\" with renewed admission within an agreed time frame can be considered on a case -by-case basis and migh t be helpful. The results of a naturalistic multicenter study indicated that older patients with a long illness duration should 130 rather be treated for longer in order to achieve a good therapy outcome (sufficient weight gain, reduction of the eating disorde r)11 (Kaechele et al., 2001) . Trajectory and predictors of trajectory A more recent study was able to identify subgroups of patients with different weight trajectories during inpatient treatment: a negative quadratic trajectory, a negative quadratic trajectory with fast weight gain, and a positive linear trajectory with slower weight gain (Makhzoumi et al., 2017) . While most patients could be categorized into the first group, the latter group were more likely to achieve complete weight restoration at dischar ge. Another study fou nd, by con trast, that patients with an initially higher BMI and those who quickly gained weight (0.5 -1 kg/week within 6 weeks) had a substantially better prognosis regarding the achievement of complete weight restoration (Wales et al., 2016) . In adult patients, comorbid depressiv e symptoms and a high motivation to change proved to be positive predictors of a clinically significant improvement in the framework of inpatient treatment, while a high body dissatisfaction, difficulties in impulse regulation and social insecurity were ne gative predictors (Schlegl et al. , 2014) . In adolescent patient s, comorbid depressive symptoms and a high body dissatisfaction emerged as negative predictors of a clinically significant improvement (Schlegl et al., 2016) . With regard to the long -term trajectory, a low starting weight is linked to an increased risk of chronification and increased mortality rates 1 to 9 years after treatment (Hebebrand et al., 1997; Pinter et al., 2004) . One single study on relapses during the transition from inpatient to day - clinic therapy revealed that a long duration of illness (> 6 years), amenorrhea of more than 2.5 years as well as a lower weight at both admission and discharge were n egative predictors (Howard et al., 1999) . In adolescent patients, the following factors predicted the necessity for rehos pitalization: alcoholism of the par ents, further AN cases in the family, an eating disorder in early childhood, periodic hyperactivity, slow weight gain at first -time hospitalization and low BMI at first discharge (Steinhausen et al., 2008) . Treatment dropouts Due to patients' strong ambivalence regarding treatment, the risk of premature dropouts is generally high (Zeeck et al. , 2005) . The following factors are linked to an increased risk of dropout: a higher severity of eating disorder symptoms (Castro et al. , 2004; Huas et al., 2011; Kahn & Pike, the bulimic subtype and a pronounced impulsivity (Fichter et 2006; Kaechele et al., 2001; Kahn & Pike, 2001; Woodside et al. , 2004) , marked fear of growing up (Woodside et al., 2004; Zeeck et al., 2005) , strong worries about weight (Woodside et a l., 2004) as well as a lower desired weight (Huas et al., 2011) , a comorbid personality disorder, having one's own children and a lower educational level (Huas et al., 2011; Pham -Scottez et al., 2012; Roux et al., 2016) . Patients with comorbid depression, by contrast, show a lower risk of treatment dropout (Roux et al., 2016; Zeeck et al., 2005) . Moreover, early treatment dropouts appear to be characterized by a s pecific profile of risk factors: low desired weight, strong mistrust, and impulsive behavior (alcohol consumption, 11 Note: Patients with a chronic course, in whom the objective is placed more on improving quality of life and social integration than on curing anorexia nervosa, also benefit from day -clinic treatment and a lower therapy dose. 131 suicide attempts) (Huas et al., 2011) . In adolescent patients, the following factors are linked to an increased risk of dropout: a one -parent household, a stron g dietary restriction, and a low initial body weight (Hubert et al., 2013; Roux et al., 2016) . Relapses Fichter et al. (Fichter et al., 2006) found a renewed deterioration of general psychopa thology and eating disorder pathology two years after inpatient treatment, but continuous improvements after six and twelve years. At the 12 -year follow -up, the degree of improvement was comparable to that at discharge (28% good outcome, 25% moderate outco me, 40% chronically ill, 7% deceased). This roughly corresponds to the findings of an earlier study (Eckert et al., 1995) . The majority of relapses occur within one year after discharge (Eckert et al., 1995; Isager et al. , 1985; Strober et al. , 1997 b), with the highest r isk between 4 and 9 months post -discharge (Carter et al., 2012) . Patients who were able to maintain their weight in the first year after discharge, by contrast, go on to relapse in only 8% of cases (Eckert et al., 1995) . The following predictors of relapse have been identified: low desired weigh t, long illness duration, bulimic subtype, increased body -related control behavior, reduction in motivation to change during treatment, as well as low motivation to change at discharge (Carter et al., 2012; Richard et al., 2005) . In a 10 -year f ollow -up following inpatient treatment of children and adolescents, 69% showed a good course, 23% a moderate course and 8% a poor outcome (Herpertz -Dahlmann et al., 2001) . A study of 212 adolescent patients (average age 14.9 years) found that 44.8% had to be rehospitalized at least once (Steinhausen et al., 2008) . Due to the risk of relapses, it is necessary to prepare the patient for the subsequent outpatient phase prior to discharge from inpatient treatment - for instance by spending weekends at home, practice discharges or a day -clinic treatment phase. Patients should have maintained the achieved target weight for some time. It is helpful to agree on interventions in the case of relapse (including readmissio n) with all persons involved before such cases occur. Interventions for relapse prevention There are a small number of randomized controlled trials on interventions following inpatient treatment. A one -year cognitive -behavioral psychotherapy was superior to an approach with \"nutritional counseling\" in adult patients with AN. One year after inpatient treatment, 44% of the group which received posthospitalization cognitive behavior al therapy achieved a good outcome, compared to 7% in the case of posthospital ization nutritional counseling (Pike et al., 2003) . An internet -based offer as an adjunct to outpatient psychotherapy also appears to contribute to a more favorable course (Fichter et al., 2012) . Posthospitalization offers, preferably through the clinic, can also be seen as beneficial; in these, the therapeutic relationship which developed during the inpatient stay is not abruptly stopped, but rather ma intained over a transition period (e.g. post -inpatient individual or group sessions). A randomized controlled trial by Russell et al. (Russell et al., 1987) showed that patients with an illness onset before the age of 19 years and a short course of illness benefited more from a 132 family -based therapy following hospitalization - in contrast to older patients, in whom an individual, supportive approach proved to be more favorable. In a randomized controlled trial, adolescents showed a significantly b etter treatment success 12 and 18 months post - hospitalization if they were offered, in addition to a multidimensional program (individual and family sessions), family sessions which did not focus on the eating disorder symptom s but rather explicitly on intra-family dynamics (Godart et al., 2012) . Summary: Evidence on inpatient treatment of AN The available empirical evidence on the efficacy of inpatient treatment compared to outpati ent therapy is very limited (Fairburn, 2005; Madden et al., 2015 a; Meads et al., 2001; Vand ereycken, 2003) . This is primarily due to the fact that a randomization of very underweight patients into an outpatient or untreated control group does not appear to be ethically justifiable. Only two randomized controlled trials have compared inpatient treatment with ou tpatient options (Crisp et al., 1991; Gowers et al., 2007) , but their findings need to be interpreted with great caution. Overall, it is apparen t that studies on inpatient treatments examine patients with a substantially lower BMI than do studies on outpatient interventions (Zeeck et al., 2018) . A further limitation is that the general conditions for inpatient treatments v ary strongly depending on the health system, making it barely possible to compare studies from different countries. So far, there is no sufficient evidence regarding which elements of inpatient treatment are indispensible and which effects they achieve. There is limited evidence that the introduction of clearly structured symptom -oriented treatment components (weight guidelines, target weight) leads to higher success rates (EL 3; (Herzog et al., 1996)). There is limited evidence that a weight stabilization phase prior to discharge is linked to a longer outpatient period before the next rehospitalization (EL 4; (Lay et al., 2002) ). There is limited evidence that discharge below a weight of BMI 18 -20 kg/m\u00b2 is associated with an increased rate of rehospitalizations and a higher risk of osteoporosis in the long term (EL 4; (Baran et al., 1995; Gross et al., 2000) ). There is evidence that a one -year cognitive -behavioral intervention following inpatient treatment is superior to a procedure with \"nutritional couns eling\" (EL 2a; (Pike et al., 2003) ). There is evidence that in children and adolescents with an illness onset < 19 years and an illness duration of < 3 years, family -oriented interventions should be part of treatment following an inpatient episode; the interve ntions should predominantly also address the intra-family dynamics. Older patients with a late illness onset benefit more from individual therapy (EL 3; (Godart et al., 2012; Russell et al., 1987) ). There is evidence that an internet -based relapse prevention in addition to outpatient interventions can contribute to preventing the eating disorder symptoms from increa sing again following discharge (EL 2a; (Fichter et al., 2012) ) 133 Recommendations for the treatment of anorexia nervosa General Patients with AN should be offered treatment as early as possible in order to avoid the disorder becoming chronic (GCP). The treatment of AN should be disorder -oriented and consider the physical aspects of the illness (GCP). Comorbid disorders should be systematically assessed and considered in the treatment (GCP). In the treatment, patients should be informed that the recovery process can encompass a period of many months to several years (GCP). Outpatient, day -hospital and inpatient treatments should t ake place in institutions or with therapists who have expertise in treating eating disorders (GCP). The involved care providers (e.g. registered therapists, advice centers, hospitals, family doctors/GPs, nutritional counselors) should ensure a close consu ltation and communication (GCP). A central therapeutic objective in the treatment of patients with AN is the normaliz ation of body weight. Recommended t arget weights are the 25th BMI percentile for adolescents and a BMI 18.5 kg/m\u00b2 for adults (GCP) . To ev aluate the medical risk or physical complications, in addition to weight development, further assessment parameters such as laboratory values and physical signs must be assessed (see guideline chapter 8 \"Physical sequelae of eating disorders\") (GCP). Depe nding on their physical status, patients with AN should be actively and regularly encouraged to attend progress check -ups (GCP). Patients with AN should receive advice on the appropriate amount and composition of food (GCP). Generally, patients with AN s how strong ambivalence with respect to changing their weight and eating behavior. Therefore, work on motivation and ambivalence is a central task, which should be continued throughout the entire treatment process (EL 1a; A). If there are no explicit reaso ns to suggest otherwise, for children and adolescents with AN, the guardians or close family members/caregivers should receive in -depth information about the illness and treatment options, and should be included in the treatment (EL Ib; A). A compulsory t reatment of patients with AN should only be used in the case of acute self - endanger ment and once all other interventions have been exhausted (GCP). Outpatient treatment The outpatient treatment of first choice in patients with AN should be an evidence -based psychotherapy (for children and adolescents: fa mily-based therapy; for adults: FPT, CBT - E, MANTRA, SSCM)12, led by therapists experienced in the realm of eating disorders (EL Ib; B). 12 FPT = Focal Maudsley Model of Anorexia Nervosa Treatment for Adults; SSCM = Specialist Supportive Clinical Management 134 [Note: In the German directives for psychotherapy, only ps ychodynamic psychotherapy, cognitive -behavior therapy and systemic psychotherapy are approved methods for the indication \"eating disorder\" ] Nutritional counseling should not be provided as a sole treatment; this also applies to interventions employed fo llowing inpatient treatment (EL 2b; B). In the outpatient setting, a weight gain of 200 -500mg/week is highly recommended . Some flexibility in this regard is possible (GCP). Prior to outpatient psychotherapy, the general conditions of the treatment should be discussed with the patient (and where appropriate the guardian): e.g . dealing with weighing, procedure in the case of weight loss, contacts with family doctor/pediatrician /gynecologist, dealing with the family (GCP). A primary objective of outpatient treatment of patients with AN should be the normalization of eating behavior and weight, as well as work on the related psychological and psychosocial problems (GCP). Following outpatient psychotherapy, follow -up appointments should be offered by the psychological or medical psychotherapist, child and adolescent psychiatrist/ psychotherapist or the attending (family/pediatric) physician. These should take place at regul ar intervals over a period of at least one year, and should have the aim of maintaining the treatment outcome as well as relapse prevention (GCP). If development deteriorates or stagnates during outpatient psychotherapy, more intensive treatment options (e .g. inpatient treatment; potentially also day -hospital treatment or a combination of treatment approaches in the outpatient setting) should be offered in a timely manner (GCP). Day-hospital treatment In the following cases , a day -hospital treatment should be consider ed (GCP): - For preparing patients to transition to the outpatient situation following an inpatient treatment (\"transfer\" of the achieved changes to everyday life; \"step -down\"); day-hospital treatment should be deliv ered with disorder -specific expertise and within the same treatment team wherever possible. - For well -motivated patients without comorbidity and only moderate underweight (BMI > 15kg/m\u00b2 or > 3rd BMI age percentile in child ren and adolescents), in whom outpatient treatment does not prove to be sufficient (intensification of outpatient treatment). - For patients with a chronic course and repeated inpatient stays in the past, if the aim is to improve social integration and daily structure. Further treatment in a day -hospital - following inpatient treatment with sufficient stabilization of the physi cal status - should be considered in children and adolescents, if the day-hospital treatment can ensue with disorder -specific expertise within the same treatment team, and if a close integration of family members is guaranteed (EL 1b; A). 135 Inpatient treatme nt Inpat ient treatment has to be offered if one or more of the followi ng criteria are present (GCP): - rapid or sustained weight loss (> 20 % over six months) - severe underweight (BMI < 15 kg/m2, or below the 3rd age percentile in children and adolescents) - sustained weight loss or insufficient weight gain over thr ee months (earlier for children and adolescents) despite outpatient or day -hospital treatment - social or family factors which strongly hamper the healing process (e.g. social isol ation, problematic family situation, insufficient social support) - pronounced mental comorbidity - suicidality - severe bulimic symptoms (e.g. abuse of laxatives/diur etics, severe binge eating with vomiting) and/or excessive urge to exercise, which canno t be mastered in the outpatient setting - physical risk or complications - low insight into the illness - excessive demands in the outpatient setting (too little struct ure in the guidelines regarding mealtime structure, amount of food, feedback on ea ting behavior; for children and adolescents: breakdown of family resources) - necessity for treatment by a multi -professional tea m (multi -modal treatme nt program integrating psychological and medical treatment m ethods as well as social work and creative arts therapies) within a hospital setting (psych osomatic/psychiatric hospital treatment). Inpatient treatment should take place in institutions that are able to offer a specialized, multimodal treatment program (EL 4; A). The following disorder -specific treatment components should be provided within the framework of a specialized day -hospital/inpatient treatment program, beyond the features of a psychosomatic -psychotherapeutic hospital treatment or a psychiatric -psychosomatic hospital treatment in children and adolescents (GCP): - Disorder -oriented psychotherapy (in the individual and group sett ing) - Disorder -oriented nutrition management (cf. Chapter 2.2.16.) - Interventions which target a change in behavior regarding weight, eating and where appropriate exercise (including supervision of eating and clear agreements/\"contracts\" between patient and treatment team regarding a target weight and weekly weight gain) - Medical treatment and regular medical rounds with d iscussion of weight trajectory - Disorder -oriented body therap y and where appropriate sport therapy - Integration of the family, at least for children and adolescents Within the overall treatment plan, in the case of inpatient treatment, a we ight restoration should be striven for (for adults: BMI 18.5 kg/m\u00b2, for children and adolescents: the 25th BMI age percentile, but at least the 10th age percentile). Nevertheless, an individual target 136 weight can also be set under consideration of further factors (e.g. duration of illness, premorbid weight) (GCP). In the case of inpatient treatment, a weight gain of 500 -1000g/week is highly recommended (GCP). Patients should be regularly weighed (generally 1 -3x/week) in the morning on an empty stomach, at around the same time and in light clothing (underwear) (GCP) . To reduce the likeliho od of relapses in the final stage of inpatient therapy, the aim should be for the patient to at least maintain the achieved weight over a certain time. Moreover, the patien t should be prepared for th e transfer to the outpatient setting (EL 4; B). Due to an increased risk of relapse, particular attention should be paid to the transfer between settings (above all into less intensive settings: inpatient outpatient) and that a networking with outpatient further treatment providers is actively sought (CGP). Particularly beneficial are options , which facilitate the transfer to the outpatient setting, such as post -inpatient groups or internet -based therapy (EL 4; B). To prepare for the transfer to the outpatient setting , also a (re-)integration into the school and work environment should be sought (GCP). Inpatient treatment should be followed by outpatient psychotherapy. For children and adolescents, this (if there are no serious reasons to suggest otherwise) should be a family - oriented psychotherapy (EL 2a; A) Pharmacotherapy Neuroleptics and antidepressants should not be used only in order to achieve weight gain in AN (EL 1a; A). If thinking is considerably restricted to weight concerns and eating, and hyperactivity cannot be mastered, an attempt to employ neuroleptics at low doses can be justified in individual cases (mainly olanzapine (EL 2a; O)). In this regard, pharmaceuticals with a low extrapyramidal impairment should be p referred. The treatment indication should be limited to the duration of the aforementioned symptoms (no long -term treatment) and only applies in the framework of the overall treatment plan. In this regard, the patient must be informed about the nature of o ff-label use (GCP). Nutrition management If medical monitoring is guaranteed, f or patients with mild to moderate AN, an initially low calorie consumption with stepwise increases is not n ecessary for safe weight gain (avoidance of refe eding syndrome) (EL 2a; evidence statement). In itial calorie intake should lead to a sufficient weight gain , taking the acceptance of the patient into account (GCP). The energy intake for the weight gain to be expected is highly variable. It should be individually tailored to the patient and the treatment phase, and continuously monitored (GCP). The refeeding of severely malnourished patients with AN must be conducted in the inpatient setting, with close medical monitoring (lab, heart/circulation parameters, fluid balance) (GCP). 137 To ensure a sufficient food intake, especially at the beginning of therapy, liquid food can be used as a supplementation (or if necessary also as a replacement) to a not yet sufficient normal nutrition. (EL 3; O) . Products should be used that are suitable for complete nutrition, i.e. which contain all components of normal nutrition in balanced amounts. If refeeding through a regular food or liquid intake proves to be insufficient, liquid food and gastric tube feeding should also be considered (GCP) . In the case of severe starvation, regular checks of the phosphate serum level must be conducted. There should be either an increased oral supply of phosphate (via food supplements or the oral administration of sodium monohydrogen phosphate) or a substitu tion oriented to the serum level. Kidney function should be noted in this regard (CGP). In the treatment of AN, serum potassium levels should be checked regularly. Furthermore, in the case of decreased values, checking signs of hypokalemia and ruling out cardiac arrhythmia is mandatory. Finally, hypokalemia should be compensated by exogenous, preferably oral administration of potassium chloride (GCP). A hypo - or hypernatremia should first be compensated through the normalization of the fluid balance with n ormal sodium intake through food. Particularly with parenteral sodium administration, a rise in serum sodium must not exceed 6 mmol per day (GCP). In the case of a very low starting weight, an initial substitution of vitamin B1 for preventive purposes shou ld be considered (GCP). Iron substitution should only be considered if iron deficiency anemia has been established (low ferritin) (GCP). In the case of D), a vitamin substitution should take place (GCP). 138 Table 1: Criteria for AN according to IC D-10, ICD -11 (proposal) and DSM 5 ICD-10 (1993) Proposal ICD -11 (2018) DSM 5 (2013) F 50.0 Body weight at least 15% below expected weight or body mass index 17.5 kg/m\u00b2 Weight loss is self -induced through: - avoidance of high -calorie foods and/or - self-induced v omiting - self-induced purging - excessive exercise - use of appetite suppressants, diuretics etc. Body image disturbance; excessive notion of being/becoming too fat; a very low weight threshold is set Endocrine disorder (hypothalamic -pituitary -gonadal axis), manifests, for example, in amenorrhea If onset is prepubertal, the sequence of pubertal development steps is delayed, e.g. growth ceases, primary amenorrhea.

International Journal of Eating Disorders , 44(7), 579 -584. 247 Method report Anorexia nervosa As the concern was with a revision of the guideline from 2010, the aim was to check the currently available evidence, and where applicable to revise the recommendations should they have changed in the interim. The key questions remain unchanged, and were only supplemented by one qu estion: Given the increasing interest in internet - and technology -based interventions, the available studies pertaining to these interventions were viewed and it was checked whether application -based recommendations could be derived. To check the current evidence, the following approach was pursued: Inclusion of current guidelines: current guidelines of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists (ANZJP; Hay et al. 2014), although these are not based on systematic literature reviews. A revision of the English NICE guidelines was underway in parallel, but had not yet been published when the German guidelines were completed. The US -American guidelines (APA, 2006) have also not yet been published in a current, fundamentally revised version. For each question, systematic reviews and meta -analysis were searched for and a systematic literature search for primary literature was conducted. The University Library in Heidelberg was given this task (AN and BN). The search strategy was oriented to the search strategies of the original version of the guidelines, although slight changes were necessary due to the change in the literature databases (see below). The search initially e ncompassed the period from 1.11.2005 - 31.01.2016. Due t o a delay in the work on the gui delines, the search was updated to the end of February 2017. The search was supplemented by a hand search in the reference lists of current reviews. First, the identified studies were viewed and roughly coded according to the following criteria: RCT vs. others; anorexia nervosa vs. others; psychotherapy vs. pharmacotherapy vs. others. All new randomized controlled trials were checked with regard to pre defined inclusion and exclusion criteria (see below) and then rated with respect to their quality by two independent raters according to the rating scheme used in the first version. In the case of discrepancies in rating, consensus was reached following di scussion. The inclusion criteria were as follows (see also Zeeck et al., 2018): 1. At least one arm of the study refers to a psychotherapeutic or pharmacological intervention; 2. Data were reported for at least two measurement time points; 3. Weight da ta (body weight, BMI) were reported for at least two measurement time points; 4. The sample size is greater than or equal to Narms X 10 (e.g. 11+9 = 20; 10 x 2); 5. No mixed samples consisting of patients with anorexia nervosa and other eating disorders (or, in such cases, the data have to be separately reported for the subgroup of patients with AN); 6. The second measurement time point lies in a time window of 3 years after the start of the intervention. 248 After intensive discussion in the expert grou p, one exclusion criterion was changed compared to the first version of the guideline: Studies were also allowed to include patients with a weight between BMI 17.5 and 18. 5 kg/m\u00b2 . The group of patients with a weight between 17.5 and 18.5 kg/m\u00b2 shows simila r characteristics to the group of patients with a BMI < 17.5 kg/m\u00b2 (see e.g. Swayer et al 2016) and is also diagnosed as AN according to the new classification in the DSM - 5. The quality evaluation was oriented to GRADE (see e.g. Guyatt et al. 2008), but re ferred to individual studies. It comprised the following criteria, which were rated as \"yes\", \"no\", or \"unclear\" : (1) Sample size > 30/arm (2) No indication of recruitment bias (3) Dropout rate < 20% (4) ITT analysis (5) Relevant outcomes were reported (BMI, eating disorder pathology, depressiveness, quality of life) (6) Validated outcome measures (7) Allocation concealment (8) Blinding (9) Consort Statement (10) Registered in a register for clinical studies (11) The examined sample corresponds to the population of interest (12) The intervention corresponds to the intervention of interest (13) Endpoints are clinically relevant (14) The intervention can be implemented and used in the German health system (15) Acceptance by patients249 Here too, in the case of discrepancies between raters, consensus was sought, and an overall quality evaluation was undertaken following discussion (high; moderate; low; very low). As several new studies on psychotherapeutic interventions have been published since the first version of the guideline, a network meta -analysis was conducted to present the available evidence, which should answer the following questions: Is one psychotherapeutic approach superior to others? Do psychotherapeutic interventions differ in terms of efficacy between adolescents and adults? Which weight gains can be expected in different settings? For the latter two questions, standardized mean change (SMC) statistics were emplo yed, and non - randomized controlled studies were also included (external validity; see Zeeck et al., 2018). The evidence tables were revised and recommendations were checked regarding whether they can remain or whether they need to be changed regarding the level of recommendation as well as the text. For many clinical questions, literature of a lower evidence level was searched (quasi - experimental studies, observation studies), if no randomized controlled trials were available. For clinical questions on whi ch no empirical evidence could be found, or for which an empirical test is not to be expected or not possible, good clinical practice was developed in the expert group. Some of these ( GCP) recommendations were formula ted upon co nsensus in the expert group as \"we suggest\" or \"we recommend\" recommendations due to the high clinical significance. Each of the individual chapters was revised by 2 -3 members of the work group. All sections were checked by experts from the area of adult treatment as well as experts from the area of child and adolescent treatment. Within multiple meetings and telephone conferences of the work group, the previously sent suggestions for change (text, evidence rating, recommendations) were discussed and a mutually agreed upon formulation was sought. This discussion explicitly included the question of implementability as well as potential side -effects of a recomme nded approach. For the section \" Nutritional managemen t\", a nutritionist was consulted. Systematic literature search for the ch apters Anorexia und Bulimia nervosa Conducted by: Mr Maurizio Grilli M.A.L.I.S.

Binge eating is understood as the consumption of unusually large amounts of food in a discrete time span (e.g. within a period of 2 hours). Frequently, the foods consumed are easily available and high -calorie foods, which are mostly avoided during regular eating (e.g. candies). Moreover, BN sufferers report feeling at the mercy of the binge episodes, or having no control over how much and wha t they eat. Even when they feel very full, they are not able to stop eating. Nevertheless, binge eating episodes can also be actively stopped and later continued (e.g. when friends visit unannounced or flatmates return home unexpectedly). Furthermore, indi viduals with BN may plan binge eating episodes in a calculated manner (e.g. shop in anticipation of having sufficient food for a binge eating episode after returning from work). The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder s (DSM -5) (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013) also does not indicate a total amount of calories for the presence of a binge eating episode. Instead, diagnosticians should orient themselves to an amount of food that is substantially larger in a b inge episode than the amount other people would eat in comparable situations. Accordingly, the context in which the eating takes place is important when interpreting whether or not a binge episode has occurred (e.g. meal to mark a special occasion vs. regu lar evening meal). Triggers of binge eating episodes . Binge eating episodes can be triggered by various factors, e.g. feeling hungry, restrictive eating behavior or negative affect. A meta -analysis of diary studies (ecological momentary assessment) in pati ents with a diagnosis of BN showed that the feeling of hunger directly before a binge episode is significantly greater than the feeling of hunger that sufferers report outside of binge episodes (Haedt -Matt & Keel, 2011a). Accordingly, the perceived hunger (\"ravenous appetite\"), which does not necessarily have to be physically justified, appears to be a trigger for binge episodes. A restrictive style of eating has also been found to be a trigger of binge eating: For instance, patients with BN may try to avoi d high -calorie, carbohydrate -rich or fatty foods during regular meals, for example by following strict diet rules. This can contribute to a strong mental preoccupation with the topics of eating, weight and shape and lead to a considerable burden in coping with everyday life. Often, particular foods are avoided for fear of losing control over one's own eating behavior if these foods are consumed. In individuals with BN, the degree of restrictive eating can predict binge episodes on the following day (Zunker et al., 2011). 13 With the exception of the first and last authors, the co -authors are listed al phabetically 261 The results of another meta -analysis of diary studies (Haedt -Matt & Keel, 2011b) also showed that negative affect was stronger before a binge episode than before regular meals. Moreover, according to the findings, the use of compensatory be haviors leads to a substantial reduction in negative affect (Haedt -Matt & Keel, 2011b). Both binge eating and the employed inappropriate compensatory behaviors are associated with a pronounced feeling of shame, which is why both behaviors mostly take place in secret. For instance, a diary study showed that feelings of shame appear to play a primary role in the maintenance of binge episodes (Berg et al., 2013). An enduring worry about weight gain is closely linked to the described disturbances in eating beha vior. Among other things, this is reflected in the focusing of thoughts on shape and weight, with sufferers' self -worth being unduly influenced by the evaluation of their own appearance (APA, 2013). Through fear of gaining weight due to the binge eating, i ndividuals with BN regularly employ various strategies (e.g. vomiting, excessive exercise) to control their weight, the most frequent of which is (deliberately induced) vomiting. Furthermore, methods of gastric emptying (laxatives, diuretics, enemas), a re strictive eating style, or longer fasting as well as excessive exercise are used as measures for weight control. Less common, and mostly not exclusively implemented, measures for weight control include, for example, misuse of thyroid hormones, chewing and spitting out food, or sauna visits. Additionally, some patients with BN and comorbid diabetes mellitus regulate their weight by reducing the intake of their prescribed insulin amount (so -called insulin purging) or refrain from taking insulin entirely (Pinh as- Hamiel, -Shraga, 2013). 1.2. Diagnostic criteria according to DSM -5TM and ICD -10 For the diagnosis of BN according to the DSM -5TM (307.51), various criteria need to be fulfilled: regular, recurrent episodes of binge eating are an important criterion (criterion A). The consumption of an amount of food that can generally be seen as large within a particular period of time (e.g. two ho urs) is typical for a binge eating episode (criterion A1); a binge eating episode is accompanied by a sense of lack of control (criterion A2). To counteract the threat of weight gain, inappropriate compensatory behaviors are repeatedly employed (criterion 2). Such measures include self -induced vomiting, misuse of laxatives, diuretics or other medications (thyroid preparations, skipping insulin), fasting or excessive exercise. For the diagnosis of BN, the binge eating has to occur, on average, at least once a week over a period of three months (criterion C). Furthermore, shape and weight have to unduly influence the individual's self - evaluation (criterion D). Another criterion is that the disorder does not exclusively occur in the framework of AN (criterion E ). In the DSM -5TM, the severity of BN is classified based on the number of inappropriate compensatory behaviors employed per week. Up to three episodes of inappropriate compensatory behaviors per week are defined as mild BN, four to seven as moderate, eigh t to 13 as severe, and 14 or more as extreme BN. The differentiation of BN into the subtypes purging type and non-purging type was included in the DSM -IV but not in the ICD -10. Due to the controversial clinical significance, this subclassification was drop ped in the currently valid version of the DSM -5. 262 If full criteria for BN were previously met and some but not all criteria of BN have been met for a sustained period of time, the disorder is seen as being in partial remission. If full criteria were previou sly met and none of the criteria have been met for a sustained period of time, the disorder is seen as being in full remission. In order to diagnose BN according to the International Classification of Mental and Behavioral Disorders (ICD -10; Dilling, Mombo ur, & Schmidt, 2013) (F 50.2), episodes of binge eating must occur; similarly to the DSM -5TM, binge eating episodes are defined as the consumption of an amount of food that can be generally seen as large within a short time span (criterion 1). Furthermore, the sufferer attempts to counteract weight gain through one or more compensatory behaviors (criterion 2). BN sufferers perceive themselves as \"too fat\" and have a morbid dread of fatness (criterion 3). Moreover, it is emphasized in criterion 3 that indivi duals set sharply defined weight thresholds for themselves which are well below the premorbid weight that constitutes a healthy weight according to the physician. In contrast to the DSM -5TM, the ICD - 10 does not provide operational criteria regarding the fr equency and duration of binge eating episodes and compensatory behaviors. Moreover, the ICD -10 does not define levels of severity for BN. However, the category of Atypical Bulimia nervosa (ICD -10 F 50.3) is considered, in which one or several criteria of B N are not fulfilled. A subtyping of BN (purging vs. non - purging type) is not implemented in the ICD -10. 1.3. Comorbidity Comorbid mental disorders and personality disorders are very frequent in BN. In a representative face -to-face survey in the USA, 94.5% of individuals with BN fulfilled the criteria for at least one of the DSM -IV core diagnoses (lifetime) (Hudson, Hiripi, Pope, & Kessler, 2007). The greatest proportion of these were anxiety disorders (mainly specific and social phobia), followed by affecti ve disorders (mainly major depression). Currently, the association between attention -deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and BN is being examined. A recent meta -analysis showed that patients with eating disorders had a twofold increased risk of fulfillin g symptoms of ADHD, and patients with ADHD had a three -fold increased risk of suffering from an eating disorder, with a - non-significant - trend for an increased risk of comorbid BN (Nazar et al., 2016). A shared developmental pathway is suspected, for in stance through dysfunctions in the dopaminergic neurotransmitter and reward system. The risk of comorbid Nazar With respect to the comorbidity of BN with personality disorders, a high prevalence is found for emotionally unstable personality disorder, followed by dependent, histrionic and anxious - avoidant personality disorder (Preti et al., 2009). 1.4. Differential diagnosis From a differential diagnostic perspective, BN is delineated in particular from the other eating disorders, depressive disorders, as well as borderline personality disorder (BPD). BN versus AN. Here, weight is a main, important differential diag nostic criterion. If a patient shows binge eating episodes and inappropriate compensatory behaviors and at the same time 263 has a significantly low body weight, then a diagnosis of AN should be made (subtype: binge - eating/purging type [bulimic form of AN]); a n additional diagnosis of BN is not made in this case. BN versus BED. BN is distinguished from BED through the regular use of inappropriate compensatory behaviors, which occur less systematically or not at all in BED. BN patients are generally of normal w eight to slightly overweight, while patients with BED are generally overweight to obese. However, weight status is not a diagnostic criterion of either BN or BED. BN versus Major Depression. Increased appetite (also including binge eating) is both a class ification criterion of a major depressive episode and one of the atypical features of depressive disorders. In contrast to BN, however, individuals with depressive disorder do not employ inappropriate compensatory behaviors. Moreover, the overvaluation of shape and weight with respect to self -esteem, as is typical for BN, is lacking in depressive disorders. If the criteria for both diagnoses are fulfilled, both should be made. BN versus BPD. Binge eating can also occur in the framework of impulsive behavior s in potentially demanding areas in individuals with BPD. However, primarily typical for BPD is a pronounced instability in interpersonal relationships, in self -image and in the area of affect. By contrast, substantial body image problems, which are typica l for BN, do not constitute core symptoms of BPD. BN versus Kleine -Levin syndrome. Binge eating can also occur within Kleine -Levin syndrome, although except the inappropriate compensatory behaviors typical for BN and the overvaluation of shape and weight with respect to self -esteem. Besides the differential diagnostic clarification of BN and the associated general eating -related psychopathology, further comorbid disorders should also be systematically assessed (e.g. using guidelines or structured interview s). If comorbid mental disorders are present, it needs to be clarified whether of the presented disorders takes precedence concerning treatment or whether both have to be treated simultaneously due to of the respective disorders being maintained by the sym ptoms of the other. For instance, current substance abuse within outpatient treatment may first require inpatient detoxification. On the other hand, if, for example, the confrontation with certain situations (or their avoidance) as well as the occurrence o f intrusive thoughts in a patient with BN and comorbid PTSD causes and perpetuates bulimic eating behavior and a negative body image, a simultaneous treatment of both disorders is useful. In this respect, the patient's general stability also needs to be ta ken into account. 1.5. Etiology and maintenance A series of biological, social and psychological factors are involved in the development and maintenance of BN. For instance, family and twin studies point to the influence of genetic factors , although their influence varies between 28 % and 83 % (for an overview see Bulik, Sullivan, Wade, & Kendler, 2000; Bulik & Tozzi, 2004). Retrospective findings suggest that obesity in childhood and family (parental) obesity are relevant predictors for BN (Fairburn, Coo per, Doll, & Welch, 1999; C. G. Fairburn et al., 1998; C. G. Fairburn, Welch, Doll, Davies, & O'Connor, 1997; Hilbert et al., 2014; Sullivan, Bulik, Carter, & Joyce, 1996). 264 Prospective studies show that the internalization of an extreme thinness ideal leads to increased body dissatisfaction, which in turn promotes bulimic eating behavior via restrictive eating and negative affect (Stice, 2001; Stice, Shaw, & Nemeroff, 1998). Several studies have demonstrated that restrictive eating behavior fosters the occ urrence of binge eating (Mauler, Hamm, Weike, & Tuschen -Caffier, 2006), with the likelihood of a binge eating episode rising with the duration of attempted dietary restriction (Holmes, Fuller - Tyszkiewicz, Skouteris, & Broadbent, 2014). Field studies in ind ividuals with a diagnosis of BN have meta -analytically shown that restrictive eating behavior appears to precede binge eating (Haedt -Matt & Keel, 2011a). On the neuronal level, studies have suggested that dietary restriction is accompanied by an increased activation of cortical areas which are related to attention, reward and motivation (Stice, Burger, & Yokum, 2013). In cross -sectional studies, individuals with BN report significantly lower self -esteem (for an overview see Cagar -Nazai et al., 2014). Howeve r, from most of the studies, it remains unclear to what extent the reported self -esteem problems constitute an expression or consequence of comorbid depressive symptoms. Most prospective studies did not find a causal relation between negative self -esteem a nd the development of eating disorder symptoms (for a review see Stice, 2016). The overvaluation of shape and weight with respect to self -esteem is relevant not only for the development of BN (Stice, 2016), but also for the maintenance of the disorder. Fo r instance, a prospective study showed that body dissatisfaction - as an emotional correlate of body image disorder - at the beginning of the study predicted a chronic course of eating disorder symptoms after 5 years in women with BN (Fairburn et al., 2003 ). Furthermore, treatment studies showed an unfavorable therapeutic course in BN patients who reported strongly pronounced body dissatisfaction at the start of therapy (Fichter, Quadflieg, & Hedlund, 2008; Wagner et al., 2015). High body dissatisfaction at the end of therapy was also positively correlated with the relapse rate of BN (Keel, Dorer, Franko, Jackson, & Herzog, 2005). Stressful events (stressors) are linked to bulimic eating behavior. A more recent field study showed that an increase in negative affect mediated the relation of various stressors, and the appraisal thereof, with bulimic eating behavior (Goldschmidt et al., 2014). Interpersonal stressors, daily hassles, and the way of stress appraisal were especially important in this regard. Severa l studies have demonstrated that negative affect triggers and/or maintains bulimic eating behavior. For instance, a meta -analysis of various field studies (Haedt -Matt & Keel, 2011b) showed that individuals with BN are in a more negative mood preceding a bi nge eating episode as compared to their general mood and their mood preceding a regular meal. Furthermore, the maintaining role of negative emotions (e.g. depressive mood) in BN was also apparent in the treatment context: The reduction of depressive sympto ms at treatment start (i.e. within the first four weeks of treatment) was associated with symptom remission of bulimic symptoms (Thompson -Brenner, Shingleton, Sauer -Zavala, Richards, & Prospective data (Nolen -Hoeksema, Stice, Wade, & Bohon, 2007) indicate that dysfunctional emotion regulation increases the risk of bulimic symptoms. Experimental findings have demonstrated a rise in the desire to binge following induction of sadness and encouragement of a ruminative emotion regulation style in patients with BN (Naumann, Tuschen -Caffier, Voderholzer, Caffier, & Svaldi, 2015). These findings support the assumption that the influence 265 of negative affect in individuals with BN is mediated by dysfunctional strategies when dealing with negative feeling s. 1.6. Course Natural course. Results of longitudinal studies show a fluctuating natural course in individuals with BN (Fairburn, Cooper, Doll, Norman, & O'Connor, 2000). In a naturalistic longitudinal study, 72% of women originally diagnosed with BN were completely remitted at the 20 -year follow -up (Keel, Gravener, Joiner, & Haedt, 2010). In terms of mortality risk, patients with BN also show an increased mortality rate and a higher suicide rate compared to the normal population. A meta -analysis of 12 st udies (Arcelus, Mitchell, Wales, & Nielsen, 2011) showed a weighted mortality rate (i.e. deaths per 1000 person -years) of 1.74 in individuals with BN; for exclusively female BN samples, the weighted mortality rate was at 2.22 per 1000 person -years, and was thus substantially lower than the weighted mortality ratio for AN (5.39). The standardized mortality ratio (i.e. the number of observed deaths compared to the number of expected deaths in the normal population) was at 1.93. The risk of suicide is also inc reased in individuals with BN, with a meta studies (Preti, Rocchi, Sisti, Camboni, & Miotto, 2011) reporting a suicide rate of 0.3 per 1000 person -years. Accordingly, around one in five deaths in individuals with BN is a consequence of suici de. Course post therapy. If one considers the complete remission rates (recovery) across various studies, it becomes apparent that the proportion of completely remitted patients after treatment increases with the duration of the follow -up. A recent study s howed rates of complete remission over a 4 -month follow -up between 22.5% (enhanced cognitive -behavioral therapy) and 32.5 % (integrative cognitive -affective therapy; Wonderlich et al., 2014). Studies with a one -year follow -up after completed treatment hav e reported remission rates of 14.6 to 22.5% (depending on the treatment arm; Bailer et al., 2004) or up to 27.8 % (Schmidt et al., 2008). In a study with BN patients who had received treatment, 32.5% of participants who received outpatient treatment were s ymptom -free over a 4 -year period (Bogh, Rokkedal, & Valbak, 2005). Castellini and colleagues (2011) found a complete recovery in 49.6 % in patients treated with cognitive -behavioral therapy at a 6 -year follow -up. In this study, recovery was defined as the absence of an eating disorder according to both the DSM -IV and DSM -5 criteria (not including EDNOS). In the observed time period (i.e. from baseline assessment to 6 -year follow -up) according to the diagnostic criteria of the DSM -5, 9.2% of the BN patients had transitioned to AN and 8.4% had transitioned to BED. The relapse rate in BN patients who were in full remission by the end of treatment was 17.7%. Moreover, 18.1% of the patients who relapsed developed AN or BED. The results of a longitudinal study conducted over 12 years revealed a complete remission rate of 70.1% following inpatient therapy (at the 12 -year follow -up; Fichter & Quadflieg, 2004). Many of the patients who were still symptomatic continued to fulfill the diagnostic criteria (DSM -IV) of BN (17.7%); only a small number fulfilled the criteria for a diagnosis of AN (1.8%) or BED (1.8%), while most fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for EDNOS. Four BN patients had died by the time of the 12 - year follow -up. 266 Predictors of course. With regard to the natural (i.e. untreated) course of BN, a prospective study (Keski -Rahkonen et al., 2013) identified a strong drive for thinness as a negative predictor for the natural course of BN. In another prospective study over a 5 -year period (Fai rburn et al., 2003), duration of pathological eating behavior, stronger level of overvaluation of shape and weight, overweight in childhood, a lower social adaptability as well as enduring inappropriate compensatory behavior were prognostically unfavorable factors with regard to binge eating. By contrast, ongoing binge eating episodes were the only predictor of the continuation of inappropriate compensatory behaviors. Moreover, in contrast to treatment -seeking samples, the frequency of binge eating episodes and compensatory behaviors was not predictive of the course. With regard to treatment -seeking patients with BN, in a study by Bulik and colleagues (1999), a lower frequency of binge eating and a lower frequency of inappropriate compensatory behaviors at b aseline were predictors of a prognostically favorable treatment course. Past history of overweight (Bulik, Sullivan, Joyce, Carter, & McIntosh, 1998; Fichter & Quadflieg, 2004) and alcohol abuse in the family history (Bogh et al., 2005), by contrast, const itute negative predictors of treatment course. Other studies indicate that a rapid reduction in the frequency of inappropriate compensatory behaviors and in restrictive eating behavior in the first four weeks of treatment are prognostically favorable predi ctors of the short - and long -term course (Agras et al., 2000; Fairburn, Agras, Walsh, Jacobsen, 1996; Wilson, Fairburn, Agras, Walsh, & Kraemer, 2002). Furthermore, a recent study showed that a rapid reduc tion (rapid response) in the severity of depression is prognostically favorable for treatment course in BN (Thompson -Brenner et al., 2015). In this study, 70% of the patients who had achieved a 25% reduction in depression severity within the first four ses sions were completely remitted, while 30% of the patients who achieved an at least 25% reduction in depression severitywere still symptomatic at the end of therapy. By contrast, of those patients who did not achieve a 25% reduction in depression severity w ithin the first four sessions, only 15% achieved complete remission, while 85% continued to be symptomatic. Interestingly, in this study, the rapid reduction in terms of depression severity was a better predictor of treatment course than the reduction in t he frequency of compensatory behaviors, although the latter was also a significant predictor of a favorable course. In the longitudinal study by Fichter and Quadflieg (2004), by contrast, comorbidity with other mental disorders was the most stable predicto r of a prognostically unfavorable therapy course. 1.7. Bulimia nervosa in childhood and adolescence Comorbidity. Regarding the comorbidity of adolescent BN with other mental disorders, a representative face -to-face survey of American adolescents (Swanson, Crow, Le Grange, Swendsen, & Merikangas, 2011) showed a lifetime comorbid prevalence that was comparable to an a dult sample: 88.0% of adolescents with BN showed at least one further comorbid mental disorder, and 27% fulfilled the criteria for three or more comorbid disorders. The most frequent comorbid disorders were anxiety disorders (especially specific and social phobia), followed by affective disorders (major depression) and behavioral disorders (especially conduct disorder and oppositional -defiant disorders). High comorbidity rates, above all those of depressive disorders and ADHD, followed by somatoform and anx iety disorders, are also shown in 267 German samples of children and adolescents with BN who are in outpatient treatment (Jaite, Hoffmann, Glaeske, & Bachmann, 2013). A recent meta -analysis (Nazar et al., 2016) showed that in pediatric samples, above all, asso ciations between ADHD and so -called loss of control eating exist, while the risk of full -blown BN was lower than in adult populations. This may possibly be attributed to the later age of onset for BN relative to AN. An increased suicidality among adolescen ts with BN compared to other eating disorder diagnoses is notable: Approximately half of adults with BN appeared to have suicidal thoughts and around a third reported suicide attempts (Swanson et al., 2011). Personality disorders are less common in adolesc ent samples of patients with BN than in adult samples. In a study by Magallon -Neri and colleagues (2014), the prevalence of BPD in adolescent patients with BN was 23.5% (firm diagnosis). In a further 17.6%, the diagnosis of BPD according to the DSM -IV was seen as likely. In a study conducted within the German -speaking area (Bottin et al., 2010), in a sample of 99 consecutively included outpatients or inpatients with an eating disorder, 48% of the patients with BN showed a personality disorder. In terms of t he distribution of diagnoses, the most frequent personality disorder diagnoses were avoidant and depressive personality disorder, and BPD. Course. In terms of the untreated course, population -based prospective studies in adolescent samples show high remiss ion rates of 91% within one year for subclinical forms and full -blown BN (Stice, Marti, Shaw, & Jaconis, 2009). These remission rates are substantially higher than findings on complete recovery in treatment -seeking populations. It can be thus be assumed th at treatment -seeking individuals with BN show substantially more severe eating pathology (Fichter & Quadflieg, 2007; Herzog et al., 1999). However, in the study by Stice and colleagues, the relapse rates were very high in the adolescent sample, with 41% fo r subclinical and f ull BN (Stice et al., 2009). In a more recent prospective population -based study (Allen, Byrne, Oddy, & Crosby, 2013) over a period of six years (age 14 -20), 56.2% of the adolescents with BN were in complete remission by the age of 20, w hile 37.6% continued to fulfill the criteria for a subclinical eating disorder or full -blown BN. Importantly, in this study, 47.1% of the 14 -year- old adolescents with BED fulfilled the criteria for a diagnosis of BN at the age of 17 years; at the age of 20 years, this figure was still at 17.6%. The prospective study by Nagl and colleagues (2016) also provides information about the course of BN, and shows that of the individuals suffering from BN at baseline, 24% still show symptoms of eating disorders almos t 10 years later. Course after therapy. Compared to adult patients with BN, data on the course of BN following therapy in adolescent patients with BN are much less clear. Family therapy -oriented treatments, including programs with a cognitive behavioral ba sis, as well as individual CBT have proven to be effective in randomized controlled trials. In studies with a 6 -month to one -year follow -up after completion of treatment, abstinence rates for bingeing and compensatory behaviors combined range from 29% to 3 9% (family therapy) up to 41% (guided [CBT -oriented] self - management interventions (Le Grange, Crosby, Rathouz, & Leventhal, 2007; Schmidt et al., 2007). A recent study (Le Grange, Lock, Agras, Bryson, & Jo, 2015) reported rates of complete remission from 20% (cognitive -behavioral therapy) to 39% (family -based therapy) at the end of treatment. At the 12 -month follow -up, no significant differences depending on treatment arm were found; 32% (cognitive -behavioral therapy) to 48.5% (family -based therapy) of the patients were in complete remission. A Danish study which examined the therapy course 268 following outpatient treatment in a specialized eating disorder outpatient clinic with an integrative approach (CBT, psychoeducation, nutrition management, interpersonal therapy and additional family therapy) showed an average treatment duration until partial remission (diagnostic criteria are no longer fulfilled) of 16 months (range 12 -22) and an average treatment duration until complete recovery of 26 months for adolesc ent BN patients (Helverskov et al., 2010). Predictors of treatment course . So far, there are few studies examining the predictors of treatment course in adolescent patients with BN. However, there are indications that factors which predict therapy course a re influenced by age: For instance, in the framework of secondary analyses of various therapy studies, Lock and colleagues (2013) showed that in adult patients with BN, especially the frequency of compensatory behaviors at the end of treatment (< 2x per week) positively predicted the further course, while in adolescent patients with BN, the best predictors were (a.) abstinence from compensatory behaviors and (b.) reduction in the extent of restraint eating . Moreover, a further study investigating adolescen t patients with BN showed, that lower engagement in an internet -based vs. cognitive -behavioral treatment (randomized controlled design) was associated with a higher BMI and lower expectation of success. Treatment dropout was especially likely to occur if p atients reported having a low social status, showed higher values in inquisitive behavior, already had experience of CBT, or had been randomized into their non -preferred treatment arm. Another randomized controlled trial compared family -based treatment (FB T) with counseling (supportive therapy, SPT) and showed that older adolescents' self -esteem improved more quickly than that of younger adolescents (p = 0.03) and that adolescents with medication achieved a quicker reduction in eating -related concerns compa red to those without medication (p = 0.02). Furthermore, it was found that age and severity of compensatory behaviors at baseline moderated the relation between intervention and reduction in the area of eating -related concerns: Younger adolescents and indi viduals with greater severity of compensatory behaviors showed a stronger improvement in FBT than in SPT (Ciao, Accurso, Fitzsimmons -Craft, & Le Grange, 2015). A similar study in adolescent patients with BN who took part in FBT as compared to SPT (Le Grang e, Crosby, & Lock, 2008) showed that, in particular, lower levels of eating -related concerns at the beginning of therapy were associated with abstinence from bingeing and purging at the end of therapy (OR = 0.47), independent of the type of treatment, whil e patients with an overall lower eating disorder pathology (Eating Disorder Examination Total score) benefited especially from FBT (OR = 0.44). 2. Therapy 2.1. Treatment aims The treatment of BN is based on the following treatment aims: Reduction in sym ptoms of BN, i.e. reduction of binge eating episodes, of compensatory behaviors (e.g. vomiting, laxative use), and of the importance of weight for self -evaluation (body image problems). 269 Treatment of psychological problems (e.g. self -esteem problems, perfectionism, impulsivity, problems with affect regulation) and background conflicts associated with the BN. Treatment of comorbid mental disorders (e.g. depression, social anxiety). Prevention and/or relapse prevention. 2.2. Treatment approaches The fou ndation of the treatment recommendations of the AWMF -S3-guideline (2010) was a meta -analysis on the efficacy of different treatment forms for BN, described in the guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of eating disorders, with which effect sizes on po st-scores from intervention groups and untreated control groups were calculated and compared (Jacobi et al., 2011) . A prerequisite for the inclusion of a treatment approach in the (old) meta -analysis was the existence of at least one randomized controlled trial (RCT). The prerequisite for evidence level 1a was seen as fulfilled if at least three RCTs could be included in the meta - analysis; otherwise, evidence level 1b was assigned. If, for a form of intervention, no RCTs with untreated control groups were a vailable, but rather only non -controlled studies or RCTs with an exclusively treated control group, the effect sizes of the meta -analysis were based on the comparison of the pre - and post -scores of the respective intervention groups (evidence 2a for at lea st three RCTs with pre -post comparison; evidence level 2b with fewer than three RCTs with pre -post comparison). If the number of primary studies did not allow for either of the two described meta -analytic integration forms, individual studies were used for the recommendations for the respective treatment form (evidence levels 2c to 4). When interpreting the results, it should be noted that effect sizes based on the comparison of post - scores from intervention and control conditions, and those based on a comp arison of pre - and post-scores for one intervention condition, are not directly comparable with one another with regard to their size. In the first version of the treatment recommendations, the procedure for determining levels of evidence was following the guidelines of the Oxford Centre of Evidence Based Medicine (Phillips et al., 1998 -2009). This schema was also the basis for determining the levels of evidence in the revision of the recommendations for the currently conducted meta -analysis (Svaldi et al., 2019). Inclusion criteria for the meta -analysis (Svaldi et al., 2019) are as follows: 1. Included studies had to have considered a follow -up period of at least one week. 2. Only methodologically high -quality studies in the sense of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for adolescent and adult populations were considered. 3. A formal diagnosis of BN (according to ICD or DSM) needed to be present. 4. Sufficient data for calculating e ffect sizes needed to be available. 5. In RCTs which included patients with different eating disorder diagnoses, separate analyses for BN needed to be available. 270 The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) unpublished studies, (2) dual publications of the same RCTs and (3) RCTs with a sample size < 10. Of the 4515 potentially relevant articles identified in the various databases, after exclusion of duplicates (n=2148), 2367 articles were viewed. Of these, 2247 articles were excluded for the following reason s: no RCTs, no BN -relevant outcome variables, no separate analyses for the BN sample, studies that did not refer to the treatment of BN, unpublished articles, as well as studies that were not published in either the German or the English language. In total , the full texts of 120 articles were read, of which a further 36 had to be excluded: 28 of these did not use an interview for diagnosis, and a further 8 only provided information on BN subgroups. Of the remaining 84 studies, effect sizes could not be dete rmined for five studies. Therefore, 79 studies were included in the quantitative meta -analysis (see Table 9) with a total of 143 active treatment arms. As a primary evidence source, randomized control group comparisons (evidence level 1a) were targeted, i n which it was possible to estimate the efficacy of one specific therapy compared to a control group without an effective intervention. However, a large number of studies did not contain any untreated control groups; instead, various potentially effective interventions were compared with one another. In other studies, there was no explicit information about non -active control groups, meaning that it was not possible to conduct group comparisons. Therefore, as a further source of evidence, pre -post compariso ns within the active arms were conducted (evidence level 2b). If the respective information was available, the sustainability of the intervention at a follow -up time point > 1 month after the end of therapy was tested. As central dependent variables, the probabilities (relative frequencies) of the absence of diagnostic criteria for BN or the absence of separate constitutive criteria for binge eating episodes and compensatory behavior (purging behavior) at post -test were evaluated. For content -based reasons , it was not possible to transform the variables into one joint dependent variable, meaning that these three categorical variables had to be separately evaluated. If possible, for the categorical variables (abstinence from binge eating episodes, compensato ry behavior, absence of diagnosis) of the therapy outcome, odds ratios (OR) were calculated into order to detect possible differences between intervention group and control group. While in classical works on meta -analytically determined OR, values over 1.0 were interpreted as small and values over 3.0 as large effects (Haddock, Rindskopf, & Shadish, 1998), in more recent works (e.g. Chen, Cohen, & Chen, 2010) higher thresholds are suggested, namely of 1.6, 3.47 and 6.71 as small, medium, and large effects, analogous to standardized mean differences for continuous variables. If no sufficient data were available for control groups, simple relations to the post -test within the active arm were indicated. Moreover, a series of continuous variables were evaluated, which enabled the examination of the reduction in symptom severity (binges, vomiting, laxative use), as well as in self -reported eating disorder pathology and depressive symptoms. For these continuous variables, standardized mean differences were calculat ed using the effect size measure Hedges' g. A Hedges' g of 0.2, 0.5, 0.8 and 1.2 was evaluated as low, medium, large and very large, respectively (Sawilowsky, 2009). 271 2.2.1. Cognitive -behavioral therapy Post-control group (CG) comparison. For this interven tion, data in an RCT design were available for a total of 10 arms from 8 RCTs with their respective control groups and a total number of N=320 persons. Three RCTs report statistics on the absence of binge eating post - treatment, from which a small improveme nt in the treatment group relative to the control group could be determined (log OR=1.66; CI: 0.47, 2.84). Five RCTs report post -treatment absence of purging, and show a moderate improvement (log OR=1.94; CI: 0.92, 2.96) relative to the control group. Five RCTs report statistics for a reduction of binge eating episodes in the intervention group relative to the control group, corresponding to a large effect (g=0.97; CI: 0.44, 1.50). With regard to a reduction in compensatory behavior, eight RCTs show a stron g improvement (g=0.82; CI: 0.58, 1.05). One study (Griffiths, HadziPavlovic, & ChannonLittle, 1994) reports a very strong reduction in self -reported eating pathology (g = 1.49; CI: 0.94, 2.05). Two studies reveal a very strong reduction of depressive sym ptoms relative to control groups (g = 1.20; CI: 0.60, 1.78). Pre-post. Data from 49 arms of 35 studies with a total number of N=1425 persons at baseline and N=1087 persons at posttest could be considered for pre -post analyses. 22 study arms report an absen ce of binge eating episodes in 51% of cases at post, 22 study arms an absence of purging in 45% of cases and 16 study arms report an improvement in absence of a BN diagnosis in 39% of cases. Overall, 38 study arms report a strong reduction in binge eating (g = 0.89; CI: 0.77, 1.00), 40 study arms a medium reduction in compensatory behavior (g = 0.69; CI: 0.61, 0.77), 18 study arms a very strong reduction in self -reported eating pathology (g = 1.43; CI: 1.24, 1.63) and 24 study arms a strong reduction in dep ressive symptoms (g = 0.90; CI: 0.75, 1.05). Pre-follow -up. Data from follow -up assessments were available from 34 arms of 24 studies with a total of N=646 persons (range: 1 month to 2 years). In four study arms, an absence of binge eating is reported in 6 2% of cases, in four study arms an absence of purging in 54% of cases and in 14 studies the absence of a diagnosis in 38% of cases. In 28 arms, a strong reduction in binge eating episodes is reported (g = 0.86; CI: 0.71, 1.01), in 25 arms a medium to stron g reduction in compensatory behavior (g = 0.69; CI: 0.56, 0.81), in 12 arms a very strong reduction in self -reported eating pathology (g = 1.59; CI: 1.33, 1.80) and in 14 arms a strong reduction in depressive symptoms (g = 0.96; CI: 0.77, 1.16). The effica cy of behavior therapy could be assessed for all central disorder variables in several well-conducted RCTs, meaning that in line with the classification of evidence levels according to the Oxford Centre of Evidence Based Medicine (Phillips et al., 1998 -2009), behavior therapy can be assigned with evidence level 1a. Additionally, the findings from the other analyses confirm the efficacy and sustainability of the intervention. 2.2.1.1. Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) Post-CG comparison. Data from an RCT design are available for 2 arms from 2 RCTs with their respective control groups and a total of N=61 persons. In one study (Safer, Telch, & Agras, 2001) the absence of a diagnosis shows a medium improvement in the treatment group relative to the control gr oup (log OR = 2.73; CI: -0.31; 5.77). Compensatory behavior improved 272 moderately (g = 0.36; CI: -0.36, 1.09). In the other study (Hill, Craighead, & Safer, 2011), after the first half of the treatment, when a control group comparison was still available, th e self - reported eating pathology improved very strongly (g = 1.18; CI: 0.47, 1.88). Both studies attest to an improvement in depressive symptoms, with a medium effect size (g = 0.64; CI: 0.14, 1.13). Pre-post. For pre -post analyses within arms of this cate gory, two study arms from two studies with a total of N=32 persons at pretest and N=28 persons at posttest were available. One study (Safer et al., 2001) reports an absence of diagnosis post -treatment of 29 %. This study also reports a strong reduction in binge eating (g = 0.82; CI: 0.17, 1.47) and a moderate reduction in compensatory behavior (g = 0.29; CI: -0.24, 0.81). The other study (Hill et al., 2011) reports a strong reduction in self -reported eating pathology (g = 0.93; CI: 0,46, 1.40) and both stud ies report a strong reduction of depressive symptoms (g = 0.78; CI: 0.41, 1.14). Pre-follow -up. For one arm from one study (Hill et al., 2011) with N=22 persons at posttest, results for a follow -up measurement time point are reported. However, this follow -up measurement time point is dated at the end of treatment of the DBT arm. The post -score was defined as a 6 -week period after the start of treatment, as at this time point, the control group comparison was ended and the waiting control group also received the treatment (see post -CG comparison). At this follow -up time point, a very strong reduction i n self -reported eating pathology was shown (g = 1.29; CI: 0.82, 1.77). The efficacy of DBT could be assessed for all central disorder variables in several well - conducted RCTs, such that in line with the classification of evidence levels according to the Oxford Centre of Evidence Based Medicine (Phillips et al., 1998 -2009), DBT can be assigned with evidence level 1b. In addition, the findings from the other analyses confirm the efficacy of the intervention. With regard to sustainability, further investigati ons are required. 2.2.2. Psychodynamic psychotherapy From the area of psychodynamic therapies, there are studies on psychoanalytic and psychodynamic psychotherapy. Post-CG comparison. For psychodynamic therapies, there are no available data with passive/placebo -controlled control groups. Pre-post. For pre -post analyses, it was possible to analyze data from two arms of two studies with their respective control groups, with a total of N=76 persons at pretest and N=64 persons at posttest. One study o n psychoanalytic psychotherapy (Poulsen et al., 2014) reports an absence of binge eating at post -treatment in 6% of cases, and the other study (psychodynamic psychotherapy; Stefini et al., 2017) an absence of diagnosis in 31% of cases. Both studies report a weak to medium reduction in binge eating (g = 0.37; CI: 0.12, 0.62), a comparable reduction in compensatory behavior (g = 0.38; CI: 0.16, 0.61) and a medium reduction in self -reported eating pathology (g = 0.59; CI: 0.37, 0.82). The study by Poulsen and colleagues (2014) shows a slight reduction in depressive symptoms (g = 0.12, CI: -0.18, 0.42). Pre-follow -up. Follow -up were available from two arms of two studies (Poulsen et al., 2014; Stefini et al., 2017) (range: 1 to 2 years). At this time point, one study describes the absence of binge eating in 6% of participants (Poulsen et al., 2014). Both studies report a medium to strong 273 reduction in binge eating (g = 0.67; CI: 0.39, 0.94), Stefini and colleagues a medium reduction in compensatory behavior (g = 0 .46; CI: 0.16, 0.76), and Poulsen and colleagues a very strong reduction in self -reported eating pathology (g = 1.66; CI: 1.32, 2.01) as well as a strong reduction in depressive symptoms (g = 0.82, CI: 0.46, 1.17). The efficacy of psychodynamic psychother apy could be confirmed for all central disorder variables in two cohort studies without control groups, meaning that in line with the classification of evidence levels according to the Oxford Centre of Evidence Based Medicine (Phillips et al., 1998 -2009), psychodynamic psychotherapy can be assigned with evidence level 2b. Findings on the sustainability of the intervention are mixed and require further investigation. It should be noted that both of the examined cohort studies were compared with cognitive - behavioral psychotherapy. In the study by Stefini and colleagues (2017; psychodynamic psychotherapy), no differences were found between the approaches at a mean therapy duration of 36 hours. Both were equally efficacious, with large effect sizes ( d = 1.2) and a remission rate of 32% at the end of therapy. In the study by Poulsen and colleagues (2014, psychoanalytic psychotherapy), by contrast, clear differences emerged between the two therapy approaches. After five months (therapy end for CBT), 42% of the patients who were treated with CBT were completely abstinent from binges and from purging behavior, while this was the case in only 6% of patients who had received psychoanalytic treatment. Moreover, two years after the start of treatment (therapy e nd of the psychoanalytic arm and simultaneous follow -up in the CBT arm), 44% of patients in the CBT arm and only 15% in the psychoanalytic arm were completely remitted with regard to binge eating and purging behavior. The results of the study by Poulsen and colleagues (2014) support the superiority of CBT over psychoanalytic psychotherapy, with the former achieving better results after five months than the latter after two years. Furthermore, the results confirm the importance of distinguishing between the efficacy of different psychodynamic approaches. While according to the available study, psychodynamic psychotherapy appears to be comparable to CBT in terms of efficacy, the study on psychoanalytic psychotherapy showed clearly poorer results. 2.2.3. Interp ersonal psychotherapy Post-CG comparison. For interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT), there are no available data with a passive/placebo -controlled control group. Pre-post. Data were available from three arms of three studies with a total number of N=166 perso ns. One study (Fairburn et al., 1991) reports an absence of binge eating post -treatment in 62% of cases, and two studies (Agras, Walsh, Fairburn, Wilson, & Kraemer, 2000; Mitchell et al., 2002) an absence of diagnosis in 8% of cases . The study by Mitchell and colleagues (2002), however, only included patients who had previously had no success with CBT. One study (Fairburn et al., 1991) reports a very strong reduction in binge eating (g = 1.44; CI: 0.86, 2.03) and in compensatory behavior (g = 0.58; CI: 0.1 9, 0.97). Two studies (Agras et al., 2000; Fairburn et al., 1991) report a very strong reduction in self -reported eating pathology (g = 1.38; CI: 1.21, 1.55). Pre-follow -up. Data were available for three arms from three studies with a total of N=166 person s at pretest and N=108 persons at follow -up (range: 4 to 6 months). In one study (Mitchell 274 et al., 2002), an absence of a diagnosis is reported in 16% of cases. In another study (Fairburn et al., 1991), a very strong reduction of binge eating episodes is r eported (g = 1.53; CI: 0.93, 2.14) as well as a strong reduction in compensatory behavior (g = 0.66; CI: 0.27, 1.05). Two studies (Agras et al., 2000; Fairburn et al., 1991) report a very strong reduction in self -reported eating pathology (g = 1.51; CI: 1 .34, 1.68). The efficacy of IPT could be confirmed for all central disorder variables in several cohort studies without control groups, such that in line with the classification of evidence levels according to the Oxford Centre of Evidence Based Medicine ( Phillips et al., 1998 -2009), IPT can be assigned with evidence level 2a. The follow -up findings speak in favor of the sustainability of the intervention. Compared to CBT (Fairburn et al., 1991, Agras et al., 2000), IPT was less effective regarding the redu ction in binge eating episodes, compensatory behavior and eating pathology (pre -post). At the follow -up time points, the results for CBT were somewhat better but did not differ significantly (Agras et al., 2000). 2.2.4. Family -based therapy The terms family therapy or family -based therapy encompass therapeutic programs which activate family resources in order to bring about an improvement in the child's eating behavior. Besides the term family therapy (Dodge, Hodes, Eisler, & Dare, 1995), the term fami ly-based therapy is often synonymously used (Le Grange, Lock, & Dymek, 2003). In addition, cognitive - behavioral approaches which include the family also count as family -based therapy (Lock, 2005). Family -based treatments for BN predominantly target the act ivation of parental support in order to overcome the child's eating disorder. In this respect, in the first phase, the parents are guided to actively support their child in coping with the eating disorder and to proactively deal with the problems in eating behavior (restrictive eating, compensatory behaviors, pathological weight control behavior, etc.). Furthermore, the parents are supported in their actions by learning to externalize the eating disorder and not to equate it with their child's actions. This should foster mutual understanding and reduce the child's resistance. Once abstinence has been achieved, the control over eating is given back to the child in a step -by- step manner, and in the final treatment cycle, the family is supported in coping with the consequences of BN for the child's development (Le Grange et al., 2007) . In the few available randomized controlled trials (RCT) testing the efficacy of family -based therapy, the available manuals for family -based treatment of anorexia nervosa were tra nsferred to the treatment of adolescents with BN, analogously to the above -described procedure (Lock, Le Grange, Agras, & Dare, 2001). Post-CG comparison. For family -based therapies, there are no data with passive/placebo - controlled control groups. Pre-post. Data for pre -post analyses were available for two arms from two studies (Le Grange et al., 2007; 2015) and a total of N=93 persons at pretest and N=79 persons at posttest. One study (Le Grange et al., 2007) reports an absence of binge eating post -treatm ent in 39% of cases. Both studies report a moderate reduction in binge eating (g = 0.39; CI: 0.16, 0.62), one study (Le Grange et al., 2007) reports a strong reduction in compensatory behavior (g = 0.94; 0.63, 1.25), both studies report a very strong reduc tion in self -reported eating pathology (g = 275 1.58; CI: 1.37, 1.78), and one study (Le Grange et al., 2007) reports a strong reduction in depressive symptoms (g = 1.08; CI: 0.72, 1.44). Pre-follow -up. Data were available from two arms from two studies (Le Gr ange et al., 2007; 2015) with a total of N=93 persons at pretest and N=68 persons at follow -up (range: 3 to 6 months). Both report a medium reduction in binge eating (g = 0.43; CI: 0.20, 0.66), one (Le Grange et al., 2007) a strong reduction in compensator y behavior (g = 0.99; CI: 0.68, 1.29), both studies report a very strong reduction in self -reported eating pathology (g = 1.63; CI: 1.43, 1.84) and a strong reduction in depressive symptoms (g = 0.81; CI: 0.59, 1.02). It should be noted that both examined cohort studies were compared with one (2007) or two (2015) active control groups. The first randomized controlled trial (LeGrange et al., 2007) included 80 patients aged from 12 to 19 years (M = 16.1, SD = 1.7 years) and compared six months of supportive t herapy (SPT, 20 sessions) with family -based therapy (20 sessions). The SPT was conceived such that it did not contain any putative active therapeutic elements such a stimulus control, problem -solving techniques (implicit) support for changing eating behavi or or similar, and thus there were no overlaps with cognitive -behavioral therapy, interpersonal therapy or psychodynamic interventions. With regard to categorical variables (symptom remission and partial remission), at treatment end, FBT was found to be su perior to SPT (39% remitted in FBT vs. 18% in SPT; Fisher's Z = 0.049), although this was only the case by trend for partially remitted patients (41% in FBT vs. 21% in SPT; Fisher's Z = 0.06). After 6 months, 29% of the patients in the FBT group were in co mplete remission vs. 10% in the SPT condition; Fisher's Z= 0.05, although FBT was no longer superior regarding the rate of partial remission (49% in FBT vs. 38% in SPT; Fisher's Z=0.38). A similar pattern emerges for the dimensional scales; here, FBT was s uperior at posttreatment, while at follow -up, no significant differences on the scales of the EDE -Q were found. The second study by LeGrange and colleagues was conducted in 2015 and compared FBT -BN with a cognitive -behavioral therapy (CBT) as well as an un specific treatment form (SPT; 18 sessions over 6 months). The SPT was conceived analogously to the study from 2007, CBT was based on CBT for BN in adulthood, with the additional offer of psychoeducation sessions for parents. 130 patients aged between 12 an d 18 years were included and randomized to the treatment arms. Follow -up investigations took place after 6 and 12 months. Similarly to the study from 2007, FBT was found to be superior at the end of treatment (abstinence: 39% in FBT vs. 20% after 6 months (44% vs. 25%; p=0.030), but this effect did not remain at the 12 -month follow -up (49% vs. 32%: P = 0.130). Above all, these results demonstrate the quicker efficacy of FBT compared to unspecific but also speci fic approaches in terms of disorder -relevant problem areas. This may be attributable to the stronger support from the parents in coping with the eating disorder during the first, more intensive treatment phase of FBT. In the further course, the approach ap pears to lose its superiority. Accordingly, based on the classification of evidence levels in line with the Oxford Centre of Evidence Based Medicine (Phillips et al., 1998 -2009), the efficacy of family -based therapy can be confirmed for all central disorde r variables in two cohort studies without control groups, meaning that FBT -BN can be assigned with evidence level 2b. The follow -up findings speak in favor of the sustainability of the intervention. 276 2.2.5. (Therapist -guided) self -management14 In this secti on, the term self -management is used rather than self -help, as the studies included in the analyses concern approaches which are based on a structured evaluated programs and are thus distinguishable from classical self -help groups. Such self -management pro grams for patients with BN are available in online and offline versions and range from pure self -help using a book (bibliotherapy), an app or a computer program, through programs with occasional therapist contact, to guided self -help programs. In addition to personal contact, these therapist contacts can take place within an audio and video chat program, but also in written chat or by email, with the latter enabling asynchronous communication. Fundamentally, these forms of contact take up less time than psy chotherapy sessions and the contents are not psychotherapeutic in the narrower sense (Cuijpers & Schuurmans, 2007). Besides their use for bridging waiting times for therapy or in the transition from inpatient to outpatient treatment, self-management approa ches can also be used in cases when there is a lack of efficacy of or a insufficient access to state -of-the-art therapy (Beintner & Jacobi, 2017). Post-CG comparison. Data are available for three arms from three RCTs (Banasiak, Paxton, & Hay, 2005; Carter et al., 2003; Treasure et al., 1994) with their respective control groups, with a total of N=248 persons. In two studies (Banasiak et al., 2005; Treasure et al., 1994) statistics are reported for the absence of binge eating post -treatment, which correspond s to a moderate improvement in the treatment group compared to controls (log OR = 1.72; CI: 0.86, 2.58). Likewise, both studies provide evidence of a weak improvement regarding the absence of compensatory behavior (log OR = 1.44; CI: 0.53, 2.36) and a weak effect on the absence of diagnostic criteria according to DSM (log OR = 1.22; CI: 0.31, 2.13). Both studies report a medium to strong reduction in binge eating (g = 0.66; CI: 0.28, 1.03) and a medium to strong reduction in compensatory behavior (g = 0.71; CI: 0.42, 1.00). One study (Banasiak et al., 2005) shows a strong reduction in self -reported eating pathology (g = 1.76; CI: 1.38, 2.14). Two studies (Banasiak et al., 2005; Carter et al., 2003) report a slight decline in depressive symptoms (g = 0.14; CI : -0.43, 0.71). Pre-post. For pre -post analyses, data are available from 10 arms from 9 studies with a total of N=451 persons at pretest and N=277 persons at posttest. In four study arms, at post -treatment, an absence of binges is reported in 43% of cases, two studies report an absence of purging in 27% of cases and four studies an absence of diagnosis in 26% of cases. Nine study arms show a moderate reduction in binge eating (g = 0.51; CI: 0.34, 0.67), ten study arms show a moderate in compensato ry behavior (g = 0.41; CI: 0.27, 0.54), five study arms a strong reduction in self -reported eating pathology (g = 0.95; CI: 0.52, 1.38) and five study arms a medium reduction in depressive symptoms (g = 0.45; CI: 0.20, 0.71). Pre-follow -up. Data are availa ble from seven arms from six studies with a total of N=344 persons at pretest and N=194 persons at follow -up (range: 3 to18 months). One study (Banasiak et al., 2005) reports the absence of binge eating in 46% of cases, absence of purging in 26% of cases, and two studies report the absence of a BN diagnosis in 25% of cases. Seven studies report a medium -sized reduction in binge eating (g = 0.63; CI: 0.33, 0.92) as well as a moderate reduction in compensatory behavior (g = 0.56; CI: 0.29, 0.83). In two studi es, a strong reduction 14 Described in chapters IV. (Anorexia nervosa) and VI. (Binge Eating Disorder) as self -help. 277 in self -reported eating pathology is reported (g = 1.11; CI: 0.87, 1.36). Furthermore, three studies show a strong reduction in depressive symptoms (g = 0.79; CI: 0.49, 1.09). The efficacy of self -management could be ensured for all central disorder variables in several well-conducted RCTs. Thus, in line with the classification of evidence levels according to the Oxford Centre of Evidence Based Medicine (Phillips et al., 1998 -2009), self -management can be assigned with evidence level 1a. In addition, the results from the other analyses confirm the efficacy and sustainability of the intervention. Nevertheless, it should be noted that among the self -management programs of the nine studies which are described under post -CG and pre -post co mparisons, six followed a CBT -based concept (this remains unclear for two, one did not follow a CBT concept). With the exception of two of the nine studies, all used a therapist -guided design, i.e. contact to a therapist with a different professional backg round took place at different time periods. Furthermore, it needs to be emphasized that only one arm of one study describes an online -based self -management approach, and this did not differ from traditional guided self -management applied in the same study in terms of the results. Moreover, it is not possible to make any clear recommendations regarding which patients are most likely to benefit from (guided) self -management. For instance, the samples of the studies entered into the analysis vary in terms of s ymptom severity, from mild to severe. In sum, it can be stated that guided self -management can be indicated when there is a lack of efficacy of or lack of access to conventional CBT. Nevertheless, it should be noted that only a small number of validated di sseminated manuals are available for this approach (Fairburn, 2008; Schmidt, Treasure, & Alexander, 2016) and guidance from a therapist is essential. 2.2.6. Other non -pharmacological interventions Interventions with a focus on dietary change Post-CG comparison. One arm of one study (Sundgot -Borgen, Rosenvinge, Bahr, & Schneider, 2002) with its control group with a total of N=17 participants was assigned to this category. However, information in a between -group design was not provided for any o f the examined variables. Pre-post. For pre -post analyses, three arms from three studies with a total of N=67 persons at pretest and N=36 persons at posttest were considered. One study arm (Laessle et al., 1991) reports an absence of binge eating at post -treatment in 41% of cases, as well as an absence of purging in 30% of cases, and one study (Hsu et al., 2001) reports the absence of a diagnosis in 17% of cases. Two study arms (Laessle et al., 1991; Hsu et al., 2001) report a moderate reduction in binge ea ting (g = 0.76; CI: 0.42, 1.09) and a strong reduction in compensatory behavior (g = 0.84; CI: 0.56, 1.12), one study (Laessle et al., 1991) reports a very strong reduction in self -reported eating pathology (g = 1.20; CI: 0.82, 1.59) and one study a modera te reduction in depressive symptoms (g = 0.79; CI: 0.39, 1.18). Pre-follow -up. For follow -up analyses (range 6 to 12 months), data were available from two arms of two studies (Laessle et al., 1991; Sundgot -Borgen et al., 2002) with a total of N = 44 person s at pretest and N = 20 persons at follow -up. In one study (Laessle et al., 1991) a reduction in binge eating of g = 0.93 is reported. Both studies report a medium to strong reduction in 278 compensatory behavior (g = 0.73; CI: 0.43, 1.03). Furthermore, one st udy (Laessle et al., 1991) reports a strong reduction in depressive symptoms (g = 0.86; CI: 0.45, 1.27). The efficacy of interventions that aim to bring about a change in nutritional habits and thus in the associated psychological factors was confirmed for all central disorder variables in several cohort studies without control groups. Similarly to comprehensive cognitive -behavioral approaches, which tackle further areas of psychopathology in addition to the focus on nutrition, it is thus also apparent that interventions that directly target a change in eating pathology are also effective for BN. Thus, in line with the classification of evidence levels according to the Oxford Centre of Evidence Based Medicine (Phillips et al., 1998 -2009), nutrition -based interventions can be assigned with evidence level 2b. The follow -up findings also generally speak in favor of the sustainability of such interventions, although the small sample sizes limit the meaningfulness of the findings. Other interventions The residual category of other non -pharmacological interventions includes those which cannot be clearly or exclusively assigned to a particular therapy orientation or school or those which were not bulimia -specific. These comprised a behavioral therapy -oriented stress -management with a focus on cross -disorder aspects of psychopathology (e.g. communication and problem - solving deficits; Laessle et al., 1991), pyschoeducation (R. Davis & McVey, 1999), exercise - based interventions (Sundgot -Borgen \"Guided Im -Psychological Treatment\" (Bachar et al., 1999). Post-CG comparison. For the aforementioned interventions, there are no available data with a passive/placebo -controlled control group. Pre-post. Overall, data were available from six study arms from five studies with a total of N = 111 persons at pretest and N= 99 persons at posttest. Two studies ( Davis et al., 1999; Laessle et al., 1991) report at post -treatment an absence of binge eating in 36% of cases, an absence of purging in 23% of cases and one study (Esplen et al., 1998) an absence of diagnosis in 21% of cases. Three studies (Davis et al., 1 999; Esplen et al., 1998; Laessle et al., 1991) report a strong reduction in binge eating (g = 0.87; CI: 0.59, 1.16) and a strong reduction in compensatory behavior (g = 0.78; CI: 0.55, 1.01). Four study arms (Bachar et al., 1999 [2 arms]; Davis et al., 1999; Laessle et al., 1991) report a very strong reduction in self -reported eating pathology (g = 1.10; CI: 0.58, 1.62) and one study (Laessle et al., 1991) a very strong reduction in depressive symptoms (g = 1.15; CI: 0.70, 1.59). Pre-follow -up. Data were a vailable from three arms from two studies (Davis et al., 1999; Laessle et al., 1991) with a total of N = 62 persons at pretest and N = 39 persons at follow -up test (range: 4 to 12 months). One study (Davis et al., 1999) reports the absence of binge eating in 26% of cases, the absence of purging in 21% of cases and the absence of a diagnosis in 16% of cases. Two studies (Davis et al., 1999; Laessle et al., 1991) report a strong reduction in binges (g = 0.92; CI: 0.55, 1.28). One study (Laessle et al., 1991) reports a strong reduction in compensatory behavior (g = 0.95; CI: 0.58, 1.32), while the other study (Davis et al., 1999) reports a very strong reduction in self -reported eating pathology (g = 1.24; CI: 0.79, 1.70). 279 Laessle et al. (1991) in turn report a very strong reduction in depressive symptoms (g = 1.56; CI: 1.03, 2.08). The efficacy of the aforementioned interventions was confirmed for all central disorder variables in at least one cohort study without control group per type of intervention. Thus, in line with the classification of evidence levels according to the Oxford Centre of Evidence Based Medicine (Phillips et al, 1998 -2009), the aforementioned interventions can be assigned with evidence level 2b. The follow -up findings for stress management an d psychoeducation, moreover, suggest a certain sustainability of the respective interventions, although the sample sizes are small, thus limiting the meaningfulness of the findings. 2.2.7. Psychotherapeutically oriented combination therapies The residual category of psychotherapeutically oriented combination therapies includes those studies which, in the framework of their RCTs, combined integrative approaches and thus interventions from different therapeutic orientations and schools. These comprised (a) a n integrative inpatient and day -clinic treatment (eclectic treatment with a combination of psychodynamic therapy, systemic and cognitive -behavioral therapy elements; Zeeck et al., 2009 [2 arms]), (b) a hypnobehavioral therapy (combination of behavioral the rapy elements and hypnotherapy; Griffiths et al., 1994), (c) a combination therapy consisting of CBT elements and elements of IPT (Durand & King, 2003), as well as (d) an \"Emotional and Social Mind Training\" (combination of IPT, mindfulness -based therapy a nd CBT; Lavendar et al., 2012). Post-CG comparison. Data are available from one arm from one RCT study (Griffiths et al., 1994) with its control group with a sample of N=55 persons. This reports a medium effect for the post -treatment absence of binge eatin g (log OR = 2.95; CI: 0.77, 5.13) and a small to medium effect for the absence of purging (log OR = 2.56; CI: 0.37, 4.75). Moreover, in a between -group comparison, the study reveals a medium reduction in binge eating (g = 0.59; CI: -0.02, 1.20), a medium t o strong reduction in compensatory behavior (g = 0.67; CI: 0.14, 1.20) and a very strong reduction in self -reported eating pathology (g = 2.12; CI: 1.59, 2.66). Pre-post. For pre -post analyses, data were available from five arms from all four studies with a total of N=153 persons at pretest and N=122 persons at posttest. In one study (Griffiths et al., 1994), a post -treatment absence of binges is reported in 48% of cases and an absence of purging in 38% of cases, while two study arms (Zeeck et al., 2009 [2 arms]) indicate the absence of a diagnosis in 85% of cases. Four study arms (Durand & King, 2003; Griffiths et al., 1994; Zeeck et al., 2009 [2 arms]) report a reduction in binge eating with a medium to strong effect (g = 0.68; CI: 043, 094) and two studie s (Durand et al., 2003; Griffiths et al., 1994) a medium reduction in compensatory behavior (g = 0.62; CI: 0.37, 0.87) and a strong reduction in self - reported eating pathology (g = 1.07; CI: 0.82, 1.33) and one study (Durand & King, 2003) reports a small t o medium effect in the reduction of depressive symptoms (g = 0.30; CI: -0.01, 0.61). Pre-follow -up. Data on a follow -up measurement time point (range 3 to 6 months) were found in four arms of three studies (Durand & King, 2003; Griffiths et al., 1994; Zeec k et al., 2009 [2 arms]) with a total of N=116 persons at pretest and N=90 persons at follow -up test. In one study (Griffiths et al., 1994) an absence of a diagnosis was reported in 41% of cases. Four study arms 280 (Durand & King, 2003; Griffiths et al., 1994 ; Zeeck et al., 2009 [2 arms]) report a medium to strong reduction in binge eating (g = 0.70; CI: 0.36, 1.03), one study (Durand & King, 2003) reports a moderate medium reduction in compensatory behavior (g = 0.50; CI: 0.16, 0.84), a strong reduction in s elf-reported eating pathology (g = 0.85; CI: 0.52, 1.19) and a moderate reduction in depressive symptoms (g = 0.54; CI: 0.21, 0.87). The efficacy of psychotherapeutically oriented combination therapies could only be confirmed for hypnobehavioral therapy in one well conducted RCT study. Thus, in line with the classification of evidence levels according to the Oxford Centre of Evidence Based Medicine (Phillips et al., 1998 -2009), hypnobehavioral therapy can be assigned with evidence level 1b. Nevertheless, it should be noted that it is difficult to clearly delineate the hypnobehavioral therapy conducted in this study from CBT: The first half of the 8 -week treatment in the hypnobehavioral arm contained all essential components of CBT according to Fairburn (1991 ). Only in the second half of treatment were the cognitive treatment elements of CBT replaced by hypnotherapeutic suggestions in terms of retaining the normalized food intake, increasing self - control and on relapse prevention, while the behavioral therapeu tic elements were retained. Accordingly, there were also no differences in central BN outcome measures between the CBT arm and the hypnobehavioral therapy. For all other intervention studies with an eclectic treatment approach ([a] Zeeck et al., 2009: eclectic treatment with a combination of psychodynamic therapy, systemic and cognitive - behavioral therapy elements; [b] Durand et al., 2003: eclectic treatment with a combination of CBT elements and elements of IPT; [c] Lavender et al., 2012: \"emotional and s ocial mind training\" [eclectic treatment with a combination of IPT, mindfulness -based therapy and CBT]), there is at least one cohort study without control group, resulting in evidence level 2b. With one follow -up for each respective intervention, the sust ainability is also shown for the eclectic treatment approach according to Zeeck and colleagues (2009), Durand and King (2003) and for hypnobehavioral therapy. 2.2.8. Pharmacotherapy Regarding the medical treatment of BN, a multitude of different medicati ons have been tested in controlled studies (Aigner, Treasure, Kaye, Kasper, & Disorders, naltrexone). It should be noted that fluoxetine is the only SSRI which is approved for the treatment of BN in Germany (and in many other countries), albeit only in conjunction with psy chotherapeutic measures. If other medications are used for the treatment of BN, the concern is with off -label use and the patient needs to be informed of such. To date, meaningful data are primarily available for substances from the group of antidepressant s, with the greatest evidence of low side effect rates being found for SSRIs (H. 281 Davis & Attia, 2017). Antidepressants not only have a positive effect on binge eating and compensatory behavior, but also reduce eating disorder -specific psychopathological fe atures such as dysfunctional attitudes to body and weight. Many studies have also observed a reduction in depressive and anxiety symptoms (Fluoxetine Bulimia Nervosa Collaborative Study Sarna, 1995). Several studi es explicitly excluded patients with depressive symptoms and found that the response to antidepressants appears to be independent of mood (H. Davis & Attia, 2017). Therefore, a direct anti -bulimic effect of antidepressant substances in assumed. An onset of effect is frequently already observed after the first week. A treatment attempt should be undertaken for a minimum of 4 weeks. However, an increase in restrictive eating behavior has also been observed in patients taking fluoxetine. This might appear to b e counter -therapeutic but an essential first step in the treatment of BN is to build up regulated eating behavior and reduce the fear of weight gain. Restrictive eating behavior, by contrast, can increase the risk of renewed binge eating in the sense of a vicious cycle. In the case of treatment with medications, dropout rates can be considerable (Mitchell et al., 2013). Moreover, even if medication proves to significantly superior in statistical terms, the clinical effect is not substantial in many patients . For instance, remission rates after short -term treatment lie between 0 and 63%, and around 24% on average, (Bacaltchuk & Hay, 2003). If qualified psychotherapy is not available, fluoxetine can be recommended as an initial treatment. Antidepressants can p rove to be helpful in patients with significant comorbid symptoms such as depression, anxiety, obsessiveness and impulse control disorders, or for patients who have responded suboptimally to an appropriate psychotherapy. To achieve an optimal effect, it ma y be necessary to employ different antidepressants sequentially (Mitchell et al., 2013). In the case of insufficient response to medication, it should be checked whether the medication is being taken close in time to self -induced vomiting. If serum levels for a medication are available, it can be checked whether an effective level has been reached. Bupropion should be specifically mentioned here: Although it has shown significantly better results than placebo, it is contraindicated for BN because it was found to lead to generalized seizures more frequently than would be expected by chance (Horne et al., 1988). Recently, an association between BN and ADHD in childhood and adolescence has been reported. Therefore, in the case of this comorbidity, treatment with stimulants should be considered with caution. In the case of a firm diagnosis of ADHD, a treatment with stimulants (methylphenidate) or atomoxetine can, of course, be considered. As an appetite reduction occurs especially with methylphenidate, the ri sk of a potential misuse needs to be monitored (Nazar et al., 2016; Svedlund, Norring, Ginsberg, & von Hausswolff -Juhlin, 2017); moreover, can be contraindicated in patients with BN. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) Post-CG comparison. For this intervention, data are available from 10 arms from 9 RCTS with their respective control groups, comprising a total of N=438 persons. For the absence of binge eating episodes post -treatment, four studies report a weak effect (log OR = 1,10; CI: 0.0 1, 2.18). One study reports a small improvement regarding the absence of purging (log OR = 1.35; CI: - 0.12, 3.82). Five studies provide information on binge eating episodes, yielding a strong 282 reduction (g = 0.95; CI: 0.58, 131). Three studies (Agras et al. , 1987; Strasser et al., 1992; Walsh et al., 1991) report a medium -sized reduction in compensatory behavior (g = 0.66; CI: - 0.33, 1.65), a very strong reduction in self -reported eating pathology (g = 1.31; CI: 0.50, 2.12), and two studies report a small to moderate reduction in depressive symptoms (g = 0.35; CI: - 0.21, 0.90). Pre-post. For pre -post analyses, data were available from 15 study arms from 13 studies with a total of N=305 persons at pretest and N=200 persons at posttest. In four study arms, info rmation was provided on the absence of binge eating episodes post -treatment, in 13% of cases, while two studies report an absence of purging in 47 % of cases. Five study arms report a strong reduction regarding binge eating (g = 0.95; CI: 0.68, 1.22), four study arms report a medium - sized to strong reduction in compensatory behavior (g = 0.45; CI: 0.00, 0.90), three study arms report a medium -sized to strong reduction in self -reported eating pathology (g = 0.77; CI: 0.30, 1.25] and three study arms report a medium -sized reduction in depressive symptoms (g = 0.50; CI: 0.06, 0.95). Pre-follow -up. Data are available for one arm from one study with a total of N=62 persons at pretest and N=18 persons at a follow -up time point (range: 1 to 6 months). One study ar m (Leitenberg, et al., 1994) shows a medium -sized reduction in compensatory behavior (g = 0.50; CI: -0.25, 1.25). The short -term efficacy of tricyclic antidepressants could be confirmed for all central disorder variables in several well -conducted RCT studi es. Thus, in accordance with the classification of evidence levels of the Oxford Centre of Evidence Based Medicine (Phillips et al., 1998 -2009), tricyclic antidepressants can be assigned with evidence level 1a. In addition, the findings from the other anal yses confirm the efficacy of the intervention. Based on the available study findings, it is not possible to make any definitive statements regarding maintenance treatment and the progression following discontinuation of treatment. Monoamine oxidase inhibi tors (MAOI) Post-CG comparison. Data are available from four arms from four RCTs with their respective control groups and a total of N=175 persons. With regard to the absence of binge eating posttreatment, one study reports an improvement in the interventi on group of log OR=2.63 (CI: 0.46, 4.80). Three studies report a weak reduction in binge eating (g = 0,11; CI: -0,65, 0.87). Two studies (Carruba et al., 2000; Kennedy et al., 1993) report a medium -sized reduction in compensatory behavior (g = 0.51; CI: 0. 01, 1.01) and a very strong reduction in self -reported eating pathology (g = 1.20; CI: 0.47, 1.93). Moreover, one study (Walsh et al., 1988) reports a medium -sized reduction in depressive symptoms (g = 0.61; CI: 0.15, 1.08) Pre-post. Data are available fro m t study arms from three studies with a total of N=88 persons at pretest and N=66 persons at posttest. In one study, an absence of binge eating at posttreatment is reported in 35% of cases. Three studies report a medium -sized to strong reduction in binge eating episodes (g = 0.70; CI: 0.20, 1.19), two studies a weak reduction in compensatory behavior (g = 0.23; CI: -0.03, 0.49) and a medium -sized reduction in -reported eating pathology (g = 0.52; CI: 0.26, 0.78) and one study a medium -sized reduction i n depressive symptoms (g = 0.58; CI: 0.23, 0.92). Pre-follow -up. No follow -up data are available for this intervention. The short -term efficacy of monoamine oxidase inhibitors was confirmed for all central disorder variables in several well -283 conducted RCT s tudies. Therefore, in line with the classification of evidence levels according to the Oxford Centre of Evidence Based Medicine (Phillips et al., 1998 -2009), monoamine oxidase inhibitors can be assigned with evidence level 1a. In addition, the findings fro m the other analyses confirm the efficacy of the intervention. There are no available data on the sustainability of the intervention. Summary on TCA and MAOI TCAs and MAOIs have rarely been used in patients with BN, and despite partial proof of efficacy, cannot be recommended, and particularly not as the sole form of treatment in patients with BN. Most of the studies were conducted in the 1980s and 1990s. Clinical trials for TCAs and MAOIs are not available, and a treatment of patients with BN with TCAs or MAOIs is always off label. Only one study has examined the efficacy of maintenance treatment over four months in patients who achieved a 50% reduction in frequency of binge eating after eight weeks of desipramine. The dropout rate during this maintenance phase lay at 29% and desipramine was not found to be superior to placebo as a maintenance treatment. There are no longer follow - up investigations after discontinuation of the medication. The high dropout rates are partially attributable to the side effects of these substance classes. Tiredness, dizziness, mouth dryness, constipation, increased heart rate, low blood pressure and above all weight gain are especially difficult to tolerate for patients with BN. The toxicity and potential lethality in the case o f overdose warrant extreme caution in suicidal patients. When taking MAOIs, in the case of very chaotic eating behavior (CAVE tyramine -containing foods), the danger of hypertonic crises is not inconsiderable. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) Post-CG comparison. Overall, data are available from 10 arms from seven RCTs and their respective control groups with a total of N=955 persons. For the absence of binge eating, two studies report a weak effect (log OR = 0.39; CI: -0.13, 0.91). Two studies report a small effect for the absence of purging (log OR 0.67; CI: 0.11, 1.24). One study (Schmidt et al., 2004) reports a weak to medium -sized effect for the absence of diagnosis (log OR = 0.06; CI: -1.20, 1.33). Five study arms report data for the frequ ency of binge eating episodes and point to a weak effect (g =0.10; CI: -0.08, 0.29). Four studs arms demonstrate a medium -sized to strong reduction in compensatory behavior (g = 0.56; CI: 0.40, 0.73). Three studies report a strong reduction in self -reporte d eating pathology (g = 1.00; CI: 0.84, 1.17). One study reports a medium -sized reduction in depressive symptoms (g = 0.58; CI: -0.24, 1.39). Pre-post. For pre -post analyses, data are available from 18 arms from 13 studies with a total of N=788 persons at pretest and N=424 persons at posttest. Six study arms report a mean absence of binge eating episodes posttreatment in 20% of cases and an absence of purging in 17% of cases and five study arms an absence of diagnosis in 16 % of cases. Eleven study arms sho w a strong reduction in binge eating episodes (g = 0.81; CI: 0.70, 0.92), 12 study arms show a medium -sized reduction in compensatory behavior (g = 0.47; CI: 0.31, 0.64), six study arms show a strong reduction in self -reported eating pathology (g = 1.00; C I: 0.32, 1.67) and six study arms a medium -sized reduction in depressive symptoms (g = 0.48; CI: 0.24, 0.71). Pre-follow -up. For three arms from three studies with a sample size of N = 36 persons, data are reported for one follow -up measurement (range: 1 to 6 months). The studies showed a medium -284 sized reduction in binge eating episodes (g = 0.53; CI: 0.17, 0.89), while compensatory behavior slightly improved (g = 0.28; CI: -0.26, 0.81). The efficacy of SSRIs was confirmed for all central disorder variables in several well -conducted RCT studies. Therefore, in line with the classification of levels of evidence according to the Oxford Centre of Evidence Based Medicine (Phillips et al., 1998 -2009), SSRIs can be assigned level of evidence 1a. Additionally, the f indings from other analyses confirm the efficacy of the intervention. However, the findings on the sustainability of the intervention are still sparse and differ depending on outcome measure, and thus require further investigation. Summary SSRIs Following two multicenter outpatient studies with large numbers of participants, fluoxetine is the only SSRI which is approved for the treatment of BN in Germany and in many other countries, albeit only in conjunction with psychotherapeutic measures. In the interim , several controlled studies are available (Beumont et al., 1997; Fichter et al., Koke, & Lee, 2002). In the treatment of B N, a higher fluoxetine dosage of 60mg/day appears to be more effective than the dosage of 20mg/day which is recommended for the treatment of depression. Generally, it is advised to increase the dosage in a step -by-step manner, although there have also been some good experiences with the immediate administration of the full dosage of 60mg/day, once, in the morning. Fluoxetine has also proven to be beneficial for patients who achieved low to no improvement in bulimic symptoms through psychotherapy (Walsh et a l., 2000). For the treatment with SSRIs, the available meta -analysis (Svaldi et al 2019) yielded only weak effects regarding the reduction in frequency of binge eating episodes (level of evidence 1a). In the large multicenter studies with fluoxetine, sexua l side effects were frequent, and with a dosage of 60mg/day, sleep disturbances, nausea and asthenia occurred in 25 -33% of patients (Levine, 1992). The results of an open study suggest that fluoxetine at 60mg/day is also effective in adolescents with BN. H owever, with this indication, no medication is approved for children and adolescents and the use is only possible in the framework of an \"individual curative attempt\" according to \u00a7 41 of the German Medicinal Products Act (Couturier & Lock, 2007; Kotler, D evlin, Davies, & Walsh, 2003). Smaller controlled studies are available for sertraline (Leombruni et al., 2006), citalopram (Leombruni et & Capasso, 2005), although it should be critically mentioned that there could also be a publication bias in medication studies in the case of BN. There are at list two unpublished studies of negative, multicenter and multinational placebo -controlled studies with fluvoxamine , which were unable to demonstrate a superiority of the medication (Flament, Bissada, & Spettigue, 2012). However, findings on the sustainability of the intervention are still sparse and differ depending on the outcome measure, and thus require further investigation. Only two studies have tested the efficacy of SSRIs as a maintenance treatment. Fichter et al. (1996) employed fluvoxamine as relapse prevention following inpatient treatment compared to placebo. Fluvoxamine was better able to prevent relapses in the treatment period of three months after discharge compared to placebo. However, the dropout rate in t he fluvoxamine arm lay at 51%. Romano and 285 colleagues (2002) conducted the largest study on maintenance therapy to date, in this case with fluoxetine. Patients with BN, who had achieved a 50% reduction in frequency of vomiting with 60mg fluoxetine, were tre ated further with fluoxetine as maintenance treatment or placebo over a period of one year. The results are difficult to interpret, as the dropout rate lay at 83% in the fluoxetine group and 92% in the placebo group. Although respective data are lacking, i n the case of a good response, a treatment duration of 9 - 12 months is generally recommended. An increase in dosage or the administration of a second medication might be useful in the case of relapses under maintenance treatment. However, so far, there are only open investigations which support this. Other antidepressants and other medications Post-CG comparison. Data are available from 13 arms from 11 studies with their respective control groups with a total of N=378 persons. Two studies (Horne et al. 1988; Pope et al., 1989) report a strong reduction in binges (log OR = 2.11; CI: -0.01, 4.23), one study (Horne et al. 1988) a strong reduction in compensatory behavior (log OR = 2.38; CI: -0.53, 5.29), and one study (Hedges/Hoopes et al., 2003) reports a moderate improvement in the intervention group regarding the absence of a diagnosis posttreatment (OR = 1.51; CI: naltrexone) report a medium -sized to strong reduction in binge ea ting (g = 1.00; CI: 0.43, 1.58) and seven study arms a strong reduction in compensatory behavior (g = 0.89; CI: 0.48, 1.30). One study (Hedges/Hoopes et al., 2003) reveals a strong reduction in self -reported eating pathology (g = 0.85; CI: 0.38, 1.33). Pre-post. For pre -post analyses, data are available from 13 arms from 11 studies with a total of N=199 persons at pretest and N=159 persons at posttest. Two studies (Horne et al. 1988; Pope et al., 1989) report the absence of binges in 22% of cases, one study (Horne et al. 1988) the absence of compensatory behavior in 30% of cases, and two studies (Hedges/ Hoopes et al., 2003; Mitchell et al., 2002) report an absence of diagnosis in 15% of cases at posttreatment. In total, eight study arms report a strong redu ction in binge eating episodes (g = 1.04; CI: 1.36), eight study arms (flutamide, lithium, topiramate, ondansetron, naltrexone) a medium - sized reduction in compensatory behavior (g = 0.57; CI: 0.25, 0.90), one study on topiramate (Hedges / Hoopes et al., 2003) a medium -sized reduction in self -reported eating pathology (g = 0.53; CI: 0.20, 1.08) and one study (naltrexone) a medium -sized reduction in depressive symptoms (g = 0.46; CI: -0.16, 1.08). Pre-follow -up. No follow -up data are available for this intervention. The efficacy of topiramate was confirmed for all central disorder variables in one conducted RCT study (Nickel et al., 2005). Therefore, in line with the classification of evidence levels according to the Oxford Centre of Evidence Based Medi cine (Phillips et al., 1998 -2009), topiramate can be assigned with evidence level 1b. In addition, the findings from the other analyses confirm the efficacy of topiramate. Due to the numerous side effects (cognitive disturbances, difficulty findings words, paresthesias), however, the medication should only be used if other medicinal treatment attempts have proven to ineffective. Accordingly, the dosage should be increased slowly. Moreover, the weight -reducing effect of topiramate further restricts its use i n normal -weight and underweight patients (Hoopes et al., 2003). No data are available on the sustainability of topiramate (maintenance treatment, progression following discontinuation). 286 The efficacy of flutamide, lithium, naltrexone and ondansetron can be assigned with evidence level 1b. Additionally, the findings from other the analyses confirm the efficacy of these substances. However, there are no findings on sustainability. In the treatment of BN, lithium harbors the danger of overdosing due to fluid sh ifts, particularly in the case of frequent vomiting (L. K. Hsu, Clement, Santhouse, & Ju, 1991). For patients with BN and a bipolar disorder, therefore, the toxicity risk is increased under lithium treatment. Both lithium and valproic acids can lead to con siderable weight gain, which reduces the acceptance of these medications. In the case of comorbid bipolar disorder, an alternative mood stabilizer should thus be considered. Flutamide (an anti -androgen used for example in the treatment of prostate cancer), ondansetron (a 5-HT 3 antagonist used in the treatment of nausea and vomiting, e.g. with chemotherapy) and naltrexone (an opioid antagonist, which is approved, for example, for relapse prevention in alcohol dependence), are not recommended for the routine treatment of patients with BN. Furthermore, naltrexone was used in high doses (200 to 300 mg) and at these doses led to a significant increase in liver transaminases. 2.2.9. Combination treatment with pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy Pharmacotherapy does not necessarily have an additive effect to a psychotherapeutic approach in BN (ceiling effect). In several studies, the combination of CBT and an antidepressant showed the highest remission rates. In other investigations, the administration of antidepress ant medication in addition to CBT only showed moderate to no additional effects in terms of bulimic symptoms. However, a superiority of the combination treatment was reported for the reduction of depression and anxiety. Therefore, combination therapy can i nitially be recommended, especially if a qualified CBT is simultaneously offered (Bacaltchuk et al., 2000). Sequential treatment studies examine the efficacy of a second -line treatment when the patient has not responded to first -line treatment (Mitchell et al., 2013). If CBT alone has not led to a clear symptom reduction after 10 sessions, the additional administration of fluoxetine is recommended. Relapse prevention after the end of psychotherapy can be discussed as a further possible indication. Post-CG c omparison. For this intervention, no data with passive/placebo -controlled control group are available. Post-CG comparison psychotherapy and placebo vs. psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy. For these analyses, data were available from six studies, each with o ne arm of combination therapy (SSRI and CBT) with a corresponding comparison arm (CBT only). In total, N=239 persons took part at pretest and N=163 at posttest al., 200 2; Leitenberg et al., 1994; Walsh et al., 1997). In four study arms, the combination therapy slightly outperformes the simple therapies in terms of absence of binges (log OR = 0.58; CI: -0.13, 1.30). Five study arms show a slight superiority regarding the absence of compensatory behavior (log OR = 0.59; CI: -0.73, 1.91), and two study arms regarding the absence of a diagnosis (log OR = 0.11; CI; -0.80, 1.03). Six study arms show moderately higher reductions in the frequency of binge eating episodes (g = 0.3 0; CI: -0.03, 0.63), six studies showed slightly stronger reductions in compensatory behavior (g = 0.19; CI: -0.09, 0.46), one study showed a stronger reduction in self -reported eating pathology with a 287 medium effect size (g = 0.56; CI: -0.02, 1.15) and thr ee study arms showed a slightly stronger reduction in depressive symptoms (g = 0.15; CI: -0.32, 0.62). Pre-post. For pre -post analyses on the individual combination studies (CBT or BT combined with SSRIs or D -fenfluramine [one study arm]; self -management in the sense of a stepped -care approach followed by SSRI and possibly CBT), 14 arms from 9 studies with a total of N=499 persons at pretest and N=387 persons at posttest were available. In four study arms (CBT/BT plus SSRIs), an absence of binge eating epi sodes posttreatment was reported in 48% of cases, in five study arms the absence of purging in 43% of cases and in two studies (Goldbloom et al., 1997; Walsh et al., 1997) the absence of a diagnosis in 31% of cases. In seven study arms, a very strong reduc tion in binge eating episodes for BT/CBT in combination with SSRI or D - fenfluramine (g = 1.25; CI: 0.73, 1.76) was reported, in seven study arms a strong reduction in compensatory behavior for BT/CBT in combination with SSRI or D -fenfluramine (g = 1.15; CI: 0.75, 1.55). Five study arms report a very strong reduction in self -reported eating pathology for BT/CBT in combination with SSRI or D -fenfluramine as well as stepped care (g = 2.49; CI: 0.64, 4.34) and five studies report a medium -sized reduction in dep ressive symptoms for BT/CBT in combination with SSRI or D -fenfluramine as well as stepped care (g = 0.54; CI: 0.43, 0.65). Pre-follow -up. Data are available for seven arms from five studies (CBT plus SSRI or D - fenfluramine) with a total of N=362 persons at pretest and N= 37 individuals at follow -up (range: 1 to 12 months). In four study arms, a very strong reduction in binge eating (g = 1.37; CI: 0.68, 2.06) is reported. Five study arms report a very strong reduction in compensatory behavior (g = 1.28; CI: 0.82, 1.74), two study arms a very strong reduction in self -reported eating pathology (g = 1.04; CI: 0.92, 1.15) and a medium -sized reduction in depressive symptoms (g = 0.50; CI: 0.39, 0.61). The efficacy of combination therapies consisting of BT or CBT c ombined with SSRIs or D - fenfluramine was confirmed for all central disorder variables in several cohort studies without control groups. In line with the classification of evidence levels according to the Oxford Centre of Evidence Based Medicine (Phillips e t al., 1998 -2009), the combination of CBT or BT with SSRIs can be assigned with evidence level 2a; the combination of CBT or BT with D - fenfluramine as well as the stepped -care approach can be assigned with evidence level 2b. Additionally, the findings from the other analyses confirm the efficacy of these substances. The follow -up findings speak in favor of the sustainability of the mentioned combination therapies. In the comparison of combination therapies (SSRI and CBT) with simple psychotherapy (CBT), the combination therapies only performed slightly better. As the confidence intervals for the group comparison included zero in each case, it was not possible to confirm a significant superiority of the combination therapies. 2.2.10. Other combination therapi es In the residual category of other combination therapies, the following RCTs were included: one study arm with a nutrition -based intervention combined with SSRI, three arms with CBT or 288 cognitive therapy with a nutrition -based intervention, one self-management study arm combined with SSRI, and one study arm with supportive therapy combined with SSRI. Post-CG comparison. Allocated to this category was one arm from one study (combination of self-management [CBT -based manual, not therapist -led] plus SSRI; Mitchell et al., 2001) including its control group with N = 43 individuals at pretest and N = 37 individuals at posttest. This study reports a strong reduction in binge eating (g = 0.85; CI: 0.08, 1.61) and a very strong reduction in compensatory be havior (g = 1.54; CI: 0.94, 2.14). Post-CG comparison psychotherapy and placebo vs. psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy. For these analyses, data were available from four study arms with their respective comparison groups with a total of N=207 individuals at pretest and N=167 individuals at posttest. In two study arms, a slightly higher absence of binge eating is determined in the combination therapy (log OR = 0.21; CI: -0.62, 1.04), in one study a slightly higher absence of compensatory behavior can be seen (log OR = 0.46) and in three study arms a slightly higher absence of diagnoses becomes apparent (log OR = 0.46; CI: -0.33, 1.25). In the combination therapies, four study arms showed a marginally stronger reduction in binge eating episodes (g = 0.16; CI: -0.19, 0.51) and a slightly stronger reduction in compensatory behavior (g = 0.24; CI: -0.03, 0.51). One study showed a marginally stronger reduction in eating pathology (g = 0.16) and in depressive symptoms (g = 0.30). Pre-post. For pre -post analyses, six arms from five studies with a total of N=144 individuals at pretest and N=119 individuals at posttest were considered. In two study arms, an absence of binge eating post treatment was reported in 52% of cases, in one study arm an absence of purging was app arent in 14% of cases, and in three study arms the absence of a diagnosis in could be seen in 29% of cases . Six study arms report a strong reduction in binge eating (g = 0.88; CI: 0.65, 1.11), six study arms report a strong reduction in compensatory behav ior (g = 0.92; CI: 0.73, 1.10), one study arm reports a very strong reduction in self -reported eating pathology (g = 1.23; CI: 0.80; 1.65) and one study reports a moderate to large reduction of depressive symptoms (g = 0.74; CI: 0.31, 1.17). Pre-follow -up. For one arm (Beumont et al., 1997) with a total of N=34 individuals at pretest and N=17 individuals at posttest, follow -up data (after one month) are available. The study shows a medium -sized to strong reduction in binge eating (g = 0.76; CI : 0.35, 1.17), and a strong reduction in compensatory behavior (g = 0.83; CI: 0.49, 1.17). The efficacy of combination therapy consisting of CBT -based, non -therapist -led self - management manual and SSRI was confirmed for all central disorder variables in on e well - conducted RCT study. Therefore, in line with the classification of evidence levels according to the Oxford Centre of Evidence Based Medicine (Phillips et al., 1998 -2009), this combination can be assigned with evidence level 1b. Furthermore, it is ap parent that the combination of the two interventions has a better effect than the respective individual interventions alone. For the other combinations, there are several cohort studies without control groups, meaning that for CBT/BT plus nutrition -based t herapy, evidence level 2a can be assigned. For the combination of nutrition -based intervention plus SSRI as well as supportive therapy and SSRI, evidence level 2b can be assigned. When comparing the other combination therapies with simple psychotherapy, th e combination therapies only performed marginally better. Here too, the confidence intervals included zero, meaning that no significant effect could be determined. 289 3. Treatment settings For BN, there are essentially three possible treatment settings in Ge rmany just as well: inpatient, partial inpatient/day -clinic, and outpatient. The majority of patients with BN can be treated in the outpatient setting. In this respect, in the framework of the directives for psychotherapy, patients are treated by medical o r psychological psychotherapists or child and adolescent psychotherapists. If the following indication criteria are present, an inpatient or day -clinic treatment can be indicated: Insufficient change from outpatient treatment, Failure of outpatient or day -clinic treatment, Substantial mental and physical comorbidity (e.g. self -harm, Diabetes mellitus Type I), which necessitates close medical supervision, Illness severity (e.g. very severe symptoms, very chaotic eating behavior), Social or familial influenci ng factors which strongly hinder the recovery process (e.g. social isolation, problematic family situation, insufficient social support), Suicidality, Necessity for treatment by a multiprofessional team with treatment methods typical for hospitals (inpatie nt intensive therapy). In the case of inpatient or day -clinic treatment, transitions often occur (e.g. inpatient - outpatient). In this respect, good coordination and cooperation between the treatment providers involved is necessary. This also applies for t he combination of psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacological treatments, if they are not carried out by one person. For children and adolescents who are well integrated with their same -aged peers, caution is particularly advised when considering inpatient treatment. Fundamentally, a treatment against a minor's express will should only ensue in exceptional cases. In order to prepare patients and their parents for treatment and to ensure insight into the illness and motivation for change, clinical experience has shown that intensive preliminary discussions are helpful. The few findings comparing inpatient and day -clinic treatment of BN available so far indicate that the two treatment settings do not differ a great deal (Zeeck, Weber, Sandholz, et al., 2009). At 3 - and 12 - month follow -up, the success of the day -clinic patients was somewhat better than that of the inpatients. An uncontrolled study compared outpatient and inpatient treatment on the basis of cognitive -behavioral therapy. Patients treated in the inpatient setting were more strongly impaired regarding eating disorder and psychopatholog y. Both treatment settings were effective, but the inpatient treatment led to quicker changes and a more obvious improvement in mental comorbidities (Williamson et al., 1989). Studies on the efficacy of inpatient treatments within the German care system we re presented by Fischer and Quadflieg (1997), von Wietersheim, Kordy, K\u00e4chele, and MZ -Ess (2004) and Zeeck and colleagues (2007). Depending on the success criterion, a large proportion of patients 290 show a clear improvement in symptoms during the inpatient treatment, and the remission rates at the time of discharge were around 50%. Generally speaking, the inpatient stay was followed by outpatient psychotherapy. Recommendations Diagnosis Patients with BN should be offered treatment as early as possible to avoid the disorder becoming chronic (GCP). Some patients with BN are ambivalent towards changing their eating disorder; therefor, patients should be offered intervention actively motiv ating for treatment (GCP) Comorbid disorders should be diagnosed systematically (GCP). Treatment setting There are indications that it can be justified to treat patients with BN in the outpatient, day - clinic and inpatient setting (GCP). For patients with BN a treatment in an outpatient setting should be considered (B, evidence level 1a ). If certain indication criteria are present (see below), type of treatment (inpatient or day - clinic treatment) should be offered in dependence of the level of severity (GCP). The criteria for inpatient or day -clinic treatment are as follows (GCP): mental or physical comorbidity which constitutes an indication for inpatient or day -clinic treatment (e.g. suicidality, inadequately controlled diabetes mellitus, severe self -harm, drug or alcohol dependency) pronounced bulimic symptoms (including derailed eating behavior, electrolyte shift) pregnancy complications due to eating disorder insufficient efficacy of outpatient treatment circumstances in the patient's environment which hinder treatment Outpatient, inpatient and day -clinic treatments should take place in institutions or with therapists which possess expertise in the treatment of patients with eating disorders (GCP). Treatment form Psychotherapy should be offered as first -line treatment approach in adults (A, level of evidence 1a) Psychotherapy should be offered as first -line treatment approach in adolescents with BN (A, level of evidence 2a). CBT (including its further developments such as dialectical behavior therapy) is the most researched psychotherapy approach with the highest evidence level; therefore, CBT should be considered as first -line treatment in patients with BN (B, evidence level 1a). Other psychotherapeutic approaches or methods are available; these should be considered if CBT proves to be ineffective or is not desired in individual cases (B, evidence level 2b). Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) should be considered as an alternative to CBT (B, evidence level 2a). [However, in the German directives for psychotherapy, IPT is not an approved method]. Alternatively, psychodynamic psychotherapy can be recommended (O, evidence level 2b). 291 In th e treatment of children and adolescents, CBT should be considered as first -choice psychotherapeutic treatment (B, 2a15); treatment should be provided according to the individual state of development (GCP) . In children and adolescents, family -based therap y can also be recommended (O, evidence level 2b). For some patients with BN, participation in an evidence -based self -management program which is therapist -guided (\"guided self -help\") and is based on elements of cognitive behavioral therapy can be recommended (O, evidence level 1a). Pharmacotherapy must not be offered as a sole treatment (A, evidence level 1a). If pharmacotherapy is offered, fluoxetine should be considered as treatment (B, evidence level 1a). A treatment of BN with a dose of 60mg fluoxetine is more effective than a treatment with a dos e of 20mg fluoxetine (evidence level 1b). This is the only active substance which is approved in Germany for the BN treatment of adults in combination with psychotherapy . A treatment attempt using fluoxetine should be undertaken for a minimum of four we eks; a longer treatment duration can be assumed for treatment success (GCP). If medications other than fluoxetine are used for the treatment of BN, patients must be informed that the treatment is off -label (GCP). Bupropion is contraindicated for the treatment of patients with BN (2b). If comorbid disorders are present, the treatment disorder -specific elements should be offered (GCP). 15 The evidence level corresponds to an extrapolation from evidence from studies in adulthood, which partially included adolescents with BN, who were offered a treatment that was comparable to the treatments for adults with BN. 292 Table 1 : Overview of all studies entered into the current meta -analysis No .

Behaviour Research and Therapy, 49 (10), 714 -717. 318 Method report bulimia nervosa Literature search and study selection The aim of the guideline revision from 2010 was to check the existing recommendations for the treatment of bulimia nervosa (BN) on the basis of a meta -analysis of randomized controlled trials on the efficacy of psychotherapeutic and pharmacologic al interventions in adolescent and adult patients with a diagnosis of BN. Therefore, in addition to a manual search in reference lists, viewing recent reviews and meta -analyses together with the anorexia nervosa guideline subgroup, the University Library o f Heidelberg was tasked with conducting a systematic literature search for primary literature, initially encompassing the timeframe of all BN publications up to 31.01.2016. Due to a delay in the work on the guidelines, at the end of March 2017, the search was updated to 03.03.2017. . For coding the studies, the following predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria were defined. Predefined inclusion cr iteria for entry in the meta -analysis were (1) randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of adolescent and adult populations, (2) studies in patients with a formal diagnosis of BN, (3) studies with an assessment period of eating disorder pathology as outcome mea sure of at least one week, (4) studies with sufficient data to calculate effect sizes and (5) studies with multiple patient groups for which separate data are available for patients with BN. The following studies were excluded: (1) unpublished studies, dua l publications of the same trials and (3) RCTS with a sample size < 10. The studies were first roughly viewed with regard to the determined inclusion and exclusion criteria by two independent rate rs (two psychologists with an MSc and experience in the area of eating disorder research). Subsequently, a total of 79 RCTs with 185 arms ( 55 psychotherapeutic interventions, 41 pharmacological interventions, 21 combination interventions [pharmacotherapy a nd psychotherapy], 10 self-help interventions, 3 nutrition - specific interventions, 9 other non -pharmacological interventions , 46 non-active control groups (waitlist/placebo) were coded and evaluated by the two raters. Study coding and evaluation of study q uality were undertaken on the basis of the coding scheme used in the first edition in a slightly modified form. The modification referred to the specification of information about abstinence (abstinence from compensatory behaviors, absti nence from binge ea ting, abstinence from DSM criteria, abstinence time period) and the introduction of a general \"purging\" variable if no specific information about the individual compensatory behaviors (vomiting, laxative abuse etc.) was provided. Furthermore, the follow -up effects of the interventions were coded according to the same scheme as the post -effects and included in the analysis. In the case of discrepancies between the raters, consensus was reached following discussion. Prior to the coding procedure, the two rate rs underwent intensive training in handling the coding scheme. In total, 32 studies ( 41%) were coded by both raters. The inter -rater reliability was determined using Cohen's Kappa () for categorical variables and intra -class correlations (ICC) for continu ous variables. The calculated coefficients am ount to a mean of /ICC = .763 and ICC = .997 (95% confidence interval .996 - .997; p<.001). Discrepant codings were resolved by consen sus. Due to the good inter -rater reliability, the remaining 47 studies ( 59%) could be coded by only one of the two respective raters. 319 The 79 studies were assigned to 15 categories. Psychotherapies were differentiated into (cognitive) behavior al therapy, dialectical behavior therapy, psychodynamic therap ies, interpersonal therapy a nd family -based therapy. Moreover, there was a category for self -help and a category for \"other non -pharmacological interventions\" . The latter encompasses nutrition -based interventions as an independent subgroup as well as a residual category \"other interv entions\" contai ning those RCTs which could not be allocated to one particular therapy direction or school. Furth ermore, there was the category \" psychotherapeutically oriented combination therapies\" , subsuming RCTs which examined integrative approaches in t erms of their efficacy. With regard to pharmacotherapy, a distinction was made between tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), (MAO) inhibitors, selective serotonin (SSRI) pressants and other medic ations\" . Furthermore, there was a category containing combination therapy (combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy) as well as a residual category \"other combination therapies\" . The latter subsumes combination therapies consisting of in part non -psychotherapeutic interventions and stepped -care approaches combined with pharmacotherapy. Primary outcome measures for the meta -analysis were the absence of diagnostic criteria after completing the intervention, thus the absence of binge eating , the absenc e of purging behavior and the absence of all diagnostic c riteria of the DSM/ICD. Further more, the severity of illness was assessed in continuous variables, thus the frequency of binge eating episodes, of vomiting and of laxative consumption. For the evalua tion as standardized effect sizes, the two compensatory measures wer e integrated into one variable \"compensatory behavior\" . Secondary outcome measures were general eating pathology and depression. All available self -reported data on eating pathology (EDE, EDI, EAT total scores) were summarized into one variable in order to obtain an integrated measure and to be able to compare more studies. For depressive symptoms, data on the BDI total score were used. When determining meta -analytic effect sizes, the main focus was on pre -post changes, and wherever possible in a control group comparison. Additionally, the sustainability of the interventions was examined with respect to the described dependent variables using follow -up data (> month after the end of therapy) . If possible, intervention effects were evaluated using a pre -post between -group design. In the absence of data for the pre -time point or invariance (generally 100% prevalence of diagnostic criteria at the start), between -group comparisons at the post tim e point were used. If there were no data from non -active control groups, pre -post change effects for the examined cohort were calculated. The same approach was used to determine sustainability using follow -up data. Generally speaking, from three analyzable studies onwards, mixed models with random effects were calculated; in the case of two studies, models with fixed effects were calculated. If there was a sufficient number of studies, funnel plots were constructed and influence statistics calculated in ord er to estimate publication bias and/or be able to identify extreme values. If indicated, leave -one-out re -analyses were conducted to estimate the robustness of effects. If only one study was available, the findings of this study were mentioned and the data base was explicitly pointed out. The presentation of the meta -analytic results is structured into post - control -group (CG) comparison, pre -post and follow -up findings, in order to facilitate the determination of evidence levels and sustainability. 320 In the re vised version of the guidelines, the text and the evidence tables were revised and recommendations were checked regarding whether - in relation to evidence levels among other factors - they can remain unchanged or whether changes nee d to be undertaken. Recommendati ons were made based on the results of the meta -analysis. In the case of a lack of empirical evidence, good clinical practice was developed following discussion in the expert group. Upon consensus in the expert group, some of these (GCP) recommenda tions were formulated as \"We recommend\" or \" We sugg est\" recommendations due to their high clinical relevance. The individual chapters were revised by members of the working group. Represented in the working group were experts from the area of inpatient and outpatient treatment for children, adolescents and adults. Text, evidence evaluation and recommendations were discussed and approved within telephone conferences and meetings on the basis of previously sent documents. For the evaluation of the meta -analys is, a methodologist was included.

Symptoms of binge -eating disorder Persons with a diagnosis of binge -eating disorder (BED) suffer from regularly occurring binge - eating episodes. Characteristic for such an episode is to eat a considerably larger amount of food than most people would eat under similar circumstances, and wit hin a discrete period of time (e.g. within two hours) (American Psychiatric Association, APA, 2013). To decide, in a concrete case, whether or not a binge -eating episode is present , the context within which eating occurs is recommended to be considered . For instance, most people eat substantially more at a party buffet than at regular mealtimes. Thus, according to the DSM -5 criteria, the amount of food eaten may be evaluated as objectively large in one context (e.g. during a regular mealtime), while thi s does not apply in a different context (e.g. at a party buffet). Binge -eating episodes can be triggered by negative affect; this has been meta -analytically shown in various diary studies (\"ecological momentary assessment\") (Haedt -Matt & Keel, 2011 a). However, affect can also b e more negative after a binge -eating episode than prior to the episode (Haedt -Matt & Keel, 2011 a). In the sense of the \"trade -off\" theory, this can be explained such that the function of a binge -eating episode may lie in swapping one particular emotion for another (possibly also negative) emotion (Kenardy, Arnow & Agras, 1996) . This theory has been supported, among other s, by field studies showing that guilt, anger, fear and sadness are reduced over the course of a binge -eating episode (Berg et al., 2013) . Another meta - analysis indicated that persons with BED estimate their fe eling of hunger directly before a binge -eating episode as significantly greater than outside of binge -eating episodes (Haedt -Matt & Keel, 2011b) . 1.2. Associated psychological problems Negative body image. Empirical findings suggest that persons with BED show an overvaluation of shape and weight as well as clinically relevant shape and weight concerns, or dissatisfaction with shape and weight, which can be relevant to self -esteem and can precede binge -eating episodes (Ahrberg, et al., 2007) . The overvaluation of shape and weight is further associated with a more pronounced eat ing disorder 16 Ulrich Hagenah and Harriet Salbach -Andrae were coauthors of a previous version of this chapter. 332 psychopathology and psychological burden, and is negatively related to treatment outcome (Grilo, 2013). Restrictive eating behavior. Several diary studies have shown that restrictive eating behavior (\"dietary restraint\") promotes the occurre nce of binge -eating episodes (Haedt -Matt & Keel, 2011 b). In this regard, the likelihood of a binge -eating episo de increases with the duration of attempted dietary restriction (Holmes, Fuller -Tyszkiewicz, Skouteris & Broadbent, 2014) . On the neural level, food deprivation may be accompanied by an increased activation of cortical areas associated with attention, reward and motivation (Stice, Burger & Yokum, 2013) . Low s elf-esteem. BED is frequently associated with low self-esteem. For instance, it was shown that persons with overweight and BED have lower implicit and explicit self -esteem than normal -weight perso ns without a diagnosis of a mental disorder (Brauhardt, Rudolph & Hilbert, 2014). Moreover, low self -esteem in persons with BED is also related to a pronounced overvaluation of shape and weight (Grilo, White & Masheb, 2012). However, a recent review (Stice , 2016) showed that most prospective studies did not find a causal relationship between negative self -esteem and the development of eating disorder symptoms. Interpersonal problems . Furthermore, interpersonal problems are characteristic for BED and are as sociated with greater symptomatology (Blomquist, Ansell, White, Masheb & Grilo, 2012; Ivanova et al., 2015). Interpersonal problems are also linked to an earlier onset of the disorder (Blomquist et al., 2012). Moreover, a higher degree of interpersonal pro blems is associated with a lower response to psychotherapy (Hilbert et al., 2007). Dysfunctional emotion regulation. On the basis of self -reports, it was found that persons with a diagnosis of BED, like persons with a diagnosis of another mental disorder , more frequently use dysfunctional strategies and more rarely use functional strategies in dealing with negative feelings (e.g. Svaldi, Griepenstroh, Tuschen -Caffier & Ehring, 2012) . Experimental studies have also confirmed that dysfunctional emotion regulation in persons with BED is associated with eating disorder symptoms (e.g. increased eating) (e.g. Svaldi, Tuschen -Caffier, Trentowska, Caffier & Naumann, 2014) . Recent findings show that in persons with BED who show a high degree of dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies, the overvaluation of shape and weight is also strongly pronounced (Harri son, Mitchison, Rieger, Rodgers & Mond, 2016). 1.3. Diagnostic criteria BED is still a relatively new diagnostic category, which was initially introduced as a research diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM -IV (APA, 1994). Research findings have shown that BED is a clinically significant mental disorder w hich is delimit able from other eating disorders, e.g. bulimia nervosa (BN), which justifies a separate clinical diagnosis (Wonderlich, Gordon, Mitchell, Crosby & Engel, 2009). Therefore, in the current version of the DSM, BED has been included as a clinical diagnosis (30 7.51 in the DSM -333 5, APA, 2013; 50.8 in the International Classification of Diseases, ICD -10, World Health Organization, WHO, 1992). To diagnose BED according to the DSM -5 (APA, 2013), the following criteria need to be fulfilled: A. Recurrent episodes of bin ge eating, accompanied by a sense of lack of control over eating B. Association of binge -eating episodes with at least three of five behavioral characteristics (eating more rapidly than normal ; eating until feeling uncomfortably full; eating large amounts of food when not being hungry ; eating alone because of feeling embarrassed ; feeling disgu sted with oneself, guilty or depressed after a binge -eating episode) C. Marked distress regarding binge eating D. Frequency of binge eating: at least once a week for three months E. Binge -eating episodes are not followed by regular use of inappropriate compensatory behavior and do not occur exclusively in the context of BN or anorexia nervosa (AN). The minimum severity of BED is determi ned based on the frequency of binge -eating episodes. The level of severity may be considered to be higher to reflect other symptoms and the degree of functional disability (mild: 1 -3 episodes per week; moderate: 4 week; severe: 8-13 episodes per week; extreme: 14 or more episodes per week). Partial remission vs. full remission. If the number of binge -eating episodes previously met the diagnostic criterion (at least one binge -eating episode per week for three months) but fewer episodes currently occur, the DSM -5 speaks of partial remission. If all diagnostic criteria were previously met and are no longer present, BED is seen as being in full remission. Other classifications of eating disorder symptoms. If a person fulfills some but not all criteria of BED, classification can be made through the category Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorders (307.59 and F50.8) by indicating the disorder concerned, for example BED with low frequency and/or limited duration. If insufficient informatio n is available for a more precise diagnosis or the clinician does not wish to record this, the category Unspecified Feeding or Eating Disorder (307.50 and F50.8) can be used in the classification. In the still curre nt version of the classification system of the World Health Organization (ICD - 10), BED is only classified within the general category of other eating disorders (F50.8) (WHO, 1992). In the revised version which is currently in preparation (ICD -11), it is highly likely that BED will also be inclu ded as its own diagnosis. 1.4. Etiology and maintenance The etiology of BED is not yet sufficiently understood. However, it is a complex mental disorder which is presumably multifactorial in nature, and various mechanisms are involved in its develop ment , triggering and maintenance . 334 Predisposing factors. A greater prevalence of BED within families can be interpreted as suggesting that genetic factor s are inv olved in the development of BED. Recent molecular genetic studies in BED point to changes in dopam inergic and opioid neurotransmitter networks, which are associated with binge -eating episodes (Kessler, Hutson, Herman & Potenza, 2016). However, overweight or obesity in childhood also appear s to be a relevant predictor for BED (Fairburn et al., 1998; Hil bert et al., 2014). The psychosocial risk factors include general vulnerability factors such as critical life events (e.g. separation of parents), neglect, stress at school, depressiveness or shyness as well as eating disorder -specific factors such as rest rictive eating behavior, emotional eating, restrictive parental feeding practices, a higher body weight, dissatisfaction with one's shape as well as a pronounced thinness ideal and shape - and weight - related criticism ( Fairburn Hilbert et al., 2014). Furthermore, compared to persons without a mental disorder diagnosis, persons with a diagnosis of BED more frequently report experiences of sexual and physical abuse (Fairburn et al., 1998; Hilbert et al., 201 4). With regard to these findings, it should be kept in mind that despite the systematic interview methods used for these investigations, retrospective reports were gathered, which can be subject to memory and reporting bias es. Further individual factors which might be involved in the etiology of BED and which have been neuropsychologically or neurophysiologically examined are problems in the area of executive functions, which affect decision -making behavior, impulse control and action planning, against the background of an altered function in the prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex as well as in the insula striatum (Kessler et al., 2016; Kittel, Brauhardt & Hilbert, 2015). Also for these studies, causality has not been clearly established. Triggering f actors. Study findings suggest that the onset of BED is preceded by a series of stressors, which might represent triggering factors for the development of the disorder (Hartmann, Czaja et al., 2012; Pike et al., 2006). In this regard, concerns about shape and weight seem to be especially relevant for the development of eating disorders. In a prospective longitudinal study, girls with a high degree of dissatisfaction with their body had a much higher risk of developing an eating disorder, including BED, over the course of eight years compared to girls with a low level of body dissatisfaction (Stice, Marti & Durant, 2011). Maintaining factors. For the direct triggering of binge eating in BED, negative mood has been shown to be a preceding factor ; binge -eatin g episodes can contribute to an improvement in mood (Haedt -Matt & Keel, 2011b). In addition , the exposure to food is also important for eliciting binge eating. For instance, experimental studies have shown that persons with overweight and BED ate significa ntly more when a larger amount of food was available. Neurophysiological findings point to an increased appetitive value of foods for persons with BED (Schienle, Sch\u00e4fer, Hermann & Vaitl, 2009). Problems in the area of executive functions can also be relev ant for the maintenance of BED. For instance, binge eating is more likely when persons with BED favor a reward -oriented decision -making behavior, show a tendency for impulsive behavior and generate fewer effective and specific problem -solving strategies (K ittel et al., 2015). Moreover, the environmental factors that may maintain BED include stressors 335 such as interpersonal conflicts or exposure to weight and shape (Hilbert & Tuschen -Caffier, 2007; Stein et al., 2007). 1.5. Differential diagnosis Like BED, BN and AN of the binge -eating/purging type are characterized by binge -eating episodes. According to the DSM -5 (APA, 2013), in the differential diagnosis of BED and these two other eating disorders, it should be taken into account that the compensatory stra tegies that are anchored in the diagnostic criteria for BN and AN binge -eating/purging type (e.g. self - induced vomiting, intake of laxatives and diuretics , use of enemas as well as excessive exercise) do not regularly occur in BED. Furthermore, in contrast to AN and BN, BED is associated with a less severe and enduring restrictive eating behavior employed for the purpos e of weight loss (APA, 2013). Additionally, BED needs to be differentiated from affective disorder s such as major depression or bipolar disorder, as an increased appetite and increased food consumption, including binge eating with a sense of loss of control over eating , can also occur in these disorders. Likewise, BED needs to be delineated from persona lity disorders, especially borderline personality disorder, as these can also be accompanied - among other s - by impulsive behavior including binge eating. According to the DSM -5, if the diagnostic criteria for affective disorders and borderline personalit y disorder are fulfilled, these disorders can also be diagnosed in addition to BED, as they are not mutually exclusive (in contrast to the eating disorder diagnoses). Disordered eating behavior can also occur in certain neurological or other medical diseas es (e.g. Prader -Willi syndrome, Kleine -Levin syndrome etc.); however, in these cases, the other features of the BED diagnostic criteria are lacking. 1.6. Comorbidity Comorbidity with mental disorders. Compared to the general population, persons with BED suffer from a higher rate of diagnosed mental disorders in addition to BED. Overall, more than 70% of persons with BED show at least one comorbid mental disorder (Keski -Rahkonen & Mustelin, 2016). This p redominantly includes affective disorders such as major depression and bipolar disorder as well as the various anxiety disorders (e.g. generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder and diverse phobias). Further, although evidently more rarely occurring , comorbid disorders are substance abuse disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, body dysmorphic disorder and the various personality disorders (Kessler et al., 2013). Moreover, there are indications that persons with BED show increased suicidality, even after controlling for the presence of depressive symptoms (Welch et al., 2016). In this respect, an increased impulsivity is discussed a possible factor underlying both BED and increased suicidality. The psychological problems and/or comorbid disorders occur mo re frequently in persons with BED than in persons without BED but with a comparable body weight, meaning that the increased rate of further mental disorders, besides possible comorbid overweight or obesity, also appears to be associated with higher severit y of BED (e.g. Welch et al., 2016). 336 Comorbidity with obesity. Obesity is a condition characterized by an excessive accumulation of fatty tissue in the body; it does not reveal an ything about etiology, for instance in the sense of an eating disorder. Acco rding to the guidelines of the German Obesity Society (DAG; 2014), body mass index (BMI) is the foundation for weight classification. BMI is the ratio of weight to the square of height (kg/m\u00b2). Overweight is defined as a BMI of 25 - 29.9 kg/m2, obesity as a BMI 30 kg/m2. Within the overall population of persons with obesity, especially in clinical practice, a subgroup of persons can be discerned in whom psychological problems and disorders lead to a change in eating and exercise behavior, the consequence of which is a sustained positive energy balance (Herpertz, 2008). In persons with obesity who seek a behavioral weight loss treatment (clinical populations), the prevalence of BED is estimated at 20 to 30% (de Zwaan, 2002; Treasure, Claudino & Zucker, 2010), and the likelihood for the presence of BED appears to increase with the level of the BMI (Hay, 1998; Telch, Agras & Rossiter, 1988). The prevalence of BED in persons with obesity prior to bariatric surgery lies at around 15 to 30% (Dawes et al., 2016; de Zwaan et de Steffen, 2012; Herpertz & de Zwaan, 2015 ). Studies on the prevalence of obesity in samples of persons with BED have found prevalence rates between 65% and 70% et al., 2012 ). According to a study by Kessler et al. (2013) in over 23,000 persons, 32.8% to 41.7% of persons with BED were classified as obese, while approx. 16% o f persons without BED were classified as obese. Thus, there appears to be a close link between obesity and BED, although it is not yet clear whether BED is a cause or a consequence of overweight and obesity (Tanofsky -Kraff et al., 2013). The assumption of a monocausal pathogenesis of obesity in persons with BED, namely that weight gain, culminating in overweight and obesity, is the sole consequen ce of hypercaloric eating behavior during binge -eating episodes, has not been empirically proven. The observation that in BN and subgroups of AN, binge -eating episodes are almost always preceded by hypocaloric eating behavior (e.g. fasting), led to the hypo thesis of restrictive eating behavior as an important pathomechanism in the genesis of eating disorder symptoms ( Andr\u00e9s & Saldana, 2014 ; Fairburn, Coop er, Doll & Davies, 2005; Fairburn & Harrison, 2003; Jacobi, Hayward, de Zwaan, Kraemer & Agras, 2004), although restrictive eating behavior appears to be less pronounced in BED than in BN (Roberto, Grilo, Masheb & White, 2010). In contrast to persons with obesity without BED, the food and energy intake in persons with obesity and BED appears to be greater, both in general and specifically on days without binge -eating episodes (Dingemans, Bruna & van Furth, 2002). The degree of psychopathology is more strong ly associated with the severity of the eating disorder than with BMI (Fairburn et al., 1998). Since the inclusion of BED within the research criteria in the DSM -IV (APA, 1994), numerous studies have found differences between persons with obesity with and without BED not only on the behavioral level (eating behavior, binge -eating episodes), but also with regard to comorbidity with Axis I and II mental disorders, dysfunctional cognitions regarding shape and weight etc. (Mitchell, Devlin, as well as Tanofsky -Kraff and colleagues (2013) 337 describe that compared to persons with obesity without BED, persons with obesity and BED show a greater dissatisfaction w ith their own body, lower self -esteem, and lower quality of life. Depressive disorders, anxiety disorders and phobic disorders, as well as a harmful use of alcohol and alcohol addiction are frequent comorbid disorders in persons with obesity and BED (Buli k, Sullivan & Kendler, & Harris, 2004) . Moreover, persons with obesity and BED suffer more frequently from a comorbid personality disorder, with reported prevalence rates ranging betwe en 7.5% and 30% (Gerlach, Loeber & Herpertz, 2016). According to Picot and Lilenfeld (2003), comorbid personality disorders act as predictors for the frequency of binge -eating episodes; however, from the majority of the studies, it is not possible to deduc e an influence of comorbid personality disorders on the treatment outcome of BED (Gerlach et al., 2016). In the long term, persons with obesity and BED appear to show a lower weight loss in behavioral weight loss programs than persons with obesity without BED (Wilson, Wilfley, Agras & Bryson, 2010). The assumption that an improvement in psychological symptoms as well as eating disorder symptoms is associated with weight loss has not been confirmed in the majority of studies (Brownley et al., 2016; Vocks et al., 2010). In the long term, the successful treatment of BED shows only marginal effects with regard to weight trajectory (Dingemans, Bruna & van Furth, 2002; Vocks et al., 2010), meaning that it is likely that other factors, such as hypercaloric eating behavior, also between the binge -eating episodes, have a decisive influence on weight (see section 2.1 \"Treatment goals \"). For persons with obesity class III (BMI 40 kg/m2) and class II (BMI 35 - 39.9 kg/m2) with chronic somatic diseases , obesity surgery is the method of choice (DAG, 2014). Persons with BED prior to surge ry carry a greater risk of problematic eating behavior post (Niego, Wittert, 2016), which is in turn associated with a lower weight loss or greater weight gain. Not least due to the changed anatomical, but also frequent neurohormonal changes following the operation, the number of binge -eating episodes decreases substantially. Persons generally no longer consume objective ly large amounts of food, meaning that a binge -eating episode rarely occurs. Pre -operative binge - eating episode s often lead to \"grazing\" (i.e. consumption of small amounts of food distributed over the day without feelings of hunger; Colles, Dixon & O'Brien , 2008). After the operation, some persons continue to feel a loss of control over eating subjectively (or also objectively) large amounts of food, which is termed \"loss of control eating\" (Colles et al., 2008; Niego et al., 2007; Opozda et al., 2016). In a minority of persons , the loss of control eating occurs for the first time after the operation. Those with loss of control eating and grazing show a lower weight loss post -operatively and report more psychological stress than those wi thout disordered eating behavior . When considering the relation of pre - and post -operative eating behavior in their predictive function for postoperative weight course, the postoperative eating behavior is substantially more meaningful (Opozda et al., 2016). The question of wh ich persons will re- develop binge eating and in which persons binge eating will remain absent in the long term is difficult to answer from a pre -operative perspective (Herpertz & de Zwaan, 2015) . Following an initial weight loss, in the majority of persons , a weight increase is observed one to two years 338 after the operation, which generally reaches a weight plateau. Not uncommonly, the affected persons perceive this weight gain with great anxiety. The consequence is often a consciously restrictive eating beh avior, which in the case of respective vulnerability can foster the re - occurrence of binge eating. 1.7. Course Natural course. Based on retrospective stud ies, the course of untreated BED is considered as chronic and persistent (de Zwaan, Mitchell, Raymond & Spitzer, 1994; Spitzer et al., 1993). The findings of a longitudinal study by Cachelin et al. (1999) on the natural cour se of BED over a period of six months, however, pointed to a variable course, which can include virtually disorder -free phases as well as phases with strong symptoms. In the large st prospective study on the cour se of eating disorders conducted to date, it was shown - similarly to retrospective studies - that the majority (64%) of pe rsons with BED continued to fulfill all or almo st all of the BED criteria at one-year follow -up; only in 7% of the sample was an eating disorder no longer diagnosed (Crow, Agras, Halmi, Mi tchell & Kraemer, 2002) . By contrast, there are also findings to suggest a relatively high remission rate for BED (Fairburn et al., 2000) . The inconsistent findings may be due to the fact that the samples are not comparable across the different studies (e.g. regarding the duration of symptoms). In summary, it must be emphasized that so far, the state of research on the natural course of BED is relatively weak and conclusions are not su fficiently empirically supported. Clinical course . There are now numerous studies demonstrating a sustained treatment success following psychotherapy (Brownley et al., 2016; Fichter, 2009; Wilfley et al., 2002; Wilson et al., 2010). In a study on a sample of 64 persons with BED, who had received inpatient treatment in a clinic with a predominantly behavioral therapy ori entation, 67% of the sample had no eating disorder diagnosis at 12 -year follow -up, around 13% had an eating disorder diagnosis from the residual category of EDNOS, 8% still had a diagnosis of BED, and 9% had a diagnosis of BN (purging type); 3% of the samp le were deceased (Fichter & Quadflieg, 2004) . The disorder -specific and general psychopathology showed stable reductions over the differe nt follow -up periods (e.g. posttreatment , 2-3-year follow -up, 6 - and 12 -year -up (Fichter & Quadflieg, 2004; Fichter, Quadflieg & Hedlund, 2006, 2008). The results indicate that about two thirds of treated persons were able to successfully overcome their eating disorder. A long -term stable treatme nt outcome has also been documented in persons treated in the outpatient setting (Hilbert et al., 2012). In this study comprising a sample of 90 persons, half were randomized to cognitive - behavioral therapy (CBT) and half to interpersonal psychotherapy (IP T). Four years after the end of therapy, stable treatment outcome was shown for the core symptoms of BED. At this time point, 52% of those who had received CBT still no longer fulfilled criteria for BED, while this figure lay at 77% for those who had recei ved IPT. While the persons treated with IPT continued to show symptom improvements over the follow -up period, persons treated with CBT showed a slight reduction in their treatment outcome . In a total of 12% of the CBT sample and 339 9% of the IPT sample, BED w as diagnosed again four years after the end of treatment. General psychopathological features (e.g. depressiveness) did not reduce during the follow -up period. A short -term CBT (eight group sessions and five booster sessions, the latter distributed over one year), was also found to lead to long -term stable treatment outcome over a four -year follow - up period in 41 persons with BED (Fischer et al., 2014). Overall, 67% of the treated persons did not show BED at the follow -up, and the number of binge -eating epi sodes (over the last 28 days) decreased on average to 0.7. Moreover, both measures continued to improve substantially between end of therapy and four-year follow -up. In sum, it can be stated that psychotherapy in BED leads to clear and stable treatment effects , both with respect to the common primary outcome measures ( diagnosis of BED, binge -eating episode s) and with respect to secondary outcome measures such as eating disorder psychopathology, but less so with regard to other psychopathologies. Moreover , body weight appears to barely decrease over the duration of treatment. The long -term course of body weight is unclear, although there are some indications that BMI reduce s over long -term follow -up (Fischer et al., 2014; Munsch, Meyer & Biedert, 2012). In addition to CBT, particularly IPT appears to show substantial effects. Following pharmacological treatment, consistent but rather weak symptom improvements in BED were shown (Brownley et al., 2016). These were generally inferior to the combined treatment with psychotherapy (Grilo, Crosby, Wilson & Masheb, 2012). In terms of pharmacological treatments, the administration of second -generation antidepressants, anticonvulsant medications (e.g. topiramate) and stimulants (lisdexamfetamine) has proven to be suc cessful in reducing binge eating and/or the rates of BED diagnosis, although less so in reducing eating disorder psychopathology (Brownley et al., 2016). By contr ast, lisdexamfetamine and topira mate had substantial effects on weight loss (Brownley et al., 2016). Follow -up studies also show a stable but rather weak effect of purely pharmacological treatment (Grilo, Crosby et al., 2012). The involvement of psychological factors in pharmacological treatment is also supported by findings demonstrating a high ra te of placebo response to medication treatment. For instance, Carter et al. (2003) reported a mean placebo response of 33% for the various pharmacological active substances, which was also confirmed by Jacobs - Pilipski et al. (2007) for an appetite suppress ant (sibutramine). However, in this study, persons who showed a placebo response were found to have a more unfavorable spontaneous course. Hence, these findings reflect the aforementioned variability in the course of illness, as well as the importance of u nspecific (psychological) factors in the pharmacotherapy of BED. Predictors of treatment outcome . Above all, disorder -related features (e.g. the level of eating disorder psychopathology) predict the long -term course of (treated) persons with BED, while general psychopathological features are less predictive (Fairburn Vall & Wade, 2015). This applies to levels of these measures not only at pretreatment , but also at the end of treat ment. For instance, a pronounced eating disorder psychopathology and binge eating at the end of treatment represented negative prognostic indicators of long -term treatment outcome (i.e. over a four - year follow -up period) (Fischer et al., 2014). The most im portant predictor of treatment 340 outcome , though, appears to be the rapid response to treatment, and this seems to be the case both for psychotherapeutic treatment and to a lesser degree also for an adjuvant pharmacotherapeutic treatment (Grilo, White, Wilso n, et al., 2017; Vall & Wade, 2015). Compared to AN and BN, the prognosis for BED is more favorable, not only with respect to eating disorder symptoms but also regarding other psychological parameters (Fichter et al., 2008; Nazar et al., 2017). Nevertheless, the long -term treatment outcome is less favorable if disorder -specific features are not already clearly reduced during therapy. 1.8. BED in childhood and adolescence Symptoms and associated psychological problems. The symptoms of BED can already occur in childhood and adolescence. For instance, children from the age of six years report recurrent overeating with a sense of loss of control over eating (Tanofsky -Kraff et al., 2004). Due to an often limited access to food, children are especially likely to eat amounts of food which are often not excessively large (Hilbert & et al., 2004). There fore, in children and adolescents, the subjective sense of loss of control during a binge -eating episode is seen as more psychopathologically rele vant than the amount of food consumed (Shomaker et al., 2010). Therefore, in children and adolescents, subject ive binge eating (i.e. loss of control over eating a subjectively large amount of food) and objective binge eating (i.e. loss of control over eating an objectively large amount of food, in line with the DSM -5) are considered, both described as \"loss of con trol eating\" (see chapter VII. \"Atypical eating disorders and eating disorders not otherwise specified \"). Such binge -eating episodes can take place alone or in the presence of other persons and at any ti me of day, but especially in the afternoon and evenin g (Kass et al., 2017; Tanofsky -Kraff et al., 2009). Also in childhood, BED is associated with an increased eating disorder -specific (e.g. shape and weight concerns) and general psychopathology (e.g. internalizing behavior problems , low self - esteem, suici dality) as we ll impairments in Grange, Swendsen & Merikangas, 2011; Tanofsky -Kraff et al., 2004). Children and adolescents with BED are more frequently affected by overweight and obesity than children and adolescents without BED (ibid.). Cognitive -emotional dysfunctions have been reported, including deficits in inhibition, increased impulsivity, a visual attention al bias for food stimuli as wel l as difficulties in emotion regulation (Czaja, Rief & & Hilbert, 2016). While BED in mid dle childhood is rarely accompanied by physical functional impairments, there are in dications that in adolescents, BED is already linked to symptoms of type 2 diabetes mellitus or cardiovascular diseases associated with overweight and obesity (Radin et al., 2015). Diagnostic criteria. Due to developmental particularities, age -adapted dia gnostic criteria have been suggested for BED in children and adolescents (Hilbert & Czaja, & Yanovski, 2008). Accordingly, for a diagnosis of BED in childhood and adolescence, not only objec tive binge eating but also subjective binge eating, i.e. loss of control eating, needs to be considered (DSM -5, criterion A). In general, binge -eating episode s are less frequent than in adults ( Hilbert & Czaja, Tan ofsky -Kraff et al., 2004), leading to the suggestion that the diagnostic frequency criterion should be decreased, for instance, to two episodes per month (criterion D) (Tanofsky -Kraff et al., 2008). Likewise, the distress due to binge eating is often weake r in BED in childhood and adolescence (criterion C) (Hilbert & Czaja, 2009). Age - adapted behavioral features have also been suggested (e.g. feelings of numbness during binge - eating episode s; criterion B; Tanofsky -Kraff et al., 2009). However, the diagnosis of BED in childhood and adolescence requires further empirical validation (Matherne et al., 2015), and specific age -adapted criteria for BED are found neither in the DSM -5 nor in the ICD -10. The symptoms of BED in childhood and adolescen ce can be subsumed under the category Unspecified Feeding or Eating Disorders in the DSM -5 and ICD -10 (307.50 and F50.9). Comorbidity. Approximately 83.5% of children and adolescents with BED show at leas t one comorbid mental disorder (e.g. affective disorder, anxiety disorder, substance abuse or dependence ; Swanson et al., 2011). Moreover, the symptoms of BED often occur comorbidly with attention -deficit/hyperactivity disorder (Hartmann, Rief & Hilbert, 2 012; Reinblatt et al., 2015), and both disorders are longitudinally associated with obesity (Nigg et al., 2016; Tanofsky -Kraff et al., 2009, 2011). Already in childhood and adolescence, BED is linked to overweight and obesity and their sequelae such as type 2 diabetes mellitus or cardiovascular diseases as well as chronic inflammation (Shank, Tanofsky -Kraff et al., 2017; Tanofsky -Kraff et al., 2012). Etiology and maintenance. A risk factor for BED in adolescence is a persistent loss of control eating in mi ddle childhood al., 2011). Retrospective and prospective studies show that the symptoms of BED are predicted by a higher body weight, critical life events (e.g. separat ion of parents), stress at school, depressiveness, emotional eating, restrictive eating behavior, restrictive parental feeding practices, dissatisfaction with one's shape as well as shape - and weight -related criticism (Allen, Byrne, Oddy & Crosby, 2013; Go Zhang, Loth & Neumark -Sztainer, 2016; Hartmann, Czaja et al., 2012). Similarly to adults with BED, maintaining factors include negative mood and difficulties in emotion regulation, stress, a restrictive eating style, the consumption of \"fo rbidden foods\", negative self -esteem and negative body image, and interpersonal problems, for instance , within the family (Hilbert, Tuschen 2016; Vannucci et al., 2014). Course. Regarding the natural course, BED in childhood and adolescence shows a moderate stability with a clear tendency for spontaneous remission and relapse ( Allen et al., 2013; Goldschmidt et al., 2016; Stice et al., 2009). To date, there are few findings specifically for BED regarding the course after treatment . Treatability was suggested by a randomized 342 controlled pilot study in 12 -18-year-old youth with rec urrent binge eating. Compared to a waitlist control condition, CBT proved to be efficacious regarding the remission of binge eating up to three months after treatment (DeBar et al., 2013) . Further initial evidence is available for IPT in the prevention of overweight and obesity in a dolescent girls in a randomized controlled pilot study (Tanofsky -Kraff et al., 2014). Compared to health -related psychoeduc ation, IPT was shown to be significantly more efficacious in reducing binge -eating episodes at one -year follow-up. 2. Therapy 2.1. Treatment goals In light of the multifactorial etiology of BED (see section 1.4 \"Etiology and maintenance\") and a symptomatology arising in psychological, physical and social areas, different treatment goals should be considered in the individual treatment planning. Essentially, the treatment goals encompass the following aspects: Treatment of the symptoms of BED (e.g. binge eating, eating disorder -specific psychopathology) Treatment of further psychological compl aints (e.g. problems with self -esteem and shame, affect regulation) Treatment of comorbid mental disorders (e.g. depression, social anxiety) Relapse prevention (e.g. imparting meta -knowl edge). If indicated , treatment of obesity (see S3-guideline Diagnosis and Prevention of Obesity ; DAG, 2014) Of course, the above -mentioned treatment goals are neither mutually exclusive nor independent from one another. If several treatment goals are pursued, it is necessary to determine priorities and temporal sequenc ing in treatment (de Zwaan, 2002). Often, persons with BED aim to lose weight . This concern needs to be addressed with the patient as part of the treatment planning, considering in how far a too strong focus on weight loss can hinder the primary treatment g oal for BED : the re duction of binge eating . 2.2. Treatment approaches In the following, recommendations for individual treatment forms are made. These are mostly based on the results of a comprehensive meta -analysis by Hil bert et al. ( 2017, 2019 , in press ) on the efficacy of different treatment approaches for BED (see \"Binge eating disorder - Method s report\"). If a sufficient number of randomized controlled trials were available for a particular treatment approach, a meta -analysis was conducted for this ap proach, into which the effect sizes (ES) for the quantification of differences between pre -post values from intervention 343 groups and untreated control groups were entered. Evidence levels were classified following the recommendations of the Oxford Centre of Evidence Based Medicine (Phillips et al., 1998 - 2009): Evidence level Ia was assigned if at least three randomized controlled trials could be included in the meta -analysis; otherwise, evidence level Ib was assigned. If no randomized controlled trials with an untreated control group were available for a treatment approach , but rather exclusively non -randomized controlled studies, uncontrolled studies or randomized controlled trials with a treated control group, the ES of the meta -analysis are based on the comparisons of the pre - and the post -values of the respective intervention groups ( evidence level IIa). When interpreting the results, it should be noted that ES which are based on the comparison of pre -post values from intervention and control conditions, a nd those which are based on a comparison of pre - and post -values for one intervention condition, are not directly comparable with one another in terms of their size; generally speaking, the ES turn out to be smaller fo r the integration of randomized contro lled trials. For this reason, the classification according to Cohen (1988) in the proper sense is solely applicable to the ES for the integr ation of randomized controlled trials. Besides ES, in meta -analysis on the basis of randomized controlled trials odds ratios were calculated as indicators of symptom remission , and in the meta -analysis based on pre -post comparisons alternatively the abstinence rates. Pre -follow -up effects were meta -analytically evaluated if data were available. If the number of primary studies did not allow for either of the two described meta -analytic comparisons , the individual studies for the respective treatment approach were used for deriving recommendations ( evidence levels IIb to IV). 2.2.1. Psychotherapy In the current meta -analysis (Hilbert et al., 2019, in press ), 46 treatment conditions were included in the evaluations on the psychotherapy of BED, encompassing a total of 1 ,915 persons. In 40 of the treatment conditions, psychotherapy took place in group setting, whil e in six of the conditions, psychotherapy was carried out in individual format. Of th e treatment conditions, 36 stud y arms contained CBT, two study arms contained IPT and three study arms contained psychodynamic therapy, one study arm humanistic therapy an d four study arms other forms of psychotherapy. With regard to study quality, the psychotherapy studies predominantly showed a high risk of bias. When solely analyzing the randomized controlled trials, it was possible to include 32 treatment conditions wi th a total of 1 ,278 persons. Here, 27 study arms comprised CBT, two IPT, and one study arm each for psychodynamic therapy, humanistic therapy and another form of psychotherapy. The meta -analytic ES referred to the comparison of the pre -post data in psychot herapy versus an untreated control condition. For psychotherapy in general, a large effect was found for binge -eating episodes (ES = 1.22). Compared to persons in the untreated control conditions, the persons who had been treated with psychotherapy had a 1 2-fold increased likelihood of being abs tinent from binge eating at the end of treatment. With regard to the group difference in eating disor der psychopathology, a medium effect (ES = 0.50) was 344 found, and for depressive symptoms a small effect (ES = 0.45). By contrast, no significant effect emerged with regard to BMI (ES = 0.04). Moreover, it needs to be noted that in a comparison of psychotherapy with other treatment approaches (e.g. structured self -help treatment , pharmacotherapy, behavioral , pharmacolog ical and surgical loss treatment , combination treatment ) evaluated in randomized controlled trials with an untreated control group, psychotherapy was significantly superior with respect to abstinence from binge eating, but not with respect to the nu mber of binge -eating episode s at the end of treatment . If, in addition to the randomized controlled trials, non -randomized controlled and uncontrolled studies were included, the uncontrolled pre -post comparison yielded effects in the high range for the num ber of binge -eating episode s (ES = 1.36). Overall, 53% of the persons treated with psychotherapy achieved an abstinence from binge eating at the end of treatment. In terms of the reduction of eating disorder psychopathology and depressive symptoms , medium effects emerged (ES = 0.52 and 0.67, respectively). A small effect was found with regard to the reduction of BMI (ES = 0.29). With regard to follow -up, relatively stable effects were found for psychotherapy up to 6 - to 12 - month follow -up after the end of therapy. For instance, in the pre -follow -up comparison, large effects emerged for the reduction of the number of binge -eating episode s (ES = 0.84), eating disorder psychopathology (ES = 0.85) and depressive symptoms (ES = 0.73) and a small effect regarding the reduction of BMI (ES = 0.27). The follow -up evaluations were based on four to ten study arms with 159 to 540 persons. A moderator analysis on the comparison of the efficacy of specific psychotherapy forms was not possible due to a lack of data on for ms of therapy other than CBT. However, if specific therapy forms were additionally meta -analytically evaluated or evaluated on an individual study basis regarding their effect on eating disorder symptoms, randomized controlled trials showed a large effect size regarding the reduction of binge -eating episode s for CBT in comparison with untreated control groups (ES = 1.22; 5 study arms, 285 persons) and an 11 -fold greater likelihood of being abstinent from binge eating at the end of treatment (6 study arms, 326 persons). When considering the randomized controlled trials by Wilfley et al. (2002) and Wilson et al. (2010) for IPT, a large pre -post effect emerged with regard to the reduction of days with binge eating (ES = 1.89; 156 persons) and an abstinence ra te of 70% (155 persons) with an average or small confidence interval. In terms of study quality, both studies showed an unclear risk of bias. For psychodynamic therapy, three studies with a high risk of bias were available. The randomized controlled tria l by Tasca et al. (2006) and the uncontrolled study by Tasca et al. (2013) showed large pre -post effects with regard to the reduction of days with binge eating (ES = 1.29, 150 persons) and abstinence rates of 33% (139 persons). The confidence intervals lay in the small (Tasca et al., 2013) to medium range (Tasca et al., 2006). The pooled abstinence rate was below -average, which was predominantly attributable to the randomized controlled 345 trial by Tasca et al. (2013), which reported an abstinence rate of 15%, The non -randomized controlled study by Ciano, Rocco, Angarano, Biasin a nd Balestrieri (2002) reported a remission of BED in 83% of the six treated persons post -treatment, and a total of 67% of the treated persons no longer showed an eating disorder. For humanistic therapy, one randomized controlled trial was available, which employed this therapy as an active control condition (Safer, Robinson & Jo, 2010). In the pre -post comparison, with a small to medium confidence interval, a below -average abstinence r ate of 33% (51 persons) was found. The study had an unclear risk of bias. These results broadly correspond to those of the previous meta -analysis by Vocks et al. (2010). In line with the classification of evidence levels according to the Oxford Centre of Evidence Based Medicine ( Phillips et al., 1998 -2009 ), psychotherapy in general as well as CBT in particular are assigned with evidence level Ia. IPT, with two randomized controlled trials with a small confidence interval and an unclear risk of bias, is ass igned with evidence level Ib. With one randomized controlled trial with a medium confidence interval and a high risk of bias, psychodynamic therapy is assigned with evidence level IIb; humanistic therapy, with one randomized controlled trial with a small t o medium confidence interval and an unclear risk of bias, and which was solely evaluated as an active control group, is assigned with evidence level IIb. 2.2.2. Structured manualized self -help treatment The current meta -analysi s (Hilbert et al., 2019, in press ) on the efficacy of structured, manualized self -help treatment included 15 study conditions with 453 persons, of which eight were guided structured self -help treatments and seven were non -guided but structured self -help treatments . In five treatment conditions, group treatments were conducted and in 10 conditions individual treatments were conducted. The majority of the employed structured self -help programs had a CBT orientation (7 of 8 of the guided and 5 of 7 of the non -guided treatments). With reg ard to study quality, self -help studies predominantly showed a low or unclear risk of bias. For the most part, the contents of the structured self -help treatment broadly corresponded to those of CBT. Generally, the patients receive respective work materia ls (e. g. in book form), which contain information on BED as well as the individual therapeutic steps for overcoming binge eating presented in a manualized form. Thus, it should be noted that the self -help interventions entered into the analysis are based o n scientifically evaluated psychotherapeutic interventions and were professionally transferred into this treatment format. By contrast, they do not contain any unstructured measures or measures that are not based on psychotherapeutic evidence. In total, twelve treatment conditions with 397 persons were evaluated in randomized controlled trials. In the meta -analytic evaluation of these randomized controlled trials, a small effect for 346 the number of binge -eating episode s emerged for structured self -help treatment compared to untreated control conditions at the end of treatment (ES = 0.47). Compared to the persons in untreated control conditions, those receiving structured self -help treatment had an 8 -fold increased likelihood of being abstinent from binge eating at the end of treatment. The effect on eating disorder psychopathology was small (ES = 0.33), while effects on depressive symptoms (ES = 0.25) and reduction of BMI (ES = 0.05) were not found. Consistent results were found when considering onl y self -help programs based on CBT, likewise with a predominantly low study quality, for example, a small effect on the number of binge -eating episode s (ES = 0.45; 5 treatment conditions, 318 persons) and an 8 -fold increased likelihood of achieving abstinen ce from binge eating at the end of treatment (5 treatment conditions, 342 persons). In the uncontrolled pre -post comparison, a large effect emerged for the reduction of binge - eating episode s (ES = 0.91). After the end of the structured self -help treatment , 45% of the affected persons achieved an abstinence from binge eating . Like psychotherapy, structured self - help treatment showed a medium effect on the reduction of eating disorder psychopathology (ES = 0.58), but a small effect on depressive symptoms (ES = 0.34). This treatment approach did not have a significant effect on the reduction of BMI (ES = 0.07). Consistent results were found when considering only self -help programs based on CBT, for example, a large effect on the number of binge -eating episode s (ES = 0.89; 10 treatment conditions, 333 persons) and an abstinence rate of 47% at the end of treatment (11 treatment conditions, 408 persons). With regard to follow -up, relatively stable effects were found for structured self -help treatment up to the 6 -month to 12 -month follow -up after the end of treatment. For instance, in the pre - follow -up comparison, medium effects were found on the reduction of binge -eating episode s (ES = 0.65) and eating disorder psychopathology (ES = 0.68). Depressive symptoms were reduced with a small effect (ES = 0.25). By contrast, no significant effect on BMI emerged (ES = 0.11). Each of the follow -up evaluations was based on three to four study arms (89 to 146 persons). A comparison of guided versus non -guided self -help treatm ent showed that in the pre -post comparison, the two forms of structured self -help did not significantly differ from one another regarding the number of binge -eating episodes and the abstinence from binge eating . These analyses were based on eight and nine study arms with 251 and 317 persons, respectively. Therefore, in line with the classification of evidence levels according to the Oxford Centre of Evidence Based Medicine ( Phillips et al., 1998 -2009 ), the psychotherapeutic intervention using structured self -help manuals in general, and specifically when based on CBT, can be classified as efficacious with regard to the reduction of binge eating (evidence level Ia). Structured, manualize d self -help treatment is found to be less efficacious than psychotherapy. Compared to the previous meta -analysis (Vocks et al., 2010), the efficacy of structured, manualized self- help treatment in the present meta -analysis, with a larger evidence base, is lower . 347 2.2.3. Pharmacotherapy Regarding the efficacy of p harmacotherapy, the current meta -analysis (Hilbert et al., 2019, in press ) included 37 study conditions with 1 ,443 persons . The examined psychotropic medications were second -generation antidepressants (e.g. central topiramate) , and other pharm aceuticals. The average duration of the medication amounted to 14 \u00b1 6 weeks with a range from 6 to 24 weeks. With regard to study quality, the pharmacotherapy studies predominantly sh owed a low or unclear risk of bias. In total, 29 treatment conditions with 1 ,310 persons were evaluated in randomized controlled trials. The meta -analytic evaluation of these studies yielded a small effect for the number of binge -eating episode s at the en d of treatment for pharmacotherapy in comparison to placebo (ES = 0.39). Compared to untreated control conditions , persons who had received pharmacotherapeutic treatment were twice as likely to be abstinent from binge eating at the end of treatment. An imp rovement in eating disorder psychopathology (ES = 0.04) and depressive symptoms (ES = 0.32) was not achieved. The effect on BMI was small (ES = 0.32). In the uncontrolled pre -post comparison, a large effect was fou nd for the reduction of binge eating (ES = 1.27). Overall, 45% of the treated persons were abstinent from binge eating at the end of treatment. Eating disorder psychopathology was reduced with a medium effect (ES = 0.52), as were depressive symptoms (ES = 0.58). BMI was reduced with a small effec t (ES = 0.44). When only considering the randomized controlled trials, a moderator analysis on the core symptoms of BED showed that pharmacotherapy was inferior to psychotherapy with respect to the abstinence from binge eating at posttreatment in the comparison with untreated control conditions. When compared to placebo , the type of medication had a significant effect on the abstinence from binge eating : For instance, for persons who had been treated with central nervous system stimulants compared to those who had received placebo, the likelihood of being abstinent from binge eating at the end of treatment was significantly greater than for persons who had been treated with second -generation antidepressants. If in addition to randomized controlled tria ls non-randomized controlled studies and uncontrolled studies were included for a pre -post comparison, it was apparent that anticonvulsant s achieved significantly higher rates of abstinence from binge eating than did second -generation antidepressants, stim ulants and other medications. When the effects of individual classes of pharmaceuticals were each meta -analytically determined, in the pre -post comparison of randomized controlled trials, central nervous system stimulants showed a greater reduction of binge-eating episode s than placebo, with a medium effect (ES = 0.54; 2 study arms, 174 persons), and a 3 -fold higher likelihood of being abstinent from binge eating at the end of treatment compared to placebo (5 study arms, 946 persons). By 348 contrast, second -generation antidepressants yielded a small effect in the reduction of binge - eating episode s (ES = 0.37, 8 study arms, 347 persons), and double the likelihood of abstinence from binge eating (10 study arms, 466 persons). Anticonvulsant drugs brought about an almost 3-fold increased likelihood of abstinence from binge eating (3 study arms, 502 persons). Overall, it is evident that although pharmacotherapy proved to be more efficacious than placebo, the efficacy with regard to the core symptoms of BED lay only slightly above that of a placebo medication. By contrast, in terms of amount, the effect of untreated control conditions in studies on psychotherapy or on structured, manualized s elf-help was larger. Due to a lack of follow -up data, it was not possible to document long -term effects of pharmacotherapy. With regard to side effects, the likelihood of various complaints (e.g. increased sympathetic arousal, gastrointestinal problems, sl eep disturbances, headache) was twice as high compared to placebo. The likelihood of terminating the treatment due to side effects of pharmacotherapy was double that for placebo. In Germany, no medication is currently approved for the treatment of BED. In line with the classification of evidence levels according to the Oxford Centre of Evidence Based Medicine (Phillips et al., 1998 -2009 ), pharmacotherapy can be rated as efficacious in the short term for the reduction of binge -eating episode s (evidence leve l Ia). This applies to central nervous system stimulants - primarily lisdexamfetamine has been examined in this regard - as well as second -generation antidepressants and anticonvulsant s, with the former showing a higher efficacy than the other examined cla sses of pharmaceuticals. Evidence on the long -term efficacy and also on long -term administration is not available; the likelihood of side effects was twice as high compared to that of placebo. The efficacy of the examined pharmaceutical s was only marginall y higher than that of placebo. Pharmacotherapy was less efficacious for the treatment of eating disorder symptoms compared to psychotherapy. Overall, these results suggest the use of pharmacotherapy if psychotherapy is not desired or not effective . Compare d to the previous meta -analysis on this topic (Vocks et al., 2010), the efficacy of pharmacotherapy has slightly reduced in several outcomes. 2.2.4. Weight loss treatment In the meta -analysis (Hilbert et al., 2019, in press ), weight loss treatments were categorized into behavioral , pharmacological and surgical interventions. Details on the indication and implementation of these forms of weight loss treatment in obesity can be found in the S3 guideline Diagnosis and Preventio n of Obesity (DAG, 2014). 2.2.4.1. Behavioral weight loss treatment Behavioral weight loss treatment for obesity usually has a multimodal orientation and aims to change nutrition, physical activity and behavior such that a weight loss occurs through a nega tive energy balance (DAG, 2014). In the current meta -analysis (Hilbert et al., 2019, in press ), a total of nine active study arms were included, encompassing 391 persons. Six of these 349 nine study arms contained a com bination of interventions on nutrition, physical activity and behavior. The remaining three study arms solely contained interventions on nutrition, on physical activity , or a combination of the two. With regard to study quality, the studies on behavioral weight loss treatment predominantly showed a high risk of bias; none of the studies had a low risk of bias. While for behavioral weight loss treatment, seven study arms with 277 persons in randomized controlled trials with active control conditions were available, there were no randomized control led trials with untreated control conditions. In uncontrolled pre -post comparisons, a large effect was apparent for behavioral weight loss treatment with respect to the reduction of binge - eating episode s (ES = 0.90). At the end of treatment, an abstinence rate of 48% was achieved. The reduction of eating disorder psychopathology was in the small range (ES = 0.24), while depressive symptoms were reduced with a medium effect (ES = 0.63). BMI was reduced with a large effect (ES = 1.55). Within behavioral weigh t loss treatment, multimodal programs containing interventions on nutrition, physical activity and behavior showed virtually identical results in the uncontrolled pre -post comparison ( binge -eating episode s: ES = study arms, 167 persons; abstinence rate: 47% , 5 study arms, 159 persons). A non -randomized controlled trial with a high risk of bias was available for dietary counseling (Compare, Calugi, Marchesini, Molinari & Dalle Grave, 2013) and showed a below -average abstinence rate of 29% at the end of treatment (63 persons). Furthermore, there was one randomized controlled trial with a high risk of bias, which focused exclusively on increasing physical activity ( Levine, Marcus & Moulton, 1996). This study revealed an abstinence rate of 81% at the end of treatment (44 persons). At follow -up, overall, behavioral weight loss programs show ed relatively stable effects up to the 6 - to 12 -month follow -up posttreatment. In the pre -follow -up comparison, large effects were observed with regard to re duction of binge eating (ES = 1.24) and depressive symptoms (ES = 0.94) as well as a medium effect regarding eating disorder psychopathology (ES = 0.77). However, no significant effect was found with regard to the reduction of BMI (ES = 0.55). Of note, the follow -up evaluations were each based on only two to three study arms (52 to 114 persons). In line with the classification of evidence levels according to the Oxford Centre of Evidence Based Medicine ( Phillips et al., 1998 -2009 ), based on the available randomized c ontrolled trials with an active control group, behavioral weight loss treatment can therefore be assigned with evidence level Ia. This applies equally for programs of behavioral weight loss treatment which combined interventions on nutrition, physical activity and behavior. However, it was not possible to determine the efficacy compared to an untreated control group, and it was also not possible to conclusively evaluate the long -term efficacy for BED. In comparison to Vocks et al. (2010), the efficacy o f behavioral weight loss treatment was partially improved in the current meta -analysis. Dietary counse ling, evaluated in a non -randomized controlled trial with a high risk of bias, with a below -average effect on binge eating symptoms, is assigned with evid ence level IIc. For an exercise program which was evaluated in one randomized controlled trial with 350 a high risk of bias, showing potential efficacy for binge eating symptoms, evidence level IIb is assigned. Overall, these results suggest that behavioral weight loss treatment should be employed as a subordinate treatment following psychotherapy. In this regard, there is further evidence that an abstinence from binge eating through psychotherapy improves the long -term maintenance of weight loss achieved thro ugh behavioral weight loss treatment (Agras et al., 1997). Thus, behavioral weight loss treatment might be beneficial in terms of an improved weight loss outcome following psychotherapy. 2.2.4.2. Pharmacological weight loss treatment In terms of pharmacol ogical weight loss treatment, which can be offered as an adjunct to behavioral weight loss treatment for obesity (DAG, 2014), six study arms were identified, comprising 242 persons (sibutramine: 5 treatment arms, d -fenfluramine: 1 treatment arm). The exami ned medications are currently not approved for the treatment of BED, or their approvals were withdrawn due to cardiovascular side effects. With regard to study quality, the studies on pharmacological weight loss treatment predominantly showed a high risk o f bias. For these medications for pharmacological weight loss treatment, randomized controlled trials revealed small effects in the comparison of pre -post values from the respective intervention group and untreated control group regarding the re duction of binge eating (ES = 0.47). Persons who had received pharmacological weight loss treatment were twice as likely to be abstinent from binge eating at the end of therapy. There were no significant effects on eating disorder psychopathology (ES = 0.46) or depressive symptoms (ES = 0.34). BMI reduced to a small degree (ES = 0.38) A moderator analysis on the core symptoms of BED showed, when solely considering the randomized controlled trials, that pharmacological weight loss treatment was inferior to psychother apy with respect to abstinence from binge eating at the end of treatment in the comparison with untreated control conditions. In uncontrolled pre -post comparisons, large effects were found for pharmacological weight loss treatment with regard to the reduction of binge eating (ES = 1.34) and eating disorder psychopathology (ES = 0.86) and a medium effect with regard to the reduction of depressive symptoms (ES = 0.75). Overall, 56% of the treated persons were abstinent from binge eating at the end of treatme nt. Weight loss lay in a medium range (ES = 0.56). No follow -up data documenting the longer -term efficacy of pharmacological weight loss treatment three months posttreatment or later were available. In line with the classification of evidence levels according to the Oxford Centre of Evidence Based Medicine ( Phillips et al., 1998 -2009 ), pharmacological weight loss treatment is therefore assigned with evidence level Ia. However, the evaluated medications sibutramine and d -351 fenfluramine are not approved for the treatment of BED, and due to their cardiovascular risk profile, they are no longer marketed for obesity. The efficacy for eating disorder symptoms turned out to be lower than that of psychotherapy. Data on the long -term efficacy are not available. 2.2.4.3. Surgical weight loss treatment The category of surgical weight loss treatment or bariatric surgery, which is used to treat severe obesity (DAG, 2014) , comprised four study arms with a total of 117 perso ns. The operative procedures examined were R oux-en-Y gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, biliopancr eatic diversion , and adjustable gastric band. Only non -randomized controlled and uncontrolled designs were used. With regard to study quality, the studies on surgical weight loss treatment all showed a high risk of bias. In uncontrolled pre -post comparisons, 79% of persons treated with obesity surgery were remitted from BED, but no effects were found regarding eating disorder psychopathology (ES = 0.05). BMI was reduced with a large effect (ES = 2.95). Follow -up data for the documentation of the longer -term effectiveness of surgical weight loss treatment three months or more post - operation were not available for BED. In line with the classification of evidence levels according to the Oxford Centre of E vidence Based Medicine ( Phillips et al., 1998 -2009 ), surgical weight loss treatment can therefore be assigned with evidence level IIc. The long -term effectiveness for BED cannot be evaluated. All included studies had a high risk of bias. 2.2.5. Combination treatment The meta -analysis by Hilbert et al. ( 2019, in press ) on the efficacy of combination treatment comprised 34 study conditions, which combined CBT with behavioral weight loss treatment (10 study arms), with pharmacological treatment (5 study arms) , or with both treatments (5 study arms). A further five study arms contained behavioral weight loss treatment with pharmacological treatment, and nine study arms comprised other combination treatments. In 14 of the treatment conditions, group therapies we re conducted; in 15 of the conditions, individual therapies ; and in five treatments , group plus individual therapy were conducted . With regard to study quality, the studies on combination treatment predominantly showed a high risk of bias. In randomized controlled trials, a total of 30 study arms with 934 persons was available. In the evaluation of the randomized controlled trials, at the post treatment t ime point, a small effect for the number of binge -eating episode s for the combination tre atments compared to untreated control conditions emerged (ES = 0.33). A significant effect regarding the abstinence from binge eating, however, was not found (odds ratio = 2), and likewise, eating disorder 352 psychopathology did not significantly improve (ES = 0.03). Small to medium effects on depressive symptoms (ES = 0.34) and body weight (ES = 0.54) were identified. A moderator analysis on the core symptoms of BED, when solely considering the randomized controlled trials, showed that combination treatment was inferior to psychotherapy with regard to abstinence from binge eating at the end of treatment in comparison with untreated control conditions. In randomized controlled trials, it was not possible to conduct a moderator analysis or separate evaluation o n subcategories of combination treatments due to a lack of data . In the uncontrolled pre -post comparison, a large effect size emerged for the reduction of the number of binge -eating episode s (ES = 1.64). The effect of combination treatments on the reducti on of eating disorder psychopathology lay in the medium range (ES = 0.52), as did the effect on depressive symptoms (ES = 0.78). The reduction in BMI showed a large effect size (ES = 0.95) When additional analyses were conducted to separately evaluate sub categories of combination treatments regarding eating disorder symptoms in the uncontrolled pre -post comparison (a moderator analysis was not possible here due to a lack of data), at treatment end, a large effect on the reduction of binge eating was found for CBT in combination with pharmacothe rapy (ES = 1.71; 5 study arms, 113 persons) and an abstinence from binge eating in 71% of persons (2 studies arms, 54 persons). For CBT in combination with behavioral weight loss treatment, a large effect emerged on t he reduction of binge eating at the end of treatment (ES = 1.19 ; 3 study arms, 94 persons) and an abstinence rate of 50% (7 study arms, 195 persons). For the triple combination of CBT plus behavioral weight loss treatment plus pharmacological treatment, a medium -sized effect on the reduction of binge -eating episode s in a small sample was found (ES = 0.54 ; 2 study arms, 20 persons), and for the combination treatment comprising behavioral weight loss and pharmacological treatment, a large effect on the reduct ion of binge eating at posttreatment was shown (ES = 1.83 ; 2 study arms, 54 persons). Due to the small samples, it is not possible to clearly derive differences in efficacy among various forms of combination treatments. With regard to follow -up, overall, relatively stable e ffects up to 6 - to 12 -month follow -up after treatment end emerged for combination treatment. For instance, the pre -follow -up comparison showed a reduction of binge -eating episode s (ES = 1.03) and eating disorder psychopathology (ES = 1.0 4) with a large effect. Depressive symptoms improved with a medium effect size (ES = 0.7) and BMI was reduced with a small effect size (ES = 0.28). The follow -up evaluations were each based on five to six study arms (114 to 134 persons). In line with the classification of evidence levels according to the Oxford Centre of Evidence Based Medicine ( Phillips et al., 1998 -2009 ), combination treatments were therefore assigned with evidence level Ia. For the treatment of binge -eating symptoms, they were less effective than psychotherapy. Within the combination treatments, no firm conclusions can be drawn about differences among various treatments. 353 2.2.6. Inpatient treatment The meta -analysis by Hilbert et al. ( 2019, in press ) was comprised of eight study conditions with 239 persons which were conducted in an inpatient setting, six of them with a multimodal therapy for BED and for weight loss , and two with a multimodal weight loss treatment. Two of the treatment conditions were conducted exclusively as group therapies and six treatment conditions compr ised both group and individual therapies. All included studies on inpatient treatment showed a high risk of bias. Although six study conditions with 117 persons in randomized controlled inpatient trials were identified that contained active control conditions, no data were available for the comparison with untreated control conditions. In untreated pre -post comparison s, it emerged, albeit on the basis of data from only three study arms of one randomized controlled trial with low methodological quality, that 95% of persons achieved abstinence from binge eating, which was substantially greater than the abstinence rate in all other therapy forms. By contrast, the effect of inpatient treatment on the reduction of eating disorder psychopathology was small (ES = 0.26), whil e a large effect was achieved for the reduction of BMI (ES = 1.09). With regard to follow -up, for inpat ient treatment , in the pre -follow -up comparison three to six months after the end of therapy, an abstinence rate of 44% emerged. A reduction of BMI was achieved at 6 - to 12 -month follow -up with a large effect size (ES = 0.95). The follow -up evaluations wer e based on three to four study arms (44 to 81 persons). In line with the classification of evidence levels according to the Oxford Centre of Evidence Based Medicine ( Phillips et al., 1998 -2009 ), inpatient therapies, with a high risk of bias, were thus ass igned with evidence level IIb. 2.2.7. Considerations for children and adolescents In the meta -analysis by Hilbert et al. ( 2019, in press ), it was not possible to include any study on the treatment of BED in children and adolescents. Recommendations In the diagnosis of overweight and obesity, assessment of binge -eating episode s as an important symptom of BED should be considered (GCP). As the first -line eating disorder treatment , psychotherapy should be offered to patients with BED (Ia, A). CBT shows the most comprehensive evidence in adult patients with BED; therefore, CBT should be offered to these patients (Ia, A). There is evidence that IPT is likewise efficacious ; therefore it should be recommended as an alternative (Ib, B). However, IPT is not an approved psycho therapy in Germany. 354 There is limited evidence that psychodynamic therapy can be efficacious ; therefore it may be considered for patients with BED (IIb, 0). There is limited evidence that humanistic therapy can be efficacious ; ther efore it may be considered for patients with BED (IIb, 0). However, humanistic therapy is not an approved psychotherapy in Germany. For structured, manualized self -help treatment , especially with treatment components of CBT, there is evidence of efficacy; therefore, it should be recommended for patients with BED (Ia, B). Currently, no medication is approved for the treatment of BED. Pharmacotherapy with central nervous system stimulants (especially lisdexamfetamine), second -generation antidepressants , and anticonvulsants are efficacious, but lead to side effects. Therefore, they can only be considered for patients with BED if psychotherapy is refused or unsuccessful (Ia, 0). Long -term effects of pharmacotherapy have not been researched. Therefore, no recomm endation for a long -term prescription of pharmacotherapy can be made. For behavioral weight loss treatment, especially multimodal programs consisting of a combination of interventions for nutrition, physical activity and behavior, there is evidence of shor t-term efficacy; therefore, it may be recommended for patients with BED and comorbid obesity (Ia, 0). Long -term effects of behavioral weight loss treatment on BED have not been sufficiently researched. For simultaneous combination treatments of psychotherapy and/or behavioral weight loss treatment with or without pharmacological treatment, there is evidence of efficacy in BED. However, an additional benefit compared to monotherapies has not been proven. Combination treatments may be considered for patients with BED in individual cases when monotherapies are not sufficient (Ia, 0). There is limited evidence for the efficacy of inpatient treatments. They may be consider ed for patients with BED when outpati ent treatments are not sufficient (IIb, 0). The following criteria suggest inpatient treatment (GCP): o Pronounced somatic comorbidity o Pronounced psychological comorbid ity o High disorder severity o Patient factors that impede therapy (e.g. , a body weight that does not permit outpatient treatment) o Necessity for treatment by a multiprofessional tea m with hospital -typical treatment methods (inpatient psychiatric/psychosomatic treatment) o Social or family factors which strongly hinder the recover y process (e.g. , social isolation, problematic family situation, insufficient social support). For children and adolescents with BED, a psychotherapy which includes direct caregivers (generally the parents) is recommended (GCP). 355 Literature Agras, W. S., Telch, C.

Internationale Klassifikation psychischer 365 Method report Binge -Eating Disorder Literature search and selection Due to increased methodological requirements for meta -analyses, including documentation of the systematic search and of an assessment of risk of bias, a new literature search was conducted for BED. In addition to determining the efficacy after the end of treatment, as in the previous meta -analysis by Vocks et al. (2010), which was based on the first version of the S3 guideline (AWMF, 2011), the aim was to examine the long -term sustainability of treatment effects. The study protocol for the meta -analysis was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) (CRD42016043604) and published (Hilbert et al., 2017). Compared to the meta -analysis by Vocks et al. (2010), the search was conducted using broader search terms in a larger number of e lectronic databases and study registers, supplemented by a manual search in all reference lists of the included and identified reviews as well as in the International Journal of Eating Disorders. The literature search was conducted up to February 201717, separately by two psychologists. In the case of discrepancies, agreement was reached by consensus. The inclusion criteria were broadly congruent, although somewhat stricter in part. Included were: (1) psychological and medical treatment studies, which (2) were conducted in persons diagnosed, before the start of treatment, with BED according to the DSM -IV (APA, 1994) or DSM -5 (including BED with limited frequency and/or limited duration; APA, 2013), (3) used a randomized controlled, non -randomized controlle d, or uncontrolled design, (4) assessed the core symptoms of BED (binge eating days or episodes, abstinence from binge eating and/or diagnosis of BED), (5) provided sufficient data at baseline and for at least one post - or follow - up time point in order to calculate effect sizes (e.g. M, SD and/or n, %), (6) reported separate data for patients with BED in studies with multiple patient groups, and (7) were published in English. Excluded were: (1) unpublished studies, (2) dual publications of the same study, a nd (3) case studies and studies with a sample size of n < 10. The selection of studies occurred in two steps: In the first step, two psychologists separately screened all titles and abstracts regarding their fit with the inclusion criteria. Based on autom atic and manual screening, duplicates were identified and removed. If it was unclear whether inclusion criteria were fulfilled, full texts were viewed. In the second step, all articles which fulfilled the inclusion criteria were checked by two psychologist s for inclusion or exclusion based on the full text. If several articles in the framework of one study were found, they were aggregated and formed one analytical unit. Of the 21,590 identified studies, 10,613 studies remained after removal of duplicates a nd 506 after screening of title and abstract. Of these studies, a total of 103 studies were included in the 17 A renewed and extended search and meta -analysis was conducted for Hilbert e t al. (2019, in press). 366 meta -analysis after full -text screening. These 103 studies contained a total of 208 study arms. Of these, 160 were active treatment conditions and 4 8 were inactive control conditions . Evaluation of scientific evidence (evidence base) In the next step, information from the 103 identified studies which was relevant for the meta - analysis was independently extracted by two psychologists. For this purpo se, a standardized coding scheme with the corresponding coding handbook was used (Vocks et al., 2010), which was updated and expanded. In this, the Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias Tool (Higgins & Green, 2011) and the Effective Practice and Organizati on of Care (EPOC) Risk of Bias Tool (EPOC) were also used in order to assess the risk of bias in randomized controlled and non - randomized controlled studies, under consideration of the Risk of Bias in Non -randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS -I; Ster ne et al., 2016) for the assessment of risk of bias in uncontrolled studies. The inter -rater reliability, which was determined for the primary outcome variables, was almost perfect, with a 99% agreement between the raters. The primary outcomes comprised the amount of binge eating (episodes or days), the abstinence from binge eating, and the diagnosis of BED; the secondary outcomes were eating disorder psychopathology, depressive symptoms , quality of life, body mass index (kg/m2), body weight, side effects and dropout. The meta -analytic evaluation was conducted using random -effects models. In this regard, in between -group analyses in randomized controlled trials, the pre -post effects in active treatment conditions were compared with the effects in inactive control conditions within each treatment form (psychotherapy, structured self -help treatment, pharmacotherapy etc.). Additionally, in within -group analyses, pre -post effects (or pre -follow -up effects) were determined in active treatment conditions of rand omized controlled, non -randomized controlled and non -controlled studies. The effects were pooled as Hedges' g, odds ratios and rates. Analogously to Cohen's d, a Hedges' g is seen as small with an effect size < 0.20 , medium with an effect size > 0.50 and l arge with an effect size > 0.80. To determine moderator effects, meta -regression analyses between and within individual treatment forms were conducted (e.g. , guided vs. non -guided self-help treatment, individual pharmaceuticals). Additionally, on the basi s of the studies included in the meta -analysis, an additional meta - analytic assessment was conducted for individual therapies or subforms, if they could not be considered in the moderator analyses but were nevertheless seen as relevant for the guidelines. Moreover, in the case of randomized controlled trials with an active control group, an individual study evaluation was carried out if a higher valuation was to be expected. Appendix Systematic literature search The literature search was conducted in 367 (1) Electronic datab ases (MEDLINE, PubMED, PsycINFO, EMBASE, PUBPSYCH, Science, DARE, ANNUAL REVIEWS , NIHR Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, CDSR, Clinical Psychology Review), (2) Study registers (PROSPERO, CENTRAL, International C linical Trials Registry Platform, ClincalTrials.gov, EU Clinical Trials Register, ISRCTN Trial Registry, German Clinical Trials Register) and (3) Through a manual search in all reference lists of the included and identified reviews as well as in the Internati onal Journal of Eating Disorders from 1990 to February 2017.

Atypical eating disorders and eating disorders not otherwise specified Astrid M\u00fcller, Andrea Hartmann & Martina de Zwaan The atypical eating disorders and eating disorders not otherwise specified (EDNOS) include conditions which do not completely fulfil l the criteria for a classical eating disorder (AN, BN, BED) but nevertheless show a clear fixation on weight and shape which poses a burden to sufferers, as well as long -term difficulties in dealing with foods and eating. Epidemiological investigations on the basis of the diagnostic criteria of the ICD -10 (WHO, 1992) or DSM -IV (APA, 2000) regularly found that with consistent use of these criteria, a clear majority of disorders of therapy -seeking patients with eating disorder symptoms had to be classified as atypical or as EDNOS (Fairburn & Cooper, 2007). The revisions in the DSM -5 (APA, 2013) have changed less in this regard than was originally expected (Machado, Goncalves, & Hoek, 2013). Through the modification of the diagnostic criteria for AN and BN and the introduction of binge eating disorder (BED) as a third classical eating disorder (see guideline chapter BED), the original category of EDNOS was made substantially smaller, but nevertheless remains prevalent (Gualandi, Simoni, Manzato, & 2017). At the same time, the knowledge about atypical eating disorders and EDNOS is still limited. The division of atypical o r EDNOS is not handled consistently in the ICD -10 and DSM -5 (Table 10). The ICD -10 (WHO, 1992) lists atypical AN (F50.1), atypical BN (F50.3), as well as other eating disorders (F50.8) and eating disorders, unspecified (F50.9). These categories are not described in further detail and examiners are asked to formulate their own criteria. In the DSM - 5 (APA, 2013), by contrast, there are the residual categories \"Other specified feeding or eating disorder\" (OSFED) and \"Unspecified feeding or eating disorder\". Wh ile the latter is not further specified as regards content, the category \"Other specified feeding or eating disorder\" now mentions atypical AN, BN of low frequency and/or of limited duration and BED of low frequency and/or of limited duration. These three disorders show the same typical symptom patterns as the classical eating disorders AN, BN and BED (see guideline chapters AN, BN and BED), but not all diagnostic criteria are completely fulfilled (e.g. with regard to weight, frequency and duration of eatin g episodes or compensatory, weight -regulating measures). Moreover, the category \"Other specified feeding or eating disorder\" also includes night eating syndrome (NES) and purging disorder with diagnostic criteria. It should be noted that the category \"Feeding and Eating Disorders\" of the DSM -5 (APA, 2013), besides the classical eating disorders AN, BN, and BED, additionally also includes pica, rumination disorder and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID). According to the ICD-11 Beta Draft, the official draft for the new 11th version of the ICD 369 (https://icd.who.int/dev11 ; October 2017), the categorization of eating disorders in the future ICD-11 will be partially oriented to the DSM -5. For instance, the future category \"Feeding or Eating Disorders\" will include, besides AN and BN, also BED, as well as ARFID, pica and rumination disorder as eating disorder categories in their own right. Moreover, the categories \"Other specified Feeding or Eating Disord ers\" and \"Feeding or Eating Disorders, unspecified\" are also planned. In the following, the state of research on the treatment of persons with subsyndromal eating disorders or EDNOS according to the DSM -IV (APA, 2000) will be briefly summarized. Further on , this guideline chapter is then devoted in more detail, based on the DSM -5 (APA, 2013), to the \"Other specified feeding or eating disorders\" night eating syndrome and purging disorder. In the subsequent chapter, \"Further feeding and eating disorders liste d in the DSM - 5\", pica, rumination disorder and ARFID will be addressed separately. Each subchapter concludes with treatment recommendations which are oriented to the respective levels of evidence according to the Oxford Centre of Evidence Based Medicine (2001). The studies with evidence levels are summarized further below ( Tables 11, 14 -16). The strength of the treatment recommendation is divided into \"A\" (very strong recommendation), \"B\" (strong recommendation), \"O\" (weak recommendation) and \"GCP\" (good cl inical practice). 1. Subsyndromal eating disorders and Eating Disorders Not Otherwise Specified (EDNOS) Subsyndromal eating disorders are clinically relevant disorders which show many but not all of the typical symptom patterns of the classical eating dis orders AN, BN, and BED. In the DSM - 5 (APA, 2013), the subsyndromal eating disorders are characterized as follows: For atypical AN, all criteria of AN are fulfilled (see guideline chapter AN), only body weight lies within or above the normal range despite c onsiderable weight loss. For BN of low frequency and/or of limited duration, all criteria of BN are fulfilled (see guideline chapter BN), only the frequency and duration of eating episodes and the compensatory behaviors are lower (< once per week and/or <3 months). For BED of low frequency and/or limited duration, with the exception of the frequency and duration of eating episodes, which are rarer and shorter (< once per week and/or <3 months), all criteria for BED are fulfilled (see guideline chapter BED). In the literature, there are barely any treatment studies which included persons with subsyndromal eating disorders or which addressed these persons separately (Table 11). It is noteworthy that those treatments were generally internet -based prevention pro grams or interventions. In a randomized controlled trial, the efficacy of an internet -based prevention program \"Student BodiesTM\" - for women with symptoms of disordered eating and/or subthreshold eating disorder syndromes was reported (Jacobi, Volker, Tr ockel, & Taylor, 2012). The program consists of an internet -based, structured cognitive -behavioral concept with asynchronous, 370 moderated online groups. The participants were 126 women with very different subsyndromal eating disorders, who were allocated eit her to the active arm (n=64) or to the control group (n= 62). The efficacy was measured by means of pre/post comparisons and 6 -month follow -up using the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE -Q; Hilbert & Tuschen -Caffier, 2006) as the primary endpo int. The authors reported that women in the active arm showed a reduction in eating disorder symptoms (EDE -Q total) after participating in the program (baseline -post d=0.35; baseline -follow -up d=62) (Jacobi et al., 2012). Similarly, an earlier internet -based study with 60 female students at risk of developing an eating disorder showed that moderated chatroom sessions, as compared to a waitlist control condition, can contribute to a reduction in eating disorder symptoms and an improvement in self -esteem (Zabinski, Wilfley, Calfas, Winzelberg, & Taylor, 2004). Findings on internet -based interventions are also available in the area of EDNOS. For instance, web-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) with asynchronous online therapist contacts was compared to a waitlist condition (ter Huurne et al., 2015). The study included women with BN (n=44), BED (n=85) and EDNOS (n=85) (randomization stratified according to diagnosis). The iCBT showed a superior outcome to the waitlist condition and the participants in th e active arm reported fewer eating disorder symptoms than the control group. However, for EDNOS, no significant interaction effect of group by eating disorder symptoms emerged, which the authors attributed to the heterogeneity of this group (ter Huurne et al., 2015). An earlier randomized controlled trial compared the efficacy of iCBT and a waitlist control group in female students with BN (n=39) or EDNOS (n=37) (Sanchez -Ortiz et al., 2011). In the iCBT group, the students took part in a CBT online program, which also provided regular email support from eating disorder experts. For both disorders, iCBT was found to be superior, although the results were unfortunately not presented separately for BN vs. EDNOS (Sanchez - Ortiz et al., 2011). So-called loss -of-control eating occurs predominantly 2008). In the literature, there is one non -internet -based randomized controlled intervention study devoted to this prob lem. The project included 113 girls aged between 12 and 17 years (BMI 75th-97th percentile), who were allocated either to a modified version of interpersonal psychotherapy focusing on the prevention of overweight or to health education (Tanofsky -Kraff et a l., 2014). At the end of treatment, both therapy groups showed a reduction of loss -of-control eating. At the 12 -month follow -up, moreover, the modified interpersonal therapy was found to be superior to health education. By contrast, there were no differenc es between the intervention groups regarding weight course (significant weight gain in both groups) one or three years after the end of treatment (Tanofsky -Kraff et al., 2017). With respect to pharmacological treatments, to the best of our knowledge, there are no findings from randomized controlled trials with patients with atypical eating disorders or EDNOS. In one case report on treatment with lamotrigine (100 mg/d over 1.5 yea rs) in a 15 -year-old girl with a diagnosis of EDNOS, a reduction up to remission of eating disorder symptoms was 371 described (Trunko, Schwartz, Marzola, Klein, & Kaye, 2014). The patient was additionally also taking escitalopram (20 mg/d). Recommendations If, after preliminary examinations, there is continued suspicion of a subsyndromal eating disorder (atypical AN, atypical BN, atypical BED), conducting a systematic classification - based diagnosis is recommended using the current diagnostic criteria of the DSM and ICD, ideally with guidelines or validated diagnostic interviews (GCP; see guideline chapter \"Diagnosis\") Internet -based cognitive -behavioral prevention or therapy programs constitute the most researched intervention and appear to contribute to the reduction of eating disorder symptoms and/or the prevention of a full -blown version of the respective eating disorder (EL 2b) . If a subsyndromal eating disorder is present, proceeding with treatment analogously to the treatment for AN, BN or BED should be considered (GCP; see guideline chapters AN, BN, BED) 372 2. Night Eating Syndrome (NES)18 2.1. Symptoms and diagnostic criteria 2.1.1. Symptoms The following symptoms are characteristic for NES: a shift in the day/night rhythm regardi ng eating behavior, with evening/nighttime eating, lack of appetite in the mornings, disturbances in sleep onset and/or maintenance and possibly loss of control over food intake (Allison, Lundgren, O'Reardon, et al., 2010; de Zwaan, 2016; Stunkard, Grace, & Wolff, 1955). Typically, either evening eating (food intake after the evening meal) or nighttime eating (nocturnal awakening with food intake) or both are present. Large amounts of food are not consumed in either the evening or the nighttime episodes (in contrast to BED). Patients with NES consume a large proportion of their daily food intake in the late evening or at night. The definition of \"large proportion\" has strongly differed in previous studies on NES, ranging from 25% of the daily calorie amount (Allison, Lundgren, O'Reardon, et al., 2010) through 35% and up to 50% (Cleator, Abbott, Judd, Sutton, & Wilding, 2012; M\u00fchlhans, Olbrich, & de Zwaan, 2009). The DSM -5 criteria (APA. 2013) assume, rather vaguely, \"excessive food consumption after the eveni ng meal\". The information also varies with regard to determining the time until which the majority of daily calorie intake is \"normally\" consumed. In the effort to achieve clear diagnostic criteria, times between 6pm and 7pm are often suggested (Cleator et al., 2012; M\u00fchlhans et al., 2009). However, Adami, Meneghelli and Scopinaro pointed out as early as 1997 that clear cultural differences can be found in the daily eating rhythm. In Southern countries, an evening meal after 8pm as well as a very small brea kfast are not unusual and are not suggestive of disordered eating behavior. Therefore, the criterion \"after the evening meal\" has prevailed, in order to adapt as far as possible to differing cultural norms as well as personal (often also influenced by exte rnal conditions such as work times) habits. In several studies, a close relation between NES with evening food intake and so -called nocturnal eating (nocturnal awakening with food intake) has been found. Many patients describe anxiety before nighttime eating and consequently also anxiety before falling asleep (Allison, 2012). Although the consumed amount of food is not large, patients with NES frequently mention a feeling of limited control over evening and specifically nighttime food consumption (Cleator e t al., 2012; Royal, Wnuk, Warwick, Hawa, & Sockalingam, 2015). In particular, the thought of \"having to eat to be able to fall (back) asleep\" is seen as a typical symptom of NES (Vinai et al., 2014). Moreover, the symptoms also include disturbances in slee p onset and/or maintenance, although this does not necessarily have to be linked to food consumption, and lack of appetite in the 18 With permission from the Thieme Verlag, several paragraphs have been taken directly, or slightly modified, from the review article: de Zwaan, M. (2016). Das Night -Eating -Syndrom. PSYCH up2date, 10, 479 -490. 373 mornings. The latter was defined by Stunkard et al. (1995) as \"lack of appetite in the morning, in which no breakfast is consu med (apart from coffee or orange juice)\". As the formulation \"lack of appetite in the morning\" represents the patient's subjective evaluation, nowadays, a complete skipping of breakfast is required as a diagnostic criterion for NES (Allison, Lundgren, O'Re ardon, et al., 2010). Since the first description of NES by Albert Stunkard and colleagues (1955), various diagnostic criteria for the disorder have been postulated (Cleator et al., 2012; M\u00fchlhans et al., 2009). Table 12 lists the diagnostic criteria sugge sted in 2010 by Allison, Lundgren, O'Reardon, et al. 2.1.2. Diagnostic criteria according to ICD -10 and DSM -5 While NES is not listed in the ICD -10 (WHO, 2000), diagnostic criteria for the disorder were listed for the first time in the DSM -5 (APA, 2013), in the category \"Other specified feeding or eating disorder\" (Table 13). The DSM -5 criteria remain rather superficial and are less detailed than the research criteria suggested by Allison et al. (2010). For instance, frequencies or levels of severity are n ot defined and associated symptoms such as lack of appetite in the morning or sleep disturbances are not taken into account. 2.2. Comorbidity Patients with NES have a higher prevalence of psychiatric lifetime diagnoses. This applies to affective disorder s, anxiety disorders and substance -related disorders (Faulconbridge & Bechtel, 2014) but also psychotic disorders (Palmese et al., 2013). On the other hand, NES is found more frequently in patients in the psychiatric outpatient or inpatient setting than wo uld be expected in the general population (Kucukgoncu, Tek, Bestepe, Musket, & Guloksuz, 2014). NES occurs particularly in times of increased stress (Vander Wal, 2012). Based on the current state of knowledge, moreover, a close relation between NES and overweight/obesity is assumed (Gallant, Lundgren, & Drapeau, 2012). The prevalence of NES in persons with obesity lies between 6 and 16%, with the frequency of NES rising w ith increasing weight (Colles, Dixon, & O'Brien, 2007). Higher prevalences are also found in therapy -seeking than in non -therapy -seeking persons 2012). Furth ermore, cross - sectional studies indicate that persons with diabetes mellitus type 2 show a higher prevalence of NES. There are several studies on the occurrence of NE or NES in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 (Allison et al., 2007; Hood, de Zwaan, & J\u00e4ger, 2012), all of which found a significant association between NES and higher depression scores, higher eating disorder scores and reduced quality of life. In all but on e study (Allison et al., 2007), there was a significant association between NES and a poorer glycemic control (higher HbA1c values and higher number of diabetes -specific sequelae). 374 2.3. Differential diagnosis With regard to differential diagnosis, other eating disorders (e.g. BED, sleep -related eating disorder), physical diseases, intake of diuretics, drug misuse and similar should be clarified (Allison, Lundgren, O'Reardon, et al., 2010; APA, 2013). Equally, NES should not be diagnosed in persons who sho w a delayed day/night rhythm due to shift work. It should be noted that the presence of these illnesses does not rule out the simultaneous presence of NES. However, it needs to be checked whether the presenting symptoms are not sufficiently explainable by another eating disorder (e.g. evening binge eating episodes in BED or BN) or a physical disease (e.g. nocturnal hypoglycemia in the case of diabetes mellitus). In contrast to BED (cf. guideline chapter BED), in the case of NES - and especially in nighttime eating - unusually large amounts of food are not normally consumed (Birketvedt et al., 1999; de Zwaan, Roerig, Crosby, Karaz, & Mitchell, 2006). Previous studies have yielded rather small overlaps between BED and NES, ranging between 0% and 26.5% (de Zwaa n, Burgard, Schenck, & Mitchell, 2003). Accordingly, two distinct disorders are assumed. The clearest differences between BED and NES lie in the motivation to eat, in the amount of food consumed per eating episode, and in the extent of dissatisfaction with weight and shape (de Zwaan et al., 2015; Vander Wal, 2012). In the third edition of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD -3) by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (Medicine, 2014), an eating -related sleep disorder is described, the so-called \"Sleep Related Eating Disorder\" (SRED). The syndrome is listed in the DSM -5 under the NREM parasomnias together with sleepwalking and sleep terrors (Pavor 2013). SRED is characterized by recurrent, undesired nocturnal eating episodes, occasionally with inedible substances also being consumed. Moreover, awareness is partially or completely impaired and there is a varying degree of amnesia regarding the nocturnal eating episode. These criteria can be categorized as a sleep disorder and rather give rise to the assumption of an association with sleepwalking than with eating disorder. Above all, the lack of awareness of the nocturnal food consumption in conjunction with an impaired recollection of the nocturnal events the next morning constitutes an important distinguishing criterion. Nevertheless, a continuum of the two syndromes can be assumed, as, for example, partial awareness (\"half awake, half asleep\") is also described by patients with NES (Allison, 2012). 2.4. Etiology Compare d to control persons, a dissociation between the circadian rhythm of sleep and food intake has been found in patients with NES. At the same time, the sleep rhythm seems to be unimpaired and the circadian rhythm of food intake seems to be delayed (Stunkard, Allison, Lundgren, & O'Reardon, 2009). This could contribute to a conflict between the desire to sleep and the desire to eat. Additionally, the circadian rhythm of glucose, melatonin, leptin and ghrelin, cortisol, prolactin TSH appears to o r desynchronized (Allison et al., 375 2005; Birketvedt et al., 2012; Goel et al., 2009). The biobehavioral model of Vander Wal (2014) assumes that there is a genetic vulnerability to increased serotonin reuptake and that stress triggers a dysregulation of circ adian rhythms and a decrease in satiety. This, in turn, might increase the risk of developing NES. 2.5. Therapy 2.5.1. Treatment aims The aim of treatment for NES is to reduce, and ideally cease, the evening /nighttime eating episodes and achieve a norma lization of the day/night rhythm of eating behavior (de Zwaan, 2016; Pinto, Silva, Bruin, & Bruin, 2016) methods 2.5.2.1. Pharmacotherapy Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) There are several case r eports and uncontrolled investigations with sertraline (50 -200 mg) & Allison, paroxetine (20 -30 mg), fluvoxamine (25 mg) (Miyaoka et al., 2003) and escitalopram (5 -20 mg) (Allison et al., 2013), which ove rall report a positive effect of SSRIs on the reduction of night -eating symptoms [see also (Vander Wal, 2014)]. However, so far, only two randomized controlled trials have been published, which will be briefly described. Sertraline, in a flexible dosage of 50 to 200 mg, was compared in 34 outpatients with NES randomized with placebo (O'Reardon et al., 2004). The treatment duration amounted to 8 weeks, sertraline was given as an evening dosage, and the average dosage at the end of the study was 126.5 mg (SD= 50.4). Diagnosis was made using a structured clinical interview. The primary endpoint was the improvement rating on the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale. After 8 weeks of treatment, 71% of the sertraline group and 18% of the placebo group had a CGI i mprovement rating of 2 or lower (strongly improved). Moreover, the scores on the Nighttime Eating Symptom Scale (NESS) also showed a significantly greater reduction in the sertraline group than in the placebo group. Calorie intake following the evening mea l in the sertraline group fell from 47.3% of daily calorie intake to 14.8%, and in the placebo group from 44.7% to 31.6%. The superiority of sertraline was also demonstrated with regard to weight loss and improvement in quality of life. Most of the effects already emerged after 2 weeks of treatment. The improvements in night -eating symptoms were independent of depressive symptoms. Two patients dropped out of the study due of a lack of efficacy. In a bi -center randomized controlled trial, escitalopram was us ed in a flexible dosage of 10 to 20 mg versus placebo in 40 patients over a period of 12 weeks (Vander Wal, Gang, Griffing, & 376 Gadde, 2012). Again, the medication was given in the evenings. Diagnosis was made using the NESHI interview and all patients addit ionally had an NEQ score of 25 or higher. The primary endpoint was the change in the NEQ sum score. Secondary endpoints were a 50% reduction in the NEQ score, no longer fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for NES, and a CGI improvement score of 1 or 2, as i n the study with sertraline. The two treatment groups did not differ in any of the endpoints. The NEQ sum score decreased by 13 points in the escitalopram group and by 10.6 points in the placebo group. After 12 weeks of treatment, 60% of the escitalopram g roup and 35% of the placebo group had a CGI improvement rating of 2 or lower (strongly improved). Compared to the study with sertraline (18%), the placebo response rate was thus substantially higher. All patients completed the study. Overall, SSRIs appear to be somewhat efficacious for reducing symptoms in patients with NES, although the evidence is still limited. The placebo response rates are high and the treatment durations are short, which in a disorder with a fluctuating course, may have simply led to a depiction of the natural course. Moreover, longitudinal studies are lacking, both as maintenance therapy and as follow -up after discontinuing the medication. Agomelatine In one case study and one case series with 5 patients with NES and comorbid depress ion, Milano, De Rosa, Milano and Capasso (2012, 2013) found an improvement in mood, a reduction in the sum score of the NEQ, and a weight loss following administration of agomelatine up to 50 mg/day over a period of 12 weeks. As melatonin plays an essentia l role in the circadian rhythm, this idea stands to reason. However, the data are not sufficient to draw any recommendations. Other medications Case reports and case series with positive effects also exist for topiramate (75 -125 mg) (Cooper - Kazaz, 2012; Tucker, Masters, & Nawar, 2004; Winkelman, 2003). Here, due to the rather unfavorable side effect profile and the selective case reports, larger studies are certainly warranted. 2.5.2.2. Psychotherapy Cognitive -behavioral therapy (CBT) As early as 2010, a n open pilot study with 25 patients who received 10 individual sessions of psychotherapy was published (Allison, Lundgren, Moore, O'Reardon, & Stunkard, 2010). The treatment was based on a therapy manual which is available in the English language (Allison, 2012). According to the manual, the treatment consists of 10 individual sessions which are structured into 3 phases. In the first 4 sessions, besides psychoeducation, a primary focus is on self-observation of sleeping and eating behavior as well as mood a nd automatic thoughts linked to the nighttime eating. A structured eating behavior with regular mealtimes is recommended, and patients should refrain from diets. The authors attribute particular importance to the thought \"I won't be able to go (back) to sl eep if I don't eat something\" in terms of the maintenance of 377 the disorder, and especially of nighttime eating. In phase 2, skills (including muscle relaxation) are trained and automatic thoughts are questioned. The final two sessions (phase 3) serve the purpose of relapse prevention. In the framework of the open pilot study (Allison, Lundgren, Moore, et al., 2010), only 14 of the 25 patients took part in at least 8 of the intended 10 sessions (56%). This group was able to successfully reduce their food inta ke following the evening meal (35% to 24.9%), the nocturnal awakening per week (13.5 to 8.5), the nighttime food consumption per week (8.7 to 2.6) and body weight (from 82.5 to 79.4 kg). The results are comparable with those that were achieved for sertrali ne (see above). Relaxation training In a small randomized controlled trial, the effect of progressive muscle relaxation in comparison with \"quietly sitting\" was examined in 20 patients with NES (Pawlow, O'Neil, & Malcolm, 2003). The therapy duration was 1 week. The rationale for this study lay in the relationship between NES and high levels of stress, as already described by Stunkard et al. (1955). Progressive muscle relaxation was superior to the control group in terms of reducing stress and anxiety. More over, the patients reported a significant reduction in the feeling of hunger in the evening and an increased appetite in the morning. However, the actual amount of food consumed in the night and in the morning did not differ significantly between the group s. A further small randomized controlled trial compared three groups with one another (Vander Wal, Maraldo, muscle relaxation (PMR, n=15) and 3) PE, P MR and additional exercise (PMRplus, n=15). The authors expected to find an additive effect of the three interventions. Overall, three appointments took place over a period of three weeks. 86.7% completed the study, and the overall remission rate was 32%. Evening eating episodes were reduced by 55% and nighttime eating episodes by 23%. In all three groups, there was a significant reduction in NES symptoms, and there were no differences between the groups. Only with regard to \"percent of food eaten after the evening meal\" did group differences emerge. The group which received PMR in addition to PE reported the clearest reduction ( - 30.5%) and thus differed significantly from the group that only received PE ( -0.95%). Additional exercise had no effect. Other therapeutic techniques In two case studies, light therapy proved to be effective in patients with depression and NES (Friedman, Even, Dardennes, & Guelfi, 2002, 2004). In both cases, a remission of NES symptoms occurred following 30 -minute, morning session s with 10,000 Lux over a period of 14 days. In a further case series with 15 patients who likewise received light therapy of 10,000 Lux over 14 days, similar effects were achieved (McCune & Lundgren, 2015). 378 2.5.3. Treatment settings Currently, there are n o evidence -based recommendations regarding the treatment setting for NES. It can be assumed that persons with NES can fundamentally be treated in an outpatient setting (de Zwaan, 2016; Pinto et al., 2016). Recommendations Knowledge on the treatment of NES is relatively limited. Due to potential somatic comorbidities of NES (e.g. obesity, diabetes), medical clarification should be conducted. (GCP) In the presence of NES, SSRIs, progressive muscle relaxation and cognitive -behavioral therapy should be considered. (0, EL 2b) 379 3. Purging disorder 3.1. Symptoms and diagnostic criteria 3.1.1. Symptoms Some patients show bulimic symptoms but do not report objectively large binge eating episodes with loss of control, as required for the diagnostic criteria of BN (see guideline chapter BN). Rather, they deem even small meals to be too big and therefore reg ularly apply compensatory behaviors such as self -induced vomiting and abuse of laxatives, diuretics and/or thyroid medications. For these patients, the diagnostic description of purging disorder was suggested (Keel, 2007; Koch, Quadflieg, & Fichter, 2013). Sufferers have recurrent eating episodes which are characterized by the consumption of an amount of food that is not substantially large but is subjectively perceived to be large, as well as the experience of loss of control over food intake (Forney, Haed t-Matt, & Keel, 2014; Goldschmidt et al., 2016). 3.1.2. Diagnostic criteria according to ICD -10 and DSM -5 While purging disorder is not mentioned in the ICD -10 (WHO, 2000), the disorder was included in the DSM -5 (APA, 2013) as a syndrome in the category \"Other specified feeding or eating disorder\". The diagnosis should be made if recurrent purging behavior is undertaken in order to influence weight or shape (e.g. self -induced vomiting, abuse of laxatives, diuretics or other medications). 3.2. Comorbidity, etiology, course The findings on differences and overlaps between purging disorder and BN, or between purging disorder and AN, are inconsistent. While some works were able to demonstrate differences, with partially small effect sizes (Brown, Keel, & Stri egel, 2012; Keel, Wolfe, Gravener, & Jimerson, 2008; Tasca et al., 2012), other authors rather assume that no substantial differences exist between patients with purging disorder and BN particularly in terms of course, prognosis, extent of restrictive eati ng behavior, body image disturbance or psychiatric comorbidity M\u00fchlhans, 2015; Keel & Striegel -Moore, 2009; Tasca et al., 2012). The results of a first ecological momentary assessment study with 24 women with purging disorder indicate that pur ging behavior serves purposes of emotion regulation (Haedt -Matt & Keel, 2015). Due to the suspected similarity with BN, reference is made here to the guideline chapter BN. 380 3.3. Therapy 3.3.1. Treatment aims Treatment aims are the reduction or cessation of purging episodes, the normalization of eating behavior and accompanying eating disorder symptoms, as well as a BMI in the normal range. 3.3.2. Treatment approaches and methods So far, only a small number of treatment studies have been published which examined patients with purging disorder separately (table 15). One exception is the study by Tasca et al. (2015), in which a total of 265 patients with eating disorders received day -clinic treatment based on the Toronto General Hospital Eating Disorders Pr ogram (Olmsted, McFarlane, Molleken, & Kaplan, 2001). The therapy offer included group therapies for the improvement of eating disorder symptoms, mood and interpersonal problems as well as nutritional counseling and dietary change, although the authors ref rained from publishing a detailed description of the therapy components. The treatment sample was composed of patients with purging disorder (n=25), AN restrictive type (n=50), AN binge -eating/purging type (n=64) and BN (n=126). A randomization was not und ertaken. The endpoint was a so -called \"good treatment outcome\", which was operationalized as follows: 1) no binge eating or purging during the last four treatment weeks, BMI 20 kg/m2 during the last two treatment weeks, and 3) BMI 19 kg/m2 during the two w eeks before the last two treatment weeks. These criteria were fulfilled by 48% of the patients with purging disorder, 57% of the patients with binge -purge BN, 36% of the patients with restrictive AN and 33% of the patients with AN binge -eating/purging type . Regression analyses yielded no significant difference in the achievement of a good treatment outcome between patients with purging disorder and the other therapy groups (odds ratios n.s. when comparing the purging disorder group with each of the other gr oups, dependent variable \"good treatment outcome\" yes/no) (Tasca et al., 2012). Likewise, patients with purging disorder did not differ regarding the post -treatment remission rates. A case report by Sysko and Hildebrandt (2011) also appears to be promising: According to this case study, a 16 -year-old girl with purging disorder benefited very much from enhanced CBT modified for adolescents (Cooper & Stewart, 2008). 3.3.3. Treatment settings It is not possible to derive empirically based specific rec ommendations on treatment setting in the case of purging disorder. 381 Recommendations Currently, it is not possible to derive empirically based treatment recommendations that are specific for the treatment of patients with purging disorder. Due to potential somatic consequences of purging disorder, medical clarification should be considered (GCP). If purging disorder is present, proceeding with treatment analogously to the treatment of BN should be considered (GCP). FURTHER \"FEEDING AND EATING DISORDERS\" LISTED IN THE DSM -5 This subchapter focuses on eating disorders which are listed in the DSM -5 (APA. 2013) in addition to the classical eating disorders AN, BN, and BED, in the chapter \"Feeding and Eating Disorders\". Table 16 summarizes the treatment studi es on pica, rumination disorder and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID). 4. Pica 4.1. Symptoms and diagnostic criteria 4.1.1. Symptoms Prior to the 20th century, pica was not considered as a disorder in its own right, but was rather subsumed under other diagnoses (AN, BN or rumination) (Hakim -Larson et al., 1997; Parry - Jones & Parry -Jones, 1994). Pica is characterized by the ingestion of substances that a re not seen as food and also possess no nutritional value. Substances include, for example, paper, hair, earth, chalk, paint and clay. In most cases, there is no fundamental aversion to normal foods. In addition to the breadth of the possible consumed subs tances, the associated behaviors can also differ considerably. While some sufferers experience an urge to consume the substance due to its taste or consistency, in others, for instance persons with intellectual impairments, the behavior can constitute a fo rm of self -soothing. The disorder appears to be especially frequent in children, persons with developmental disorders or intellectual impairments, persons in institutions, pregnant women and persons in underdeveloped regions of the world or with a low soci oeconomic status (Rose, Porcerelli, & Neal, 2000). So far, the assumption is that the disorder does not present differently in children, although it can also be assumed that children are cognitively less capable of judging and 382 perceiving the possible medic al consequences of the behavior, which can additionally complicate the treatment of the problem. 4.1.2. Diagnostic criteria according to ICD -10 and DSM -5 In the ICD -10, pica is defined as the persistent consumption of non -nutritive substances. Only if it occurs as a relatively isolated psychopathological behavior it is diagnosed under F98.3 under the disorders with onset in childhood or adolescence. Alternatively, the broader disorder is diagnosed and the behavior is subsumed therein. For adults, a diagnos is under F50.8 - other eating disorders - is used. In the DSM -5 (APA, 2013), the diagnosis is found in the category of eating disorders and can thus be applied to all age groups. Furthermore, it is specified that the consumption of the substance takes plac e at least once a month and is not part of a culturally supported or socially normative practice. Furthermore, the differential diagnosis is defined somewhat further and pica should only be given as an additional diagnosis in the case of another mental dis order or medical condition if it requires additional treatment. 4.2. Comorbidity Pica is frequently associated with intellectual impairment or developmental disorders, for instance autism spectrum disorder (Clark et al., 2010). Based on individual case studies and several larger studies, it might be part of frequently occurring comorbidities in obsessive - compulsive disorder (Bhatia & Gupta, 2009), impulse control disorder (Stein, Bouwer & van Heerden, 1996), schizophrenia (Dumaguing et al., 2003) and oth er eating disorders (Delaney et al. 2014). Possible comorbidly occurring medical complications (caused by the pica behavior) can include intestinal perforation or obstruction, intoxication, asphyxiation and infections (Decker, 1993; Dumaguing et al., 2003; Luoba et al., 2005; Saathoff et al., 2002). 4.3. Differential diagnosis Pica should principally be differentiated from the following five disorders: If the substance is only consumed as an alternative to normal foods in order to counteract weight gain ( as part of AN, BN or BED; Delaney et al., 2014) or in order to have a substance with the desired sensory properties (smell, taste or consistency in the case of ARFID), the diagnosis should not be made (Hartmann et al., 2012). Persons who undertake self -harm with non -suicidal intention and consequently consume potentially dangerous objects should also not receive an additional diagnosis. Moreover, persons suffering from psychoses may also consume objects and substances, possibly as a consequence of a halluci nation or as the function of a delusion (Fishbain & Rotondo, 1983; Foulon, 2003). Such behavior would be subsumed as part of a psychosis diagnosis. Finally, a factitious disorder can also be mentioned as a further differential diagnosis, in which objects a nd substances are swallowed in order to produce medical symptoms and receive medical treatment (APA, 2013). 383 4.4. Etiology To date, there are no comprehensive evidence -based models to explain the etiology of all forms of pica. 4.5. Course Longitudinal re presentative data regarding the onset and course of the disorder are still lacking. Nevertheless, the typical onset appears to occur in childhood, often followed by spontaneous remission. Persistence into adolescence and adulthood seems to be detected more rarely (APA, 2013). However, particularly in children with a developmental disorder or intellectual impairment, pica can persist, especially if it remains untreated (Matson et al., 2011). In part, later disorder onsets occur in certain subgroups, for inst ance pregnant women (APA, 2013). 4.6. Therapy 4.6.1. Treatment aims The aim of pica treatment is to reduce, and ideally cease, the ingestion of substances that are non-food and non -nutritive. 4.6.2. Treatment approaches One randomized controlled trial d escribes the treatment of pica in children using iron or multinutrient supplementations (Nchito et al., 2004). No effect was found regarding the reduction of pica behaviors. Medical reasons for the pica behavior (for example in terms of malnutrition), howe ver, should be considered in the treatment planning. Psychotherapeutic treatment components which are mentioned in case studies belong primarily to the group of behavior modification (operant techniques): stimulus control, habit reversal and positive reinf orcement with pleasant consequences (Kelly et al., 2014). 4.6.3. Treatment settings Currently, there are no evidence -based recommendations regarding treatment setting. It can be assumed that pica can essentially be treated in the outpatient setting, exce pt for if the preferred substance carries a strong medical risk, and if patients show little insight into the illness and thus need closer supervision for the purpose of stimulus control. 384 Recommendations Currently, it is not possible to derive empirically based treatment recommendations which are specific for the treatment of pica. Due to the potential risk through accompanying diseases and deficiencies (e.g. anemia), medical clarification and where necessary medical treatment should be consider ed (GCP ). In the treatment of patients with pica, behavioral -therapeutic techniques should be considered. (0, EL 5). 5. Rumination disorder 5.1. Symptoms and diagnostic criteria 5.1.1. Symptoms Rumination disorder is characterized by the regurgitation of previously swallowed and possibly partially digested food. This process occurs intentionally without physical -somatic reasons such as reflux, nausea or aversion. It is sometimes accompanied by coughing or contractions or the tongue or abdomen or the hel p of the fingers. The food is then chewed again and spat out or swallowed again. Moreover, infants display a characteristic arching of the back, including jerky movements (Nicholls et al., 2008). 5.1.2. Diagnostic criteria according to ICD -10 and DSM -5 In the ICD -10, rumination disorder is not listed separately, but is rather subsumed as F98.2 under 'Other feeding disorders of infancy and childhood,' and mentioned as a possible symptom. In the DSM -5, the disorder is described as a repeated regurgitation of food over a period of at least one month. The regurgitated food can either be chewed, swallowed or spat out. The repeated regurgitation should not be a consequence of a condition of the gastrointestinal tract or of another somatic disease (e.g. esophage al reflux, pyloric stenosis). Moreover, the differential diagnosis from the eating disorders and other mental disorders is specified. 5.2. Comorbidity In the DSM -5, it is merely noted that rumination disorder can occur in the context of other disorders, su ch as generalized anxiety disorder, and more frequently occurs in the context of intellectual impairment. So far, systematic empirical works examining the comorbidity of rumination disorder are lacking. 385 5.3. Differential diagnosis The eating disorders AN and BN can also feature regurgitation and spitting out of food in order to rid oneself of additional calories. Furthermore, gastrointestinal conditions need to be clarified from a differential diagnostic perspective. 5.4. Etiology So far, there are no evidence -based models to explain the etiology of rumination disorder. 5.5. Course Fundamentally, the onset of the disorder can occur at any age. If the disorder occurs for the first time in infancy, spontaneous remission often arises. Little is known a bout the course of the disorder in adolescence and adulthood. 5.6. Therapy 5.6.1. Treatment aims The aim of treatment for rumination disorder is to reduce, and ideally cease, the behavior. 5.6.2. Treatment approaches There is one randomized controlled t rial in the area of rumination disorder. In an outpatient setting, 18 women and 6 men (19 -79 years old), who met the ROME III criteria for rumination, were randomized to a placebo and a treatment group. Three sessions over 10 days with EMG biofeedback trai ning targeted increased control of the abdomino -thoracic muscles and learning of abdominal breathing. This led to a reduction in rumination activity of 74% (from 29\u00b16 to 7\u00b12 daily activities) in the intervention group vs. 1% in the placebo group (from 21\u00b12 to 21\u00b1 4 daily activities) (p Soldevilla, Malagelada & Azpiroz, 2016). Psychotherapeutic techniques which have also been mentioned in case studies are habit reversal and reinforcement with positive consequences (Tack et al., 201 1). 386 5.6.3. Treatment settings Currently, there are no evidence -based recommendations regarding treatment setting. It can be assumed that rumination disorder can fundamentally be treated in the outpatient setting except for when the behavior leads to a strong medical risk and the sufferer therefore requires close supervision. Recommendations Currently, it is not possible to derive empirically based treatment recommendations which are specific for the treatment of patients with rumination disorder. In patients with rumination disorder, somatic clarification is recommended (GCP) In the treatment of patients with rumination disorder, EMG biofeedback training can be justified (0, EL 3) 6. Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder 6.1. Symptoms and dia gnostic criteria 6.1.1. Symptoms Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) describes a maladaptive pattern of feeding or eating which results in significant health consequences. These can be weight loss, stalled growth, deficiencies and subsequent dependency on artificial feeding or nutritional supplements. Thus, although the food restriction in ARFID is not associated with significant body image concerns, but rather mostly with concerns about the characteristics or sensory properties of food (extr eme sensitivity towards external appearance, color, smell, consistency, temperature or taste), the health consequences can be reminiscent of AN (hypothermia, bradycardia, anemia, tooth decay and electrolyte disturbances; Pinhas et al., 2011). The disorder mostly occurs for the first time in early childhood, which is why careful attention should be paid to the symptoms in this age group. Moreover, in the very young age group, the caregiver who feeds the child, as well as his/her relationship with the child, plays a very important role for diagnosis and treatment. 387 6.1.2. Diagnostic criteria according to ICD -10 and DSM -5 In the ICD -10, the disorder is categorized as a feeding disorder of infancy and childhood (F98.2). It comprises food refusal or extreme fadiness in the presence of an adequate food supply and a reasonably competent caregiver and the absence of organic disease. Rumination may also be present. The disorder should be distinguished from \"fussiness\" and should only be diagnosed if it goes clear ly beyond the normal range or is qualitatively abnormal or if the child is not gaining weight or is losing weight. In the DSM -5, the disorder is found in the category of \"Feeding and eating disorders\". It describes an eating or feeding disorder in the sens e of a lack of interest in eating or in food, the avoidance of sensory characteristics of foods or concerns about aversive consequences of eating. The disorder manifests in an insufficient energy consumption in terms of weight loss (or insufficient weight gain or vertical growth in children), significant nutritional deficiencies, dependence on oral nutritional supplements or enteral feeding. A particular difference from the ICD-10 diagnosis is that an onset before the age of six years is not an essential cr iterion. 6.2. Comorbidity Disorders which have already been described as occurring comorbidly with ARFID are anxiety and obsessive -compulsive disorders Robinson, Harrison, Spettigue 2014; Zickgraf, Franklin & Rosin, 2016), esp ecially generalized anxiety disorder (Fisher et al., 2014) and learning and developmental disorders ( Nicely, Masciulli, Hollenbeak & Ornstein, 2014), especially autism spectrum disorder ( Sharp, Berry & McCracken, 2013). 6.3. Differential diagnosis To date, systematic investigations on mental disorders and medical diseases which should be delineated from ARFID from a differential diagnostic perspective are lacking. Anorexia nervosa constitutes a particularly relevant differential diagnostic category, in which, however, food restriction is mainly based on body image -associated concerns. Further differences from anorexia nervosa lie in the often younger age, the longer duration of illness, the larger proportion of male sufferers, higher weight and a higher likelihood of comorbid medical diseases and anxiety disorder but a lower likelihood of an affective disorder (Fisher et al., 2014; Norris et al., 2014). However, restrictive food intake (based among other things on lack of appetite) can occur unspecifica lly in various mental disorders. All differential diagnoses listed in the following can also be given comorbidly, as long as all diagnostic criteria are fulfilled and a separate clinical consideration is justified. They are also mentioned in the DSM -5 (APA , 2013). Besides other interactions, the feeding situation can be affected by a reactive attachment disorder. Persons with autism spectrum disorder often show rigid eating behavior and increased sensory sensitivity. Moreover, specific phobias (especially f ear of choking or vomiting) and social 388 anxiety disorder (fear of being observed by others while eating) can lead to an ARFID - resembling avoidance. Furthermore, persons with obsessive -compulsive disorder can show food avoidance or restriction in relation to an excessive concern with respect to eating or in relation to ritualized eating behavior. Food avoidance or restriction can additionally arise in the framework of schizophrenia or delusional disorder as a reaction to delusional ideas. A factitious disorde r or factitious disorder imposed on another also need to be considered. In this context, food avoidance or food restriction might be used to bring about possible medical complications in order to be able to seek medical treatment. Besides mental disorders, above all, other physical diseases such as gastrointestinal diseases, food allergies and intolerances as well as invisible malignancies should be considered. Furthermore, neurological/neuromuscular, structural and congenital disorders can also be linked t o feeding difficulties. 6.4. Etiology To date, there are no evidence -based models to explain the etiology of ARFID. 6.5. Course Systematic investigations on the course of ARFID are lacking. In the DSM -5, prototypical courses for the specific subforms of ARFID are described as follows: Food avoidance or restriction based on disinterest in food mostly develop in infancy or early childhood and can persist into adulthood. Avoidance due to sensory characteristics likewise mostly arises in the first decade o f life and can persist, while avoidance which is based on the anticipation of aversive consequences of eating can emerge at any age. The few available longitudinal studies point to a high persistence with a comparatively high functioning in adulthood with respect to the form based on the sensory characteristics of food. Less is known about the other forms. 6.6. Therapy 6.6.1. Treatment aims The aim of treatment for ARFID is to reduce, and ideally cease, the food restriction and thus to reduce the medical risks, especially underweight. 6.6.2. Treatment approaches Three randomized controlled trials were found. One was characterized as a pilot trial, in which 20 children aged between 13 and 72 months with a diagnosis of ARFID were allocated to a 5 - day treatment in a day -clinic setting or a waiting list (10 patients in each group) (Sharp et al., 389 2016). The behavioral therapy included reinforcemen t techniques as well as a formalized mealtime structure (written instructions, reduced bite volume and pureed food texture). In the framework of the treatment meals, eight foods were available, two each from the groups of proteins, starch, fruit and vegeta bles. At each meal, the caregiver offered four foods. The bite volume was continuously increased. At the end of treatment, the treatment group showed greater improvements on all outcome measures (bite volumes, level of disruptions of feeding situation, vol ume of food consumed; p = .05; d=1.03 -2.11) compared to the waitlist control group (d= -1.13-0.24). These differences remained stable over the course of one month. The second randomized controlled trial on general feeding disorders in childhood (not diagnosed as ARFID according to DSM -5) included 64 children aged 4 -36 months who participated with their primary feeders in a 7 -week week -day inpatient therapy. It was shown that behavioral therapy (main focus) plus a nutritional intervention is superior to a traditional nutritional intervention alone (establishing structured plans and routines to stimulate hunger/satiety cycles) in terms of the transition from enteral to oral feeding (Benoit, Wang & Zlotkin, 2000). 4.5 months after the first clinic visit (3rd follow -up), 15 of the 32 patients in the combination group no longer required enteral feeding, compared to no patients in the nutritional intervention alone group. In the third randomized controlled trial, 22 children aged 9 -24 months who were fully tube fed were allocated to a hunger provocation program and a standard treatment program. The hunger provocation program comprised a stepwise reduction in the proportion of food administered via the tube and an increasing oral feeding initially in the absence o f the parents. As soon as it was possible to remove the tube, the parents were included in the oral feeding. In the hunger provocation program group, 9 of 11 patients (81.8%) were successfully weaned from tube feeding, while only 1 of 11 patients (9%) in t he control group was successfully weaned. The control group patients who were not successfully weaned subsequently received the hunger provocation program. Accordingly, at follow -up, 18 of 21 patients (86%) had been successfully treated (Hartdorff, Kennpke ns, Stok -Akerboom, van Dijl -Lokkart, Engels & Kindermann (2015). A systematic review of pediatric feeding disorders which also considered case series in addition to the aforementioned randomized controlled trials summarizes that the potentially effective psychotherapeutic treatment techniques mainly stem from behavioral interventions (positive and negative reinforcement, shaping, discrimination, fading; Lukens & Silverman, 2014). This was confirmed by a recent meta -analytic review, which in addition to the two aforementioned randomized controlled trials (Hartdorff et al., 2015; Sharp et al., 2016) also included retrospective chart reviews (Sharp, Volkert, Scahill, McCracken & McElhanon, 2017). In summary, it can be concluded that behavioral therapy interven tions and the weaning from tube feeding are the main components in the treatment of ARFID. These measures led to successful weaning from tube feeding in 71% of patients (95% CI 54% -83%). The successes also remained stable following discharge (80%; 95% CI 6 6%-89%). Moreover, the treatment led to an increased oral food intake, improved behavior during mealtimes and reduced parental stress (Sharp et al., 2017). For young patients suffering from ARFID, modifiable parent variables can 390 also constitute aims of the treatment in order to change the feeding situation (McGrath Davis et al., 2010). An adjuvant treatment with cyproheptadine, an active substance from the group of antihistamines, may potentially lead to an improvement of ARFID. This was indicated by the results of a retrospective analysis of the medical records of 127 children aged between 7 and 80 months who were treated due to a feeding disorder fulfilling the description according to the ARFID criteria (Sant'Ana et al., 2014). 82 of the 127 children not only took part in the intervention program but additionally took cyproheptadine (0.25mg/kg per day over 1 -3 weeks). The majority of parents of these children (96%) reported an improvement in mealtime and feeding behavior and a weight gain was observed (Sa nt'Ana et al., 2014). 6.6.3. Treatment settings Currently, there are no evidence -based recommendations regarding treatment setting. It can be assumed that ARFID can fundamentally be treated in an outpatient setting unless a strong weight loss or medical risk is present due to malnutrition. Recommendations In view of the risk of malnutrition and underweight, a medical clarification in patients with ARFID should be considered (GCP). In the treatment of patients with ARFID, a formalized mealtime structure and behavioral therapy interventions, including the parents or guardians, should be considered (0, EL 2b). It can be assumed that patients with ARFID can be treated in the outpatient setting. In the case of medical risk due to malnutrition and weight loss, an inpatient treatment is recommended (GCP). It is recommended that the treatment of patients with ARFID should be oriented to the guidelines on mental disorders in infancy, toddlerh ood and preschool ages (S2k). 391 Table 1 : Atypical and unspecified eating disorders in the ICD -10 and DSM -5 ICD-10 (WHO, 1992) DSM -5 (APA, 2013) Atypical and other/unspecified eating disorders 307.59: Other specified feeding and nervosa of limited frequency and/or limited duration F50.8: Other eating disorders F50.9: Eating disorder, unspecified Binge eating disorder of limited frequency and/or limited duration Purging disorder Night eating syndrome F98.21: Rumination disorder of infancy Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) Feeding and eating disorders (except for AN, BN, BED) F98.21: Rumination disorder of infancy 307.53: Rumination disorder F98.3: Pica of infancy and childhood F50.8: eating disorders, non -organic pica in adults 307.52: Pica 392 Table 2 : Evidence from studies on the treatment of EDNOS (DSM -IV) Authors Diagnosis Age Study design Treatment n/arm Measurement time points OCEM evidence level Jacobi et al. 2014 Subsyndromal AN/ BN / BED 22.3 \u00b1 2.9 yrs eating disorder 18.9 \u00b1 2.4 LOC eating 14.5 \u00b1 1.7 yrs RCT Modified IPT vs. Health Education FU EDNOS yrs Case study Lamotrigine 100mg/d 1 Pre-Post 5 EDNOS = Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified, RCT = Randomized Controlled Trial, WL = Waitlist/Waiting control group FU = Follow -up, iCBT = Internet -based cognitive behavior therapy, LOC = Loss -of-Control, IPT = Interpersonal psychotherapy, Wk = Week, Mth = Month 393 Table 3 : Operationalized research criteria from an expert group for night eating syndrome (Allison, Lundgren, O'Reardon, et al., 2010) A.

The latter are largely oriented to the DSM -5. A systema tic literature search was conducted in electronic databases (MEDLINE, PubMED, PsycINFO, Web of Science). In addition, a manual search in the reference lists of the identified relevant publications was conducted. In the following, the search terms for title s, abstracts and keywords are summarized.

Concomitant physical conditions 1.1. Diabetes mellitus In young women aged between 15 and 25 years, diabetes mellitus is comparatively rare, with an assumed point prevalence of < 0.2 %. However, the clinical frequency of concurrent AN and diabetes mellitus is comparably higher, leading to the assumption of a c o-occurrence greater than would be expected by chance. Nevertheless, precise epidemiological data on AN are lacking. Disordered eating behavior that does not yet meet the diagnostic criteria for AN or BN, by contrast, is significantly more common in young female type I diabetics (Colton et al., 2004 ). A third of young women with insulin -dependent diabe tes show disturbed eating behavior, and over 10% show a substantial underdosage or skipping of insulin administration for weight control. Disordered eating behavior is linked to a poorer attitude towards diabetes (Rydall et al., 1997 ). A meta -analysis on the comorbidity of diabetes mellitus and eating disorders revealed an increased prevalence for bulimia nervosa but not for anorexia nervosa. A 10 -year follow -up investigation by Nielson (Nielsen et al., 2002 ) compared the mortality of anorexia nervosa, of type I diabetes mellitus and of a combination of both. The mortality rate for type I diabetes amounted to 2.2 per 1000 person -years, 7.3 for anorexia nervosa, and 34.6 for comorbid cases, demonstrating how drastic the consequences of this combination of diagnoses is. 1.2. Pregnancy and eating disorders Disruption to the hypothalamic -pituitary -gonadal axis leads to a reduced likelihood of pregnancy in t he course of AN (Brinch et al., 1988 ). By contrast, because of menstrual cycle irregularities and the disturbed absorption of oral contraceptives, women with BN have a higher risk of unwanted pregnancies (Morgan, 1999 ). Pregnancies have the potential to worsen the eating disorder symptoms as the affected women fear losing control over their body weight in the course of the pregnancy. However, longitudinal studies over the course of the first months of pregnancy tend to show a reduction in eating disorder symptoms (Blais et al., 2000 ; Rocco et al., 2005 ). Pregnancies in the case of ac tive eating disorders are not without complications. The newborns show a lower birth weight (Bulik et al., 1999 ; Franko et al., 2001 ; Micali et al., 2007 ). The rate of pregnancy complications is quite substantially increased in both AN and BN (Bulik et al., 1999 ). By contrast, patients with a history of AN who are in remission show a norm al pregnancy risk (Ekeus et al., 2006 ). Sufferers should receive particular attention in the postpartum period, as both the eat ing disorder symptoms can again increase, and the risk of postpartum depression also seems to be higher (Mazzeo et al., 2006 ; Morgan et al., 2006 ; Rocco et al., 2005 ). 409 2. Eating disorders related to physical illness and pregnancy 2.1. Laboratory changes Eating disorders are accompanied by characteristic, pathological changes in routine lab results, although these do not generally have further clinical implications. The bone marrow, particularly in patients with AN, is hypoplastic and shows gelatinous tran sformation (Chen et al., 2004 ), which can lead to both leukopenia and anemia (Abella et al., 2002 ; Cleary et al., 2010 ; Thiel et al., 2007 ). Both anemia and leukopenia normalize in the course of weight gain and do not generally require separate treatment. Recent work indicates a \"low grade inflammation\" with an IL -6 and TNF -alpha increase found in meta -analyzes (Dalton et al. 2018). The function of the lymphocytes is also impaired (Allende et al., 1998 ). Thus, in everyday clinical practice, one founds that anorexic patients suffer less frequently from symptoms of common viral infections, but also show fewer physical symptoms in the case of severe infections (Mustafa et al., 1997 ). In the case o f underweight in AN, serum cholesterol is frequently increased (Nakai et al., 2016 ). This is essentially due to an increase in the LDL fraction (Weinbrenner et al., 2004 ). The free fatty acids, by contrast, are normal. This constellation of lab findings is attributable to various causes, such as increased synthesis within hypercortisolism (Ohwada et al., 2006 ), a reduced c learance due to functional hypothyroidism and a reduced clearance and reduced production of bile. Hypercholesterolemia normalizes in the course of weight gain, and a specific cholesterol -lowering medication of even low -fat diets are not indicated. Vagal ov erstimulation through recurrent vomiting leads in the case of BN and the bulimic forms of AN to hypertrophy of the parotid, submandular and sublingual glands (Gunther, 1988 ; Pyle et al., 1981 ). Concurrently, a hyperamylasemia is often found (Hempen et al., 1989 ; Kinzl et al., 1993 ), which correlates with the frequency of vomiting. As patients are additionally more likely to suffer from gastrointestinal conditions, this lab finding leads not uncommonly to a misdiagnosis of pancreatitis. Typically, however, the lipase is not increased . 2.2. Eating disorders and the thyroid gland The changes in metabolism and in hormonal regulation triggered by disordered eating behavior and semi -starvation are extremely diverse. The numerous investigations in this area, however, have only little rel evance for clinical practice. The following section is therefore limited to the endocrine regulation of thyroid function, as the typical consequences of AN typically give rise to misdiagnoses and incorrect treatment in this respect. The thyroid gland relea ses thyroxine, which is converted in the body into the ultimately active hormone triiodothyronine. The main effects of thyroid hormones are as follows: Increase in basal metabolic rate and of oxygen and energy requirements of the organism. Increase in pro tein metabolism. Proteins are increasingly broken down or also produced. Increase in glucose supply and of gluconeogenesis. Increase in the rate of lipolysis. Increase in heart rate and blood pressure amplitude. 410 All of these main effects increase the energy consumption; thus, from the perspective of the existing lack of energy, it is metabolically appropriate that in the state of malnutrition, the production of thyroid hormones is down -regulated. This applies part icularly to triiodothyronine, which in AN is lowered to a much greater extent than thyroxine (Bannai et al., 1988 ; Casper et al., 1991 ; Croxson & Ibbertson, 1977 ; Miyai et al., 1975 ; Onur et al., 2005 ; Sato et al., 1988 ) and is highly correlated with the reduction in the basal metabolic rate (Aschettino -Manevitz et al., 2012 ). Generally speaking, functional hypothyroidism is not accompanied by an increase in TSH (thyroid -stimulating hormone), which would be the case in hypothyroidism due to the underproduction of the thyroid gland; the rise in TSH following TRH admi nistration is delayed (Kiriike et al., 1987 ; Kiyohara et al., 1987 ; Tamai et al., 1986 ). Occasionally, however, increased TSH values are also found, which should not be prematurely interpreted as a sign of hypothyroidism requiring treatment (Matsu bayashi et al., 1988 ). Thyroxine increases the energy consumption and the protein metabolism, consequently has unfavorable main effects for anorexia nervosa and therefore requires a closely defined indication in the case of anorexia nervosa. If hypothyr oidism is clearly presented, thyroxine should then be substituted in very low dosages. 2.3. Fluid and electrolyte balance Within the scope of eating disorders, substantial shifts in the fluid and electrolyte balance occur. Abnormal eating habits frequentl y also refer to drinking behavior, with both polydipsia (in order to suppress hunger) and water restriction being observed. Recurrent vomiting leads to volume depletions, to the depletion of chloride and other electrolytes and to metabolic alkalosis. The abuse of diuretics and laxatives also leads to volume deprivation and to shifts in the electrolyte balance, in particular to hypokalemia and loss of sodium, but not to hypochloremia. The loss of potassium initially affects the extracellular potassium conce ntration, while the intracellular potassium concentration is less affected. This causes an increase in the potassium stress of muscle and nerve cells and consequently an increased electrophysiological excitability of these cells. In this regard, the speed of potassium depletion is decisive for the extent of the resulting potassium stress. Chronic potassium depletions also lead to a drop in the intracellular potassium concentration and thus to a less pronounced change in potassium stress. The risk of cardiac arrhythmia is therefore less pronounced in the case of chronic potassium depletions than in the case of acute potassium depletions. The ECG changes associated with hypokalemia (Khan et al., 2007) enable an estimation of the resulting potassium stress and thus the arrhythmogenic risk. Hypokalemia in the scope of anorexia nervosa (Sugimoto et al., 2003 ) or in the scope of an abuse of diuretics (Copeland, 1989 ) is held responsible in case studies for the severe complication of pontine myelinolysis, ev en though no concomitant hyponatremia emerged in these cases. Likewise, there are case reports of a rhabdomyolysis (Dive et al., 1991 ). Chronic hypokalemia in conjunction with lack of volume and lack of substrates are conditions fo r the development of hypokalemic nephropathy. This disease is marked by a tubulointerstitial fibrosis, which is clinically expressed in polyuria, metabolic alkalosis, proteinuria and consecutively progressing impairment of renal function (Lee et al., 2015 ; Liang & Yeh, 2011 ). This type of nephropathy has been experimentally induced through potassium deprivation in rats (Manzato et al., 2009 ). On the other hand, renal function is also endangered through the 411 increased incidence of nephrolithiasis (Jonat & Birmingham, 2003 ) and more rarely also through nephrocalcinosis (Roberts et al., 2005 ). Even before the manifestation of renal insufficiency, the renal function is impaired in most patients with AN, the filtration fraction is decreased and in the case of fluid deprivation, the ability to concentrate is reduc ed (Aperia et al., 1978 ). As nutrition begins to normalize in the framework of treatment, many patients with AN and BN show a pronounced tendency to edema, marked by a disproportionate increase in the extracellular volume (Ehrlich et al., 2006a ; Tey et al., 2005 ). The associated high initial weight gain (the weight gain caused by edema formation can amount to up to 10 kg) often unnerves patients and therapists alike and therefore has to be considered when evaluating the course of weight. Electrolyte depletions and hypokalemia are the cause of an overa ctivation of the renin - angiotensin -aldosterone mechanism. The rise in plasma -aldosterone upon administration of angiotensin II is significantly higher in patients with anorexia nervosa (Mizuno et al., 1992 ). Under the conditions of normalization of nutrition, the activation of this mechanism leads to a substantially increased water retention and a tendency for hypok alemia. In less pronounced cases, it is sufficient to inform the patient of the benign nature of the edema formation and to take a \"wait -and-see\" stance, as this so -called Pseudo -Bartter syndrome normalizes completely within the first few weeks. A differen t stance should be taken in the case of extreme edema formation, which is associated with hyperhydration and affects the cardiovascular system (Ehrlich et al., 2006b ; Rigaud et al., 2010 ). Here, a diuretic treatment, in this case for logical reasons with aldosterone antagonists, is indicated. Pathophysiologically, other factors are held res ponsible for the edema formation. In this respect, the reinstated insulin secretion, in conjunction with increased insulin sensitivity, is discussed, which then leads to a sodium retention in the distal tubule (Yucel et al., 2005 ). In cases with hyponatremia, the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) should also be considered - SIADH is presumably also more frequent in AN (Challier & Cabrol, 1995 ). 2.4. Bone structure One of the frequent and severe medical complications in patients with a long -term course of AN or the subgroup of especially underweight patients with BN (Robinson et al., 2017 ) is the occurrence of osteopenia (reduced bone density) or osteoporosis (reduction of bone density by more than two standard deviation s according to age - and sex -adapted values). For children and adolescents the term \"osteopenia\" should be avoided because of its imprecise defintion. Besides a reduced bone density the definition of osteoporosis implies the presence of at least one pathol ogical fracture (Bianchi et al. 2014). In patients with a more than two -year course and/or in AN patients with bone pain or spontaneous fractures, a bone density measurement should be carried out (NICE guidelines 2017, Treasure et al., 2015 ; Zipfel et al., 201 5). A systematic review pointed to the following predictors for a reduced bone mineral density (BMD) in AN patients: a) young age at onset, b) long duration of illness, c) long duration of amenorrhea, and d) low weight (BMI) (Robinson et al, 2017). While lower bone density was demonstrated in the area of the spine in AN patients and in the subgroup of BN patients, only in the AN patients 412 was a s ignificantly reduced bone density in the hips, the femoral neck and in the whole -body bone density demonstrated. Loss of bone density already sets in within the first twelve months after diagnosis, with an average yearly bone density loss of 1% (Bruni et al., 2006). 25% of patients fulfilled diagnostic criteria of osteoporosis including one pathological fracture. . A longitudinal study in adult AN patients showed that the subgroup with a chronic course had an average yearly loss in bone density of 3.7%, while the group which had recovered showed a slight increase in bone density (0.7) per year. In particular, the grou p of AN patients with purging symptoms showed the highest yearly bone density loss (Zipfel et al., 2001 ). In this group, also with regard to the bone turnover, the highest markers were found for bone loss and the lowes t markers for bone formation. AN patients with amenorrhea of more than six years had a seven -fold increased risk of fractures, and with a chronic long -term course of an average of eleven years, 44% of sufferers already showed osteoporotic bones. Preferenti ally affected are the trabecular bones in the area of the thighs and the lumbar spine. In performance athletes (e.g., ballet dancers), the illness and the significant physical demands can lead even in young years to pathological fractures and stress fractu res. As a guide, it can be stated that per standard deviation in bone density, the risk of fracture doubles. Based on a recent review, AN patients therefore have a four -fold increased risk of fractures (Robinson et al., 2016). The background for these dram atic figures is that puberty and early adulthood constitute a very sensitive period for bone formation, in which within a few years after completion of vertical growth, the maximum bone mass (peak bone mass) is reached. As AN frequently begins in the cours e of puberty, a reduced bone formation and consequently an already reduced peak bone mass and bone density arises. At the same time, the malnutrition and malnourishment have a series of effects on neuroendocrine factors, which are directly related to bone change. The following factors are involved in this regard: Reduction in the release of gonatotropin -releasing hormone (GnRH) and of gonadotropins and consequently reduced and androgen production (Testosteron, DHEAS) Increase in plasma cortisol levels Reduction of free T3 Reduced hepatic synthesis of growth factors (including IGF1) Reduced leptin levels and increased catecholomine levels (Bruni et al., 2006) Reduced calcium and vitamin D supply Metabolic acidosis due to increased lipolysis. Redu ced Ghrelin and enhanced levels fo PYY (Fazeli & Klibanski 2014, 2018 Due to this pattern, the pathomechanisms of osteoporosis in patients with eating disorders differ from those in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. In contrast to the po stmenopausal form, in which both bone reabsorption and bone growth are simultaneously increased (\"high - turnover\" osteoporosis), AN patients show a \"low -turnover\" situation with reduced bone growth and increased reabsorption. Consequently, a lack of estroge n, which is causal for postmenopausal osteoporosis, cannot solely explain the bone metabolism situation of AN patients. 413 As all previous studies have revealed that body weight is the most important determinant of bone density in patients with eating disorde rs, weight normalization and normalization of malnutrition and malnourishment is of the highest priority (Mehler & Mac Kenzie, 2009 ). Therefore, the most effective, and considering the risk/benefit profile best measure, is to achieve an early weight restitution and normalization of eating behavior. The additional supplem entation of calcium and vitamin D can have a supportive effect, especially in the early phase of weight restitution (Gatti et al., 2015 ). Although an oral a pplication of estrogen - gestragen preparations has long been established as a measure in postmenopausal osteoporosis, and in a series of studies, the duration of amenorrhea was found to be a predictor for bone density in patients with AN, previous intervent ion studies with this subgroup did not yield significant effects. Based on a study by Misra (Misra et al., 2011 ), a recent systematic review (Robinson et al., 2017 ) pointed to the option of applying transdermal 17 -\u00df-estradiol with cyclical progesterone application. Based on the data by Misra and Klibansky a transdermal substitution of estrogene should be considered from the age of 12 years on if patients are suffering from long lasting severe AN (see also NICE Guidelines; https://pathways.nice.org.uk/ pathways/eating -disorders ). Estr ogene deficits during this critical time window will later often be associated with a sub -normal peak -bone mass, even if a normalisation of body weight is achieved .. Bone age of patients with AN is often deviant from that of age -mateched controls and thus not very suitable as a parameter of maturity and prognostoc indicator for adult body height. (Misra et al. 2004, Modan -Moses et al. 2012). Besides a direct effect on bone, estrogenes impact on the mechanism of endogenously secreted Growth Hormone (GH) -induced effect on bone and body composition. . Several trials demonstrated that an oral, but not transdermal application affects the metabolic effects of GH in the liver. This leads to an attenuation of the hepatic ICF -1 synthesis with unfavorable consequenc es of the body composition. (Leung et al. 2004). Although a physiological transdermal substitution of estrogenes helps to prevent a further loss of body mass, there is no total catch -up, probably because of additional hormonal deficits with relevance for an increase of bone growth. (Misra et al. 2011). In the subgroup with a bone age below 15 years, the British guidelines recommend considering a substitution of estrogen in increasing dosage. Generally, however, such treatment should only occur in close co operation with an endocrinologist. A regular estrogene - progesterone application should be considered in over 15 -year-old patients, who suffer from more chronic forms of AN whith insufficient weight rehabilitation and who did not resume menses for more than one year. . This recommendation was taken over from the NICE guidelines application should only be reserved for those AN patients in whom the menstrual period i s still absent following weight restitution. In women with AN, a hypothalamic oligo -/amenorrhea may not only be transient but can also persist despite stable weight restoration, which among other things can point to infertility (Dempfle et al. 2013; Kohmur a et al. 1986; Misra & Klibanski 2014). This underlines a further aspect of the necessary follow -up care and can result in an indication for hormonal stimulation and induction of ovulation. In the past few years, further pharmacological substances have be en examined, such as in particular the orally applied bisphosphonate Risedronate, which was prescribed either in a daily dosage of 5mg over 9 months or in a weekly administration of 35mg over 12 months. This substance showed, partly in combination with an additional transdermal testosterone 414 administration, a significant increase in bone density in adult AN patients of up to 4.9% (Miller et al. 2011). However, this approach has only been practised in the frame of clinical trials and, because of missing data . cannot be recommended yet for routine clinical practise. When prescribing this group of substances, therefore, the patient must be clearly informed and warned of the teratogenic effects. Further substances, such as teriparatide, a human parathyroid hormone which must be applied subcutaneously, have also been successfully tested in the group of adult AN patients in first clinical studies (Fazeli et al., 2014 ), although it is still too early to draw any treatment recommendations from individual cases. For male AN patients, there are currently no reliabl e treatment recommendations. In general, male AN patients with a longer illness duration and especially those with a documented reduced bone density, should be urged to avoid sport and exercise that is associated with high weight burden, tendency for falls and thus risk of fracture (so -called high -impact physical activities). 2.5. Cardiovascular complications Besides an increased suicide rate and the direct consequences of malnutrition (including severe infectious diseases), cardiovascular complications are also mentioned as reasons for the increased mortality in AN (Casiero & Frishman, 2006 ). Indeed, at least the indirectly life - threatening cardiovascu lar complications of AN are diverse and pronounced. As patients with bulimia nervosa maintain a normal weight, they are seen as less susceptible to hunger -induced cardiac complications (Casiero & Frishman, 2006 ). Cardiovascular complications mostly arise as a consequence of induced vomiting (Forney et al., 2016 ). 2.5.1. Functional changes Sinus bradycardia (heart rate <60/min) is a typical concomitant symptom in eating disorders. It occurs both in patients with full -blown AN and in patients with atypical AN who still have a normal BMI or in the disease pattern of BN ( Palla & Litt, 1988 ; Sawyer et al., 2016 ; Vo et al., 2016 ). In contrast to training -related bradycardia in sportspersons, a reduced increase in heart rate under physical stress and a reduced physical resilience is found (Nudel et al., 1984 ; Peschel et al., 2016 ). \"Normal\" heart rates between 80 and 90 beats per minute are unusual, especially in severely underweight patients (Spaulding -Barclay et al., 2016 ); these should be evaluated as relative \"tachycardia\" and give rise to respective differential -diagnostic considerations. Bradycardia is understood as the physiological adaptation to the reduced metabolism in the case of low energy intake; an increased vagal tone is suspected to be the main cause (Portilla, 2011 ; Spaulding -Barclay et al., 2016 ). Acute reduction of food intake and rapid weight loss thus have a stronger i nfluence on the metabolic regulation of the heart rate than chronic malnutrition (DiVasta et al., 2010 ). Thus, in AN, the change in heart rate begins during the first year of illness and normalizes agai n as the illness continues (Lesinskiene et al., 2008 ). These principles also hold when examining patients with BN: The vagal activity is dependent on the BMI of the patient and is inversely correlated therewith (Peschel et al., 2016 ). 415 In the framework of bradycardia or increased vagal activity, occasionally escape rhythms are also found, which revert back to a normal sinus rhythm once the heart rate accelerates (Gaudiani & Mehler, 2016 ; Krantz et al., 2011 ). Even in t he case of severe bradycardia, patients generally remain symptom -free in this regard and there is no indication for pacemaker implantation. Furthermore, the literature describes further abnormalities of the heart rhythm such as sinus arrhythmia, AV escape rhythms, increased likelihood of supraventricular but also ventricular extrasystoles and short -lasting paroxysmal supraventricular extrasystoles. More severe arrhythmias which would explain the increased mortality were not observed (DiVasta et al., 2010 ; Roche et al., 2005 ; Roche et al., 2004 ). The QT interval represents the myocardial repolarization. A prolonged QT interval is seen as a risk for sudden death through Torsades -de- pointes (TdP) tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. The sole indication of the measured QT time per se is less meaningful, as the repolarization duration and thus also the m easured QT duration are largely dependent on the heart rate. Therefore, in routine practice, the measured QT duration is converted to a standardized heart rate of 60 beats per minute (QTc interval). There are various correction formulae for this calculatio n, although the formula by the physiologist Bazett is often used. However, this corrects substantially more strongly than other formulae (Rowlands, 201 2) and in comparison, is the poorest at distinguishing patients at risk and those not at risk. For such a classification, by contrast, the Hodges formula has consistently been shown to be the best and also seems to be suitable for anorexic patients; the refore, the evaluation of the QTc interval should be based on this formula (Walter et al., 2015 ). In the investigation of patients with eating disorders, the overall outcome of a meta - analysis on the QTc interval in AN showed a prolongation compared to healthy controls, but no prolongation beyond a normal extent (Lesinskiene et al., 2008 ). Nevertheless, there are reports of a TdP in anorexia nervosa (Isner et al., 1985 ; Rotondi et al., 2010 ), meaning that an individual risk assessment should be undertaken. At particular risk are patients with purging behavior, in whom various mechanisms accumulate which increase the risk of a QT time prolongation (e.g. potassium d epletion due to vomiting and abuse of laxatives or diuretics) (Forney et al., 2016 ; Zenker et al., 2010 ). Similar findings were observed in patients with BN: As long as the electrolytes were in the normal range, the QTc intervals were longer than in a healthy control group, but on average, they did not lie above a limit of 500ms and they remained stable during an inpatient therapy (Nahshoni et al., 2010 ; Takimoto et al., 2004 ). In this respect, the length of the QTc duration appears to be related to the amount of weight lost since disorder onset as well as with psychopathological variables (tension -anxiety score and depression score on the Profile of Mood St ates) (Takimoto et al., 2008 ). The literature reports various thresholds for assessing the individual risk. The best balance between sensitivity and specificity for detecting patients who will develop a TdP was found at a cut -off of >500ms (Chiladakis et al., 2012 ). Both the QT dispersion and the QT variability are described as an independent measure for the risk of sudden cardiac death, although this has yet to be confirmed. QT dispersion is described as the difference between the maximum and minimum duration of the QT interval (Sachs et al., 2016 ): The QT dispersion is higher in anorexia nervosa than in healthy controls 416 and is negatively correlated with the resting metabolic rate. In the framework of refeeding, the QT dispersion decreases. Spontaneo us fluctuations of the QT interval, which reflect the fine temporal variations of ventricular depolarization and repolarization, are described as QT variability. In underweight AN patients, the examination showed an increased QT variability index (QT varia bility normalized in relation to the heart rate variability) in comparison to healthy controls (Koschke et al., 2010 ). After weight normalizati on, by contrast, no difference in the QT variability and normalized QT variability compared to controls was found (Nussinovitch et al., 2012 ). 2.5.2. Structural changes Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a rare, sudden and often severe dysfunction of the heart muscle. The symptoms resemble those of a heart attack and mostly occur directly after an extreme emotional or physical stressor. In the literature, there is a series of case reports on the occurre nce of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy within (mostly severe) AN (Kawano et al., 201 6; Kim et al., 2011 ; Ohwada et al., 2005 ; Rotondi et al., 2010 ; Shimizu et al., 2014 ; Volman et al., 2011 ). In all cases, th e illness was severe and chronic and the body mass index was mostly below 13 kg/m2. The episodes occurred in the framework of an anesthesia, a hypoglycemic coma or within severe hypoglycemia and after a family argument and after spatial separation from th e mother (with complete change in food intake). To date, there are no case reports on the occurrence of Takotsubo syndrome in patients with BN. In cases of severe AN, small to medium pericardial effusions are often found (Docx et al., 2010 ; Frolich et al., 2001 ; Inagaki et al., 2003 ; Kastner et al., 2012 ; Oflaz et al., 2013 ; Ramacciotti et al., 2003 ; Silverman & Krongrad, 1983 ) - this has also been described in a male patient (Shapiro et al., 2014 ). The pericardial effusion is normally clinically inconspicuous and disappears following normalization of weight (Kastner et al., 2012 ; Ramacciotti et a l., 2003 ; Ulger et al., 2006 ), meaning that no specific treatment is necessary. Nevertheless, in rare cases, it can progress to a pericardial tamponade (Kircher et al., 2012 ; Polli et al., 2006 ; Shapiro et al., 2014 ). So far, the pathophysiology is not entirely clear, but Docx et al. suspect a relation between the decrease in pericardial fat and myocardial atrophy (Docx et al., 2010 ). In mitral valve prolap se, one or both leaflets of the mitral valve prolapse systolically in the left atrium. It is a frequent change in the valve apparatus in patients with anorexia. Prevalence rates range from 13% (Hall et al., 1989 ) up to 82.6% in a Japanese cohort (Oka et al., 1987 ). In comparison, the prevalence in a general population sample lay at 2.4% (Freed et al., 1999 ). Mitral valve prolapse in AN is mostly described as mild and asymptomatic and can persist following weight normalization (Olivares et al., 2005 ). Howeve r, the pathological movement of the mitral valve usually normalized following weight normalization (Meyers et al., 1987 ). From a pathophysiological perspective, it is assumed that a valve apparatus that has become too large rel ative to the dystrophic heart muscle is responsible for the occurrence of a mitral prolapse (Cheng, 1989 ). One study found a strong relation between myocardial fibrosis and AN (Oflaz et al., 2013 ). Myocardial fibrosis was found in 9 of 40 examined pati ents; the examined patients were an average of 22.3 years old and had a BMI of 15.3kg/m2. The fibrosis was subendocardial and transmural in segments of the left ventricle. Similar findings emerged in pathological case 417 reports: Lamzabi et al. (2015) describ ed the case of a 47 -year-old female patient with a BMI of 10.3kg/m2. A postmortem showed a diffuse endocardial and intestinal fibrosis with areas of myxoid material and mast cells. An endomyocardial biopsy in a 17 -year-old female patient with a BMI of 17.4 kg/m2 also showed, among other things, a moderate interstitial fibrosis (Takahashi & Mine, 2016 ). Structurally, the heart is substantially smaller in patients with AN. The left ventricular mass, as can be determined with two -dimensional ec hocardiogram, is substantially reduced (Oflaz et al., 2013 ; Olivares et al., 2005 ; Romano et al., 2003 ; Ulger et al., 2006 ) and lies below the parameter of constitutionally thin participants (Galetta et al., 2003 ). Ultimately, however, the ventricular mass increases again when patients eat a sufficient amount, and following weight restitutio n, no longer differs from healthy persons (Olivares et al., 2005 ; Ulger et al., 2006 ). 2.5.3. Hemodynamic and peripheral vascular changes One of the characteristic clinical concomitant symptoms of AN is hypotonia (Gottdiener et al., 1978 ). Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure are reduced (Sachs et al., 2016) . Normal circadian variation is impaired (Oswiecimska et al., 2007 ). Patients with atypical anorexia who still have a no rmal BMI show higher blood pressure values than those with typical anorexia nervosa, although 10% nevertheless show an RR <90mmHg (Sawyer et al., 2016 ). Acrocyanosis is clinically characterized by cold, painless lividly colored acra (often with hyperhidrosis and hypothermia. It manifests symmetrically, predominantly on the hands and feet (often also nose, cheeks and ears) and does not occur paroxysmally (Kurklinsky et al., 2011 ). In anorexia nervosa, the prevalence of acrocyanosis lies at 21 -40% (in questionnaires up to 81%). (Bhanji & Mattingly, 1991 ; Hediger et al., 2000 ; Schulze et al., 1999 ; Strumia et al., 2001 ). Independently of the time of year, it disappears with increasing body weight (Hediger et al., 2000 ). In extreme cases, acrocyanosis can lead to acral necrosis (Launay et al., 2000 ). 2.6. Gastrointestinal complications Binge eating episodes as part of AN, BN or BED lead to a quite significant, unphysiological mechanical stress of the upper digestive tract, which in turn can lead to considerable and severe complications. In rare cases, perforations of the esophagus or stomach ruptures can occur (Abdu et al., 1987 ; Evans, 1968 ; Saul et al., 1981 ). Binge eating, by contrast, can also lead to stomach dilatation (Barada et al., 2006 ; Brook, 1977 ; Evans, 1968 ; Gruner, 1977 ; Mitche ll et al., 1982 ; Stheneur et al., 1995 ), which even withou t perforation can lead to complications such as ischemia and necroses. Stomach necroses with perforation are also described in AN without relation to binge eating (Arie et al., 2008 ). Through the recurrent vomiting and the more frequent acid contact of the epithelium of the lower esophagus, reflux problems are very frequent, and in many cases, esophagitis occurs (Aframian et al., 2010 ; Brown & Mehler, 2013 ; Denholm & Jankowski, 2011 ). By contrast, squamous cell carcinomas, which occur based on esophagitis caused by recurrent induced vomiting, are a rarity (Dessureault et al., 2002 ). 418 Functional gastrointestinal complaints are a regular concomitant symptom of eating disorders, and are most frequent in AN. In BN, they ar e somewhat rarer (Hadley & Walsh, 2003 ; Waldholtz & Andersen, 1990 ) and relatively most rare in BED (Crowell et al., 1994 ). The most frequently mentioned complaints are postprandial feelings of fullness and epigastric pain, a bloated abdomen and constipation (Waldholtz & Andersen, 1990 ). The often very pronounced complaints improve with remission of the eating disorder symptoms. Frequently, however, a symptomatic medicatio n treatment is necessary and requested by the patient. The increased occurrence of a sometimes very severe constipation with anorexia nervosa (Chiarioni et al., 2000 ; Chun et al., 1997 ; Waldholtz & Andersen, 1990 ) is like ly multicausal in nature. Reasons for the reduced stool frequency include the reduced stool mass, an often co -occurring hypokalemia and hypothyroid metabolic state. In view of the diverse endocrinological changes associated with a too low body weight and d isordered eating behavior, however, other causes are also likely to be found. The functional gastrointestinal complaints are associated with abnormal transit time (Kamal et al., 1991 ), motility (Stacher et al., 1993 ) and gastric electr ical activity (Ogawa et al., 2004 ). Although such findings suggest the use of pro kinetic agents such as domperidone (Russell et al., 1983 ), metoclopramide (Saleh & Lebwohl, 1980 ) or cisapride (Stacher et al., 1993 ) and give rise to the assumption of affecting both a reduction of the burden of gastroi ntestinal symptoms and a facilitation of weight gain, in practice, their use is disappointing. The effects on gastrointestinal symptoms are low and with regard to weight, no effects are found in practice. The increase of transminases is, dependent on the l evel of malnutrition, a frequent accompanying symptom, especially in AN (Bridet et al., 2014 ; Dowman et al., 2010 ; Goh & Lee, 2015 ; Hanachi et al., 2013 ; Ramsoekh et al., 2014 ; Rautou et al., 2008 ; Smith et al., 2013 ). In the case of severe anorexia nervosa (BMI < 15) transminases are increased in the m ajority of cases (Rautou et al., 2008 ; Tsukamoto et al., 2008 ). (As vitamin B12 is stored in the hepatocytes, a paradoxical increase in serum vitamin B12 is normally found in such patients (Corbetta et al., 2015 )). Autophagy is a cellular process which can be induced by lack of energy to contribute to the survival of the organism. Cell autophagy can be observed in plant and animal organisms in emergency situations and takes place throughout t he body. The increase in transminases indicates that autophagy particularly concerns the liver cells. Liver cell biopsies in AN have no significance for further treatment. In the cases in which biopsies were conducted, no liver cell necroses were found, bu t an increased sinusoidal fibrosis was found. Liver cells show increases in autophagosomes (Rautou et al., 2008 ). In clinical terms, the process of liver autophagy can lead to hepatic insufficiency or even liver failure (Dowman et al., 2010 ; Rosen et al., 2017 ; Sakada et al., 2006 ; Yoshida et al., 2010 ). 2.7. Dental health and eating disorders The most frequent damage to the teeth in AN and BN arises due to the effect of acid on the teeth. Through the regurgitation of the stomach contents when vomiting, the critical pH value of 5.5 is not reached, leading to damage to the tooth enamel (Milosevic & Slade, 1989 ). Clear clinical symptoms of tooth erosions which can be induced by frequent vomiting are only 419 observable after one to two years. At that point, especially on the palatina l and occlusal tooth surfaces in the upper jaw, marked loss of hard tooth structures of enamel and dentine are found, which are also described as \" perimolysis\" (Hellstrom, 1977 ). If vomiting occurs directly before going to sleep, the exposure to acids is potentiated, as the acid remains in the oral cavity for longer and salivation is minimal during sleep. The typical erosions in eating disorders hav e a soft, waxy surface. These can be accompanied by exposure of dentine or pulp, strong hypersensitivities, a thinning of the incisal edges and ultimately by a decline in the vertical dimension of the jaw. The progressive loss of hard tooth substance can l ead to margins of restoration rising above the tooth level. Often, patients brush their teeth after vomiting. When brushing, the tooth surface which has been softened by the acids is removed all the more, thus additionally accelerating the loss of hard too th substance. Vestibular erosions on the teeth in conjunction with eating disorders are found in those patients who are additionally triggered by extrinsic factors such as one -sided nutrition with citrus fruits or glucose in order to assuage the feeling of hunger. Patients with BN further show a higher prevalence of caries (Ohrn et al., 1999 ; Ohrn & ngmar -Mansson, 2000 ). The excessive intake of fermentable carbohydrates during eating episodes and a reduced salivation are discussed as reasons for the increased prevalence of caries. Furthermore, during fasting, the phosphate concentration in saliva is reduced, and an increased plaque formation can be observed. As such, the dimineralized enamel caused by the attack from acid appears to be more sensitive to cariogenic noxious substances. Due to recurrent vomiting, but also due to abuse of diuretics and laxatives, the sa liva production is reduced. The resulting xerostomia , however, is also found in severe anorexia and with the intake of antidepressants, especially those with a tricyclic structure (Montecchi et al., 2003 ). Moreover, patients with AN show an increased likelihood of gingivitis and periodontosis as an expression of the poor nutritional state (Touyz et al., 1993 ). Through the strong vagal stimulation, in the case of recurrent vomiting, a clear enlargement of the parotid and sublingual glands is often found, which is generally pain -free (Mignogna et al., 2004 ; Moorthy et al., 1998 ). The associated visual swelling of the parotid glands is perceived as disfiguring by some patients. In most cases, this visible swelling of the salivary glands disappears once the patient has no longer vomited for a lengthy amount of time. The optimal preventive protection against tooth erosion is to avoid contact of the teeth with erosive noxious substances such as acid -containing drinks and foods, and to cease vomiting. In many cases, this is only achieved under psychotherapeutic treatment. As long as abnormal eating behavior persists, measures should be taken to protect dental health. After vomiting, a short -term decrease in the pH value on the tooth sur faces occurs, particularly the palatinal surfaces of the upper front teeth. Therefore, it is especially important to inform the patient that the teeth should not be brushed directly after contact with acid, and instead , the mouth should be rinsed with wate r. Furthermore, it is recommended to rinse the mouth with acid -neutralizing fluids such as sodium bicarbonate, baking powder or antacids, which are first dissolved in water, in order to achieve an increase in the pH value and a buffering of acids in the mo uth. The patient can achieve a further chemical protection of the teeth, for example, by chewing sugar -free, urea -containing gum, which brings about an alkalization of the acidic 420 saliva. Additionally, chewing gum stimulates salivation, which also increases the buffering capacity of saliva. Through the treatment of tooth enamel with a solution or coating containing sodium fluoride, the erosion resistance of the enamel can be increased. Fluoride -containing mouth rinses or toothpastes also contribute to this. The re -hardening of erosive -softened tooth enamel can also be accelerated by the consumption of milk or cheese. Mechanical protection can be achieved be sealing the tooth surfaces or by recommending a tooth -covering plastic brace to protect against the ex posure to acids, although this recommendation is certainly difficult to realize. In the case of more severe hard tooth substance defects, conservational or prosthetic measures to protect the teeth and restore masticatory function are indicated. An avoidanc e of erosive noxious substances is based on the therapeutically guided normalization of eating behavior. Literature Abdu, R. A., Garritano, D., & Culver, O. (1987).
