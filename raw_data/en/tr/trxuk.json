Between so many different kinds of self-care and essential oils, the topics often feel overwhelming, and many are unsure of where to start. When it comes to essential oils, many are aware of the benefits of diffusing them. But did you know there are other ways you can incorporate them into your self-care routine? Try these DIY essential oil recipes when you're in need of some self-care! What is So Great About Essential Oils Again? To be clear, essential oils are the oils extracted from various plants. They are typically used in aromatherapy, a way of enhancing a person's well-being by helping to balance the body, mind, and spirit. Aromatherapy is most often done through either smell or through topical application to the skin in conjunction with a carrier oil. Which Ones Do I Use and When Do I Use Them? Different oils have different uses and benefits. Some essential oils can be used to improve sleep quality or uplift mood. While others increase energy or reduce anxiety or depression. Others even provide pain relief, reduce inflammation, and more! Essential oils can tend to both physical ailments and emotional well-being! That's why they're such an effective self-care tool. Here are some of our favorites: Mood-Boosting - sweet orange, peppermint, grapefruit, lemon Mental Clarity - rosemary, juniper berry, clary sage, basil, lemon Stress and Anxiety Relief - lavender, chamomile, ylang-ylang, bergamot, rose, lavender, jasmine, cedarwood, Cleansing - peppermint, tea tree, eucalyptus, clary sage Anti-Bacterial - tea tree, grapefruit, cinnamon, eucalyptus, thyme, lemon Anti-Inflammatory - peppermint, spruce, lavender, bergamot Sleep - lavender, vetiver, chamomile, marjoram, sandalwood 5 Self-Care Essential Oil DIY Recipes 1. DIY Skin Care Skincare routines have fallen under the self-care umbrella. Having a skincare routine can be that much needed \"me\" time, that allows a person to focus solely on themselves. Many are drawn to it because it can help a person feel more confident in their skin. However, this kind of care is more than just \"skin-deep\". Allowing yourself to be your own priority once or twice a day can begin to build other healthy habits. You can make a number of skincare products with essential oils. And making your own lotions, serums, scrubs, and balms are nice because you know exactly what's going on your skin. Here's one of our favorites: Mix 1 drop of [Lavender](https://ecomodernessentials.com.au/products/lavender-essential-oil) and 1 drop of [Frankincense](https://ecomodernessentials.com.au/products/frankincense-essential-oil) with [Jojoba oil](https://ecomodernessentials.com.au/collections/diy/products/jojoba-carrier-oil). Apply to face as a moisturizer. This is a beautiful and luxurious ritual that will help regenerate, tone and hydrate the skin throughout the night. You can also mix jojoba oil with a few drops of your desired essential oil for a soothing overall body moisturizer! 2. DIY Bath, Shower, or Soak When taking a bath, you can buy or make [bath bombs with essential oils](https://www.recipeswithessentialoils.com/homemade-bath-bomb/). Or you can simply drop 2 oz of carrier oil (like coconut or jojoba) with 15-20 drops of your favorite essential oils - we suggest lavender or wild orange! And as an added bonus, your skin is going to feel super smooth and soft from the carrier oil once you towel off! For the shower, try putting a few drops on both the floor and wall or your shower for an extra boost. You can even put a few drops on a washcloth or loofah to intensify the experience. If a bath or shower feels like too much, you can also draw a simple foot soak to help ease and wash off the tension of the day If you have dry, cracked, heavy or aching feet, you can treat yourself to a foot soak. Add two drops of either lavender, eucalyptus, chamomile, or peppermint to a bowl of warm water. Submerge your feet and let them soak for 15 minutes. Once the time is up, dry your feet off and give yourself a quick foot massage with your favorite lotion and a drop of lavender! 3. DIY Essential Oil Roll-Ons One of the best ways to enjoy essential oils on the go is by using them in a roller bottle. You'll need a carrier oil in order to dilute your blend and avoid skin irritation. The formula is pretty simple: - Get some roller bottles ( [try these!](https://www.gotoilsupplies.com/gemstone-clear-essential-oil-roller-bottles-with-black-lids/)) - Add 10-15 drops of your chosen essential oils - Fill the rest of the bottle with your carrier oil That's it! Roll-ons are fun because they allow you to experiment and come up with your own unique blends! For stress relief, try oils like lavender, peppermint, and sweet orange. If you're looking to recenter and focus, try frankincense and cinnamon. You can keep these at your work desk, in your bag, or even in your car to deal with that after work, rush hour traffic! 4. DIY Essential Oil Sprays Sprays can be a good substitute if you don't have (or don't want to purchase) a diffuser. They can help give you a quick, fresh boost to help you be mindful of the present. As a base again, you will need: - A glass spray bottle - Fill it with 3/4 cup of water - 2 tablespoons of rubbing alcohol - 15-20 drops of your chosen essential oils Just like the roll-ons, you can have fun experimenting with sprays. We love this DIY recipe for a blend that stimulates the positivity of a walk in the woods: - 4 drops [Vetiver](https://www.amazon.com/doTERRA-Vetiver-essential-Oil-15/dp/B004O2912I/ref=sr_1_6?keywords=vertiver+oil&qid=1558368318&s=gateway&sr=8-6) - 10 drops [Cedarwood](https://www.amazon.com/doTERRA-Cedarwood-Essential-Oil-Relaxation/dp/B00GUSF31M/ref=sr_1_13?keywords=cedarwood+oil&qid=1558368348&s=gateway&sr=8-13) - 6 drops [Frankincense](https://www.amazon.com/doTERRA-Frankincense-Essential-Oil-Diffusion/dp/B003I6Q3IG/ref=sr_1_10?crid=2NVI5H1MULEKX&keywords=frankincense+oil&qid=1558368406&s=gateway&sprefix=frankencense+oil%2Caps%2C136&sr=8-10) 5. DIY Essential Oil Massage A quick aromatherapy massage on your arms, chest, and legs can do wonders. It can help warm muscles and get your blood moving. And it can also help soothe ragged nerves to help you re-center. You can do this with a friend or partner or on your own. In a small bowl, prep two ounces of lotion or carrier oil. Add 2 drops of petitgrain, 4 drops of Bergamot, and 1 drop of Ylang Ylang. Mix well. Then using your thumbs and palms, massage the mixture into your skin in small circular motions. Press into any areas of tension and make sure to utilize your breath for maximum relaxation vibes. This is a great tool to help you calm down and settling into sleep.
