Vitamin K2 is a powerful addition to this supplement as it helps enhance the absorption of Vitamin D3. - Organic Astragalus: Rooted in TCM, astragalus root is known as an overall health supporter. Specific benefits include boosting the immune system, supporting healthy aging, increasing energy, and promoting heart health. - Bovine liver: Derived from pasture-raised New Zealand cattle, the bovine liver in this Vitamin D supplement is a powerful superfood.
