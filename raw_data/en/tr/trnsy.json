Every culture and ancient civilization used plants to heal. Even today around 75% of the world's population, especially those in developing countries, relies on herbal medicine. The ancient Chinese developed herbal medicine thousands of years ago, as one of the five branches of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Acupuncture was developed first, over 4000 years ago. Today, acupuncture and herbal medicine are often used together to enhance their effects. In general, herbs treat internal medical problems more successfully than functional or structural musculoskeletal problems, which are better suited to acupuncture therapy. Herbs can be used to good effect alone, particularly in those few animals who will not tolerate acupuncture, for example to treat behavioural problems such as aggression. "}
