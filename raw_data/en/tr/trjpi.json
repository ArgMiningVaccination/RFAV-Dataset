Biomedical scientists focus on how cells, organs and systems function in the human body. Their work is an important element in our understanding and treatment of human diseases. This course introduces a broad range of theory, including studies in anatomy, physiology, microbiology, immunology, genetics, biochemistry and biomedical ethics, while giving you extensive practical experience in cutting edge laboratories, located in our purpose-built $50m Science building. As a Biomedical Science graduate, you can also continue on to specialise in one of these fields: medical science, medical microbiology, genetics, haematology, histopathology, anthropology, cytology, human biology, immunology, medicine, nutrition science, biochemistry, data science, clinical chemistry or evolutionary medicine.

In my three years of studies, I was allowed to take units that interested me as electives, while also completing compulsory (core) units. It enhanced my whole study experience. The atmosphere at ECU is inclusive and has a community feeling to it. I feel safe and a sense of belonging when I am at ECU. Lecturers are also very engaging and approachable which helped me keep track in my studies. They are knowledgeable and passionate about the things they do. - I could not have asked for a better university experience There was a great balance of laboratory and practical work at ECU, alongside the theory and lectures. I now have a strong understanding of the human body, and with extensive practical experience, I believe I can transition into studying medicine. I could not have asked for a better university experience to prepare me for the next step in my life and career. - My experience at ECU has exceeded my expectations in many ways. From my very first week at ECU, I felt motivated and encouraged that I would do well. The lecturers are the best part of my study experience at ECU. They have always been supportive and helpful. I did not know that I would have the opportunity to learn so much about the practical side of biomedical science. I was aware there would be laboratory sessions but what I learnt was so much more. Quick guide to uni-speak - - ATAR is the Australian Tertiary Admission Rank, the primary criterion for entry into most undergraduate university courses in Australia. The ATAR is a percentile score which denotes a student's ranking relative to their state-wide peers upon completion of their secondary education. - CRICOS is the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students. A CRICOS code is allocated to education institutions (like ECU) who are approved to recruit, enrol and deliver education to overseas students. Courses with a CRICOS code are available to international students who meet the entry requirements. - A major, or unit set, is your chosen area of in-depth study in an undergraduate course. It usually involves 8 units of study, or one-third of the units in a 3-year degree. Talk to your Student Information Office if you need help choosing a major subject. - Minors include between 4 and 6 study units in a specific discipline. Not all courses require you to complete a minor. Your minor subject doesn't appear on your printed degree (parchment), but is part of your academic transcript. - If you're enrolled in 3 or more units in a semester this is considered full-time study. To complete most 3-year degrees studying full-time you'll need to complete 4 units per semester, i.e. 24 units over 3 years. - If a course is available to study part-time you can generally expect it to take twice as long to complete as it would in full-time mode. Part-time students are enrolled in 1 or 2 units maximum per semester. Note: International students who hold a student visa can only choose the full-time study option for our courses. This is to ensure the course is completed within the duration of the student visa. - - - Most courses start in Semester 1 each year, usually in the last week of February. Some courses can be started in Semester 2 (we call this mid-year). There's a week of Orientation before each semester to help you get used to uni life. - A lot of our courses start in Semester 2 each year, usually in the last week of July. We call this mid-year. There's a week of Orientation beforehand to help you get used to uni life. - We use a points system to make it easier for you to understand your study progress. Most Bachelors degree study units are allocated 15 credit points. If you're studying a 3-year full-time degree you'll need to successfully complete 360 credit points - that's 24 units x 15 points per unit. - These are compulsory units you have to successfully complete as part of your course. - An elective is a unit you choose to study that counts towards your course requirements, but isn't compulsory. For some courses we recommend elective units. In some situations, a course coordinator may approve an elective unit as a replacement for a compulsory one. - Quick guide to uni-speak - - ATAR is the Australian Tertiary Admission Rank, the primary criterion for entry into most undergraduate university courses in Australia.
