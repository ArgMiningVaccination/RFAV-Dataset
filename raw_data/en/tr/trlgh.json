Offer Statistics and Expected Timetable Not applicable. Item 3. Key Information 3.A [Reserved] 3.B Capitalization and indebtedness Not applicable. 3.C Reasons for the offer and use of proceeds Not applicable. 23.D Risk Factors Principal risks and uncertaintiesWe outline below the principal risks and uncertainties relevant to GSK's business, financial condition and operations that may affect our performance and ability to achieve our objectives. These are the risks that we believe could cause our actual result s to differ materially from expected and historical results. Operating in the biopharmaceutical sector carries various inherent risks and uncertainties that may affect our business. We must comply with a broad range of laws and regulations which apply to the research and development, manufacturing, testing, approval, distribution, sales, and marketing of pharmaceutical and vaccine products. These affect the cost of product development, the time required to reach the market and the likelihood of doing so successfully on an uninterrupted basis. As rules and regulations change, government interpretation evolves, and our business activities develop, the nature of a particular risk may also alter. Changes to regulatory regimes may be substantial. Any alteration in, and failure to comply with , applicable laws and regulations could materially and adversely affect our financial results. Similarly, our global business exposes us to litigation and government investigations, including product liability litigation, patent and antitrust litigation and sales and marketing litigation. Litigation and government investigations, and the related provisions we may make for unfavourable outcomes and increases in related costs such as insurance premiums, could alsomaterially and adversely affect our financial results. More detail on the status and various uncertainties in our significant unresolved disputes and potential litigation is set out in Note 47, 'Legal proceedings' on pages 265 to 267 of the GSK Annual Report 2022, which is incorporated by reference herein. Patient safety Risk definition The risk that GSK, including our third parties, potentially fails to appropriately collect, review, follow up, or report human safety information, including adverse events, from all potential sources or that GSK potentially fails to act on any relevant findings in a timely manner. Risk impact GSK will not tolerate an unfavourable benefit-to-risk profile for patients who use our products. As the most important consequence of ineffective pharmacovigilance is the potential for harm to patients, we maintain robust processes for managing human safety information, conducting timely safety signal detection, and ensuring appropriate measures are inplace to manage risks to patients. GSK also intends to fully comply with pharmacovigilance and other relevant regulations worldwide. Non-compliance could result in inspection findings, regulatory scrutiny, civil or criminal sanctions and either temporary or permanent loss of product marketing authorisation. We regularly review and respond to all patient safety risks tolimit the potential for reputational damage, loss of trust by patients and healthcare providers, product-related litigation, an d loss of shareholder confidence. Context We are fully accountable for safeguarding patients; our failure to do so effectively could result most importantly in harm to patients, as well as reputational damage and/or product liability litigation. We conduct internal safety surveillance and rely on access to safety information from external sources. Information on the safety and efficacy of our products in humans is collected during clinical development, with more comprehensive information incorporated from real-world use once our products are marketed. There are examples of regulatory agencies using real-world evidence from sources which may not beaccessible to the industry to supplement and validate the evidence we use to support the safety and efficacy of our products. There is a potential emerging risk that technology companies or other data custodians may similarly draw and communicate conclusions about the safety of our products based on digital health data collected through their platforms that is inaccessibl e by either the industry or regulatory agencies. Our licence to operate depends on our compliance with regulatory requirements worldwide, not only those directly related to patient safety but extending to privacy and information security regulations as well. Regulatory compliance depends on appropriate identification and management of human safety information by all employees and third parties acting on ourbehalf. We are pursuing innovative solutions to enhance our ability to perform pharmacovigilance, including ArtificialIntelligence and Machine Learning technology to augment our capacity to manage increasing volumes of adverse eventreports from varied sources, and advancing technical solutions for delivering safety information and risk minimisationmeasures to patients and health care providers. The COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on pharmacovigilance activities by increasing public focus on safety and efficacy of medicines and vaccines, highlighting the importance of robust business continuity planning for uninterrupted safetyoversight and regulatory compliance (including the ability to accommodate remote regulatory inspections), and acceleratingautomation to manage increasing volumes of adverse events. Product quality Risk definitionThe risk that GSK or our third parties potentially fail to ensure appropriate controls and governance of quality for developmen t and commercial products; compliance with industry practices and regulations in manufacturing and distribution activities; andterms of GSK product licenses and supporting regulatory activities. Risk impact A failure to ensure product quality could have far-reaching implications for patient safety, cause product launch delays, drug shortages or product recalls, and have regulatory, legal, and financial consequences. These could materially and adversely affect GSK's reputation and financial results. 3Context The external environment for product quality remains challenging, with increased cyber-attacks and data breaches across the industry. Cyber-attacks remain a key risk to the integrity of product quality data and its audit trail. We met our commitments for the 2021 European Medicines Agency (EMA) requirements for licensing of Medical Devices. We continue to plan for thedeployment of the New Annex 1 guidance for the manufacture of Sterile Medicinal products which was published in September 2022 and sets an expectation for compliance by August 2023. We are actively managing this implementation in the context of global equipment and component supply chain constraints affecting the industry. We are increasingly applying advanced digital technologies and insights to drive scientific excellence to enhance the development, manufacture and testingof our products. For example, we use new electronic documentation systems and advanced laboratory information management tools. Our quality organisations are aligned to make sure quality procedures and governance can facilitate the new company strategy. Pre-pandemic levels of on-site inspections have resumed, and we continue to take steps to ensureour inspection readiness. Financial controls and reporting Risk definition The risk that GSK fails to comply with current tax laws, fails to report accurate financial information in compliance with accounting standards and applicable legislation, or incurs significant losses due to treasury activities. Risk impact Non-compliance with existing or new financial or new ESG reporting and disclosure requirements, or changes to the recognition of income and expenses, could expose GSK to litigation and regulatory action and could materially and adverselyaffect our financial results. Failure to comply with changes in the substance or application of the laws governing transfer pricing, dividends, tax credits and intellectual property could also materially and adversely affect our financial results. Fai lure to comply with applicable sanctions laws and regulations could result in GSK being investigated by relevant government agencies and authorities and/or in legal proceedings against us. Government investigations and litigation, can be unpredictable and regardless of their outcome, may be costly, require significant management attention, and damage ourreputation. Inconsistent application of treasury policies, transactional or settlement errors, or counterparty defaults could l ead to significant losses. Context We are required by the laws of various jurisdictions to publicly disclose our financial results and events that could materiall y affect the Group's financial results. Regulators routinely review the financial statements of listed companies for compliancewith new, revised, or existing accounting and regulatory requirements. We believe that we comply with the appropriate regulatory requirements concerning our financial statements and the disclosure of material information, including any transactions relating to business restructuring such as acquisitions and divestitures. However, should we be subject to aninvestigation into potential non-compliance with accounting and disclosure requirements, this could lead to restatements of previously reported results and significant penalties. Our Treasury group deals daily in high value transactions, mostly foreign exchange, and cash management transactions. These transactions involve market volatility and counterparty risk. The Group's effective tax rate reflects the locations of ou r activities and the value they generate, which determine the jurisdictions in which profits arise and the applicable tax rates. These may be higher or lower than the UK statutory rate and may reflect regimes that encourage innovation and investment in R&D by providing tax incentives which, if changed, could affect GSK's tax rate. In addition, the worldwide nature of our operations means that our cross-border supply routes, necessary to ensure supplies of medicines and vaccines, can result inconflicting claims from tax authorities as to the profits to be taxed in individual countries. This can lead to double taxation , with profits taxed in more than one country. The complexity of tax regulations also means that we may occasionally disagree with tax authorities on the technical interpretation of a particular area of tax law. The tax charge included in our financialstatements is our best estimate of tax liability pending any audits by tax authorities. We expect there to be a continued focus on tax reform, driven by initiatives by the OECD and the EC to address the tax challenges arising from digitalisation of the economy. Together with domestic initiatives around the world, these may result in significant changes to established taxprinciples and an increase in tax authority disputes. Regardless of their merit or outcomes, these may be costly, divertmanagement attention and adversely impact our reputation and relationship with key stakeholders. Laws, regulations, ordersand other measures restrict dealings with certain countries, governments, government officials, entities, individuals, use offinancial institutions and movement of funds. Circumvention of sanctions and export controls can be a criminal offence andGSK has a zero tolerance policy for breaches of its sanctions obligations. While we believe the Group complies with allapplicable sanctions in all material respects, such laws are complex and continue to evolve rapidly. Anti-bribery and corruption (ABAC) Risk definitionThe risk that GSK or our third parties potentially fail to comply with applicable laws, regulations, or internal requirements a nd to ensure appropriate controls and governance over bribery and corruption in business activities. Risk impact Failure to mitigate this risk could expose GSK and associated persons to governmental investigation, regulatory action, and civil and criminal liability. It may compromise GSK's ability to supply its products under certain government contracts. Inaddition, failure to prevent bribery or corruption could have substantial implications for GSK's reputation and the credibility of senior leaders. It might erode investor confidence in our governance, risk management and future performance, and have a consequential negative impact on share performance. It could also lead to the imposition of significant financial penalties andthe imposition of additional reporting obligations. 4Context There continues to be a strong enforcement appetite for foreign bribery investigations and prosecutions, with a particular focus on the conduct of multinational companies wherever they operate. Financial penalties handed down in provencorruption cases are often very significant. Disruption to global supply chains and the commercial pressures caused by higher than usual inflation rates are likely to increase the risks of bribery and corruption in certain contexts. However, greater transparency and collaboration among enforcement authorities, advances in technology and the use of data analytics are providing better platforms to streamline processes and detect potential issues. Commercial practices Risk definitionThe risk that GSK or our third parties potentially engage in commercial activities that fail to comply with laws, regulations, industry codes, and internal controls and requirements. Risk impact Failure to engage in activities that are consistent with the letter and spirit of the law, industry regulations, or the Group's requirements relating to sales and promotion of medicines and vaccines; with appropriate interactions with healthcareprofessionals (HCPs), organisations and patients; with legitimate and transparent transfers of value; and with pricing and competition (or antitrust) regulations in commercial practices, including trade channel activities and business tendering, coul d materially and adversely affect our ability to deliver our strategy and long-term priorities. Additionally, it may result inincomplete awareness of the risk/benefit profile of our products and possibly suboptimal treatment of patients and consumers; governmental investigation, regulatory action and legal proceedings brought against the Group by governmental and private plaintiffs which could result in government sanctions, and criminal and/or financial penalties. Any practices that are found tobe misaligned with our values and expectations could also result in reputational harm and dilute the trust established with external stakeholders. Context We operate in a highly regulated and extremely competitive biopharma industry, amongst peers who make significant product innovations and technical advances and intensify price competition. Additional external factors impacting our businessoperations include the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 global pandemic, access limitations to our customers, macroeconomic inflationary dynamics, and pricing pressure across markets. To achieve our strategic objectives, we mustcontinue to develop commercially viable new products and deliver additional uses for existing products that address the needsof patients, consumers, HCPs and payers. Financially, new products/indications carry with them an uncertainty with regards to future success. Product development is costly, lengthy, and uncertain, and carries with it the potential for failure at any sta ge. Even after successful product development, we face challenges in how we launch, and our competitors' products or pricing strategies could render our assets less competitive. We support product innovation through our continued focus on both in-person and virtual engagement, with a constant focus on our patient. Once we have an approved medicine or vaccine, it is our obligation to provide important information to the healthcare community in various ways, always in a responsible, legal, and ethical manner. Appropriate product promotion ensures HCPs have access to the information they need, that patients and consumers have the facts about the medicines and vaccines they require, and that products are prescribed, recommended, or used in a manner that provides healthcare benefit. We arecommitted to the ethical and responsible commercialisation of our products in support of our purpose to improve the quality of human life and get ahead of disease together. Scientific and patient engagement Risk definitionThe risk that GSK or our third parties potentially fail to engage externally to gain insights, educate and communicate on the science of our medicines and associated disease areas, and provide grants and donations in a legitimate and transparentmanner compliant with laws, regulations, industry codes and internal controls and requirements. Risk impact Without controls in place, the risk could result in real, perceived, or disguised promotion including off-label and prior- authorisation promotion, and real or perceived provision of medical advice. This in turn could lead to criminal investigations and penalties, civil litigation, or competitor complaints. At the same time, if we do not engage fully and appropriately, this could result in patient harm, failure to advance science and innovation, reputational damage, and financial loss. Such consequencesmay reduce the trust of the public, patients, healthcare professionals, payers, regulators and governments. Context Scientific and patient engagements are diverse non-promotional activities directed at healthcare professionals, patients, payers, and external stakeholders. Such engagements aim to improve patient care through the exchange or provision of knowledge on the use of our products and related diseases. Scientific and patient engagement with external stakeholder groups is vital to GSK, as a research-based biopharma company that is ambitious for patients and is necessary to advancescience and medicine. We expect our activities to be scientifically sound and accurate, conducted ethically and transparently, and compliant with applicable codes, laws, and regulations. There are many industry and local codes and laws and other regulations that apply (such as Privacy, Data integrity). That means measured risk-taking, rooted in sound ethical considerations, and principles-based decision-making, training, communication, and monitoring of such activities are key to managing the risk and enabling full and appropriate engagement. 5Data ethics and privacy Risk definitionThe risk that GSK or our third parties potentially fail to ethically collect; use; re-use through artificial intelligence, data analytics or automation; secure; share and destroy personal information in accordance with laws, regulations, and internal controls and requirements. Risk impact Non-compliance with data privacy laws globally could lead to harm to individuals and GSK. It could also damage trust between GSK and individuals, communities, business partners and government authorities. Many countries have increasedthe enforcement powers of their data protection authorities by allowing them to impose significant fines, impact cross-border data flows, or temporarily ban data processing. Many new national laws also enable individuals to bring collective legal actions against companies such as GSK for failure to follow data privacy laws. Context Data protection and privacy legislation is diverse, with limited global harmonisation or simplification. It is challenging for multinationals to standardise their approach to compliance with data privacy laws. Governments are enforcing compliance with data protection and privacy laws more rigorously. The approach and focus of data protection and privacy regulators also differs between regions and countries, which further creates challenges for global organisations seeking to implement a singleharmonised global privacy programme. Increases in the volume of data processed and advances in technology have resulted in a greater focus on data governance and the ethical use of personal information, over and above compliance with data privacy laws. Companies seeking to foster innovation in artificial intelligence and other new technologies are faced with evolving decisions from global policymakers onhow best to promote trust in these systems and avoid unintended outcomes or harmful impacts. Additionally, there are a number of emerging laws concerning the localisation of data, restrictions on international transfers and data security, which are changing existing frameworks that GSK has previously relied upon. This increasing trend for data sovereignty affects our ability to drive medical innovation and to effectively operate internationally. Research practices Risk definitionThe risk that GSK or our third parties potentially fail to adequately conduct ethical and credible pre-clinical and clinical research, collaborate in research activities compliant with laws, regulations, and internal controls and requirements. Risk impact The potential impacts of the risk include harm to human subjects, reputational damage, failure to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for our products, governmental investigation, legal proceedings brought against the GSK by governmental and private plaintiffs (product liability suits and claims for damages), loss of revenue due to inadequate patent protection or inability to supply our products, and regulatory action such as fines, penalties, or loss of product authorisatio n. Poor data integrity and governance could compromise GSK's R&D efforts and negatively impact our reputation. Any of thesecould materially and adversely affect our financial results and damage the trust of patients and customers. Context Research involving animals can raise ethical concerns. In many cases, however, research involving animals is the only way to investigate the effects of a potential new medicine in a living body other than in humans. Animal research provides critical information about the causes and mechanisms of diseases and therefore remains a vital part of our research. We continuallyseek ways in which we can minimise our use of animals in research, development, and testing, while complying with regulatory requirements and reducing the impact on the animals used. Human subject research is critical to assessing anddemonstrating the safety and efficacy of our investigational products or further evaluating our products once they have beenapproved. This research includes clinical trials in healthy volunteers and patients and adheres to regulations and high ethical , medical, and scientific standards. We disclose the results of this research externally regardless of whether they reflect positively or negatively on our products, so that the scientific community can learn from the outcomes of our research. Wealso work with human biological samples which are fundamental to the discovery, development, and safety monitoring of our products. We are committed to managing human biological samples in accordance with relevant laws, regulations, and ethical principles, and in a manner that respects the interests of sample donors. Data is pivotal to our R&D strategy, and we aremaximising the use of data to serve patients. Governing our data in accordance with relevant laws, regulations, contractualobligations, expectations, and our culture across privacy, information security, and data integrity is essential. We use a wide variety of biological materials in the discovery, research, and development of our assets. Through the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the Nagoya Protocol, the international community has established a globalframework regulating access to, and use of, genetic resources of non-human origin in research and development. We support the principles of access to, and benefit-sharing of, genetic resources as outlined in the CBD and the Nagoya Protocol. Wealso recognise the importance of appropriate, effective, and proportionate implementation measures at national and regionallevels. Environment, health, and safety (EHS) Risk definitionThe risk that GSK or our third parties potentially fail to ensure appropriate controls and governance of the organisation's assets, facilities, infrastructure, and business activities, including execution of hazardous activities, handling of hazardousmaterials, or release of substances harmful to the environment that disrupts supply or harms employees, third parties or the environment. 6Risk impact Failure to manage EHS risks could lead to significant harm to people, the environment and the communities in which we operate, fines, inability to meet stakeholder expectations and regulatory requirements, litigation or regulatory action, anddamage to the company's reputation, which could materially and adversely affect our financial results. Context GSK is subject to the health, safety and environmental laws of various jurisdictions. These laws impose duties to protect people, the environment and the communities in which we operate. Information security Risk definitionThe risk that GSK or our third parties potentially fail to ensure appropriate controls and governance over unauthorised access, disclosure, theft, unavailability or corruption of GSK's information, key systems or technology infrastructure. Risk impact Failure to adequately protect our information and systems may cause harm to our patients, workforce and customers, disruption to our business and/or loss of commercial or strategic advantage, regulatory sanction or damage to our reputation. Context The external environment continues to be extremely challenging, making it hard to keep pace with increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. This is due to many factors including increased geopolitical conflict and digital nationalism, rising frequency and severity of data breaches and growing capability and sophistication of bad actors and cyber criminals. GSK's business relies on operating a highly connected information network of internal and external systems, which hold confidential research anddevelopment, manufacturing, commercial, workforce and financial data. This means that our systems and information havebeen and will continue to be the target of cyber-attacks. Acceleration in the use of digital, data and analytics and cloud computing capabilities to drive GSK's pipeline and performance requires us to continuously adapt and strengthen our controlsand defensive capabilities. GSK also relies on third-party contractors, partners and suppliers who face similar cyber threats and this continues to be a vector of risk to manage as well. Supply continuity Risk definitionThe risk that GSK or our third parties potentially fail to deliver a continuous supply of compliant finished product or respond effectively to a crisis incident in a timely manner to recover and sustain critical supply operations. Risk impact We recognise how important the continuity of supply of our products is to the patients who rely on them. Supply disruption can lead to: Product shortages and product recalls Regulatory intervention Reputational harm Lost sales revenue Consequently, we need sophisticated end-to-end supply chain management with robust crisis management and business continuity plans in place to respond. Context We run our supply chains in a continually evolving, highly-regulated environment. There is no single set of global regulations which governs the manufacture and distribution of medicines, and we must adhere to the requirements in all those markets inwhich we licence, sell or manufacture our products. We rely upon our internal Quality Management System and our Internal Control Framework to ensure we continue to preserve our licence to operate. Our complex end-to-end supply chains often involve third-party suppliers, from Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) manufacturers and raw material suppliers through to Third-Party Logistics Providers and contract engineering firms. Weembed integrated risk management into our sourcing and day to day business processes, alongside our Third-Party Oversightprogramme. External factors continued to challenge supply continuity in 2022. In the early part of the year COVID-19 continued to disrupt our sourcing of biosciences materials across our Medicines and Vaccines supply chains (e.g. vials, syringes and single-usesystems components). The Ukraine conflict has resulted in supply disruption to the region. To manage these disruptions, we deployed bespoke de-risking plans using crisis and continuity plans to manage the detail and mitigate the risk of supply continuity problems, e.g. by dual sourcing of materials or re-routing of shipments to avoid conflict zones. Keeping our patient s supplied with their medicines is our priority. New technology and modality platforms within supply chains are changing the requirements for the skillsets of people working in this field. We have implemented a new Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls Operating Model in 2022. This brings cross-fertilisation of talent focus on the skills needed for the future for innovative manufacturing. Industrial relations are also a current risk to supply continuity, with the threat of industrial action being averted in our UK manufacturing sites through successful dialogue with unions. Continued business monitoring is in place to assess the risk ofthe spread of industrial relations challenges resulting from global cost of living pressures. 7Climate-related risks Risk definitionFailure in the management of: Physical climate and environmental risks; Current and future regulatory requirements for environmental policies and taxes; Delivery and performance of management environmental objectives; leading to: reduced supply chain resilience; product life cycle management issues, loss of trust/reputation with employees, investors, customers, regulators and other stakeholders; increased costs; loss of sales or market access; negative impacts on the environment. Risk impact We recognise that the way we respond to climate change and manage environmental risks affects our ability to supply products to patients and consumers and could lead to harm to the environment and our reputation. For example, risks fromincreasing levels of water stress could lead to interruptions to supply of water to our sites and third-party supply sites, andincreasing frequency of extreme weather events may cause disruptions to our and third-party supply sites, affecting our abilityto supply products to patients and consumers. Current and future regulatory responses to address climate change may result in increased costs and compliance obligations, including restricting our ability to manufacture certain products and/or requiring us to find alternatives for the manufacture of certain products. For example, regulations governing the use of high global warming potential (GWP) substances are beingupdated in the EU and were recently updated in the US, which will lead to increasing costs and could restrict GSK's ability tomanufacture its metered dose inhaler products that use a high GWP propellant. In addition, our ability to meet our target ofreducing carbon emissions by 80% and 90% by 2030 and 2045, respectively, is based on our investment in an R&Dprogramme to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from metered dose inhalers, including successful clinical trials and obtainingregulatory approvals. Limitations in the jurisdictions in which we operate may also limit our access to renewable energysources and electric vehicles, which may affect our ability to achieve reductions in emissions across our operations. Failure t o meet fast-evolving regulatory requirements and stakeholder expectations could also result in litigation or regulatory actions o r lead to increasing demand for low carbon medicines and vaccines, affecting demand for our products, which may have a material adverse impact on our financial results and longer term loss of trust, undermining the credibility of the company. Context It is increasingly understood that the interconnected effects of climate change, nature loss, and society's impact on both are influencing human health. Internal and external expectations for companies to address their impact on the environment are increasing, as are the effects of climate change on operational resilience, in regard to access to energy, water and the natura l resources used in products, along with potential cost increases from any regulatory changes or environmental taxes, such ascarbon taxes in countries where GSK manufacturers and sources goods from third parties. Risks associated with COVID-19 The potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on GSK's trading performance and all its principal risks is continually assessed. While GSK was encouraged by the uptake of its vaccines and medicines in 2022, the pandemic remains a dynamicongoing risk, with the World Health Organization continuing to monitor the emergence of new variants. The current rate ofinfection is predominantly driven by the circulation of the BA.5 subvariant and its descendent lineages, which are still thedominant subvariants of Omicron globally. While COVID-19 vaccines are being updated with Omicron variants to providebroader immunity against circulating and emerging variants, these subvariants and potential future variants of concern could potentially impact GSK's trading results, clinical trials, supply continuity and its employees materially. Risks relating to the separation of the Consumer Healthcare business On 18 July 2022, GSK separated its Consumer Healthcare business from the Group to form Haleon, an independent listed company. Following the demerger, GSK continues to hold 6.0% of the shares of Haleon (including shares received by GSK'sconsolidated ESOP trusts) and 7.5% remains held by certain Scottish Limited Partnerships set up to provide collateral for afunding mechanism pursuant to which GSK will provide additional funding for its UK defined benefit pension schemes. The realisation of the anticipated benefits of the separation is subject to a number of factors, including many which are outsi de the control of the Group. There can be no guarantee that the anticipated benefits of the separation will be realised in full or in part, or as to the timing of when any such benefits may be realised. In addition, even if the anticipated benefits of the separation are realised, the market price of the GSK shares may not reflect such benefits. Following the separation, GSK's business is smaller and less diversified than it was prior to the separation, with greater relative exposure to the global pharmaceuticals and vaccines markets and the risks associated with such markets. As a resultof the reduction in GSK's size, should any part of its business underperform, this may have a greater adverse impact on theGroup than would have been the case prior to the separation. In addition, the value of GSK's retained investment in Haleon will be affected by changes in the market price of Haleon shares, and may decrease in value as a result of any decrease in the market price of Haleon shares. The failure of GSK to realise any of the anticipated benefits of the separation, including the value of its retained investment in Haleon, could have a material adverse impact on the Group's business, financial condition, results of operations and/orprospects. 8Item 4.

(2) Adjusted results are non-IFRS measures excluding discontinued operations and other adjustments that may be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, or superior to, information presented in accordance with IFRS. Adjusted results, AER growth, CER growth, free cash flow and other non-IFRS measures are defined below under \"Reporting framework\". Adjusted resultsreconciliations are presented above on pages 11 to 13 above and free cash flow reconciliations are presented below on page 29below. Total Turnover Total turnover in 2022 was \u00a329,324 million, up 19% at AER, 13% at CER, reflecting strong performance in all three product group s. Sales of COVID-19 solutions contributed 3% growth at AER and CER to Commercial Operations turnover. Specialty Medicines included \u00a32,309 million sales of Xevudy , and double-digit growth across all therapy areas. Vaccines growth reflected strong Shingrix and Meningitis performance, partially offset by pandemic adjuvant sales in 2021. General Medicines reflected the recovery of the antibiotics m arket and the strong performance of Trelegy in respiratory across all regions. Specialty Medicines Specialty Medicines sales were \u00a311,269 million, up 37% at AER, 29% at CER, driven by consistent double-digit growth in all ther apy areas. Sales of Xevudy of \u00a32,309 million contributed growth of 14% at AER and CER. Specialty Medicines, were \u00a38,960 million up 23% at AER, 15% at CER without Xevudy . Vaccines Vaccines turnover was \u00a37,937 million, up 17% at AER, 11% at CER in total. Sales of pandemic adjuvant contributed 7% growth at A ER and 6% CER to Commercial Operations turnover. The performance reflected a favourable comparator, which was impacted by COVID-19 related disruptions in several markets primar ily in H1 2021, and strong commercial execution of Shingrix , particularly in the US and Europe. General Medicines General Medicines sales in the year were \u00a310,118 million, up 5% at AER, 1% at CER, with the impact of generic competition in US , Europe and Japan offset by Trelegy growth in respiratory and the post-pandemic rebound of the antibiotic market since H2 2021, in Other General Medicines. Total Continuing Operating Profit Total operating profit from continuing operations was \u00a36,433 million compared with \u00a34,357 million in 2021. This included the \u00a30 .9 billion upfront income received from the settlement with Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead), increased profits on turnover growth of 13% at CER and fair value gains on investments, partly offset by higher remeasurement charges for contingent consideration liabilities. Total continuing Adjusted operating profit Adjusted operating profit was \u00a38,151 million, 26% higher at AER and 14% at CER than 2021. The Adjusted operating margin of 27.8 % was 1.5 percentage points higher at AER and 0.3 percentage points higher at CER compared to 2021. This primarily reflected the impact from low margin COVID-19 solutions sales ( Xevudy ). This was offset by operating leverage from strong sales growth, mix benefit, lower inventory adjustments and write-offs and higher royalty income. 14Total Earnings per Share Total EPS was 371.4p compared with 109.6p in 2021. The increase primarily reflected the profit after taxation for discontinued operations recognised on the Consumer Healthcare business demerger, upfront income received from the settlement with Gilead, increased pro fits and fair value gains on investments, partly offset by higher remeasurement charges for contingent consideration liabilities and an unfavourable comparison due to a credit of \u00a3397 million to Taxation in 2021. Total continuing Earnings per Share Total EPS from continuing operations was 110.8p compared with 82.9p in 2021. This primarily reflected the upfront income receiv ed from the settlement with Gilead, increased profits from turnover growth and fair value gains on investments, partly offset by higher remeasurement charges for contingent consideration liabilities and an unfavourable comparison due to a credit of \u00a3430 million t o Taxation in 2021. Total discontinued Earnings per Share EPS from discontinued operations was 260.6p, compared with 26.7p in 2021. The increase primarily reflected the gain arising on the demerger of Consumer Healthcare recognised in Profit after taxation for discontinued operations. Adjusted Earnings per Share Adjusted EPS was 139.7p compared with 110.3p in 2021. Operating leverage from strong sales growth, beneficial mix and lower inv entory adjustments and write-offs, higher royalty income and a lower effective tax rate was partly offset by increased investment behi nd launches, higher supply chain, freight and distribution costs and higher non-controlling interests. Cash generated from operations attributable to continuing operations Cash generated from operations attributable to continuing operations for the year was \u00a37,944 million (2021: \u00a37,249 million). Th e increase primarily reflected a significant increase in operating profit, favourable exchange impact and favourable timing of collections , partly offset by unfavourable timing of profit share payments for Xevudy sales, increased cash contributions to the UK defined benefit pension schemes, increased contingent consideration payments and a higher increase in inventory. Free cash flow Free cash inflow from continuing operations was \u00a33,348 million for 2022 (2021: \u00a33,301 million). The increase primarily reflecte d a significant increase in operating profit, favourable exchange, reduced purchases of intangible assets and favourable timing of collections. This was partly offset by unfavourable timing of profit share payments for Xevudy sales, increased cash contributions to pensions, increased contingent consideration payments, higher tax payments, lower proceeds from disposals, higher capital expenditure and a higher increase in inventory. 15Financial performance The Total results of the Group are set out below. 2022 2021(1) Growth % of % of \u00a3m turnover \u00a3m turnover \u00a3% CER% Turnover 29,324 100 24,696 100 19 13 Cost of sales (9,554) (32.6) (8,163) (33.1) 17 16 Gross profit 19,770 67.4 16,533 66.9 20 12 Selling, general and administration (8,372) (28.6) (7,070) (28.6) 18 13 Research and development (5,488) (18.7) (5,019) (20.3) 9 4 Royalty income 758 2.6 417 1.7 82 81 Other operating (expenses)/income (235) (504) Operating profit 6,433 21.9 4,357 17.6 48 31 Net finance costs (803) (755) Loss on disposal of interest in associates \u2014 (36) Share of after-tax (losses)/profits of associates and joint ventures (2) 33 Profit before taxation 5,628 3,599 56 37 Taxation (707) (83) Profit after taxation from continuing operations for the year 4,921 3,516 40 23 Profit after taxation from discontinued operations and other gains from the demerger 3,049 1,580 Remeasurement of discontinued operations distributed to shareholders on demerger 7,651 \u2014 Profit after taxation from discontinued operations 10,700 1,580 >100 >100 Total profit after taxation for the year 15,621 5,096 >100 >100 Profit attributable to non-controlling interests from continuing operations 460 200 Profit attributable to shareholders from continuing operations 4,461 3,316 Profit attributable to non-controlling interests from discontinued operations 205 511 Profit attributable to shareholders from discontinued operations 10,495 1,069 15,621 5,096 >100 >100 Total profit attributable to non-controlling interests 665 711 Total profit attributable to shareholders 14,956 4,385 15,621 5,096 >100 >100 Earnings per share from continuing operations (p) 110.8p 82.9p 34 18 Earnings per share from discontinued operations (p) 260.6p 26.7p >100 >100 Total earnings per share (p) 371.4p 109.6p >100 >100 Earnings per ADS from continuing operations (US$) 2.75 2.29 Earnings per ADS from discontinued operations (US$) 6.46 0.73 Total earnings per ADS (US$) 9.21 3.02 (1) The 2021 comparative results have been restated on a consistent basis from those previously published to reflect the demerge r of the Consumer Healthcare business (see \"Note 41 - Acquisitions and Disposals\" to the financial statements incorporated by refere nce in Item 18 below). 16The Adjusted results for the Group are set out below.

GSK believes that Adjusted results, when considered together with Total results, provide investors, analysts and other stakehol ders with helpful complementary information to understand better the financial performance and position of the Group from period to perio d, and allow the Group's performance to be more easily compared against the majority of its peer companies. These measures are also us ed by management for planning and reporting purposes. They may not be directly comparable with similarly described measures used by o ther companies. GSK encourages investors and analysts not to rely on any single financial measure but to review GSK's Annual Reports, including the financial statements and notes, in their entirety. Adjusted results Adjusted results exclude the profits from discontinued operations from the Consumer Healthcare business (see \"Note 41 - Acquisi tions and Disposals\" to the financial statements incorporated by reference in Item 18 below) and the following items in relation to o ur continuing operations from Total results, together with the tax effects of all of these items: - amortisation of intangible assets (excluding computer software and capitalised development costs) - impairment of intangible assets (excluding computer software) and goodwill - Major restructuring costs, which include impairments of tangible assets and computer software, (under specific Board approved programmes that are structural, of a significant scale and where the costs of individual or related projects exceed \u00a325 million ) including integration costs following material acquisitions - transaction-related accounting or other adjustments related to significant acquisitions - proceeds and costs of disposals of associates, products and businesses; significant settlement income; significant legal charg es (net of insurance recoveries) and expenses on the settlement of litigation and government investigations; other operating income oth er than royalty income, and other items Costs for all other ordinary course smaller scale restructuring and legal charges and expenses are retained within both Total a nd Adjusted results. As Adjusted results include the benefits of Major restructuring programmes but exclude significant costs (such as amortisation of intangible assets except for computer software and capitalised development costs, significant legal, major restructuring and transaction i tems), they should not be regarded as a complete picture of the Group's financial performance, which is presented in its Total results. The exclusion of other Adjusting items may result in Adjusted earnings being materially higher or lower than Total earnings. In particular, when significant impairments, restructuring charges and legal costs are excluded, Adjusted earnings will be higher than Total earnings. 17GSK is undertaking a number of Major restructuring programmes in response to significant changes in the Group's trading environ ment or overall strategy, or following material acquisitions. Costs, both cash and non-cash, of these programmes are provided for as in dividual elements are approved and meet the accounting recognition criteria. As a result, charges may be incurred over a number of years following the initiation of a Major restructuring programme. Significant legal charges and expenses are those arising from the settlement of litigation or government investigations that ar e not in the normal course and are materially larger than more regularly occurring individual matters. They also include certain major legac y matters. Reconciliations between Total and Adjusted results, providing further information on the key Adjusting items for 2022, 2021 and 2020, are set out on pages 11 to 13. GSK provides earnings guidance to the investor community on the basis of Adjusted results. This is in line with peer companies and expectations of the investor community, supporting easier comparison of the Group's performance with its peers. GSK is not able to give guidance for Total results as it cannot reliably forecast certain material elements of the Total results, particularly the futu re fair value movements on contingent consideration and put options that can and have given rise to significant adjustments driven by externa l factors such as currency and other movements in capital markets, and therefore a reconciliation of the guidance for Adjusted results to equivalent guidance for Total results is not available without unreasonable effort. Historical record of Adjusting items The reconciliations between Total and Adjusted operating profit from continuing operations over the last three years (1) can be summarised as follows: 2022 \u00a3m 2021(2) 5,979 Intangible amortisation 739 761 724 Intangible impairment 296 347 200 Major restructuring 321 424 1,178 Transaction-related items 1,750 1,143 1,237 Divestments, significant legal Adjusted results 8,151 6,493 6,656 The analysis of the impact of transaction-related items on operating profit for each of the last three years is as follows: 2022 \u00a3m 2021(2) preferential dividends) 1,431 1,026 1,114 ViiV Healthcare put options and Pfizer preferential dividends 85 48 (52) Contingent consideration on former Novartis Vaccines business 193 27 172 Contingent consideration on acquisition of Affinivax, Inc (Affinivax) 17 - - Other adjustments 24 42 3 Transaction-related items 1,750 1,143 1,237 (1) Three year financial data is presented reflecting the restated results following the demerger of Consumer Healthcare busines s. The financial results of 2019 and 2018 are not restated and are not presented. (2) The 2021 and 2020 comparative results have been restated on a consistent basis from those previously published to reflect th e demerger of the Consumer Healthcare business (see \"Note 41 - Acquisitions and Disposals\" to the financial statements incorporat ed by reference in Item 18 below). Full reconciliations between Total and Adjusted results for 2020-2022 including continuing and discontinued operations are set out above on pages 11 to 13 above. Further explanations on the Adjusting items for 2022 are reported on pages 27 to 29 below. Other non-IFRS measures Free cash flow Free cash flow is defined as the net cash inflow/outflow from continuing operating activities less capital expenditure on prope rty, plant and equipment and intangible assets, contingent consideration payments, net finance costs, and dividends paid to non-controlling in terests plus proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, and dividends received from joint ventures and associates. It is used by management for planning and reporting purposes and in discussions with and presentations to investmen t analysts and rating agencies. Free cash flow growth is calculated on a reported basis. A reconciliation of net cash inflow from continuing operating activities to free cash flow is set out on page 29 below. 18Working capital Working capital represents inventory and trade receivables less trade payables. CER and AER growth In order to illustrate underlying performance, it is the Group's practice to discuss its results in terms of constant exchange rate (CER) growth. This represents growth calculated as if the exchange rates used to determine the results of overseas companies in Sterl ing had remained unchanged from those used in the comparative period. CER% represents growth at constant exchange rates. \u00a3% or AER% represents growth at actual exchange rates. Total net debt Net debt is defined as total borrowings less cash, cash equivalents, liquid investments, and short-term loans to third parties that are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. Please see \"Note 30 - Net Debt\" to the financial statements incorporated b y reference in Item 18 below for the calculation of net debt. Non-controlling interests in ViiV Healthcare Trading profit allocationsAs ViiV Healthcare is a subsidiary of the Group, 100% of its operating results (turnover, operating profit, profit after tax) a re included within the Group income statement and then a portion of the earnings is allocated to the non-controlling interests owned by the othershareholders, in line with their respective equity shareholdings (Pfizer, Inc. (Pfizer) 11.7% and Shionogi & Co. Ltd (Shionogi) 10%). Each of the shareholders, including GSK, is also entitled to preferential dividends determined by the performance of certain product s that each shareholder contributed. As the relative performance of these products changes over time, the proportion of the overall earning s allocated to each shareholder also changes. In particular, the increasing proportion of sales of dolutegravir and cabotegravir-containing products has a favourable impact on the proportion of the preferential dividends that is allocated to GSK. Adjusting items are allocated to shareholders based on their equity interests. GSK was entitled to approximately 83% of the Total earnings and 82% of the Adjust ed earnings of ViiV Healthcare for 2022. Remeasurements of the liabilities for the preferential dividends allocated to Pfizer and Shionogi are included within other operating income/(expense). Acquisition-related arrangements As consideration for the acquisition of Shionogi's interest in the former Shionogi-ViiV Healthcare joint venture in 2012, Shion ogi received the 10% equity stake in ViiV Healthcare and ViiV Healthcare also agreed to pay additional future cash consideration to Shionogi , contingent on the future sales performance of the products being developed by that joint venture, dolutegravir and cabotegravir . Under IFRS 3 `Business combinations', GSK was required to provide for the estimated fair value of this contingent consideration at th e time of acquisition and is required to update the liability to the latest estimate of fair value at each subsequent period end. The lia bility for the contingent consideration recognised in the balance sheet at the date of acquisition was \u00a3659 million. Subsequent re-measurement s are reflected within other operating income/(expense) and within Adjusting items in the income statement in each period. Cash payments to settle the contingent consideration are made to Shionogi by ViiV Healthcare each quarter, based on the actual sales performance and other income of the relevant products in the previous quarter. These payments reduce the balance sheet liabilit y and hence are not recorded in the income statement. The cash payments made to Shionogi by ViiV Healthcare in 2022 were \u00a31,100 milli on. As the liability is required to be recorded at the fair value of estimated future payments, there is a significant timing diffe rence between the charges that are recorded in the Total income statement to reflect movements in the fair value of the liability and the actual cash payments made to settle the liability. The cash payments are reflected in the cash flow statement partly in operating cash flows and partly within investing activitie s. The tax relief on these payments is reflected in the Group's Adjusting items as part of the tax charge. The part of each payment relati ng to the original estimate of the fair value of the contingent consideration on the acquisition of the Shionogi-ViiV Healthcare joint ve nture in 2012 of \u00a3659 million is reported within investing activities in the cash flow statement and the part of each payment relating to the in crease in the liability since the acquisition is reported within operating cash flows. Movements in contingent consideration payable to Shionogi were as follows: 2022 \u00a3m 2021 \u00a3m beginning of the year 5,559 5,359 Remeasurement through income statement and other movements 1,431 Cash payments: operating cash flows (1,031) (721) Cash payments: investing activities (69) (105) Contingent consideration at end of the year 5,890 5,559 Of the contingent consideration payable (on a post-tax basis) to Shionogi at 31 December 2022, \u00a3940 million (31 December 2021: \u00a3937 million) is expected to be paid within one year. 19Exit rights Pfizer may request an IPO of ViiV Healthcare at any time and if either GSK does not consent to such IPO or an offering is not c ompleted within nine months, Pfizer could require GSK to acquire its shareholding. Under the original agreements, GSK had the unconditio nal right, so long as it made no subsequent distribution to its shareholders, to withhold its consent to the exercise of the Pfizer put op tion and, as a result, in accordance with IFRS, GSK did not recognise a liability for the put option on its balance sheet. However, during Q1 2016, GSK notified Pfizer that it had irrevocably given up this right and accordingly recognised the liability for the put option on the Group's balance sheet during Q1 2016 at an initial value of \u00a31,070 million. Consistent with this revised treatment, at the end of Q1 2016 GSK a lso recognised liabilities for the future preferential dividends anticipated to become payable to Pfizer and Shionogi on the Group' s balance sheet. Pfizer has the right to require GSK to acquire its shareholding in ViiV Healthcare in certain circumstances at any time. A put option liability is therefore recorded on the Group's balance sheet as a current liability. It is measured on the gross redemption basis derived from an internal valuation of the ViiV Healthcare business. The closing balances of the liabilities related to Pfizer's shareholding are as follows: 2022 \u00a3m 2021 \u00a3m option 1,093 1,008 the original agreements, Shionogi could also have requested GSK to acquire its shareholding in ViiV Healthcare in six-mon th windows commencing in 2017, 2020 and 2022. GSK had the unconditional right, so long as it made no subsequent distribution to it s shareholders, to withhold its consent to the exercise of the Shionogi put option and, as a result, GSK did not recognise a liab ility for the put option on its balance sheet. However, during Q1 2016, GSK notified Shionogi that it had irrevocably given up this right and accordingly recognised the liabi lity for the put option on the Group's balance sheet during Q1 2016 at an initial value of \u00a3926 million. In Q4 2016, Shionogi irrevocably ag reed to waive its put option and as a result GSK de-recognised the liability for this put option on the Group's balance sheet directly to equity. The value of the liability was \u00a31,244 million when it was de-recognised. GSK also has a call option over Shionogi's shareholding in ViiV Healthcare, which under the original agreements was exercisable in six-month windows commencing in 2027, 2030 and 2032. GSK has now irrevocably agreed to waive the first two exercise windows, bu t the last six-month window in 2032 remains. As this call option is at fair value, it has no value for accounting purposes. Settlement with Gilead On 1 February 2022, ViiV Healthcare reached agreement with Gilead to settle the global patent infringement litigation relating to the commercialisation of Gilead's Biktarvy. Under the terms of the global settlement and licensing agreement, Gilead made an upfron t payment of $1.25 billion to ViiV Healthcare in February 2022. In addition, Gilead will also pay a 3% royalty on all future US s ales of Biktarvy and in respect of the bictegravir component of any other future bictegravir- containing products sold in the US. These royalties will be payable by Gilead to ViiV Healthcare from 1 February 2022 until the expiry of ViiV Healthcare's US Patent No. 8,129,385 on 5 October 2027. Gilead's obligation to pay royalties does not extend into any period of regulatory paediatric exclusivity, if awarded. The impact of the settlement with Gilead on the contingent consideration liability (CCL) was to increase it by \u00a3288 million, on a post-tax basis in Q4 2021 due to the obligation ViiV Healthcare has to pay future cash consideration to Shionogi for its share of the up front and of the future US sales performance of Biktarvy and products containing bictegravir. The liability which is discounted at 8% is \u00a35, 890 million at 31 December 2022 on a post-tax basis. The impact of the settlement on the Pfizer put option liability was an increase of \u00a3114 m illion and was included in the re-measurement at 31 December 2021. Reporting definitions COVID-19 solutionsCOVID-19 solutions include the sales of pandemic adjuvant and other COVID-19 solutions including vaccine manufacturing and Xevudy and the associated costs but does not include reinvestment in R&D. This categorisation is used by management and we believe is helpful to investors by providing clarity on the results of the Group by showing the contribution to growth from COVID-19 solutions. General Medicines General medicines are usually prescribed in the primary care or community settings by general healthcare practitioners. For GSK , this includes medicines in inhaled respiratory, dermatology, antibiotics and other diseases. Specialty Medicines Specialty medicines are typically prescription medicines used to treat complex or rare chronic conditions. For GSK, this compri ses medicines in infectious diseases, HIV, oncology, immunology and respiratory. Total Operating Margin Total Operating margin is operating profit dividend by turnover. Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) CAGR is defined as the compound annual growth rate and shows the annualised average rate of revenue growth between a number of given years, assuming growth takes place at an exponentially compounded rate. 20Share Consolidation Shareholders received 4 new Ordinary shares with a nominal value of 31 14 pence each for every 5 existing Ordinary shares which had a nominal value of 25 pence each. Earnings per share, diluted earnings per share, adjusted earnings per share and dividends per s hare were retrospectively adjusted to reflect the Share Consolidation in all the periods presented. Earnings per share Earnings per share has been retrospectively adjusted for the Share Consolidation on 18 July 2022, applying a ratio of 4 new Ord inary shares for every 5 existing Ordinary shares. Total Earnings per share Unless otherwise stated, Total earnings per share refers to Total basic earnings per share. The same principle applies to conti nuing and discontinued earnings per share. Financial performance Group turnoverGSK has revised its operating segments during the year. Previously, GSK reported results under four segments: Pharmaceuticals; Pharmaceuticals R&D; Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare. GSK now reports results under two segments namely Commercial Operations and Total R&D. See \"Note 6 - Turnover and segment information\" to the financial statements incorporated by reference in Item 18 below for more details. The Commercial Operations segment has three product groups of Specialty Medicines, Vaccines and General Medicines. - Specialty Medicines products which includes GSK's marketed products for HIV, oncology, immuno-inflammation, respiratory and other specialty medicines (including Nucala ) and the COVID-19 solution, Xevudy ; - Vaccines products, including sales of GSK's AS03 adjuvant as part of the pandemic solutions; - General Medicines products, which include products previously reported as Established Pharmaceuticals and sales of Trelegy Ellipta and Anoro Ellipta (previously reported within the Respiratory category under Specialty products). These products are typically accessed by patients through primary care settings. Group turnover was \u00a329,324 million in the year, up 19% at AER, 13% at CER. In 2022 sales of COVID-19 solutions contributed 3% g rowth at AER and CER. Commercial operations Innovation sales (sales of products launched in the last five years including lifecycle innovation) amoun ted to \u00a312,690 million in 2022 20 12 Oncology 602 489 23 17 Immuno-inflammation, respiratory and other 2,609 2,027 29 20 8,960 7,293 >100 Specialty medicines 11,269 8,251 37 29 2021 has been revised to reflect changes to product groups previously reported as Established Pharmaceuticals. HIV HIV sales were \u00a35,749 million with growth of 20% at AER, 12% at CER. The performance benefited from strong patient demand for t he new HIV medicines approximately three quarters of the growth. US pricing favourability and year-end inventory build together contributed one third of the growth which was partially offset by I nternational tender decline. New HIV products delivered sales of over two billion to \u00a32,474 million, up 78% at AER, 67% at CER, representing 43% of the tota l HIV portfolio compared to 29% last year. Growth was primarily driven by sales of Dovato and Cabenuva . Dovato recorded sales of \u00a31,375 million up 75% at AER and 65% at CER and Cabenuva , the first long acting injectable for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, recorded sales of \u00a3340 million. Apretude , the first long acting injectable for the prevention of HIV-1 delivered sales of \u00a341 million. Oncology Oncology sales were \u00a3602 million, up 23% at AER, 17% at CER. Zejula sales of \u00a3463 million were up 17% at AER, 12% at CER driven by the first line indication, but with diagnosis and treatment rates continuing to be impacted by the pandemic especially in the U S. Sales of Blenrep of \u00a3118 million grew 33% at AER, 25% at CER, and included the impact of withdrawal from US market in Q4 2022. 21Immuno-inflammation, respiratory and other Immuno-inflammation, Respiratory and Other sales were \u00a32,609 million up 29% at AER, 20% at CER on strong performance of Benlysta and Nucala . Benlysta sales were \u00a31,146 million, up 31% at AER, 20% at CER, representing strong underlying demand in US and worldwide. Nucala sales were \u00a31,423 million, up 25% at AER, 18% at CER, reflecting continued strong patient demand and the launch of additional indications. Pandemic Sales of Xevudy were \u00a32,309 million, compared to \u00a3958 million sales in 2021. Sales were delivered in all regions, comprising \u00a3828 million in the US, \u00a3456 million in Europe, and \u00a31,025 million in International. Vaccines 714 679 5 Shingles 2,958 1,721 72 60 Established Vaccines 3,085 2,970 4 \u2014 Pandemic Vaccines 7,873 6,331 24 17 64 447 (86) (86) Vaccines 7,937 6,778 17 11 Meningitis Meningitis vaccines sales grew 16% at AER, 11% at CER to \u00a31,116 million mainly driven by Bexsero up 16% at AER, 12% at CER to \u00a3753 million resulting from higher CDC (Center for Disease Control) demand and increased share in the US. Menveo sales were also up 27% AER, 18% CER to \u00a3345 million, primarily driven by post-pandemic vaccination catch-up and higher public demand in Internatio nal, together with favourable pricing mix and share gain in the US. Influenza Fluarix/FluLaval sales grew by 5% AER but decreased 4% CER to \u00a3714 million, primarily driven by lower post-pandemic demand in Europe and the US, partly offset by lower expected returns in the US Shingles Shingrix sales grew 72% at AER, 60% at CER to \u00a32,958 million. All regions grew significantly reflecting post-pandemic rebound, strong uptake and new market launches with more than half of the growth contributed from outside of the US. In the US, Shingrix grew 46% at AER, 32% at CER to \u00a31,964 million due to higher non-retail and retail demand and strong commercial execution. Germany and China contributed strongly to the Shingrix growth. Shingrix was launched in 9 markets during 2022 and is now available in 26 countries. Established Vaccines Established Vaccines grew 4% AER but were stable at CER to \u00a33,085 million mainly resulting from supply constraints in MMR/V vac cines and lower tender demand in International for Synflorix . This was offset by hepatitis vaccines demand rebound in the US and Europe and Boostrix post-pandemic demand recovery and increased share in the US. Pandemic Vaccines Pandemic Vaccines decreased 86% AER and CER primarily reflecting comparison to 2021 pandemic adjuvant sales to the US and Canadian governments partly offset by GSK's share of 2022 contracted European volumes related to the COVID-19 booster vaccinedeveloped through a collaboration with Sanofi Pasteur (Sanofi). Growth 8 3 Other general medicines 3,570 3,619 (1) (2) General medicines 10,118 9,667 5 1 2021 has been revised to reflect changes to product groups previously reported as Established Pharmaceuticals. 22Respiratory Respiratory sales were \u00a36,548 million, up 8% at AER, 3% at CER. The performance was driven by Trelegy sales of \u00a31,729 million, up 42% AER, 32% CER, including strong growth across all regions. Advair/Seretide sales of \u00a31,159 million decreased 15% at AER, 17% at CER predominantly reflecting the adverse impact of generic competition, with growth in certain International markets due to targete d promotion offsetting the decrease. Other general medicines Other General Medicines sales were \u00a33,570 million, decreasing 1% at AER, 2% at CER. Augmentin sales were \u00a3576 million, up 35% at AER, 38% at CER, reflecting the post pandemic rebound of the antibiotic market since H2 2021 in the International and Europe re gions. This partially offsets the ongoing adverse impact of generic competition, and approximately two percentage points impact at AER and CER from the divestment of cephalosporin products in Q4 2021. Turnover by regions USIn the US, sales were \u00a314,542 million, up 22% at AER, 10% at CER. Sales of COVID-19 solutions contributed 2% growth at AER and CER to US Commercial Operations turnover. Sales of Xevudy were \u00a3828 million. In Specialty Medicines, HIV sales of \u00a33,756 million were up 30% at AER, 17% at CER. Growth benefited from strong patient demand for all new HIV products, pricing favourability and year-end inventory build. 88% at AER, 70% at CER. Nucala in respiratory and Benlysta in immunology both continued to grow double-digit and reflected ongoing strong patient demand. Oncology sales increased 14% at AER, 3% at CER with diagnosis an d treatment rates continuing to be impacted by the pandemic for Zejula , and the withdrawal of Blenrep from the US market in Q4 2022. Vaccine sales were \u00a34,243 million, up 22% at AER, 10% at CER. Sales of pandemic adjuvant contributed 9% growth at AER and 8% CE R to US Commercial Operations turnover. The performance was primarily driven by Shingrix sales of \u00a31,964 million up 46% at AER, 32% at CER, mostly due to higher non-retail and retail demand and strong commercial execution. Demand recovery in Established Vaccines and share gains in Meningitis vaccines also contributed to growth. General Medicines sales were \u00a33,572 million up 10% at AER down 1% at CER. Trelegy was up 47% at AER, 32% at CER reflecting increased patient demand and growth of the single inhaler triple therapy market, and Flovent grew on launch of authorised gener ics in the year. Overall, there was a three- percentage point reduction in growth of US General Medicines due to prior period Returns and Rebates (RAR) adjustments in the year. Europe In Europe, sales were \u00a36,348 million, up 18% at AER, 19% at CER. Sales of COVID-19 solutions of \u00a3513 million contributed 8 perc entage points of growth at AER and CER. In Specialty Medicines, HIV sales were \u00a31,310 million up 10% at AER, 10% at CER primarily driven by strong patient demand for Dovato , Cabenuva and Zejula Blenrep and Jemperli all continued to show strong double-digit growth. Vaccine sales were \u00a31,884 million, up 31% at AER, 32% at CER. The performance was driven by Shingrix sales of \u00a3688 million, >100% at AER and CER, particularly in Germany. Pandemic adjuvant sales of \u00a357 million contributed four percentage points of growth at AE R and CER. General Medicines sales of \u00a32,079 million decreased 3% at AER and CER, reflecting the ongoing impact of generic competitive pre ssures on Seretide and the divestment in Q4 2021 of cephalosporin products which caused one percentage point of drag on growth at AER and CER. This was partly offset, however, by strong demand for Trelegy and the growth of Augmentin following the post-pandemic rebound of the antibiotic market since H2 2021. International International sales were \u00a38,434 million, up 14% at AER and CER, including Xevudy sales of \u00a31,025 million. Sales of COVID-19 solutions contributed 7% AER and 8% CER growth to International Commercial Operations turnover. In Specialty Medicines, HIV sales were \u00a3683 million, stable at AER and decreased 3% at CER, primarily driven by tender decline. Excluding tenders, International grew driven by strong Dovato growth. Combined Tivicay and Triumeq sales were \u00a3506 million, down 12% at AER and 15% at CER. Nucala sales of \u00a3242 million grew 24% at AER and 28% at CER reflecting strong market growth and patient uptake. Benlysta sales of \u00a3114 million grew 44% at AER, 43% at CER reflecting growth in the biological market in Japan and inclusion on China's National Reimbursement Drug List. Vaccine sales were \u00a31,810 million, down 3% at AER, 5% at CER, reflecting an 11 percentage points drag at AER and CER from COVID-19 vaccine adjuvant sales in 2021. Growth excluding COVID-19 solutions was driven by strong Shingrix take-up in China, Canada and Japan more than offsetting the impact of supply constraints in MMR/V vaccines and lower Synflorix tender demand across several markets. 23General Medicines sales were \u00a34,467 million up 5% at AER and CER. Respiratory sales of \u00a31,955 million increased 10% at AER, 9% at CER, with Trelegy sales up 47% at AER, 48% at CER reflecting strong demand and inclusion on China's National Reimbursement Drug List. Sales of Advair/Seretide were up 3% at AER, 1% at CER with the adverse impact of generic competition offset by growth in certain markets due to targeted promotion. Other General Medicines sales of \u00a32,512 million increased 1% at AER, 2% at CER, and reflecte d growth of Augmentin following the post-pandemic rebound of the antibiotic market since H2 2021, partially offset by generic competition and price reductions in certain markets.

Total cost of sales as a percentage of turnover was 32.6%, 0.5 percentage points lower at AER and 0.9 percentage points higher in CER terms than 2021. Adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of turnover was 29.8%, 0.1 percentage points higher at AER and 1.3 percentage points hig her at CER compared with 2021. This primarily reflected higher sales of lower margin Xevudy compared to 2021 which included higher margin pandemic adjuvant sales, increasing cost of sales margin by 2.5 percentage points at AER and CER, as well as the impact of incr eased commodity prices and freight costs. This was partially offset by a favourable mix primarily from increased sales of Shingrix in the US and Europe and increased sales of HIV medicines in the US, lower inventory adjustments and write offs in Vaccines and continued con tribution from restructuring savings.

Total SG&A costs as a percentage of turnover were 28.6%, 0.1 percentage points lower at AER and stable at CER compared to 2021. This included a reduction in restructuring charges. Adjusted SG&A costs as a percentage of turnover were 27.7%, 0.4 percentage points higher at AER and 0.5 percentage points highe r at CER than in 2021. Adjusted SG&A costs increased 20% at AER, 15% at CER which primarily reflected an increased level of launch investment in Specialty Medicines particularly HIV and Vaccines including Shingrix to drive post-pandemic recovery demand and support market expansion. The growth in Adjusted SG&A also reflected an unfavourable comparison to a beneficial legal settlement in 202 1 as well as impairment provisions relating to Russia and Ukraine. This growth was partly offset by the continuing benefit of restru cturing and tight control of ongoing costs. Research and development 2022 \u00a3m 2021(1) \u00a3m Growth \u00a3% Growth CER% Total research and development (5,488) (5,019) 9 4 Adjusted research and development (5,062) (4,525) 12 6 (1) The 2021 comparative results have been restated on a consistent basis from those previously published to reflect the demerger of the Consumer Healthcare business (see \"Note 41 - Acquisitions and Disposals\" to the financial statementsincorporated by reference in Item 18 below). Total R&D expenditure was \u00a35,488 million up 9% at AER, 4% at CER. This included amortisation and impairments. Adjusted R&D expenditure in the full-year increased by 12% at AER, and 6% at CER, to \u00a35,062 million. This reflected continued i ncreased investment across Vaccines clinical development, including investments into our mRNA technology platforms, continued investment in the late-stage portfolio and several early discovery programmes, as well as expenditure related to our recent acquisition of Affini vax, Inc (Affinivax). In addition, in Specialty Medicines, the level of R&D investment increased to support the phase III respiratory programme for depemokimab, a potential new medicine to treat severe asthma, and bepirovirsen, our study in chronic hepatitis B, in preparatio n for the start of the phase III trial. In Oncology, investment increased in our early-stage immuno-oncology assets and in momelotinib (M MB), our potential new treatment of myelofibrosis patients with anaemia, acquired as part of the recent Sierra Oncology acquisition. The se increases in investment were offset by decreases related to the completion of several late-stage clinical development programme s and reduced R&D investment in COVID-19 pandemic solutions versus 2021. Royalty income Royalty income was \u00a3758 million (2021: \u00a3417 million), up 82% at AER, 81% at CER, the increase primarily reflecting royalty inco me from Gilead under the settlement and licensing agreement with Gilead announced on 1 February 2022 and Gardasil royalty income increa sing to \u00a3446 million due to higher sales. 24Other operating income/(expense) Net other operating expense was \u00a3235 million (2021: \u00a3504 million) reflecting accounting charges of \u00a31,726 million (2021: \u00a31,101 million) arising from the remeasurement of contingent consideration liabilities and the liabilities for the Pfizer put option and Pfizer and Shionogi preferential dividends in ViiV Healthcare. This included a remeasurement charge of \u00a31,431 million (2021: \u00a31,026 million) for th e contingent consideration liability due to Shionogi, including the unwinding of the discount of \u00a3410 million and a charge for \u00a31,021 millio n primarily from changes to exchange rates as well as adjustments to sales forecasts. This was partly offset by \u00a3922 million upfront income received from the settlement with Gilead, fair value gain on investments including \u00a3229 million on the retained stake in Haleon plc (Hal eon), reflecting an increase in share price since listing and milestone income from disposals. Operating profit Total operating profit from continuing operations was \u00a36,433 million compared with \u00a34,357 million in 2021. Total operating marg in was 21.9%, lower compared to 2021 due to the net impact of adjusting items described on page 11. This included the \u00a3922 million upfront income received from the settlement with Gilead, increased profits on turnover growth of 19% at AER, 13% at CER and fair value gains on investments including \u00a3229 million on the retained stake in Haleon, partly offset by hi gher remeasurement charges for contingent consideration liabilities. Adjusted operating profit was \u00a38,151 million, 26% higher at AER and 14% at CER than 2021 on a turnover increase of 13% at CER. The Adjusted operating margin of 27.8% was 1.5 percentage points higher at AER and 0.3 percentage points higher at CER compared to 2021. This primarily reflected the impact from low margin COVID-19 solu tions sales ( Xevudy ), which reduced Adjusted Operating profit growth by 3% AER and CER and reduced the Adjusted operating margin by approximately 1.4 percentage points at AER and approximately 1.3 percentage points at CER. This was offset by operating leverag e from strong sales growth, mix benefit, lower inventory adjustments and write offs and higher royalty income. Contingent consideration cash payments made to Shionogi and other companies reduce the balance sheet liability and hence are no t recorded in the income statement. Total contingent consideration cash payments in 2022 amounted to \u00a31,137 million (2021: \u00a3856 m illion). These included cash payments made to Shionogi of \u00a31,100 million (2021: \u00a3826 million). Adjusted operating profit by business Commercial Operations operating profit was \u00a313,590 million, up 19% at AER and 10% at CER on a turnover increase of 13% at CER. The operating margin of 46.3% was 0.1 percentage points lower at AER, 1.2 percentage points lower at CER than in 2021. This primari ly reflected strong sales of lower margin Xevudy , increased investment behind launches in Specialty Medicines including HIV and Vaccines plus higher commodity, freight and distribution costs as well as an adverse comparison to a favourable legal settlement in 2021 . This was partly offset by leverage from strong sales growth, mix and lower inventory adjustments and write-offs, continued tight control of ongoing costs, benefits from continued restructuring and increased royalty income from Biktarvy and Gardasil sales. R&D segment operating expenses were \u00a35,060 million, up 11% at AER, 5% at CER, primarily reflecting increased investment in Vacc ines including priority investments for mRNA, late stage portfolio and expenditure from the acquisition of Affinivax and in Specialt y Medicines in early stage HIV and depemokimab. This was partly offset by decreases related to the completion of several late-stage clinical development programmes and reduced R&D investment in COVID-19 pandemic solutions versus 2021. Net finance costs Finance income 2022 \u00a3m 2021(1) \u00a3m Interest and other income 62 13 Fair value movements 14 1 76 14 Finance expense Interest expense (789) (735) Unwinding of discounts on provisions (7) (2) Remeasurements and fair value movements (20) (2) Finance expense on lease liabilities (30) (27) Other finance expense (33) (3) (879) (769) (1) The 2021 comparative results have been restated on a consistent basis from those previously published to reflect the demerger of the Consumer Healthcare business (see \"Note 41 - Acquisitions and Disposals\" to the financialstatements incorporated by reference in Item 18 below). Total net finance costs were \u00a3803 million compared with \u00a3755 million in 2021. Adjusted net finance costs were \u00a3791 million comp ared with \u00a3752 million in 2021. The increase is mainly driven by costs associated with the Sterling Notes repurchase in Q4 2022 and highe r interest on tax offset by increased interest income due to higher interest rates and larger cash balances as a result of the Consumer He althcare demerger. 25Share of after tax profits of associates and joint ventures The share of after tax loss of associates and joint ventures was \u00a32 million (2021: \u00a333 million share of profit). Loss on disposal of interest in associates In 2021, the Group also reported a net loss on disposal of interests in associates of \u00a336 million, primarily driven by a loss o n disposal of our interest in the associate Innoviva Inc. Profit before tax Taking account of net finance costs, the share of profits of associates and loss on disposal of interest in associates, profit before taxation was \u00a35,628 million compared with \u00a33,599 million in 2021. Taxation 2022 \u00a3m 2021(1) \u00a3m UK current year charge 200 119 Rest of world current year charge 1,351 593 Charge/(credit) in respect of prior periods (60) 219 Total current taxation 1,491 931 Total deferred taxation (784) (848) Taxation on total profits 707 83 (1) The 2021 comparative results have been restated on a consistent basis from those previously published to reflect the demerger of the Consumer Healthcare business (see \"Note 41 - Acquisitions and Disposals\" to the financialstatements incorporated by reference in Item 18 below). The charge of \u00a3707 million represented an effective tax rate on Total results of 12.6% (2021: 2.3%) and reflected the different tax effects of the various Adjusting items. Included in 2021 was a credit of \u00a3430 million resulting from the remeasurement of deferred tax ass ets following enactment of the proposed change of UK corporate income tax rates from 19% to 25%. Tax on Adjusted profit amounted to\u00a31,138 million and represented an effective Adjusted tax rate of 15.5% (2021: 15.9%). Issues related to taxation are described in Note 14 to the financial statements 'Taxation'. The Group continues to believe it h as made adequate provision for the liabilities likely to arise from periods which are open and not yet agreed by tax authorities. The u ltimate liability for such matters may vary from the amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome of agreements with relevant tax authoriti es. Non-controlling interests The allocation of Total profit from continuing operations to non-controlling interests amounted to \u00a3460 million (2021: \u00a3200 mil lion). The increase was primarily due to an increased allocation of ViiV Healthcare profits of \u00a3416 million (2021: \u00a3197 million), includin g the Gilead upfront settlement income, partly offset by increased credits for remeasurement of contingent consideration liabilities, as wel l as higher net profits in some of the Group's other entities with non-controlling interests. The allocation of Adjusted earnings from continuing operations to non-controlling interests amounted to \u00a3595 million (2021: \u00a344 1 million). The increase in allocation primarily reflected an increased allocation of ViiV Healthcare profits of \u00a3551 million (2021: \u00a3438 m illion), as well as higher net profits in some of the Group's other entities with non-controlling interests. Earnings per share from continuing operations Total EPS from continuing operations was 110.8p compared with 82.9p in 2021. This primarily reflected the \u00a3922 million upfront income received from the settlement with Gilead, increased profits on turnover growth of 13% at CER and fair value gains on investment s including the retained stake in Haleon, partly offset by higher remeasurement charges for contingent consideration liabilities and an unfavourable comparison due to a credit of \u00a3430 million to Taxation in 2021 resulting from the remeasurement of deferred tax as sets. Adjusted EPS was 139.7p compared with 110.3p in 2021, up 27% at AER, 15% at CER on a 13% CER turnover increase. Operating leverage from growth in sales of Specialty Medicines including HIV and Vaccines, beneficial mix and lower inventory adjustments and write-offs, higher royalty income and a lower effective tax rate was partly offset by increased investment behind launches in S pecialty Medicines including HIV and Vaccines plus higher supply chain costs, freight and distribution costs and higher non-controlling interests. Growth in lower margin COVID-19 solutions sales reduced Adjusted EPS growth by 4% AER and 3% CER. Profit and earnings per share from discontinued operations Discontinued operations include the Consumer Healthcare business and certain Corporate costs directly attributable to the Consu mer Healthcare business. Profit after taxation from discontinued operations amounted to \u00a310,700 million (2021: \u00a31,580 million). Thi s includes \u00a310,084 million for the gain arising on the demerger of Consumer Healthcare split between the amount distributed to shareholder s on demerger of \u00a37,651 million and profit after taxation on discontinued operations for the retained stake of \u00a32,433 million. In ad dition, the Profit after taxation from discontinued operations for the Consumer Healthcare business was \u00a3616 million (2021: \u00a31,580 million) . EPS from discontinued operations was 260.6p, compared with 26.7p in 2021. The increase primarily reflected the gain arising on the demerger of the Consumer Healthcare business. For further details see \"Note 41 - Acquisitions and Disposals\" to the financial s tatements incorporated by reference in Item 18 below, discontinued operations. 26Total earnings per share Total EPS was 371.4p compared with 109.6p in 2021. The increase primarily reflected the profit after taxation for discontinued operations recognised on the Consumer Healthcare business demerger, upfront income received from the settlement with Gilead, increased pro fits and fair value gains on investments, partly offset by higher remeasurement charges for contingent consideration liabilities and an unfavourable comparison due to a credit of \u00a3397 million to Taxation in 2021. Dividends The Board has declared four interim dividends resulting in a total dividend for the year of 61.25p per share retrospectively ad justed for the share consolidation. The 2021 dividend per share was 100p retrospectively adjusted for the share consolidation. See \"Note 16 - Dividends\", to the financial statements incorporated by reference in Item 18 below. Dividend policy On 23 June 2021, at the new GSK Investor Update, GSK set out that from 2022 a progressive dividend policy will be implemented g uided by a 40 to 60 percent pay-out ratio through the investment cycle. The dividend policy, the total expected cash distribution, an d the respective dividend pay-out ratios for GSK remain unchanged. GSK has previously stated that it expected to declare a 27p per share dividend for the first half of 2022, a 22p per share divi dend for the second half of 2022 and a 45p per share dividend for 2023 (before the Share Consolidation) but that these targeted dividends pe r share would increase in step with the Share Consolidation to maintain the same aggregate dividend pay-out in absolute Sterling terms. Accordingly, using the consolidation ratio, GSK's expected dividend for the fourth quarter of 2022 converts to 13.75p per new o rdinary share. This results in an expected total dividend for the second half of 2022 of 27.5p per new ordinary share. The expected div idend for 2023 converts to 56.5p per new ordinary share in line with the original expectation converted for the Share Consolidation and r ounded up. COVID-19 solutions Based on known binding agreements with governments, GSK does not anticipate any significant COVID-19 pandemic-related sales or operating profit in 2023. Sales of COVID-19 solutions were \u00a32.4 billion in 2022 and therefore we expect a reduction in Turnover growth by approximately 9% and a reduction in Adjusted Operating profit growth by 6% to 7%. However, the Company continues to discuss fut ure opportunities to support governments, healthcare systems, and patients whereby its COVID-19 solutions can address the emergence of any new COVID-19 variant of concern. Profit from discontinued operations Discontinued operations include the Consumer Healthcare business and certain Corporate costs directly attributable to the Consu mer Healthcare business. Profit after taxation from discontinued operations amounted to \u00a310,700 million (2021: \u00a31,580 million). Thi s includes \u00a310,084 million for the gain arising on the demerger of Consumer Healthcare split between the amount distributed to shareholder s on demerger of \u00a37,651 million and profit after taxation on discontinued operations for the retained stake of \u00a32,433 million. In ad dition, the Profit after taxation from discontinued operations for the Consumer Healthcare business was \u00a3616 million (2021: \u00a31,580 million) . Intangible asset amortisation See \"Note 20 - Other intangible assets\" to the financial statements incorporated by reference in Item 18 below for description and information on Intangible asset amortisation. Intangible asset impairment See \"Note 20 - Other intangible assets\" to the financial statements incorporated by reference in Item 18 below for description and information on Intangible asset impairment. No individual intangible asset accounted for a material impairment. Major restructuring and integration Within the Pharmaceuticals sector, the highly regulated manufacturing operations and supply chains and long life cycle of the b usiness mean that restructuring programmes, particularly those that involve the rationalisation or closure of manufacturing or R&D site s are likely to take several years to complete. Major restructuring costs are those related to specific Board-approved Major restructuring programmes and are excluded from Adj usted results. Major restructuring programmes, including integration costs following material acquisitions, are those that are struct ural and are of a significant scale where the costs of individual or related projects exceed \u00a325 million. Other ordinary course smaller-scale r estructuring costs are retained within Total and Adjusted results. Total Major restructuring charges incurred in 2022 were \u00a3321 cash \u00a3m Total \u00a3m Separation preparation restructuring programme 177 110 287 353 59 412 Significant acquisitions 20 \u2014 20 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Legacy programmes 9 5 14 32 (20) 12 206 115 321 385 39 424 (1) The 2021 comparative results have been restated on a consistent basis from those previously published to reflect the demerge r of the Consumer Healthcare business (see \"Note 41 - Acquisitions and Disposals\" to the financial statements incorporated by refere nce in Item 18 below). 27Cash charges of \u00a3177 million under the Separation Preparation programme primarily arose from the restructuring of some administ rative functions as well as Global Supply Chain, R&D functions and commercial. The non-cash charges of \u00a3110 million primarily reflecte d the write-down of assets in administrative and manufacturing locations and impairment of IT assets. Total cash payments made in 2022 were \u00a3388 million (2021: \u00a3551 million), \u00a3332 million (2021: \u00a3428 million) relating to the Sepa ration Preparation restructuring programme, \u00a317 million relating to significant acquisitions (2021: \u00a3nil) and \u00a339 million (2021: \u00a3123 million) relating to other legacy programmes including the settlement of certain charges accrued in previous quarters. The analysis of Major restructuring charges by income statement line was as follows: 2022 \u00a3m 2021(1) \u00a3m Cost of sales 102 102 Selling, general and administration 180 277 Research and development 39 45 Total Major restructuring costs from continuing operations 321 424 (1) The 2021 comparative results have been restated on a consistent basis from those previously published to reflect the demerger of the Consumer Healthcare business (see \"Note 41 - Acquisitions and Disposals\" to the financialstatements incorporated by reference in Item 18 below). The benefit in 2022 from restructuring programmes was \u00a30.5 billion, primarily relating to the Separation Preparation restructur ing programme. The Group initiated in Q1 2020 a Separation Preparation programme to prepare for the separation of GSK into two companies: The programme aims were: Drive a common approach to R&D with improved capital allocation Align and improve the capabilities and efficiency of global support functions to support GSK Further optimise the supply chain and product portfolio, including the divestment of non-core assets Prepare Consumer Healthcare to operate as a standalone company The programme delivered \u00a30.9 billion of annual savings by 2022 and targets to deliver \u00a31.0 billion by 2023, with total costs es timated at \u00a32.4 billion, of which \u00a31.6 billion is expected to be cash costs. The proceeds of divestments have largely covered the cash cos ts of the programme. Transaction-related adjustments Transaction-related adjustments from continuing operations resulted in a net charge of \u00a31,750 million (2021: \u00a31,143 million). T his included a net \u00a31,726 million accounting charge for the re-measurement of the contingent consideration liabilities and the liabilities f or the Pfizer put option and Pfizer and Shionogi preferential dividends in ViiV Healthcare. Charge/(credit) 2022 \u00a3m 2021(1) \u00a3m Contingent consideration on Venture (including Shionogi preferential dividends) 1,431 1,026 ViiV Healthcare put options and Pfizer preferential dividends 85 48 Contingent consideration on former Novartis Vaccines business 193 27 Contingent consideration on acquisition of Affinivax 17 \u2014 Other adjustments 24 42 Total transaction-related charges 1,750 1,143 (1) The 2021 comparative results have been restated on a consistent basis from those previously published to reflect the demerger of the Consumer Healthcare business (see \"Note 41 - Acquisitions and Disposals\" to the financialstatements incorporated by reference in Item 18 below). The \u00a31,431 million charge relating to the contingent consideration for the former Shionogi-ViiV Healthcare joint venture repres ented an increase in the valuation of the contingent consideration due to Shionogi, as a result of the unwind of the discount for \u00a3410 m illion and a charge of \u00a31,021 million primarily from adjustments to sales forecasts and the settlement with Gilead as well as updated exchan ge rate assumptions. The \u00a385 million charge relating to the ViiV Healthcare put option and Pfizer preferential dividends represented an increase in the valuation of the put option as a result of the settlement with Gilead, offset by lower cash and updated exchange rate assum ptions. The ViiV Healthcare contingent consideration liability is fair valued under IFRS. An explanation of the accounting for the non- controlling interests in ViiV Healthcare is set out on pages 19 to 20 above. Divestments, significant legal charges and other items Divestments, significant legal charges and other items primarily included the \u00a3922 million upfront settlement income received f rom Gilead, a fair value gain on investments including \u00a3229 million on the retained stake in Haleon as well as milestone income and gains f rom a number of asset disposals, partly offset by certain other Adjusting items. 28Discontinued operations From Q2 2020, the Group started to report additional costs to prepare for establishment of the Consumer Healthcare business as an independent entity (\"Separation costs\"). These are presented as part of discontinued operations. Total separation costs incurre d in 2022 were \u00a3366 million (2021: \u00a3314 million). This includes \u00a3103 million relating to transaction costs incurred in connection with th e demerger and preparatory admission costs related to the listing of Haleon. Total separation costs to date are \u00a3748 million including \u00a3141 million relating to transaction costs. Cash generation and conversion A summary of the consolidated cash flow statement is set out below. 2022 \u00a3m 2021 \u00a3m Total net cash inflow from operating activities 7,403 7,952 Total net cash (outflow) from investing activities (8,772) (1,777) Total net cash inflow/(outflow) from financing activities 823 (7,589) Decrease in cash and bank overdrafts (546) (1,414) Cash and bank overdrafts at beginning of year 3,819 5,262 Exchange adjustments 152 (29) Decrease in cash and bank overdrafts (546) (1,414) Cash and bank overdrafts at end of year 3,425 3,819 Cash and bank overdrafts at end of year comprise: Cash and cash equivalents 3,723 4,274 Overdrafts (298) (455) 3,425 3,819 Total net cash inflow from operating activities Total net cash generated from operating activities for the year was \u00a37,403 million (2021: \u00a37,952 million). The decrease primarily reflected unfavourable timing of profit share payments for Xevudy sales, increased cash contributions to UK pension schemes, increased contingent consideration payments for the settlement with Gilead and to Shionogi, plus a higher incr ease in inventory and a reduction in cash from discontinued operations. The decrease was primarily offset by a significant increase in operating profit including the upfront income from the settlement with Gilead, favourable exchange impact and favourable timing of collec tions. Reconciliation of net cash inflow from continuing operating activities to free cash inflow A reconciliation of net cash inflow from operating activities, which is the closest equivalent IFRS measure to free cash flow, is shown below. 2022 \u00a3m 2021(1) \u00a3m Net cash inflow from continuing operating activities 6,634 6,277 Purchase of property, plant and equipment (1,143) (950) Purchase of intangible assets (1,115) (1,704) Proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment 146 132 Proceeds from sale of intangible assets 196 641 Net finance costs (784) (758) Dividends from joint ventures and associates 6 9 Contingent consideration paid (reported in investing activities) (79) (114) Contribution from non-controlling interests 8 7 Distributions to non-controlling interests (521) (239) Free cash inflow 3,348 3,301 (1) The 2021 comparative results have been restated on a consistent basis from those previously published to reflect the demerger of the Consumer Healthcare business (see \"Note 41 - Acquisitions and Disposals\" to the financial statements incorporated by reference in Item 18 below). Capital expenditure and financial investment Cash payments for tangible and intangible fixed assets amounted to \u00a32,258 million (2021: \u00a32,654 million) and disposals realised \u00a3342 million (2021: \u00a3773 million). Cash payments to acquire equity investments amounted to \u00a3143 million (2021: \u00a3162 million) an d sales of equity investments realised \u00a3238 million (2021: \u00a3202 million). 29Free cash flow Free cash flow is the amount of cash generated by the Group after meeting our obligations for contingent consideration, interes t, tax and dividends paid to non-controlling interests, and after capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment and intangible asse ts. 2022 \u00a3m (1) The 2021 comparative results have been restated on a consistent basis from those previously published to reflect the demerger of the Consumer Healthcare business (see \"Note 41 - Acquisitions and Disposals\" to the financial statements incorporated by reference in Item 18 below). Total cash payments to Shionogi in relation to the ViiV Healthcare contingent consideration liability in the year were \u00a31,100 m illion (2021: \u00a3826 million), of which \u00a31,031 million was recognised in cash flows from operating activities and \u00a369 million was recognised in contingent consideration paid within investing cash flows. These payments are deductible for tax purposes. Future cash flow Over the long term, we expect that future cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operating and debt serv icing costs, normal levels of capital expenditure, obligations under existing licensing agreements, expenditure arising from restructuring p rogrammes and other routine outflows including tax, pension contributions and dividends, subject to the \"Principal risks and uncertaintie s\" discussed under Item 3.D \"Risk Factors\" above. We may from time to time have additional demands for finance, such as for acquisitions. We have access to multiple sources of liquidity from short and long-term capital markets and financial institutions for such needs, in addition to the cash flow from operations. Investment appraisal and capital allocation We have a strong framework for capital allocation, including a board to govern the allocation of capital between our businesses . We utilise a consistent cash return on invested capital (CROIC) methodology to prioritise investment across the Group as a whole, so that we can more effectively compare the returns from each of the businesses as we allocate capital between them. We also consider the impa ct on EPS and our credit profile where relevant. 30Financial position and resources 2022 \u00a3m 2021 \u00a3m Assets Non-current assets Property, plant and equipment 8,933 9,932 Right of use assets 687 740 Goodwill 7,046 10,552 Other intangible assets 14,318 30,079 Investments in associates and joint ventures 74 88 Other investments 1,467 2,126 Deferred tax assets 5,658 5,218 Derivative financial instruments \u2014 18 Other non-current assets 1,194 1,676 Total non-current assets 39.377 60,429 Current assets Inventories 5,146 5,783 Current tax recoverable 405 486 Trade and other receivables 7,053 7,860 Derivative financial instruments 190 188 Current equity investments 4,087 \u2014 Liquid investments 67 61 Cash and cash equivalents 3,723 4,274 Assets held for sale 98 22 Total current assets 20,769 18,674 Total assets 60,146 79,103 Liabilities Current liabilities Short-term borrowings (3,952) (3,601) Contingent liabilities (1,289) (958) Trade and other payables (16,263) (17,554) Derivative financial instruments (183) (227) Current tax payable (471) (489) Short-term provisions (652) (841) Total current liabilities (22,810) (23,670) Non-current liabilities Long-term borrowings (17,035) (20,572) Corporation tax payable (127) (180) Deferred tax liabilities (289) (3,556) Pensions and other post-employment benefits (2,579) (3,113) Other provisions (532) (630) Derivative financial instruments \u2014 (1) Contingent consideration liabilities (5,779) (5,118) Other non-current liabilities (899) (921) Total non-current Total equity 10,096 plant and equipment Our business is science-based, technology-intensive and highly regulated by governmental authorities. We allocate significant f inancial resources to the renewal and maintenance of our property, plant, equipment and vehicles to minimise risks of interruption to pr oduction and to ensure compliance with regulatory standards. A number of our processes use hazardous materials. The total cost of our property, plant and equipment at 31 December 2022 was \u00a319,451 million, with a net book value of \u00a38,933 mi llion. Of this, land and buildings represented \u00a33,113 million, plant, equipment and vehicles \u00a34,012 million and assets in construction \u00a31 ,808 million. In 2022, we invested \u00a31,245 million in new property, plant and equipment. This was mainly related to a large number of projects for the renewal, improvement and expansion of facilities at various worldwide sites to support new product development and launches as well as to improve the efficiency of existing supply chains. Property is mainly held freehold. New investment is financed from our liqu id resources. At 31 December 2022, we had contractual commitments for future capital expenditure of \u00a3743 million. We believe that our propert y and plant facilities are adequate for our current requirements. We observe stringent procedures and use specialist skills to manage environmental risks from our activities. Environmental issu es, sometimes dating from operations now modified or discontinued, are reported under 'Environment' on pages 45 and 46 of the GSK A nnual Report 2022 and in \"Note 47 - Legal Proceedings\" to the financial statements incorporated by reference in Item 18 below. Right of use assets Right of use assets amounted to \u00a3687 million at 31 December 2022 compared with \u00a3740 million at 31 December 2021. The decrease i n the year reflected the impact of depreciation and transfer to assets held for sale/distribution of \u00a3192 million and \u00a3127 millio n respectively, disposals and impairments amounting to \u00a375 million, partly offset by additions through business combinations of \u00a353 million and other additions of \u00a3233 million. Goodwill Goodwill decreased to \u00a37,046 million at 31 December 2022, from \u00a310,552 million primarily as a result of transfer of assets held for sale/distribution of \u00a35,183 million for the Consumer Healthcare demerger partially offset by an increase of \u00a31,127 million for the acquisitions of Sierra Oncology and Affinivax. The values for Affinivax are provisional and are subject to change. Other intangible assets Other intangible assets include the cost of intangibles acquired from third parties and computer software. The net book value o f other intangible assets as at 31 December 2022 was \u00a314,318 million (2021: \u00a330,079 million). The decrease primarily reflected transfer to assets held for sale/distribution of \u00a320,057 million, impairment losses, net of reversals and amortisation of \u00a31,519 million, offset b y additions, net of disposals, write-offs of \u00a34,047 million and exchange rate gains of \u00a31,628 million. Investments in associates and joint ventures We held investments in associates and joint ventures with a carrying value at 31 December 2022 of \u00a374 million (2021: \u00a388 millio n). See \"Note 21 - Investments in associates and joint ventures\" to the financial statements incorporated by reference in Item 18 below for more details. Current equity investments Current equity investments amounted to \u00a34,087 million at 31 December 2022 (2021: \u00a3nil). Current equity investments comprise equ ity investments which the Group holds with the intention to sell and which it may sell in the short term. Where acquired with this intention, they are measured at fair value through the profit and loss (FVTPL). They are initially recorded at fair value plus transaction costs and then remeasured at subsequent reporting dates to fair value. Unrealised gains and losses are recognised in the income statement. The investment of \u00a34,087 million (2021: \u00a3nil) represents the shares held in Haleon after the demerger. Other investments We held other investments with a carrying value at 31 December 2022 of \u00a31,467 million (2021: \u00a32,126 million). The most signific ant of these investments held at 31 December 2022 were in Vir Biotechnology and Nimbus Discovery. These investments had a fair value a t 31 December 2022 of \u00a3180 million (2021: \u00a3266 million) and \u00a3139 million (2021: \u00a332 million) respectively. The other investments included equity stakes in companies with which we have research collaborations, and which provide access to biotechnology developments o f potential interest and interests in companies that arise from business divestments. Derivative financial instruments: assets We held current derivative financial assets at fair value of \u00a3190 million (2021: \u00a3188 million) and non-current derivative finan held at fair value of \u00a3nil (2021: \u00a318 million). The majority of these financial instruments related to foreign exchange contracts bo th designated and not designated as accounting hedges. Inventories Inventories amounted to \u00a35,146 million (2021: \u00a35,783) at 31 December 2022. The decrease was mainly driven by the Consumer Healthcare demerger partially offset by vaccines stock build. Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables amounted to \u00a37,053 million (2021: \u00a37,860 million) at 31 December 2022. The decrease was mainly driv en by the Consumer Healthcare demerger and lower pandemic adjuvant sales compared to last year. 32Deferred tax assets Deferred tax assets amounted to \u00a35,658 million (2021: \u00a35,218 million) at 31 December 2022. Derivative financial instruments: liabilities We held current and non-current derivative financial liabilities at fair value of \u00a3183 million (2021: \u00a3228 million). This prima rily related to foreign exchange contracts both designated and not designated as accounting hedges. Trade and other payables At 31 December 2022, trade and other payables were \u00a316,263 million compared with \u00a317,554 million at 31 December 2021. See \"Note 29 - Trade and other payables\" to the financial statements incorporated by reference in Item 18 below. The decrease was mainly dri ven by the Consumer Healthcare demerger and profit share collaborations offset by an increase in promotional activity in the regions. Provisions We carried deferred tax provisions and other short-term and non-current provisions of \u00a31,473 million at 31 December 2022 (2021: \u00a35,027 million). Other provisions at the year-end included \u00a3218 million (2021: \u00a3196 million) related to legal and other disputes and \u00a3 351 million (2021: \u00a3652 million) related to Major restructuring programmes. Provision has been made for legal and other disputes, indemnifi ed disposal liabilities, employee related liabilities and the costs of the restructuring programme to the extent that at the balan ce sheet date a legal or constructive obligation existed and could be reliably estimated. Pensions and other post-employment benefits We account for pension and other post-employment arrangements in accordance with IAS 19. The net deficits were \u00a31,356 million ( 2021: \u00a31,129 million) on pension arrangements and \u00a3994 million (2021: \u00a31,243 million) on unfunded post- employment liabilities. See \" Note 31 - Pensions and other post-employment benefits\" to the financial statements, incorporated by reference in Item 18 below. Other non-current liabilities Other non-current liabilities amounted to \u00a3899 million at 31 December 2022 (2021: \u00a3921 million). Contingent consideration liabilities Contingent consideration amounted to \u00a37,068 million at 31 December 2022 (2021: \u00a36,076 million), of which \u00a35,890 million (2021: \u00a35,559 million) represented the estimated present value of amounts payable to Shionogi relating to ViiV Healthcare, \u00a3501 million (2021 : \u00a3nil) represented the estimated present value of contingent consideration payable to the former shareholders of Affinivax and \u00a3673 mi llion (2021: \u00a3479 million) represented the estimated present value of contingent consideration payable to Novartis related to the Vac cines acquisition. The liability due to Shionogi was \u00a3263 million in respect of preferential dividends. An explanation of the accounting for the n on-controlling interests in ViiV Healthcare is set out on pages 19 to 20 above. Of the total contingent consideration payable (on a post-tax basis) at 31 December 2022, \u00a3940 million (2021: \u00a3937 million) is e xpected to be paid within one year. The consideration payable is expected to be paid over a number of years. As a result, the total estima ted liabilities are discounted to their present values, on a post-tax basis using post-tax discount rates. The Shionogi-ViiV Healthcare contingent consideration liability is discounted at 8% and the Novartis Vaccines contingent consid eration liability is discounted partly at 7.5% and partly at 8.5%. Net debt 2022 \u00a3m 2021 \u00a3m Liquid investments 67 61 Cash and cash equivalents 3,723 4,274 Short term borrowings (3,952) (3,601) Long term borrowings (17,035) (20,572) Net debt the end of the year (17,197) (19,838) At 31 December 2022, net debt was \u00a317.2 billion, compared with \u00a319.8 billion at 31 December 2021, comprising gross debt of \u00a321. 0 billion and cash and liquid investments of \u00a33.8 billion. Net debt reduced by \u00a32.6 billion primarily due to \u00a33.3 billion free cash flow from continuing operations, \u00a30.2 billion disposals of equity investments and \u00a37.2 billion decrease from discontinued operations as result of de merger primarily reflecting \u00a37.1 billion of pre-separation dividends attributable to GSK funded by Consumer Healthcare debt. This was partly offset by purchases of businesses of \u00a33.1 billion, net of cash acquired, reflecting the acquisitions of Sierra Oncology and Affinivax, dividends paid to shareholders of \u00a33.5 billion, net adverse exchange impacts of \u00a31.4 billion from the translation of non-Sterling denomin ated debt and exchange on other financing items and \u00a30.1 billion purchases of equity investments. At 31 December 2022, GSK had short-term borrowings (including overdrafts and lease liabilities) repayable within 12 months of \u00a34.0 billion and \u00a31.9 billion repayable in the subsequent year. 33At 31 December 2022, GSK's cash and liquid investments were held as follows: \u00a3m 2021 \u00a3m Bank balances and deposits 1,324 2,825 US Treasury and Treasury repo only money market funds 146 54 Liquidity funds 2,253 1,395 Cash and cash equivalents 3,723 4,274 Liquid investments - government securities 67 61 3,790 4,335 Cash and liquid investments of \u00a33.1 billion (2021: \u00a32.9 billion) were held centrally at 31 December 2022.

A summary of the movements in equity is set out below: 2022 \u00a3m 2021 \u00a3m Total equity at beginning of year 21,342 20,808 Total comprehensive income for the year 14,790 4,759 Non-cash distribution to non-controlling interests (2,960) \u2014 Deconsolidation of former subsidiaries (3,045) \u2014 Dividends to shareholders (3,467) (3,999) Ordinary shares issued 25 21 Changes in non-controlling interests (20) \u2014 Non-cash dividends to shareholders (15,526) \u2014 Hedging gain/loss transferred to non-financial assets 9 \u2014 Transaction with non-controlling interest \u2014 10 Share-based incentive plans 357 367 Tax on share-based incentive plans (8) 11 Contributions from non-controlling interests 8 7 Distributions to non-controlling interests (1,409) (642) Total equity at end of year 10,096 21,342 34Share purchases At 31 December 2022, GSK held 217.1 million shares as Treasury shares (2021: 284.2 million shares), at a cost of \u00a33,798 million (2021: \u00a34,969 million), which has been deducted from retained earnings. No ordinary shares were repurchased in the period 1 January 2022 to 28 February 2023 and the company does not expect to make an y ordinary share repurchases in the remainder of 2023. In 2022, 77.1 million Treasury shares were transferred to the Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) Trusts, of which 50.3 millio n shares were transferred prior to the share consolidation. Shares are held by the Trusts to satisfy future exercises of options and awards under the Group share option and award schemes. A proportion of the shares held by the Trusts are in respect of awards where the rules of the scheme require GSK to satisfy exe rcises through market purchases rather than the issue of new shares. The shares held by the Trusts are matched to options and awards g ranted. At 31 December 2022, the ESOP Trusts held 59.9 million (2021: 23.3 million) GSK shares against the future exercise of share opt ions and share awards. The carrying value of \u00a3353 million (2021: \u00a327 million) has been deducted from other reserves. The market value of these shares was \u00a3861 million (2021: \u00a3371 million). Contractual obligations and commitments Financial commitments are summarised in \"Note 36 - Commitments\" and in \"Note 44 - Financial instruments and related disclosures \" to the financial statements incorporated by reference in Item 18 below. The following table sets out our contractual obligations and commitments at 31 December 2022 as they fall due for payment. Total Under 1 yr 1-3 yrs 3-5 3,666 Finance lease obligations 1,008 167 328 177 336 Future Finance Charges on leases 146 25 41 28 52 Lease contracts that have not yet commenced 396 18 42 68 268 Intangible assets 10,659 317 590 1,616 8,136 Property, plant & equipment 743 612 131 \u2014 \u2014 Investments 138 51 71 13 3 Purchase commitments 161 96 61 4 \u2014 Pensions and post-retirement benefits 345 345 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Total 40,004 6,011 5,578 5,126 23,289 Commitments in respect of loans and future interest payable on loans are disclosed before taking into account the effect of der ivatives. We have entered into a number of research collaborations to develop new compounds with other pharmaceutical companies. The term s of these arrangements can include upfront fees, equity investments, loans and commitments to fund specified levels of research. In addition, we will often agree to make further payments if future 'milestones' are achieved. As some of these agreements relate to compounds in the early stages of development, the potential obligation to make milestone payments will continue for a number of years if the compounds move successfully through the development process. Generally, the closer the product is to marketing approval, the greater the probability of success. The amounts shown above within intangible assets represent the maximum that would be paid if all milestones were achieved. There was a decrease in the commitments in 2022 as a result of a reduction in outstanding loan commitments. In connection with the demerger of Consumer Healthcare, the 31 December 2020 pension scheme valuations identified cash funding or technical provisions deficits in three GSK UK Pension Schemes. Scottish limited partnerships (\"SLPs\") were established to provi de a funding mechanism for each of GSK's UK defined benefit pension schemes. The SLPs together hold shares representing 7.5% of the total issued share capital of Haleon. Each pension scheme, through its SLP interest, is entitled to receive a distribution from that SLP in an amount equal to the ne t proceeds of sales of Haleon shares, and to receive dividend income on Haleon shares, until it has received an aggregate amount equal to an agreed threshold (\"Proceeds Threshold\"). The Proceeds Thresholds total \u00a31,080 million (as increased by notional interest on the remaining balance from time to time), and payment of this amount would fully fund the cash funding or technical provisions defi cits in the three schemes shown by the 31 December 2020 valuations. Once the Proceeds Threshold has been reached the GSK-controlled GeneralPartner of each SLP is entitled to sell the remaining Haleon shares held by the SLP and distribute the proceeds to GSK. As at31 December 2022, \u00a3345 million remains outstanding to the UK Pension Trustees. 35Contingent liabilities Other contingent liabilities are set out in \"Note 35 - Contingent liabilities\" to the financial statements incorporated by refe rence in Item 18 below. The following table sets out contingent liabilities, comprising performance guarantees, letters of credit and other items arisi ng in the normal course of business, and when they are expected to expire. Total Under 1 yr 1-3 yrs 3-5 yrs 5 yrs+ \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m \u00a3m Guarantees 12 8 3 \u2014 1 Other contingent liabilities 46 10 \u2014 11 25 Total 58 18 3 11 26 In the normal course of business, we have provided various indemnification guarantees in respect of business disposals in which legal and other disputes have subsequently arisen. A provision is made where an outflow of resources is considered probable and a reliabl e estimate can be made of the likely outcome of the dispute and this is included in \"Note 32 - Other provisions\" to the financial statements incorporated by reference in Item 18 below. We provide for the outcome of tax, legal and other disputes when an outflow of resources is considered probable and a reliable estimate of the outflow may be made. At 31 December 2022, other than for those disputes where provision has been made, it was not possib le to make a reliable estimate of the potential outflow of funds that might be required to settle disputes where the possibility of t here being an outflow was more than remote. The ultimate liability for such matters may vary significantly from the amounts provided and is dependent upon negotiations wit h the relevant tax authorities and the outcome of litigation proceedings, where relevant. This is discussed further in 'Principal ris ks and uncertainties' under Item 3.D above on pages 3 to 8 above and \"Note 47 - Legal proceedings\" to the financial statements incorpo rated by reference in Item 18 below. 36Group Financial Review 2021 2021 Financial performanceFinancial performance growth commentary other than for growth in Group turnover is not available at CER without unreasonable ef fort.

Non-controlling interests in ViiV Healthcare Trading profit allocations As ViiV Healthcare is a subsidiary of the Group, 100% of its operating results (turnover, operating profit, profit after tax) a re included within the Group income statement and then a portion of the earnings is allocated to the non-controlling interests owned by the othershareholders, in line with their respective equity shareholdings (Pfizer, Inc. (Pfizer) 11.7% and Shionogi & Co. Ltd (Shionogi) 10%). Each of the shareholders, including GSK, is also entitled to preferential dividends determined by the performance of certain product s that each shareholder contributed. As the relative performance of these products changes over time, the proportion of the overall earning s allocated to each shareholder also changes. In particular, the increasing proportion of sales of dolutegravir and cabotegravir-containing products has a favourable impact on the proportion of the preferential dividends that is allocated to GSK. Adjusting items are allocated to shareholders based on their equity interests. GSK was entitled to approximately 86% of the Total earnings and 83% of the Adjust ed earnings of ViiV Healthcare for 2021. Remeasurements of the liabilities for the preferential dividends allocated to Pfizer and Shionogi are included within other operating income/(expense). 38Acquisition-related arrangements As consideration for the acquisition of Shionogi's interest in the former Shionogi-ViiV Healthcare joint venture in 2012, Shion ogi received the 10% equity stake in ViiV Healthcare and ViiV Healthcare also agreed to pay additional future cash consideration to Shionogi , contingent on the future sales performance of the products being developed by that joint venture, dolutegravir and cabotegravir . Under IFRS 3 'Business combinations', GSK was required to provide for the estimated fair value of this contingent consideration at th e time of acquisition and is required to update the liability to the latest estimate of fair value at each subsequent period end. The lia bility for the contingent consideration recognised in the balance sheet at the date of acquisition was \u00a3659 million. Subsequent re-measurement s are reflected within other operating income/(expense) and within Adjusting items in the income statement in each period. Cash payments to settle the contingent consideration are made to Shionogi by ViiV Healthcare each quarter, based on the actual sales performance and other income of the relevant products in the previous quarter. These payments reduce the balance sheet liabilit y and hence are not recorded in the income statement. The cash payments made to Shionogi by ViiV Healthcare in 2021 were \u00a3826 million . As the liability is required to be recorded at the fair value of estimated future payments, there is a significant timing diffe rence between the charges that are recorded in the Total income statement to reflect movements in the fair value of the liability and the actual cash payments made to settle the liability. The cash payments are reflected in the cash flow statement partly in operating cash flows and partly within investing activitie s. The tax relief on these payments is reflected in the Group's Adjusting items as part of the tax charge. The part of each payment relati ng to the original estimate of the fair value of the contingent consideration on the acquisition of the Shionogi-ViiV Healthcare joint ve nture in 2012 of \u00a3659 million is reported within investing activities in the cash flow statement and the part of each payment relating to the in crease in the liability since the acquisition is reported within operating cash flows. Movements in contingent consideration payable to Shionogi were as follows: 2021 \u00a3m 2020 \u00a3m Contingent consideration at beginning of the year 5,359 5,103 Remeasurement through income statement and other movements 1,026 Cash payments: operating cash flows (721) (751) Cash payments: investing activities (105) (107) Contingent consideration at end of the year 5,559 5,359 Of the contingent consideration payable (on a post-tax basis) to Shionogi at 31 December 2021, \u00a3937 million (31 December 2020: \u00a3745 million) is expected to be paid within one year. Exit rights Pfizer may request an IPO of ViiV Healthcare at any time and if either GSK does not consent to such IPO or an offering is not c ompleted within nine months, Pfizer could require GSK to acquire its shareholding. Under the original agreements, GSK had the unconditio nal right, so long as it made no subsequent distribution to its shareholders, to withhold its consent to the exercise of the Pfizer put op tion and, as a result, in accordance with IFRS, GSK did not recognise a liability for the put option on its balance sheet. However, during Q1 2016, GSK notified Pfizer that it had irrevocably given up this right and accordingly recognised the liability for the put option on the Group's balance sheet during Q1 2016 at an initial value of \u00a31,070 million. Consistent with this revised treatment, at the end of Q1 2016 GSK a lso recognised liabilities for the future preferential dividends anticipated to become payable to Pfizer and Shionogi on the Group' s balance sheet. Pfizer has the right to require GSK to acquire its shareholding in ViiV Healthcare in certain circumstances at any time. A put option liability is therefore recorded on the Group's balance sheet as a current liability. It is measured on the gross redemption basis derived from an internal valuation of the ViiV Healthcare business. The closing balances of the liabilities related to Pfizer's shareholding are as follows: 2021 \u00a3m 2020 \u00a3m Pfizer put option 1,008 960 Pfizer preferential dividend \u2014 1 Under the original agreements, Shionogi could also have requested GSK to acquire its shareholding in ViiV Healthcare in six-mon th windows commencing in 2017, 2020 and 2022. GSK had the unconditional right, so long as it made no subsequent distribution to it s shareholders, to withhold its consent to the exercise of the Shionogi put option and, as a result, GSK did not recognise a liab ility for the put option on its balance sheet. However, during Q1 2016, GSK notified Shionogi that it had irrevocably given up this right and accordingly recognised the liabi lity for the put option on the Group's balance sheet during Q1 2016 at an initial value of \u00a3926 million. In Q4 2016, Shionogi irrevocably ag reed to waive its put option and as a result GSK de-recognised the liability for this put option on the Group's balance sheet directly to equity. The value of the liability was \u00a31,244 million when it was de-recognised. GSK also has a call option over Shionogi's shareholding in ViiV Healthcare, which under the original agreements was exercisable in six-month windows commencing in 2027, 2030 and 2032. GSK has now irrevocably agreed to waive the first two exercise windows, bu t the last six-month window in 2032 remains. As this call option is at fair value, it has no value for accounting purposes. Settlement with Gilead On 1 February 2022, ViiV Healthcare reached agreement with Gilead to settle the global patent infringement litigation relating to the commercialisation of Gilead's Biktarvy. Under the terms of the global settlement and licensing agreement, Gilead made an upfron t payment of $1.25 billion to ViiV Healthcare in February 2022. In addition, Gilead will also pay a 3% royalty on all future US s ales of Biktarvy and in respect of the bictegravir component of any other future bictegravir- containing products sold in the US. These royalties will be payable by Gilead to ViiV Healthcare from 1 February 2022 until the expiry of ViiV Healthcare's US Patent No. 8,129,385 on 5 October 2027. Gilead's obligation to pay royalties does not extend into any period of regulatory paediatric exclusivity, if awarded. Th e settlement resulted in a re- measurement of the existing liabilities for contingent consideration and the Pfizer put option at the 2021 ye ar end. The impact of the settlement with Gilead on the contingent consideration liability (CCL) was to increase it by \u00a3288 million, on a post-tax basis in Q4 2021 due to the obligation ViiV Healthcare has to pay future cash consideration to Shionogi for its share of the up front and of the future US sales performance of Biktarvy and products containing bictegravir. Including the impact of the settlement at 31 D ecember 2021, the liability which is discounted at 8% stood at \u00a35,559 million, on a post-tax basis.The impact of the settlement on the Pfizer put option liability was an increase of \u00a3114 million and was included in the re-meas urement at 31 December 2021. 39Reporting definitions Reporting definitions are set out on pages 20 and 21 above.

Group turnover was \u00a324,696 million in 2021, up 1% at AER, 6% at CER compared to 2020. In 2021 sales of COVID-19 solutions contributed growth of 6% at AER and 6% CER. Specialty Medicines turnover in the year was \u00a38,251 million, up 18% AER, 25% CER. Sales of Xevudy , the monoclonal antibody treatment for COVID-19 of \u00a3958 million contributed approximately 15 percentage points to Specialty Medicines growth. Vaccines turnover in the year decreased 3% at AER but grew 2% at CER to \u00a36,778 million, primarily driven by pandemic adjuvant s ales, partially offset by foreign exchange and lower demand for routine adult vaccination due to COVID-19 vaccination programme deplo yment and disease circulation across regions, resulting in lower Shingrix and Hepatitis vaccines sales. Unfavourable US prior period RAR adjustments reduced overall Vaccines growth by approximately 2 percentage points, particularly in Fluarix/ FluLaval and Shingrix where the impact on product growth was a decrease of 7% and a decrease of 2% respectively. Sales of pandemic adjuvant contributed 6% at AER, 7% at CER. Excluding these sales Vaccines turnover decreased 9% AER, 5% CER t o \u00a36,331 million.

Triumeq sales were \u00a31,882 million, down 18% AER, 14% CER and Tivicay sales were \u00a31,381 million, down 10% AER, 4% CER. The mature portfolio resulted in less than 1 percentage point of CER sales decrease. New HIV products Juluca , Dovato , Rukobia and Cabenuva delivered sales of million representing 29% of the total HIV portfolio (18% in 2020). Sales of the two drug regimens Juluca and Dovato were \u00a3517 million and \u00a3787 million, respectively, with combined growth of 50% AER, 58% CER. Rukobia sales were \u00a345 million. Cabenuva , the first long acting injectable, recorded \u00a338 million of sales for the full year. In the US, total sales were \u00a32,898 million with a decrease of 4% AER, but growth of 3% CER.

New HIV products delivered sales of \u00a3420 million, including: Dovato sales of \u00a3302 million, which more than doubled at AER and CER, and Juluca \u00a3111 million with growth of 14% AER, 18% CER. Combined Tivicay and Triumeq sales were \u00a3738 million declining 21% AER, 19% CER. International continued to grow strongly with total sales of \u00a3685 million, with growth of 4% AER, 11% CER, driven by the Tivicay tender business and new HIV products. Oncology Sales of Zejula , the PARP inhibitor treatment for ovarian cancer were \u00a3395 million, up 17% AER, 22% CER, impacted by ongoing lower diagnosis rates due to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in the US. Sales included \u00a3212 million in the US and \u00a3163 million in Europe. 40Blenrep for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma was approved and launched in the US and Europe in Q3 2020, with ongoing launches throughout Europe in 2021. Blenrep sales globally totalled \u00a389 million. Immuno-inflammation, respiratory and other Immuno-inflammation, respiratory and other sales were \u00a32,027 million, up 18% AER, 25% CER with Benlysta sales up 22% AER, 29% CER to \u00a3874 million, benefitting from lupus nephritis launches in US and Japan in H2 2020. Sales of Nucala were \u00a31,142 million in the year and grew 15% AER, 22% CER, with consistent, strong growth across all three regions.

Bexsero sales were stable at AER, but grew 5% CER to \u00a3650 million, reflecting increased market share in the US. Menveo sales were up 3% AER, 9% CER to \u00a3272 million, primarily driven by 2020 cohort catch-up vaccinations and 2021 higher demand, as well as increased market share in the US. Influenza Fluarix/FluLaval sales decreased 7% AER, 2% CER, to \u00a3679 million as a result of unfavourable prior period RAR movements in the US, partially offset by higher volume in the US and strong southern hemisphere demand in International. Shingles Shingrix decreased 13% AER, 9% CER to \u00a31,721 million, primarily driven by lower demand in the US and International for routine adult vaccination due to COVID-19 vaccination programme deployment and disease circulation. In Europe, sales growth was driven by Germany and launches in the UK, Spain and Italy. Shingrix was sold in 17 countries, including 9 markets launched during 2021. Established Vaccines Hepatitis vaccines sales were down 20% AER, 16% CER to \u00a3460 million, adversely impacted by de-prioritisation of routine US adul t vaccinations, increased Hepatitis B vaccine competition and unfavourable CDC stockpile movements in the US, and by COVID-19 rel ated travel restrictions in Europe and International. Sales of DTPa-containing ( Infanrix , sales decreased 14% AER, 9% CER to \u00a3543 million, reflecting lower tender volume in Europe and International as well as a change in recommendation for the dosing schedule in Germany, partly offset by increased demand in the US. Boostrix sales grew 9% AER, 14% CER to \u00a3521 million, largely driven by demand recovery and tender volumes in International, as well as higher demand and share in the US. Rotarix sales were down 3% AER but up 1% CER to \u00a3541 million, reflecting demand recovery in International and foreign exchange impacts. Synflorix sales decreased by 11% AER, 8% CER to \u00a3357 million, primarily due to lower tender demand in Emerging markets. MMRV vaccines sales were stable at AER but grew 4% CER to \u00a3260 million, largely driven by higher demand in International.

Advair/Seretide sales of \u00a31,357 million continued to be eroded by generic competition, decreasing by 12% at AER, 7% at CER. Other general medicines Other General Medicines sales were \u00a33,619 million, down 15% at AER and 15% at CER primarily driven by a decline in Augmentin at 13% AER and 7% CER due to lower demand for antibiotics during the COVID-19 Pandemic period. Avodart which declined 19% at AER and 25% at CER due to loss of exclusivity in Japan and Europe and the divestment of GSK's cephalosporin products in Q4 2021.

Total cost of sales as a percentage of turnover was 33.1%, 0.5 percentage points higher at AER than 2020. Adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of turnover was 29.7%, 2.3 percentage points higher at AER compared with 2020. This prim arily reflected higher pandemic sales ( Xevudy ) as well as higher supply chain costs in Vaccines resulting from lower demand and higher inventory adjustments, partly offset by price benefits, including the benefit from prior period RAR adjustments, a further cont ribution from restructuring savings across the business and favourable mix in Vaccines. Selling, general and administration 2021(1) \u00a3m 2020(1) \u00a3m Growth \u00a3% Total selling, general and administration (7,070) (7,437) (5) Adjusted selling, general and administration (6,749) (7,025) (4) (1) The 2021 and 2020 results have been restated on a consistent basis from those previously published to reflect the demerger of the Consumer Healthcare business (see \"Note 41 - Acquisitions and Disposals\" to the financial statements incorporated by reference in Item 18 below). Total SG&A costs as a percentage of turnover were 28.6%, 1.9 percentage points lower at AER compared to 2020. This included a reduction in restructuring charges. Adjusted SG&A costs as a percentage of turnover were 27.3%, 1.5 percentage points lower at AER than in 2020. Adjusted SG&A cost s decreased 4% at AER which reflected the tight control of ongoing costs and reduced variable spending across all three businesse s as a result of the COVID-19 lockdowns, and the continuing benefit of restructuring in Commercial Operations and support functions. T he decrease also reflected a favourable legal settlement in 2021 compared to increased legal costs in 2020 as well as one-off bene fits in pensions and insurance which were partly offset by the one-off benefit from restructuring of post- retirement benefits in 2020. This was partly offset by increased investment behind launches in HIV and Vaccines. Research and development 2021(1) \u00a3m 2020(1) \u00a3m Growth \u00a3% Total research and (4,793) 5 Adjusted research and development (4,525) (4,322) 5 (1) The 2021 and 2020 results have been restated on a consistent basis from those previously published to reflect the demerger of the Consumer Healthcare business (see \"Note 41 - Acquisitions and Disposals\" to the financial statements incorporated by reference in Item 18 below). Total R&D expenditure was \u00a35,019 million up 5% at AER including an increase in impairments partly offset by a decrease in major restructuring charges. Adjusted R&D expenditure increased by 5% at AER to \u00a34,525 million (18.3% of turnover), up 4% at AER, primarily driven by increa sed investment in our Specialty portfolios, including the early stage research projects. Efficiency savings continued from the impl ementation of the One R&D programme for Research and Development as part of the Separation preparation restructuring programme. 42The growth of the Specialty portfolio in 2021 was primarily driven by our two programmes for COVID-19 treatment (Xevudy and oti limab) along with the other otilimab programme rheumatoid arthritis, our HBV antisense oligonucleotide and depemokim ab, our anti-IL5 for asthma. This has been partly offset by reduced spend on daprodustat due to the completion of programmes. In Oncolo gy, there is continued investment reflecting our commitment to synthetic lethality and in Blenrep, together with bintrafusp alfa, w here we have accelerated close-out costs for the programme but this has been largely offset by a reduction in spend on feladilimab following the decision to terminate the programme in April. Vaccines increased investment in clinical programmes for meningitis and RSV and investment in our mRNA platform, partly offset by efficiency savings from the implementation of the One Development programme a nd variable spending as a result of COVID-19 lockdowns. Royalty income Royalty income was \u00a3417 million (2020: \u00a3321 million), up 30% AER primarily driven by higher sales of Gardasil. Other operating income/(expense) Net other operating expenses of \u00a3504 million (2020: \u00a31,463 million income) primarily reflected accounting charges of \u00a31,101 mil lion (2020: \u00a31,234 million) arising from the re-measurement of the contingent consideration liabilities related to the acquisitions of the former Shionogi-ViiV Healthcare joint venture and the former Novartis Vaccines business and the liabilities for the Pfizer put option and Pfizer and Shionogi preferential dividends in ViiV Healthcare. This included a re-measurement charge of \u00a31,026 million (2020: \u00a31,114 milli on) for the contingent consideration liability due to Shionogi, as a result of the unwinding of the discount for \u00a3380 million and a charge for \u00a3646 million primarily from adjustments to sales forecasts and the settlement with Gilead (see \"Settlement with Gilead Sciences Inc. (Gilead )\" above). This was partly offset by a number of asset disposals including the disposal of royalty rights on cabozantinib, the disposal of the cephalosporin business and fair value uplifts on investments. 2020 included the net profit on disposal of Horlicks and other Co nsumer Healthcare brands of \u00a32,815 million, partly offset by the related loss on sale of the shares in Hindustan Unilever of \u00a3476 mill ion. Operating profit Total operating profit was \u00a34,357 million compared with \u00a35,979 million in 2020. This primarily reflected an unfavourable compar ison to the net profit on disposal in Q2 2020 of Horlicks and other Consumer brands and resultant sale of shares in Hindustan Unilever. Thi s was partly offset by lower major restructuring costs and lower re-measurement charges on the contingent consideration liabilities. Total operating margin was 17.6%. Excluding these and other Adjusting items, Adjusted operating profit was \u00a36,493 million, 2% lower than 2020 at AER, on a turnov er increase of 1% AER. The Adjusted operating margin of 26.3% was 1.0 percentage points lower at AER. The decrease in Adjusted operating profit reflected foreign exchange, lower sales in Vaccines, primarily Shingrix , higher supply chain costs in Vaccines and increased investment in R&D across Vaccines and Specialty Medicines. This was partially offset by the benefit f rom incremental pandemic sales ( Xevudy and adjuvant) contributing approximately 9% AER to Adjusted Operating profit growth. Adjusted Operating profit also benefited from sales growth in Commercial Operations including the benefit from prior period RAR adjustme nts and tight control of ongoing costs including reduced promotional and variable spending across all the business as a result of the C OVID-19 lockdowns, favourable legal settlements compared to increased legal costs in 2020 and benefits from continued restructuring acr oss the business. Contingent consideration cash payments which are made to Shionogi and other companies reduce the balance sheet liability and he nce are not recorded in the income statement. Total contingent consideration cash payments in 2021 amounted to \u00a3856 million (2020: \u00a3885 million). This included cash payments made to Shionogi of \u00a3826 million (2020: \u00a3858 million). Adjusted operating profit by business Commercial Operations operating profit was \u00a311,467 million, up 2% AER on a turnover increase of 2% AER. The operating margin of 46.4% was 0.2 percentage points lower at AER than in 2020. This primarily reflected price benefits in Commercial Operations, in cluding the benefit from a prior period RAR adjustment, the tight control of ongoing costs, short term benefits to changes in ways of w orking, a favourable legal settlement in 2021 compared to increased legal costs in 2020, increased royalty income and the continuing bene fit of restructuring. This was partly offset by support to launches in HIV and Vaccines and higher supply chain costs in Vaccines. Research and Development operating expenses were \u00a34,567 million, up 4% AER primarily driven by increased investment in our Spec ialty portfolios, including the early stage research projects. Net finance costs Finance income 2021(1) \u00a3m 2020(1) \u00a3m Interest and other income 13 26 Fair value movements 1 6 14 32 Finance expense Interest expense (735) (813) Unwinding of discounts on provisions (2) (3) Remeasurements and fair value movements (2) (2) Finance expense on lease liabilities (27) (33) Other finance expense (3) (23) (769) (874) (1) The 2021 and 2020 results have been restated on a consistent basis from those previously published to reflect the demerger of the Consumer Healthcare business (see \"Note 41 - Acquisitions and Disposals\" to the financial statements incorporated by reference in Item 18 below). Total net finance costs were \u00a3755 million compared with \u00a3842 million in 2020. Adjusted net finance costs were \u00a3752 million comp ared with \u00a3838 million in 2020. The decrease is primarily as a result of reduced interest expense from lower debt levels, favourable move ments in foreign exchange rates, a premium paid on the early repayment and refinancing of bond debt in 2020 and reduced interest on tax partly offset by lower interest income on overseas cash post-closing of the divestment of Horlicks and other Consumer Healthcare nutri tion products in India and a number of other countries.Share of after tax profits of associates and joint ventures The share of after tax profits of associates and joint ventures was \u00a333 million (2020 - \u00a333 million). 43Loss on disposal of interest in associates The net loss on disposal of interests in associates was \u00a336 million, primarily driven by a loss on disposal of our interest in the associate Innoviva Inc. Profit before tax Taking account of net finance costs, the share of profits of associates and loss on disposal of interest in associates, profit before taxation was \u00a33,599 million compared with \u00a35,170 million in 2020. Taxation 2021(1) \u00a3m 2020(1) \u00a3m UK current year charge 119 (45) Rest of world current year charge 593 745 Charge/(credit) in respect of prior periods 219 11 Total current taxation 931 711 Total deferred taxation (848) (644) Taxation on total profits 83 67 (1) The 2021 and 2020 results have been restated on a consistent basis from those previously published to reflect the demerger of the Consumer Healthcare business (see \"Note 41 - Acquisitions and Disposals\" to the financial statements incorporated by reference in Item 18 below). The charge of \u00a383 million represented an effective tax rate on Total results of 2.3% (2020: 1.3%) and reflected the different t ax effects of the various Adjusting items, including a credit of \u00a3430 million resulting from the revaluation of deferred tax assets following enactment of an increase in the headline rate of UK corporation tax (effective 1 April 2023). 2020 reflected the disposal of Horlicks and ot her Consumer brands and the subsequent disposal of shares received in Hindustan Unilever. Tax on Adjusted profit amounted to \u00a3918 million an d represented an effective Adjusted tax rate of 15.9% (2020: 13.9%). Issues related to taxation are described in Note 14 to the financial statements 'Taxation' incorporated by reference in Item 18 below. The Group continues to believe it has made adequate provision for the liabilities likely to arise from periods which are open and n ot yet agreed by tax authorities. The ultimate liability for such matters may vary from the amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcom e of agreements with relevant tax authorities. Non-controlling interests The allocation of Total earnings to non-controlling interests amounted to \u00a3200 million (2020: \u00a3230 million). Allocation of ViiV Healthcare profits was \u00a3196 million (2020: \u00a3223 million), including reduced credits for re-measurement of contingent consideration liabili ties. The allocation of Adjusted earnings to non-controlling interests amounted to \u00a3441 million (2020: \u00a3481 million). The reduction i n allocation primarily reflected a reduced allocation of ViiV Healthcare profits of \u00a3438 million (2020: \u00a3474 million), partly offset by high er net profits in some of the Group's other entities with non-controlling interests. Earnings per share Total EPS from continuing operations was 82.9p compared with 122.4p in 2020. This primarily reflected an unfavourable compariso n to the net profit on disposal in Q2 2020 of Horlicks and other Consumer Healthcare brands partly offset by the related loss on sal e of the shares in Hindustan Unilever, partly offset by a credit of \u00a3430 million to Taxation in 2021 resulting from the revaluation of d eferred tax assets following enactment of an increase in the headline rate of UK corporation tax (effective 1 April 2023), lower major rest ructuring costs and lower remeasurement charges on the contingent consideration liabilities. Adjusted EPS was 110.3p compared with 114.4p in 2020, down 4% AER primarily reflecting foreign exchange, lower sales in Vaccine s, primarily Shingrix , higher supply chain costs in Vaccines, increased R&D investment and a higher effective tax rate. This was offset by incremental pandemic sales, sales increases in Pharmaceuticals, tight cost control and favourable legal settlements and lower i nterest costs. Major restructuring and integration Within the Pharmaceuticals sector, the highly regulated manufacturing operations and supply chains and long life cycle of the b usiness mean that restructuring programmes, particularly those that involve the rationalisation or closure of manufacturing or R&D site s are likely to take several years to complete. Major restructuring costs are those related to specific Board-approved Major restructuring programmes and are excluded from Adj usted results. Major restructuring programmes, including integration costs following material acquisitions, are those that are struct ural and are of a significant scale where the costs of individual or related projects exceed \u00a325 million. Other ordinary course smaller-scale r estructuring costs are retained within Total and Adjusted results. Total Major restructuring charges incurred in 2021 were \u00a3424 million (2020 - \u00a31,178 million), cash \u00a3m Total \u00a3m Separation preparation restructuring programme 353 59 412 624 215 839 Legacy programmes 32 (20) 12 145 194 339 385 39 424 769 409 1,178 (1) The 2021 and 2020 results have been restated on a consistent basis from those previously published to reflect the demerger o f the Consumer Healthcare business (see \"Note 41 - Acquisitions and Disposals\" to the financial statements incorporated by reference in Item 18 below). Cash charges of \u00a3353 million under the Separation Preparation programme primarily arose from restructuring of some administrati ve functions as well as Global Supply chain, R&D functions and Commercial. The non-cash charges of \u00a359 million primarily reflected write- down of assets in administrative locations and R&D sites. 44Total cash payments made in 2021 were \u00a3551 million (2020: \u00a3435 million), \u00a3428 million (2020: \u00a3152 million) relating to Sepa ration Preparation restructuring programme, \u00a3123 million (2020: \u00a3256 million) relating to other legacy programmes including the settle ment of certain charges accrued in previous quarters. The analysis of Major restructuring charges by income statement line was as follows: 2021(1) \u00a3m 2020(1) \u00a3m Cost of sales 102 585 Selling, general and administration 277 395 Research and development 45 198 Total Major restructuring costs from continuing operations 424 1,178 (1) The 2021 and 2020 results have been restated on a consistent basis from those previously published to reflect the demerger of the Consumer Healthcare business (see \"Note 41 - Acquisitions and Disposals\" to the financial statements incorporated by reference in Item 18 below). The benefit in the 2021 from restructuring programmes was \u00a30.7 billion, the benefit from the Separation Preparation restructuri ng programme was \u00a30.3 billion and the benefit from the 2018 Restructuring programme was \u00a30.2 billion. The Group initiated in Q1 2020 a two-year Separation Preparation programme to prepare for the separation of GSK into two compan ies: new GSK, a biopharma company with an R&D approach focused on science related to the immune system, the use of genetics and newtechnologies, and a new leader in Consumer Healthcare. The programme aimed to: Drive a common approach to R&D with improved capital allocation Align and improve the capabilities and efficiency of global support functions to support new GSK Further optimise the supply chain and product portfolio, including the divestment of non-core assets. A strategic review of prescription dermatology is underway Prepare Consumer Healthcare to operate as a standalone company Legacy programmes included the 2018 major restructuring programme, including Tesaro, which cost \u00a31.5 billion to the end of 2021 , with cash costs of \u00a30.6 billion and non-cash costs of \u00a30.9 billion, and has delivered annual savings of around \u00a30.5 billion by the e nd of 2021 (at 2019 rates). These savings were fully re-invested to help fund targeted increases in R&D and commercial support of new products . The programme is substantially complete. Transaction-related adjustments Transaction-related adjustments resulted in a net charge of \u00a31,143 million (2020: \u00a31,237 million). This included a net \u00a31,101 m illion accounting charge for the re-measurement of the contingent consideration liabilities related to the acquisitions of the former Shionogi-ViiV Healthcare joint venture and the former Novartis Vaccines business and the liabilities for the Pfizer put option and Pfizer and Shionogi preferential dividends in ViiV Healthcare. Charge/(credit) 2021(1) \u00a3m 2020(1) \u00a3m Contingent consideration on Venture (including Shionogi preferential dividends) 1,026 1,114 ViiV Healthcare put options and Pfizer preferential dividends 48 (52) Contingent consideration on former Novartis Vaccines business 27 172 Other adjustments 42 3 Total transaction-related charges 1,143 1,237 (1) The 2021 and 2020 results have been restated on a consistent basis from those previously published to reflect the demerger of the Consumer Healthcare business (see \"Note 41 - Acquisitions and Disposals\" to the financial statements incorporated by reference in Item 18 below). The \u00a31,026 million charge relating to the contingent consideration for the former Shionogi-ViiV Healthcare joint venture repres ented an increase in the valuation of the contingent consideration due to Shionogi, as a result of the unwind of the discount for \u00a3380 m illion and a charge of \u00a3646 million primarily from adjustments to sales forecasts and the settlement with Gilead as well as updated exchange rate assumptions. The \u00a348 million charge relating to the ViiV Healthcare put option and Pfizer preferential dividends represented an increase in the valuation of the put option as a result of the settlement with Gilead, offset by lower cash and updated exchange rate assum ptions. An explanation of the accounting for the non-controlling interests in ViiV Healthcare is set out above under \"Reporting framewo rk\". Divestments, significant legal charges and other items Divestments and other items also included gains from a number of asset disposals, including the disposal of royalty rights on c abozantinib, disposal of the cephalosporins business, fair value gains on investments and certain other Adjusting items, including the impac t of the enactment of the increase in the headline rate of UK Corporate tax as discussed in \"Note 14\u2014Taxation\" to the financial statemen ts incorporated by reference in Item 18 below. In 2021 the net loss on disposal of interests in associates was \u00a336 million, primar ily driven by a loss on disposal of the interest in the associate Innoviva Inc. A charge of \u00a335 million (2020: \u00a37 million) was recorded for s ignificant legal matters arising in 2021. Significant legal cash payments were \u00a35 million (2020: \u00a39 million). 45Cash generation and conversion A summary of the consolidated cash flow statement is set out below. 2021 \u00a3m 2020 \u00a3m Total net cash inflow from operating activities 7,952 8,441 Total net cash (outflow) from investing activities (1,777) 2,161 Total net cash inflow/(outflow) from financing activities (7,589) (10,132) (Increase)/Decrease in cash and bank overdrafts (1,414) 470 Cash and bank overdrafts at beginning of year 5,262 4,831 Exchange adjustments (29) (39) Decrease in cash and bank overdrafts (1,414) 470 Cash and bank overdrafts at end of year 3,819 5,262 Cash and bank overdrafts at end of year comprise: Cash and cash equivalents 4,274 6,292 Overdrafts (455) (1,030) 3,819 5,262 The net cash inflow from operating activities for the year was \u00a37,952 million (2020: \u00a38,441 million). The decrease primarily re flected , increased trade receivables, adverse timing of RAR, , a reduction in cash from discontinued operations including increased sepa ration costs and reduced adjusted operating profit at AER partly offset by reduced tax payments including tax on disposals. Reconciliation of net cash inflow from continuing operating activities to free cash inflow A reconciliation of net cash inflow from operating activities, which is the closest equivalent IFRS measure to free cash flow, is shown below. 2021(1) \u00a3m 2020(1) \u00a3m Net cash inflow from continuing operating activities 6,277 6,588 Purchase of property, plant and equipment (950) (989) Purchase of intangible assets (1,704) (956) Proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment 132 49 Proceeds from sale of intangible assets 641 343 Net finance costs (758) (824) Dividends from joint ventures and associates 9 31 Contingent consideration paid (reported in investing activities) (114) (120) Contribution from non-controlling interests 7 3 Distributions to non-controlling interests (239) (442) Free cash inflow 3,301 3,683 (1) The 2021 and 2020 results have been restated on a consistent basis from those previously published to reflect the demerger of the Consumer Healthcare business (see \"Note 41 - Acquisitions and Disposals\" to the financial statements incorporated by reference in Item 18 below). Capital expenditure and financial investment Cash payments for tangible and intangible fixed assets amounted to \u00a32,654 million (2020: \u00a31,945 million) and disposals realised \u00a3773 million (2020: \u00a3392 million). Cash payments to acquire equity investments amounted to \u00a3162 million (2020: \u00a3411 million), p rimarily relating to Vir Biotechnology, and sales of equity investments realised \u00a3202 million (2020: \u00a33,269 million). Free cash flow Free cash flow is the amount of cash generated by the Group after meeting our obligations for contingent consideration, interes t, tax and dividends paid to non-controlling interests, and after capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment and intangible asse ts. 2021(1) \u00a3m (1) The 2021 comparative results have been restated on a consistent basis from those previously published to reflect the demerger of the Consumer Healthcare business (see \"Note 41 - Acquisitions and Disposals\" to the financial statements incorporated by reference in Item 18 below). Total cash payments to Shionogi in relation to the ViiV Healthcare contingent consideration liability in the year were \u00a3826 mil lion (2020: \u00a3858 million), of which \u00a3721 million was recognised in cash flows from operating activities and \u00a3105 million was recognised in contingent consideration paid within investing cash flows. These payments are deductible for tax purposes. 46Treasury policies We report in Sterling and pay dividends out of Sterling cash flows. The role of Treasury is to monitor and manage the Group's e xternal and internal funding requirements and financial risks in support of our strategic objectives. GSK operates on a global basis, prima rily through subsidiary companies, and we manage our capital to ensure that our subsidiaries are able to operate as going concerns and to op timise returns to shareholders through an appropriate balance of debt and equity. Treasury activities are governed by policies approve d annually by the Board of Directors, and most recently on 12 October 2022. A Treasury Management Group (TMG) meeting, chaired by our Chie f Financial Officer, takes place on a regular basis to review Treasury activities. Its members receive management information rel ating to these activities. Treasury operations The objective of GSK's Treasury activities is to minimise the post-tax net cost of financial operations and reduce its volatili ty in order to benefit earnings and cash flows. GSK uses a variety of financial instruments to finance its operations and derivative financial instruments to manage market risks from these operations. Derivatives principally comprise foreign exchange forward contracts and swaps whi ch are used to swap borrowings and liquid assets into currencies required for Group purposes, as well as interest rate swaps which are used to manage exposure to financial risks from changes in interest rates. Derivatives are used exclusively for hedging purposes in relation to underlying business activities and not as trading or specu lative instruments. Capital management GSK's financial strategy, implemented through the Group's financial architecture, supports GSK's strategic priorities and is re gularly reviewed by the Board. We manage the capital structure of the Group through an appropriate mix of debt and equity. We continue to manage our financial policies to a credit profile that particularly targets short-term credit ratings of A-1 and P-1 while main taining single A long-term ratings consistent with those targets. Liquidity risk management GSK's policy is to borrow centrally in order to meet anticipated funding requirements. Our cash flow forecasts and funding requ irements are monitored by the TMG on a regular basis. Our strategy is to diversify liquidity sources using a range of facilities and to maintain broad access to financial markets. Each day, we sweep cash to or from number of global subsidiaries to central Treasury accounts for liquidity management purposes . Interest rate risk management GSK's objective is to minimise the effective net interest cost and to balance the mix of debt at fixed and floating interest ra tes over time. The policy on interest rate risk management limits the net amount of floating rate debt to a specific cap, reviewed and agreed no less than annually by the Board. Foreign exchange risk management Our objective is to minimise the exposure of overseas operating subsidiaries to transaction risk by matching local currency inc ome with local currency costs where possible. Foreign currency transaction exposures arising on external and internal trade flows are se lectively hedged. GSK's internal trading transactions are matched centrally and we manage inter-company payment terms to reduce foreign currency risk. Where possible, we manage the cash surpluses or borrowing requirements of subsidiary companies centrally using f orward contracts to hedge future repayments back into the originating currency. In order to reduce foreign currency translation exposure, we seek to denominate borrowings in the currencies of our principal a ssets and cash flows. These are primarily denominated in US Dollars, Euros and Sterling. Borrowings can be swapped into other currencies as required. Borrowings denominated in, or swapped into, foreign currencies tha t match investments in overseas Group assets may be treated as a hedge against the relevant assets.Forward contracts in major currencies are also used to reduce exposure to the Group's investment in overseas Group assets. The TMG reviews the ratio of borrowings to assets for major currencies regularly. Commodity risk management Our objective is to minimise income statement volatility arising from fluctuations in commodity prices, where practical and cos t effective to do so. The TMG is authorised to approve the execution of certain financial derivatives to hedge commodity price exposures. Counterparty risk management We set global counterparty limits for each of our banking and investment counterparties based on long-term credit ratings from Moody's and Standard and Poor's. Usage of these limits is actively monitored and any breach of these limits would be reported to the Ch ief Financial Officer immediately. In addition, relationship banks and their credit ratings are reviewed regularly so that, when changes in ratings occur, changes can be made to investment levels or to authority limits as appropriate. All banking counterparty limits are reviewed at least annually. Critical accounting policies The Group consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with international accounting standards in conform ity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the Internat ional Accounting Standard Board (IASB). We are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses reported in the financial statements. Actual amounts and results could differ from those estimates. The critical accounting policies relate to the following areas: Turnover (Note 6) Taxation (Note 14) Legal and other disputes (Notes 47 and 32) Contingent liabilities (Note 35) Pensions and other post-employment benefits (Note 31). 47Information on the judgements and estimates made in these areas is given in \"Note 3 - Critical accounting judgements and key so urces of estimation uncertainty\" to the financial statements incorporated by reference in Item 18 below. Turnover In respect of the Turnover accounting policy, our largest business is US Commercial Operations, and the US market has the most complex arrangements for rebates, discounts and allowances. The following briefly describes the nature of the arrangements in existence in our US Commercial Operations: We have arrangements with certain indirect customers whereby the customer is able to buy products from wholesalers at reduced prices. A chargeback represents the difference between the invoice price to the wholesaler and the indirect customer's contractual discounted price. Accruals for estimating chargebacks are calculated based on the terms of each agreement, historical experience and product growth rates Customer rebates are offered to key managed care and Group Purchasing Organisations and other direct and indirect customers. These arrangements require the customer to achieve certain performance targets relating to the value of productpurchased, formulary status or pre-determined market shares relative to competitors. The accrual for customer rebates is estimated based on the specific terms in each agreement, historical experience and product growth rates The US Medicaid programme is a state-administered programme providing assistance to certain poor and vulnerable patients. In 1990, the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program was established to reduce state and federal expenditure on prescription drugs. In 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act became law. We participate by providing rebates to states. Accruals forMedicaid rebates are calculated based on the specific terms of the relevant regulations or the Patient Protection andAffordable Care Act Cash discounts are offered to customers to encourage prompt payment. These are accrued for at the time of invoicing and adjusted subsequently to reflect actual experience We record an accrual for estimated sales returns by applying historical experience of customer returns to the amounts invoiced, together with market-related information such as stock levels at wholesalers, anticipated price increases andcompetitor activity A reconciliation of gross turnover to net turnover for US Commercial Operations is as follows: 2022 2021 2020 \u00a3m Margin % \u00a3 m Margin % \u00a3 m Margin % Gross turnover 29,814 100 24,432 100 24,570 100 Market-driven segments (8,275) (28) (6,875) (28) (7,004) (29) Government mandated and state programmes (6,218) (21) (5,134) (21) (5,710) (23) Cash discounts (536) (2) (438) (2) (453) (2) Customer returns (255) (1) (253) (1) (235) (1) Prior year adjustments 780 3 855 4 540 2 Other items (768) (2) (673) (3) (560) (2) Total deductions (15,272) (51) (12,518) (51) (13,422) (55) Net turnover 14,542 49 11,914 49 11,148 45 The reconciliation has been revised to include Vaccines as part of US Commercial Operations in all years. Market-driven segments consist primarily of managed care and Medicare plans with which we negotiate contract pricing that is ho noured via rebates and chargebacks. Mandated segments consist primarily of Medicaid and federal government programmes which receive government- mandated pricing via rebates and chargebacks. Overall sales deduction as a percentage of sales is consistent year over year with sales growth coming primarily from Trelegy and Specialty Products including ViiV. Deductions within the year were split approximately as follows: General Medicines 70%, Speci alty Medicines 20% and Vaccines 10%. At 31 December 2022, the total accrual for rebates, discounts, allowances and returns for US Commercial Operations amounted to \u00a35,855 million (2021: \u00a35,044 million). A monthly process is operated to monitor inventory levels at wholesalers for any abnormal movements. This process uses gross sa les volumes, prescription volumes based on third party data sources and information received from key wholesalers. The aim of this is to maintain inventories at a consistent level from year to year based on the pattern of consumption. On this basis, US Commercial Operations inventory levels at wholesalers and in other distribution channels at 31 December 2022 were estimated to amount to approximately four weeks of turnover. This calculation uses third party information, the accuracy of whi ch cannot be totally verified, but is believed to be sufficiently reliable for this purpose. Legal and other disputes In respect of the accounting policy for Legal and other disputes, the following briefly describes the process by which we deter mine the level of provision that is necessary. In accordance with the requirements of IAS 37, 'Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets', we provide for antic ipated settlement costs where an outflow of resources is considered probable and a reliable estimate may be made of the likely outcome of the dispute and legal and other expenses arising from claims against the Group. We may become involved in significant legal proceedings, in respect of which it is not possible to meaningfully assess whether the outcome will result in a probable outflow, or to quantify or reliably estimate the liability, if any, that could result from ul timate resolution of the proceedings. In these cases, appropriate disclosure about such cases would be included in the Annual Report, but no provisi on would be made. This position could change over time and, therefore, there can be no assurance that any losses that result from the outcome of any legal proceedings will not exceed by a material amount the amount of the provisions reported in the Group's financial statements. Like many pharmaceutical companies, we are faced with various complex product liability, anti-trust and patent litigation, as w ell as investigations of our operations conducted by various governmental regulatory agencies. Throughout the year, the General Counse l of the Group, as head of the Group's legal function, and the Senior Vice President and Head of Global Litigation for the Group, who is responsible for all litigation and government investigations, routinely brief the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and theBoard of Directors on the significant litigation pending against the Group and governmental investigations of the Group. 48These meetings, as appropriate, detail the status of significant litigation and government investigations and review matters su ch as the number of claims notified to us, information on potential claims not yet notified, assessment of the validity of claims, progre ss made in settling claims, recent settlement levels and potential reimbursement by insurers. The meetings also include an assessment of whether or not there is sufficient information available for us to be able to make a reliable estimate of the potential outcomes of the disputes. Often, external counsel assisting us with various litigation matters and in vestigations will also assist in the briefing of the Board and senior management. Following these discussions, for those matters where it is possible to make a reliable estimate of the amount of a provision, if any, that may be required, the level of provision for legal and other disputes is reviewed and adjusted as appropriate. These matters are discussed further in \"Note 47 - Legal proceedings\" to the financial sta tements incorporated by reference in Item 18 below. 495.B Liquidity and capital resources The information set forth under the heading \"Note 44 - Financial instruments and related disclosures\" on pages 245 to 261 of the GSK Annual Report 2022 is incorporated herein by reference. The information set forth under the headings \"Cash generation and conversion,\" \"Financial position and resources\" and \"Treasury policies\" in Item 5.A of this annual report on Form 20-F is incorporated herein by reference. The information set forth under the heading \"Note 27 - Cash and cash equivalents\" on page 216 of the GSK Annual Report 2022 is incorporated herein by reference. The Group has, in its opinion, sufficient working capital to meet its present requirements. Liquidity sources in the short-term The information set forth under the heading \"Liquidity risk management\" on page 245 of the GSK Annual Report 2022 is incorporated herein by reference. Liquidity sources in the long-term The information set forth under the heading \"Cash generation and conversion,\" in Item 5.A of this annual report on Form 20-F is incorporated herein by reference. Material Cash Requirements The information set forth under the headings: \"Note 30 - Net debt\" on pages 218 and 219; and \"Note 36 - Commitments\" on page 232 of the GSK Annual Report 2022 is incorporated herein by reference.Loans: At 31 December 2022 the Group had \u00a320.1 billion of borrowings of which \u00a33.8 billion was repayable within one year and \u00a316.3 billion was payable after one year. Interest payable on these loans amounted to \u00a36.3 billion of which \u00a30.6 billion was payable within one year and \u00a35.7 billion was payable after more than one year. Commitments in respect of loans and future interest payable on loans are disclosed before taking into account the effect of derivatives. Intangible assets commitments: At 31 December 2022, the Group had intangible assets commitments of \u00a310.7 billion. Of these, \u00a30.3 billion fall due within one year and \u00a310.4 billion fall due after more than one year. The commitments include milestone payments, which are dependent on successful clinical development or on meeting specified sales targets, and which represent the maximum that would be paid if all milestones, however unlikely, are achieved. The amounts are notrisk-adjusted or discounted. We have entered into a number of research collaborations to develop new compounds with other pharmaceutical companies. The terms of these arrangements can include upfront fees, equity investments, loans and commitments to fund specified levels of research. In addition, we will often agree to make further payments if future 'milestones' are achieved. Assome of these agreements relate to compounds in the early stages of development, the potential obligation to make milestone payments will continue for a number of years if the compounds move successfully through the development process. Generally, the closer the product is to marketing approval, the greater the probability of success. The amountsshown above within intangible assets represent the maximum that would be paid if all milestones were achieved. Finance Lease obligations: At 31 December 2022 the Group had \u00a31.0 billion of finance lease obligation of which \u00a30.2 billion was payable within one year and \u00a30.8 billion was payable after one year. Property, plant and equipment: At 31 December 2022 the Group had property, plant and equipment commitments of \u00a30.7 billion of which \u00a30.6 billion was payable within one year and \u00a30.1 billion was payable after one year. The informationset forth under the heading \"Property, plant and equipment\" within \"Financial position and resources\" in Item 5.A of this annual report on Form 20-F is incorporated herein by reference. Purchases commitments: At 31 December 2022 the Group had \u00a30.2 billion of purchase commitments of which \u00a30.1 billion was payable within one year and \u00a30.1 billion was payable after one year. Future finance charges on leases : At 31 December 2022 the Group had \u00a30.1 billion of future finance charges most of which was payable after one year. Investments : At 31 December 2022 the Group had \u00a30.1 billion of investments commitments most of which was payable after one year. Pensions: In connection with the demerger of Consumer Healthcare, the 31 December 2020 pension scheme valuations identified cash funding or technical provisions deficits in three GSK UK Pension Schemes. Scottish limited partnerships(\"SLPs\") were established to provide a funding mechanism for each of GSK's UK defined benefit pension schemes. TheSLPs together hold shares representing 7.5% of the total issued share capital of Haleon. Each pension scheme, through its SLP interest, is entitled to receive a distribution from that SLP in an amount equal to the net proceeds of sales of Haleon shares, and to receive dividend income on Haleon shares, until it has received anaggregate amount equal to an agreed threshold (\"Proceeds Threshold\"). The Proceeds Thresholds total \u00a31,080 million (as increased by notional interest on the remaining balance from time to time), and payment of this amount would fully fund the cash funding or technical provisions deficits in the three schemes shown by the 31 December 2020 valuations. Once theProceeds Threshold has been reached the GSK-controlled General Partner of each SLP is entitled to sell the remaining Haleon shares held by the SLP and distribute the proceeds to GSK. As at 31 December 2022, \u00a3345 million remains outstanding to the UK Pension Trustees. There was a decrease in the commitments in 2022 as a result of a reduction in outstanding loan commitments. 505.C Research and development, patents and licenses, etc. The information set forth under the headings: \"Research and development\" on pages 15 to 28; \"Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines product development pipeline\" on pages 278 to 281; \"Pharmaceutical products, competition and intellectual property\" on pages 282 and 283; and \"Vaccine products, competition and intellectual property\" on page 284 of the GSK Annual Report 2022 is incorporated herein by reference. 5.D Trend information The information set forth under the heading \"Group financial review 2022\" in Item 5.A of this annual report on Form 20-F is incorporated herein by reference. 5.E Critical Accounting Estimates Not applicable.

Shareholders should not rely on this summary, but should instead refer to the current Articles which are filed with theRegistrar of Companies in the UK and can be viewed on the company's website. The Articles contain the fundamentalprovisions of the company's constitution, and the rules for the internal management and control of the company. Thecompany has no statement of objects in its Articles and accordingly its objects are unrestricted in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. (a) Voting All resolutions put to the vote at general meetings, including electronic general meetings (see paragraph (h)), will be decided by poll. On a poll, every shareholder who is present in person or by proxy or, in the case of an electronic generalmeeting, who participates or is represented by proxy via an electronic platform shall have one vote for every Ordinary Share of which they are the holder. In the case of joint holders of a share, the vote of the senior who tenders a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders, and seniority shallbe determined by the order in which the names stand on the register. Unless the Directors otherwise decide, the right to attend a general meeting and voting rights may not be exercised by a shareholder who has not paid to the company allcalls and other sums then payable by them in respect of their Ordinary Shares. The right to attend a general meeting and voting rights may not be exercised by a shareholder who is subject to an order under Section 794 of the Companies Act 2006 because they have failed to provide the company with information concerning their interests in Ordinary Shares within the prescribed period, as required by Section 793 of the Companies Act 2006. (b) Transfer of Ordinary Shares Any shareholder may transfer their Ordinary Shares which are in certificated form by an instrument of transfer in any usual form or in any other form which the Directors may approve. Such instrument must be properly signed and stamped or certified (or otherwise shown to the satisfaction of the Directors as being exempt from stamp duty) and lodged with thecompany together with the relevant share certificate(s) and such other evidence as the Directors may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer. Any member may transfer title to their uncertificated Ordinary Shares by means of a relevant system, such as CREST.The transferor of a share is deemed to remain the holder until the transferee's name is entered on the register. The Directors may decline to register any transfer of any Ordinary Share which is not fully paid. Registration of a transfer of uncertificated Ordinary Shares may be refused in the circumstances set out in the uncertificated securities rules, and where, in the case of a transfer to joint holders, the number of joint holders to whom theuncertificated Ordinary Share is to be transferred exceeds four. The Articles contain no other restrictions on the transfer of fully paid certificated Ordinary Shares provided: (i) the instrument of transfer is duly stamped or certified or otherwise shown to the satisfaction of the Directors to be exempt from stamp duty and is accompanied by the relevant share certificate and such other evidence of the right to transfer as the Directors may reasonably require; (ii) the transfer, if to joint transferees, is in favour of not more than four transferees; (iii) the instrument of transfer is in respect of only one class of shares; and (iv) the holder of the Ordinary Shares is not subject to an order under Section 794 of the Companies Act 2006. Notice of refusal to register a transfer must be sent to the transferee within two months of the instrument of transfer being lodged. The Directors may decline to register a transfer of Ordinary Shares by a person holding 0.25 per cent. or more ofthe existing Ordinary Shares if such person is subject to an order under Section 794 Companies Act 2006, after failure to provide the company with information concerning interests in those Ordinary Shares required to be provided under Section 793 of the Companies Act 2006, unless the transfer is carried out pursuant to an arm's length sale. Provisions in the Articles will not apply to uncertificated Ordinary Shares to the extent that they are inconsistent with: (i) the holding of Ordinary Shares in uncertificated form; (ii) the transfer of title to Ordinary Shares by means of a system such as CREST; and (iii) any provisions of the relevant regulations. (c) Dividends and distribution of assets on liquidation The profits of the company which are available for distribution and permitted by law to be distributed and which the company may by ordinary resolution from time to time declare, upon the recommendation of the Directors to distribute by way of dividend, in respect of any accounting reference period shall be distributed by way of dividend among holders of Ordinary Shares. If in their opinion the company's financial position justifies such payments, the Directors may, as far as any applicable legislation allows, pay interim dividends on shares of any class of such amounts and in respect of such periods as they think fit. Except in so far as the rights attaching to, or the terms of issue of, any share otherwise provide, all dividends wi ll be declared, apportioned and paid pro rata according to the amounts paid up on the shares during any portion of the periodin respect of which the dividend is paid. As the company has only one class of Ordinary Shares, the holders of such Ordinary Shares will be entitled to participate in any surplus assets on a winding-up in proportion to their shareholdings. 53(d) Variation of rights and changes in capital Subject to the provisions of any statute (including any orders, regulations or other subordinate legislation made under it) from time to time in force concerning companies in so far as it applies to the company (the \"Companies Acts\"), the rightsattached to any class of shares may be varied with the written consent of the holders of three-quarters in nominal value ofthe issued shares of that class (excluding any shares of that class held as treasury shares) or with the sanction of a specialresolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of shares of that class. At every such separate meeting, the provisions of the Articles relating to general meetings shall apply, except the necessary quorum shall be at least two persons entitled to vote and holding or representing as proxy at least one-third in nominal value of the issued shares of therelevant class (excluding any shares of that class held as treasury shares) (but provided that at any adjourned meeting one holder of shares of the relevant class present in person or by proxy shall be a quorum). If new shares are created or issued which rank equally with any other existing shares, or if the company purchases or redeems any of its own shares, the rights of existing shares will not be regarded as changed or abrogated unless the termsof the existing shares expressly say otherwise. (e) Unclaimed dividends All dividends or other sums payable on or in respect of any Ordinary Shares which remain unclaimed may be invested or otherwise made use of by the Directors for the benefit of the company until claimed. Unless the Directors decide otherwise, any dividend or other sums payable on or in respect of any Ordinary Shares unclaimed after a period of six years from thedate when declared or became due for payment will be forfeited and revert to the company. The company may stop sending dividend cheques or warrants by post, or employ such other means of payment in respect of any Ordinary Shares, if at least two consecutive payments have remained uncashed or are returned undelivered or if one payment has remaineduncashed or is returned undelivered and the company cannot establish a new address for the holder after makingreasonable enquiries; however, in either case, the company must resume sending cheques or warrants or employ suchother means of payment if the holder or any person entitled to the Ordinary Shares by transmission requests theresumption in writing. (f) Untraced shareholders The company may sell any certificated Ordinary Shares in the company after using reasonable efforts to trace the holder of, or person entitled by transmission to, the Ordinary Shares and sending a notice to the registered address or last knownaddress of the holder or other person entitled in accordance with the requirements of the Articles and waiting for three months if the Ordinary Shares have been in issue for at least ten years and during that period at least three dividends have become payable on them and have not been claimed or satisfied and, so far as any Director is aware, the company has notreceived any communication from the holder of the Ordinary Shares or any person entitled to them by transmission. Upon any such sale, the company will become indebted to the former holder of the Ordinary Shares or the person entitled to them by transmission for an amount equal to the net proceeds of sale unless and until forfeited. If no valid claim for themoney has been received by the company during a period of two years from the date on which the relevant shares were sold by the company, the money will be forfeited and will belong to the company. (g) Limitations on rights of non-resident or foreign shareholders There are no limitations imposed by the Articles on the rights of non-resident or foreign shareholders except that there is no requirement for the company to serve notices on shareholders outside the United Kingdom and the United States, if no postal address in the United States or United Kingdom has been provided to the company. The company may choose not to serve, send or supply any notice to a particular shareholder where it considers this necessary or appropriate to deal withlegal, regulatory or practical problems in, or under the laws of, any territory. (h) General meetings of shareholders The Articles rely on the Companies Act 2006 provisions dealing with the calling of general meeting. The company is required by the Companies Act 2006 to hold an annual general meeting each year. General meetings of shareholders may be called as necessary by the Directors and must be called promptly upon receipt of a requisition from shareholders. Underthe Companies Act 2006, an annual general meeting must be called by notice of at least 21 clear days. A general meetingother than an annual general meeting may be called on not less than 14 clear days' notice provided a special resolutionreducing the notice period to 14 clear days has been passed at the immediately preceding annual general meeting or ageneral meeting held since that annual general meeting.

A Director seekingauthorisation in respect of a Conflict shall declare to the other Directors the nature and extent of their Conflict as soon as is reasonably practicable and shall provide the other Directors with such details of the matter as are necessary to decidehow to address the Conflict. The board may resolve to authorise the relevant Director in relation to any matter the subjectof a Conflict, save that the relevant Director and any other Director with a similar interest shall not count towards thequorum nor vote on any resolution giving such authority, and, if the other Directors so decide, shall be excluded from any meeting of the Directors while the Conflict is under consideration.

In particular, the Depositary, under the terms of the Deposit Agreement, shall charge (i) a fee of $5.00 per 100 American Depositary Shares (or portion thereof) for the issuance, delivery, reduction, cancellation or surrender (as the case may be) of AmericanDepositary Shares (\"ADSs\"), (ii) a fee of U.S.$0.05 or less per ADS held (A) upon which any cash distribution is made pursuant to the Deposit Agreement or (B) in the case of an elective cash/stock dividend, upon which a cash distribution or an issuance of additional ADSs is made as a result of such elective dividend, (iii) a fee for the distribution or sale of securiti es, such fee being in an amount equal to the fee for the execution and delivery of ADSs referred to above which would have been charged as a result of the deposit of such securities but which securities or the net cash proceeds from the sale thereof are instead distributed by the Depositary to ADR holders entitled thereto, (iv) an aggregate fee of U.S.$0.05 or less per ADS per calendar year (or portion thereof) for services performed by the Depositary in administering the ADRs (which fee may be charged on a periodic basis during each calendar year and shall be assessed against ADR holders as of the record date orrecord dates set by the Depositary during each calendar year and shall be payable at the sole discretion of the Depositary bybilling such Holders or by deducting such charge from one or more cash dividends or other cash distributions), and (v) a feefor the reimbursement of such fees, charges and expenses as are incurred by the Depositary and/or any of its agents(including, without limitation, the agent or agents of the Depositary (the \"Custodian\") and expenses incurred on behalf of ADR holders in connection with compliance with foreign exchange control regulations or any law or regulation relating to foreign investment) in connection with the servicing of the ordinary shares or other Deposited Securities, the sale of securities(including, without limitation, Deposited Securities), the delivery of Deposited Securities or otherwise in connection with the Depositary's or its Custodian's compliance with applicable law, rule or regulation (which fees and charges shall be assessed on a proportionate basis against ADR holders as of the record date or dates set by the Depositary and shall be payable at thesole discretion of the Depositary by billing such ADR holders or by deducting such charge from one or more cash dividends or other cash distributions). GSK will pay other charges and out of pocket expenses of the Depositary and any agent of the Depositary (except the Custodian) as specified in written agreements from time to time between GSK and the Depositary, except (i) stock transfer orother taxes and other governmental charges (which are payable by ADR holders or persons depositing ordinary shares), (ii) SWIFT, cable, telex and facsimile transmission and delivery charges incurred at the request of persons depositing, or ADR holders delivering ordinary shares, ADRs or Deposited Securities (which are payable by such persons or ADR holders), (iii)transfer or registration fees for the registration or transfer of Deposited Securities on any applicable register in connection with the deposit or withdrawal of Deposited Securities (which are payable by persons depositing ordinary shares or ADR holders withdrawing Deposited Securities) and (iv) in connection with the conversion of foreign currency into U.S. dollars, theDepositary shall deduct out of such foreign currency the fees, expenses and other charges charged by it and/or its agent (which may be a division, branch or affiliate) so appointed in connection with such conversion. The Depositary and/or its agentmay act as principal for such conversion of foreign currency. Such charges may at any time and from time to time be changedby agreement between GSK and the Depositary. Direct and indirect payments by the Depositary The Depositary anticipates reimbursing GSK for certain expenses incurred by GSK that are related to the establishment and maintenance of the ADR program upon such terms and conditions as GSK and the Depositary may agree from time to time. The Depositary may make available to GSK a set amount or a portion of the Depositary fees charged in respect of the ADRprogram or otherwise upon such terms and conditions as GSK and the Depositary may agree from time to time. In 2022 the Depositary made payments of approximately $21.20 million. Under certain circumstances, including removal of the Depositary or termination of the ADR program by GSK, GSK is required to repay certain amounts paid to GSK and to compensate the Depositary for payments made or services provided on behalfof GSK. PART II Item 13. Defaults, Dividend Arrearages and Delinquencies Not applicable. Item 14. Material Modifications to the Rights of Security Holders and Use of Proceeds Not applicable. Item 15. Controls and Procedures The information set forth under the heading \"Internal control framework\" on page 125 to 126 of the GSK Annual Report 2022 is incorporated herein by reference. US law and regulation A number of provisions of US law and regulation apply to the company because our shares are quoted on the NYSE in the form of American Depositary Shares. NYSE rules In general, the NYSE rules permit the company to follow UK corporate governance practices instead of those applied in the USA, provided that we explain any significant variations. This explanation is contained in Item 16.G of this Form 20-F. NYSE rules that came into effect in 2005 require us to file annual and interim written affirmations concerning the Audit & RiskCommittee and our statement on significant differences in corporate governance. 58Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 Following a number of corporate and accounting scandals in the USA, Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Sarbanes-Oxley is a wide ranging piece of legislation concerned largely with financial reporting and corporate governance. As recommended by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), the company has established a Disclosure Committee. The Committee reports to the CEO, the CFO and to the Audit & Risk Committee. It is chaired by the Company Secretary and the members consist of senior managers from finance, legal, corporate communications and investor relations. External legal counsel, the external auditors and internal experts are invited to attend its meetings periodically. It has responsibility for considering the materiality of information and, on a timely basis, determining the disclosure of that information. It has responsibility for the timely filing of reports with the SEC and the formal review of the GSK Annual Report 2022 and Form 20-F. In 2022 the Committee met 28 times. Sarbanes-Oxley requires that this annual report on Form 20-F contain a statement as to whether a member of our Audit & Risk Committee (\"ARC\") is an audit committee financial expert as defined by Sarbanes-Oxley. For a summary regarding the Board's judgment on this matter, please refer to Item 16.A below and to page 98 in the biography for \"Charles Bancroft\" and the paragraph under \"Financial Experience\" under \"FRC UK Corporate Governance Code\" within \"Corporate governancearchitecture\" on page 109 of the GSK Annual Report 2022. Additional disclosure requirements arise under section 302 and section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley in respect of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Section 302: Corporate responsibility for financial reports Sarbanes-Oxley also introduced a requirement for the CEO and the CFO to complete formal certifications, confirming that: they have each reviewed the GSK Annual Report 2022 and Form 20-F; based on their knowledge, the GSK Annual Report 2022 and Form 20-F contain no material misstatements or omissions; based on their knowledge, the financial statements and other financial information fairly present, in all material respects, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as of the dates, and for the periods, presented in the GSKAnnual Report 2022 and Form 20-F; they are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures that ensure that material information is made known to them, and have evaluated the effectiveness of these controls and procedures as at theyear-end, the results of such evaluation being contained in the GSK Annual Report 2022 and Form 20-F; they are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting that provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; they have disclosed in the GSK Annual Report 2022 and Form 20-F any changes in internal controls over financial reporting during the period covered by the GSK Annual Report 2022 and Form 20-F that have materially affected, or arereasonably likely to affect materially, the company's internal control over financial reporting; and they have disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the external auditors and the ARC, all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to affect adversely the company's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information, and any fraud (regardless of materiality) involving persons that have asignificant role in the company's internal control over financial reporting. The Group has carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including the CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Group's disclosure controls and procedures as at 31 December 2022. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Based on the Group's evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that, as at December 31, 2022, the disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports thatthe Group files and submits under the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed,summarized and reported as and when required and that it is accumulated and communicated to management, including theCEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. The CEO and CFO completed these certifications on March 10, 2023. Section 404: Management's annual report on internal control over financial reporting. In accordance with the requirements of section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley, the following report is provided by management in respect of the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934): management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Group. Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability offinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with IFRS; management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013 Framework) issued by the Committee of SponsoringOrganizations of the Treadway Commission; 59 management has assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as at 31 December 2022 and has concluded that such internal control over financial reporting was effective. In addition, there have been no changes in the Group's internal control over financial reporting during 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to affect materially, the Group's internal control over financial reporting; and Deloitte LLP, which has audited the consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended December 31, 2022, has also assessed the effectiveness of the Group's internal control over financial reporting under AuditingStandard No. 2201 of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Their audit report can be found below. 60REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of GSK plc Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of GSK plc and subsidiaries (the \"Group\") as at 31 December 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control \u2014 Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Group maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over fin ancial reporting as at 31 December 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control \u2014 Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) , the consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2022, of the Group and our report dated 10 March 202 3, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Group's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessmen t of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying \" Section 404: Management's annual report on internal control over financial reporting \" included in Item 15 of the Form 20-F. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Group's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Group in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regul ations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audi t to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material re spects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weak ness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing su ch other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opini on. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the relia bility of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted acc ounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to th e maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the com pany; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in a ccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accorda nce with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the fin ancial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, p rojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of change s in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Deloitte LLP London, United Kingdom 10 March 2023 61Item 16.

Item 16.G Corporate Governance Comparison of New York Stock Exchange Corporate Governance Standards and GSK plc's corporate governance practice. The application of the New York Stock Exchange's (\"NYSE\") corporate governance standards is restricted for foreigncompanies, recognizing that they have to comply with domestic requirements. As a foreign private issuer, GSK plc (\"GSK\"or the \"Company\") must comply with the following NYSE standards: 1. the Company must satisfy the audit committee requirements of Rule 10A-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"); 2. the Chief Executive Officer (the \"CEO\") must promptly notify the NYSE in writing after any executive officer of the Company becomes aware of any non-compliance with any applicable provisions of the NYSE's corporate governancestandards; 3. the Company must submit an annual affirmation to the NYSE affirming GSK's compliance with applicable NYSE corporate governance standards, and submit interim affirmations to the NYSE notifying it of specified changes to theaudit committee or a change to the status of the Company as a foreign private issuer; and 4. the Company must provide a brief description of any significant differences between its corporate governance practices and those followed by US companies under the NYSE listing standards. As a Company listed on the London Stock Exchange, GSK is required to comply with the UK Listing Authority's Listing Rules (the \"Listing Rules\") and to report non-compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code (the \"UK Code\"). 62The table below discloses differences between GSK's current domestic corporate governance practices, which are based on the UK Code, and the NYSE corporate governance standards, applicable to US companies. NYSE Corporate Governance Standards Description of differences between GSK's governance practice and the NYSE Corporate Governance Standards Director Independence (303A.01 of the NYSE Manual) 1. Listed companies must have a majority of independent directors (as defined in Section 303A.02 of the NYSE Manual (see below). GSK complies with the equivalent domestic requirements contained in the UK Corporate Governance Code (the \"UK Code\"), the latest version of which was issued in July 2018. The UK Code provides that the board of directors of GSK (the\"Board\") and its committees should have a combination of skills, experience and knowledge. Consideration should be given to thelength of the service of the Board and membership should be regularly refreshed (Principle K). The Board should include an appropriate combination of Executive and Non-ExecutiveDirectors and, in particular, \"independent\" Non-Executive Directors (for the purpose of the UK Code) such that no one individual or small group of individuals can dominate the Board'sdecision-making. There should be a clear division of responsibilities between the leadership of the Board and the executive leadership of GSK's business (Principle G). At least halfthe Board, excluding the Chair, should comprise Non-ExecutiveDirectors determined by the Board to be independent (Provision11). The roles of Chair and Chief Executive should not beexercised by the same individual. If, exceptionally, this isproposed by the Board, major shareholders should be consultedahead of appointment (Provision 9). The current Chair of the Board, Sir Jonathan Symonds, wasconsidered independent on appointment (Provision 9). The Board considers that Elizabeth McKee Anderson, CharlesBancroft, Dr Anne Beal, Dr Hal Dietz, Dr Jesse Goodman, UrsRohner and Dr Vishal Sikka are independent for the purpose ofthe UK Code. A majority of the Board members are independent Non-ExecutiveDirectors and, in accordance with the requirements of the UK Code, the Board has appointed one of the independent Non-Executive Directors as Senior Independent Director toprovide a sounding board for the Chair and act as an intermediary for other Directors and shareholders where necessary (Provision 12). In January 2012 the Board adopted a formal written rolespecification for the Senior Independent Director. 63 NYSE Independence Tests (303A.02 of the NYSE Manual) 2. In order to tighten the definition of \"independent director\" for purposes of these standards: (a)(i) No director qualifies as \"independent\" unless the board of directors affirmatively determines that thedirector has no material relationship with the listed company (either directly or as a partner, shareholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the company). (ii)In addition, in affirmatively determining the independence of any director who will serve on the compensation committee of the listed company's board of directors, theboard of directors must consider all factors specifically relevant to determining whether a director has a relationship to the listed company which is material tothat director's ability to be independent from management in connection with the duties of a compensation committee member, including, but notlimited to: (A) the source of compensation of such director, including anyconsulting, advisory or other compensatory fee paid by the listedcompany to such director; and (B) whether such director is affiliated with the listed company, asubsidiary of the listed company or an affiliate of a subsidiary ofthe listed company. (b)In addition, a director is not independent if: (i)The director is, or has been within the last three years, an employee of the listed company, or an immediate family member is, or has been within the last three years, an executive officer, of the listedcompany. (ii)The director has received, or has an immediate family member who has received, during any twelve- month period within the last three years, more than $120,000 in direct compensation from the listedcompany, other than director and committee fees and pension or other forms of deferred compensation for prior service (provided such compensation is not contingent in any way on continued service). (iii)(A) The director is a current partner or employee of a firm that is the listed company's internal or externalauditor; (B) the director has an immediate family member who is a current partner of such a firm; (C) the director has an immediate family memberwho is a current employee of such a firm and personally works on the listed company's audit; or (D) the director or an immediate family member waswithin the last three years a partner or employee of such a firm and personally worked on the listed company's audit within that time. (iv)The director or an immediate family member is, or has been within the last three years, employed asan executive officer of another company where anyof the listed company's present executive officers atthe same time serves or served on that company's compensation committee. (v)The director is a current employee, or an immediate family member is a current executive officer, of acompany that has made payments to, or receivedpayments from, the listed company for property orservices in an amount which, in any of the last threefiscal years, exceeds the greater of $1 million, or 2%of such other company's consolidated gross revenues. (For the purposes of these standards \"executive officer\" is definedto have the meaning specified for the term \"officer\" in Rule16a-1(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the \"Exchange Act\"). GSK complies with the corresponding domestic requirements contained in the UK Code, which sets out the principles for GSKto determine whether a director is independent. The Board is required to identify each Non-Executive Director itconsiders to be independent. Circumstances which are likely to impair, or could appear to impair a non-executive director's independence include, but are not limited to, whether a director: (a)is or has been an employee of GSK within the last five years; (b)has, or has had within the last three years, a material business relationship with GSK either directly or as a partner, shareholder, director or senior employee of a body that has such a relationship with GSK; (c)has received or receives additional remuneration from GSK apart from a director's fee, participates in GSK'sshare option or a performance-related pay scheme, or isa member of GSK's pension scheme; (d)has close family ties with any of GSK's advisers, directors or senior employees; (e)holds cross-directorships or has significant links with other directors through involvement in other companiesor bodies; (f)represents a significant shareholder; or (g)has served on the Board for more than nine years from the date of their first appointment. Where any of these or other relevant circumstances apply, andthe Board nonetheless considers that the non-executive director isindependent, a clear explanation should be provided (Provision10). The Board considers all its Non-Executive Directors to beindependent in character and judgment and has concluded that all its Non-Executive Directors are independent within the meaning of the UK Code. The Chair satisfied the independence criteria on appointment inaccordance with the UK Code (Provision 9). The Chair should notremain in post beyond nine years from the date of their first appointment to the Board. To facilitate effective succession planning and the development of a diverse board, this period can be extended for a limited time (Provision 19). GSK complied with the UK Code requirement, and its Articles ofAssociation, that all Directors should be subject to annual election or re-election by shareholders (Provision 18) at its Annual GeneralMeeting in 2022 and intends to comply with this requirement at its 2023 Annual General Meeting. The UK Code also provides that the Board should undertake aformal and rigorous annual evaluation of its own performance and that of its committees, the Chair and individual Directors (PrincipleL and Provision 21). Annual evaluation of the Board shouldconsider the Board's composition, diversity and how effectivelymembers work together to achieve objectives. Individualevaluation should demonstrate whether each director continues tocontribute effectively (Principle L). GSK has complied with thisrequirement. In addition, the annual evaluation of the Boardshould be externally facilitated at least every three years and astatement should be made as to whether an external facilitatorhas any other connection with GSK or individual directors and the external facilitator should be identified in the Annual Report(Provision 21). Internally facilitated evaluations were conducted in 2015, 2016, 2018 and 2021. GSK conducted an externally facilitated evaluation in 2014, 2017, 2019, 2020 and 2022. The FRC's Guidance on Board Effectiveness (\"Guidance\") provides that all Directors should receive an induction on joiningthe Board and should regularly update and refresh their skills and knowledge. The Chair should ensure that new Directors receive a full, formal and tailored induction on joining the Board (Guidance,para 61, 75-76 & 81). The Chair should act on the results of the annual evaluation by recognising the strengths and addressing any weaknesses of the Board. Each Director should engage withthis process and take appropriate action when development needs have been identified (Provision 22). 64 Executive Sessions (303A.03 of the NYSE Manual) Meetings 3. To empower non-management directors to serve as a more effective check on management, the non-management directorsof each listed company must meet at regularly scheduled executive sessions without management. GSK complies with the equivalent domestic requirements set out in the UK Code, which requires the Chair of GSK to hold meetingswith the Non-Executive Directors without executives present (Provision 13). The Non-Executive Directors, led by the Senior Independent Director, also meet at least annually without theChair present to appraise the Chair's performance, and on other occasions as necessary (Provision 12). The UK Code provides that the Chair should promote a culture of openness and debate by facilitating the effective contribution of allNon-Executive Directors in particular, and constructive boardrelations between Executive and Non-Executive Directors(Principle F). In addition, the Chair should seek regularengagement with major shareholders in order to understand their views on governance and performance against the strategy. The Chair is responsible for ensuring that the Board as a whole has aclear understanding of the view of shareholders and stakeholders (Principle D and Provision 3). The Board should also understand the views of GSK's other key stakeholders and keep engagementmechanisms under review so that they remain effective (Provision 5). 65 Nominating / Corporate Governance Committee (303A.04 of the NYSE Manual) Nominations Committee 4. (a) Listed companies must have a nominating/corporate governance committee composed entirely of independent directors. (b) The nominating/corporate governance committee must have awritten charter that addresses: (i)the committee's purpose and responsibilities - which, at minimum, must be to: identify individuals qualified to becomeboard members, consistent with criteria approved by theboard, and to select, or to recommend that the board select,the director nominees for the next annual meeting ofshareholders; develop and recommend to the board a set of corporate governance guidelines applicable to the corporation; and oversee the evaluation of the board andmanagement; and (ii) an annual performance evaluation of the committee. GSK complies with the corresponding domestic requirements set out in the UK Code, which requires GSK to have a Nominations Committee that is comprised of a majority of independent Non-Executive Directors (Provision 17). In practice, GSK's currentNominations & Corporate Governance Committee is comprised entirely of independent directors within the meaning of the UK Code. The Chair of the Board should not chair the committeewhen it is dealing with the appointment of their successor (Provision 17). GSK's Nominations & Corporate Governance Committee has written terms of reference in accordance with the UK Code. Theterms of reference are available on GSK's website and explain the Nominations & Corporate Governance Committee's role and theauthority delegated to it by the Board (Guidance, para 63). The Nominations & Corporate Governance Committee reviews the structure, size, diversity (including diversity of gender, social and ethnic backgrounds, and cognitive and personal strengths), andcomposition of the Board (evaluating the balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge on the Board), leads the process for the appointment of members to the Board and theGSK Leadership Team (the \"GLT\"), and makes recommendations to the Board as appropriate. The Nominations & Corporate Governance Committee also monitors the planning of successionfor the Board and senior management (Provision 17). 66 The terms and conditions of appointment of the Chair and Non-Executive Directors are available for inspection (Guidance, para 96). The UK Code requires that GSK's Annual Report describes thework of the Nominations Committee in discharging its duties, including the process it has used in relation to appointments, its approach to succession planning and how both supportdeveloping a diverse pipeline (Provision 23). Open advertisingand/or an external search consultancy should generally be usedfor the appointment of a chair or a non-executive director. If anexternal search consultancy is engaged it should be identified in the Annual Report and a statement should be made as to whether it has any other connection with GSK or individual directors(Provision 20). This section should also include a description of how the Board evaluation has been conducted, the Board's policy on diversity and inclusion together with its objectives and linkageto GSK's strategy, how it has been implemented and progress on achieving the objectives, and the gender balance of those in the senior management and their direct reports (Provision 23). GSKhas complied with this requirement under the UK Code. As described above, there is an annual Board evaluation exercise, which also includes evaluation of the Board's committees and individual Directors (Principle L). The Board is responsible for regularly reviewing its corporategovernance standards and practices. The Company Secretaryoversees corporate governance matters for the Group. The Company Secretary is responsible for advising the Board on all corporate governance matters (Provision 16). Domesticrequirements do not mandate GSK to establish a distinct corporate governance committee. 67 Compensation Committee (303A.05 of the NYSE Manual) Remuneration Committee 5. (a) Listed companies must have a compensation committee composed entirely of independent directors. Compensationcommittee members must satisfy the additional independence requirements specific to compensation committee membership set forth in Section 2(a)(ii) in the Section titled \"NYSE Independence Tests\" above. GSK complies with the equivalent domestic requirements set out in the UK Code, which requires GSK to have a RemunerationCommittee comprising at least three independent Non-Executive Directors (Provision 32). In practice, GSK's current Remuneration Committee is comprised entirely of independent directors within the meaning of the UK Code. (b) The compensation committee must have a written charter that addresses: (i) the committee's purpose and responsibilities - which, at aminimum, must be to have direct responsibility to: (A)review and approve corporate goals and objectives relevant to CEO compensation, evaluate the CEO's performance in light of those goals and objectives, and, either as acommittee or together with the other independent directors(as directed by the board), determine and approve the CEO'scompensation level based on this evaluation; (B)make recommendations to the board with respect to non-CEO executive officer compensation, and incentive-compensation and equity-based plans that are subject to board approval; and (C)prepare the disclosure required by Item 407(e)(5) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act; (ii) an annual performance evaluation of the compensation committee. (iii) The rights and responsibilities of the compensation committeeset forth in Section 303A.05(c). (c)(i) The compensation committee may, in its sole discretion,retain or obtain the advice of a compensation consultant, independent legal counsel or other adviser. (ii) The compensation committee shall be directly responsible forthe appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of any compensation consultant, independent legal counsel or otheradviser retained by the compensation committee.

GSK's Remuneration Committee has written terms of reference in accordance with the UK Code, which explain the Remuneration Committee's role and the authority delegated to it by the Board and are available on GSK's website (Guidance, para 63). TheRemuneration Committee determines the terms of service and remuneration of the Executive Directors and members of the GLT and, with the assistance of external independent advisers, itevaluates and makes recommendations to the Board on overall executive remuneration policy (the Chair and the CEO are responsible for evaluating and making recommendations to theBoard on the remuneration of Non-Executive Directors within the terms of the approved remuneration policy). It should review workforce remuneration and related policies and the alignment ofincentives and rewards with culture, taking these into accountwhen setting the policy for executive director remuneration(Provision 33). Where remuneration consultants are appointed,they should be identified in the Annual Report and a statementshould be made as to whether they have any other connectionwith GSK or individual directors (Provision 35). The UK Code provides that the Remuneration Committee: (a)should take care to recognise and manage conflicts of interest when receiving views from Executive Directorsor senior management, or consulting the Chief Executiveabout its proposals (Provision 35 & Guidance, para 129)and should have delegated responsibility for setting remuneration for all Executive Directors and the Chair (Provision 33); (b)should carefully consider the pension consequences and associated costs of basic salary increases and any otherchanges in pensionable remuneration, or contribution rates, particularly for Directors close to retirement (Provision 38); 68 (iv) The compensation committee may select a compensation consultant, legal counsel or other adviser to the compensation committee only after taking into consideration, all factors relevantto that person's independence from management, including the following: (A)The provision of other services to the listed company by the person that employs the compensation consultant,legal counsel or other adviser; (B)The amount of fees received from the listed company by the person that employs the compensation consultant, legal counsel or other adviser, as a percentage of the total revenue of the person that employs thecompensation consultant, legal counsel or other adviser; (C)The policies and procedures of the person that employs the compensation consultant, legal counsel or other adviser that are designed to prevent conflicts of interest; (c)should ensure that compensation commitments in Directors' terms of appointment do not reward poor performance (Provision 39). Remuneration schemesshould promote long-term shareholdings by Executive Directors that support alignment with long-term shareholder interests. A formal policy should bedeveloped for post-employment shareholding requirements encompassing both unvested and vested shares (Provision 36). Remuneration schemes and policies should enable the use of discretion to override formulaic outcomes and include provisions that wouldenable GSK to recover and/or withhold sums or share awards specifying the circumstances in which it would beappropriate to do so (Provision 37); and (d)when determining Executive Director remuneration policy and practices, should address the following:(i) remuneration arrangements are transparent and promote 69 (D)Any business or personal relationship of the compensation consultant, legal counsel or other adviser with a member of the compensation committee; (E)Any stock of the listed company owned by the compensation consultant, legal counsel or other adviser; and (F)Any business or personal relationship of the compensation consultant, legal counsel, other adviser or the personemploying the adviser with an executive officer of the listed company. effective engagement with shareholders and the workforce; (ii) the operation and rationale of remuneration structures are easy to understand; (iii) remuneration arrangements identify and mitigate reputational and otherrisks from excessive rewards and behavioural risks that can arise from target-based incentive plans; (iv) the range of possible values of rewards to individual Directors andany other limits or discretions are identified and explained at the time of approving the policy; (v) the link between individual awards, the delivery of strategy and the long-term performance of GSK should be clear; and (vi) incentive schemes should drive behaviours consistent with company purpose, values and strategy (Provision 40). The UK Code requires that remuneration of Non-ExecutiveDirectors should not include share options or other performance- related elements, but should reflect the time commitment andresponsibilities of the role (Provision 34). The UK Code requires that notice or contract periods should beone year or less (Provision 39). As described above, there is an annual Board evaluation exercise, which also includes evaluation of the Board's committees (Principle L). 70 Audit Committee (303A.06 and 303A.07 of the NYSE Manual) Audit & Risk Committee 6. Listed companies must have an audit committee that satisfies the requirements of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act. GSK complies with equivalent domestic requirements set out in the UK Code, which require that GSK has an Audit & RiskCommittee that is comprised of at least three independent Non-Executive Directors (Provision 24). GSK considers all members of the Audit & Risk Committee to be independent. The Board has also satisfied itself, in line with the UK Code, that atleast one member of the Audit & Risk Committee has recent and relevant financial experience and that the Audit & Risk Committee as a whole has competence relevant to the sector in which GSKoperates (Provision 24). Under the UK Code, the main roles and responsibilities of the Audit & Risk Committee include: (a)monitoring the integrity of the financial statements of GSK and any formal announcements relating to GSK's financial performance, reviewing significant financialreporting judgments contained in them (Provision 25); (b)providing advice (where requested by the Board) on whether the Annual Report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assessGSK's position and performance, business model andstrategy (Provision 25); (c)reviewing GSK's internal financial controls and internal control and risk management systems (Provision 25); (d)monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of GSK's internal audit function (Provision 25); (e)conducting the tender process and making recommendations to the Board regarding theappointment, re-appointment and removal of the externalauditor and approving the remuneration and terms ofengagement of the external auditor (Provision 25); (f)reviewing and monitoring the external auditor's independence and objectivity and the effectiveness of the audit process, taking into consideration relevant UK professional and regulatory requirements (Provision 25); 71 (g)developing and implementing policy on the engagement of external auditors to supply non-audit services, ensuring there is prior approval of non-audit services, considering the impact this may have on independence, taking intoaccount the relevant regulations and ethical guidance regarding the provision of non-audit services by the external audit firm, and to report to the Board on anyimprovement or action required (Provision 25); and (h)reporting to the Board on how it has discharged its responsibilities (Provision 25). The Audit & Risk Committee is also the means by which the Boardreviews arrangements by which the staff of GSK may, in confidence, raise concerns about possible improprieties in mattersof financial reporting or other matters (Provision 6). GSK's Audit & Risk Committee meets the requirements of Rule10A-3 in that: each member of the Audit & Risk Committee is deemed to be \"independent\" in accordance with the Exchange Actand applicable NYSE and UK requirements; the Audit & Risk Committee, amongst other things, is responsible for recommending the appointment,compensation, maintenance of independence and oversight of the work of any registered public accounting firm engaged for the purpose of preparing or issuing anaudit report or performing other audit, review or attest services for GSK, and each such accounting firm must report directly to the Audit & Risk Committee; the Audit & Risk Committee has established a procedure for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters, and for the confidential, anonymoussubmission by employees of concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters; the Audit & Risk Committee has the authority to engage independent counsel and other advisors as it determines necessary to carry out its duties; and GSK must provide appropriate funding for the Audit & Risk Committee.

Please see section 6 above for a description of the main role andresponsibilities of the Audit & Risk Committee. In accordance with the UK Code (Provision 25), the Audit & Risk Committee monitors and reviews the effectiveness of GSK's internal audit function. 74 Shareholder Approval of Equity Compensation Plans (303A.08 of the NYSE Manual) 8. Shareholders must be given the opportunity to vote on all equity- compensation plans and material revisions thereto, except for employment inducement awards, certain grants, plans and amendments in the context of mergers and acquisitions, and certain specific types of plans. However, these exempt grants, plans and amendments may be made only with the approval ofthe listed company's independent compensation committee or theapproval of a majority of the listed company's independentdirectors. Companies must also notify the Exchange in writingwhen they use one of these exemptions. GSK complies with corresponding domestic requirements in the Listing Rules, which mandate that GSK must seek shareholder approval for employee share schemes and significant changes to existing schemes, save in circumstances permitted by the Listing Rules (Listing Rule 9.4).

Item 16.I Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections. Not applicable. PART III Item 17 Financial Statements Not applicable. Item 18 Financial Statements The information set forth under the headings: \"Consolidated income statement\" on page 182; \"Consolidated 182; \"Consolidated balance sheet\" on page 183; statement of in equity\" on page 184; \"Consolidated cash flow statement\" on page 185; and \"Notes to the financial statements\" on pages 186 to 267 of the GSK Annual Report 2022 is incorporated herein by reference. 76REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of GSK plcOpinion on the Financial StatementsWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of GSK plc and subsidiaries (the \"Group\") as at 31 December 2022 a nd 2021, the related consolidated income statements, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity, and cash flow statements, for each of the three years in the period ended 31 December 2022, and the related notes, included in Exhibit 15.2 o n pages 182 to 267 (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, i n all material respects, the financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash f lows for each of the three years in the period ended 31 December 2022, in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) , the Group's internal control over financial reporting as at 31 December 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control \u2014 Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated 10 March 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Group's internal control over financial reporting. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Group's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Group's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be inde pendent with respect to the Group in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the S ecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the aud it to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or f raud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence reg arding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our a udits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements tha t were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are mate rial to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of cr itical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating t he critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 77Valuation of the ViiV Healthcare Shionogi contingent consideration liability Accounts impacted: Contingent consideration liabilities and Other operating expenseRefer to Notes 29, 33 and 44 to the financial statementsCritical Audit Matter DescriptionThe Group has completed a number of significant transactions which resulted in the recognition of material contingent considera tion liabilities, which are a key source of estimation uncertainty. The most significant of these liabilities was the ViiV Healthcar e Shionogi Contingent Consideration Liability (ViiV CCL). The Group completed the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in the Shionogi-ViiV Healthcare joint venture in 2012. Upon completion, the Group recognised a contingent consideration liability for the fair value of the expected future payments to be made to Shionogi. As at 31 December 2022 the liability was valued at \u00a35,890 million. We identified the ViiV CCL as a critical audit matter because of the significant estimates and assumptions relating to the sale s forecasts used in valuing the ViiV CCL and the sensitivity of the valuation to these inputs. The most significant of these relate to sale s forecasts in the United States (US) on certain products in the treatment portfolio. Such forecasts are based on an assessment of the expecte d launch dates, the ability to shift market practice and prescriber behaviour towards long-acting injectable treatments and 2-drug regim ens, the impact of healthcare reform and subsequent sales volumes and pricing. There is incremental challenge in forecasting sales assoc iated with recently launched products due to the lack of historical actual data. The forecasts also required significant audit effort to perform appropriate audit procedures to challenge and evaluate the reasonableness of those forecasts. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit We performed the following audit procedures, amongst others, related to the sales forecasts: Obtained the Group's assessment of the key inputs and assumptions used in the forecasts and challenged the reasonableness of these, including through enquiries of key individuals from the senior leadership team, commercial strategy team and key personnel involved in the budgeting and forecasting process, and inspection of supporting evidence; Challenged the US volume assumptions made by the Group to estimate sales forecasts. This involved benchmarking forecast market share data against external data, such as total prescription volumes and new patient prescription volumes, in order toassess for any sources of contradictory evidence; Challenged the reasonableness of US pricing assumptions by the Group, by comparing the forecasted Returns and Rebates rate by product against the current rate, and assessing the forecasted Returns and Rebates against comparable products considering expected changes in payer policy and healthcare reform implications; Considered the results of clinical studies undertaken in the year by the Group and key competitors in order to assess whether these are corroborative or contradictory to assumptions used in the product portfolio sales forecasts in the US; Benchmarked the Group's sales forecasts against those included in reports from nine analysts and considered sales forecasts on both a total ViiV basis and an individual product basis, assessing against identified contradictory data; and Tested the controls over the key inputs and assumptions used in the valuation of the contingent consideration liability, including review controls over the sales forecasts of the treatment product portfolio used to value the ViiV CCL. 78Valuation of US Returns and Rebates (RAR) accruals Accounts impacted: Turnover and Trade and other payables Refer to Note 29 to the financial statementsCritical Audit Matter DescriptionIn the US the Group sells to customers under various commercial and government mandated contracts and reimbursement arrangement s that include rebates, chargebacks and a right of return for certain pharmaceutical products. As such, revenue recognition refle cts gross-to-net sales adjustments. These adjustments are known as the Returns and Rebates (RAR) accruals and are a source of signi ficant estimation uncertainty which could have a material impact on reported revenue. In the US Pharmaceuticals business in 2022 $18,928 million of RAR deductions were made to gross revenue of $36,953 million, res ulting in net revenue of $18,023 million. The balance sheet accrual at 31 December 2022 for the combined US Pharmaceuticals and Vaccin es businesses amounted to $6,881 million. The four most significant payer channels (also referred to as buying groups) to which the RAR accrual relates are managed healt hcare organisations, Medicaid, Ryan White and Medicare Part D. The two main causes of significant estimation uncertainty are: The utilisation rate, which is the portion of total sales that will be made into each payer channel, estimated by the Group i n recording the accruals. The utilisation assumption is the most challenging of the key assumptions used to derive the accrualgiven that it is influenced by market demand and other factors outside the control of the Group; and The time lag between the point of sale and the point at which exact rebate amounts are known to the Group upon receipt of a claim. Those payer channels with the longest time lag result in a greater accrued period, and therefore, a greater level ofestimation uncertainty in estimating the period end accrual. The level of estimation uncertainty is also impacted by significant shifts in channel mix driven by changes in the competitive landscape, including competitor and generic product launches and other macroeconomic factors. As such, we focus on the utilisation assumpt ions for those products where we deem the level of estimation uncertainty to be the most significant. Furthermore, auditing standards presume that a significant fraud risk exists in revenue recognition. In line with this presumpt ion, we also focus on the period-end adjustments made to the RAR accruals. These adjustments reflected updates made to the initial assumptio ns included within the forecasted RAR rates and, in our view, present the greatest opportunity for fraud in revenue recognition (notwithstanding the existence of internal controls). How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Audit procedures performedWe performed the following audit procedures, amongst others, related to estimates in the RAR accruals: Challenged assumptions for a selection of utilisation rates, focusing on certain products where we concluded the accrual is most sensitive to these assumptions. Our challenge included comparison to historical utilisation rates, consideration of historical accuracy and drivers of market changes such as the impact of competition and macroeconomic trends; Supplemented this with substantive analytical procedures by developing an independent expectation of the accrual balance for each of the key segments, based on historical claims received adjusted to reflect market changes in the period including an assessment of the time lag between the initial point of sale and the claim receipt. We then compared this independentexpectation to those recorded to evaluate the appropriateness of the year ending accrual position; Considered the historical accuracy of estimates and evaluated whether forecast assumptions had been appropriately updated in a selection of cases where the actual rebate claims differed to the amount accrued; Evaluated the appropriateness of, and completeness of, period-end adjustments to the liability made as part of the ongoing review of the estimated accrual; and Tested the key controls over the estimation of RAR accruals including the controls associated with the forecasting of utilisa tion rates process and the month-end accrual review controls. 79Valuation of other intangible assets Accounts impacted: Other intangible assets, Cost of sales, Research and development, and Selling, general and administration Refer to Notes 20 and 41 to the financial statementsCritical Audit Matter Description As at 31 December 2022, the Group held \u00a313,663 million of other intangible assets (including licenses, patents, trademarks, and trade names, but excluding goodwill and computer software). This includes \u00a32,964 million of intangible assets acquired as part of bus iness combinations with Sierra Oncology, Inc. and Affinivax Inc during the year. During 2022, impairment charges of \u00a3330 million were recorded. An individual intangible asset, or an intangible asset which forms part of a cash-generating unit, is impaired when its carryin g amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of these other intangible assets relies on certain assumptions and estim ates of future trading performance which create estimation uncertainty. Future trading performance of intangible assets includes key assumptions such as sales pricing, volume, growth rates and probab ility of technical and regulatory success of ongoing clinical trials. This includes assumptions on timing of cash flows determined by an ticipated launch year, peak year sales, subsequent sales erosion due to generic product competition and profit margin levels. In addition , due to the impact of uncertainty driven by ongoing global macroeconomic volatility, the valuation of intangible assets will also be affect ed by discount rate assumptions made by the Group. We identified the valuation of other intangible assets as a critical audit matter due to the inherent judgements involved in es timating future cash flows. Auditing such assumptions and estimates required extensive audit effort to challenge and evaluate the reasonablenes s of forecasts and judgements. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit We performed the following audit procedures, amongst others, related to the future sales pricing, volume, growth rates and prob ability of technical and regulatory success, profit margin levels, and discount rates used in the assessment in the valuation of other int angible assets: Inquired with the key individuals from the corporate development team, commercial forecasting leads, and key personnel involved in the assets research and development process to discuss and evaluate the Group's evidence to support the futurepricing, volume, sales growth rates and probability of regulatory and technical success; Evaluated the key inputs and assumptions applied in estimating sales and profit margin forecasts, including benchmarking of forecasts against external market data. This included independent market research of therapeutic area price points, price growth rates, and anticipated competitor market landscape, currently and at the time of forecast regulatory approval, plus assessment of any sources of contradictory evidence; Inspected independent research and literature to consider corroborative and contradictory evidence to assess assumptions on probability of technical and regulatory success; Compared the forecast sales and profit margin levels to the Plan data (asset by asset internal forecasts) approved by the GSK Leadership Team and the Board of Directors, where the in-development intangible asset is forecast to launch within the next 3-year period; Assessed the historical accuracy of sales forecasts by performing retrospective reviews across marketed assets within the business; Considered whether events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date but before the reporting date affect the conclusions reached on the carrying values of the assets and associated disclosures; Engaged Internal Fair Valuation Specialists (IFVS) to assess the reasonableness of discount rates and valuation methodology; and Tested review controls over the key inputs and assumptions used in the valuation of other intangible assets. The controls encompass review of the valuation models, which contain a number of assumptions such as the probability of technical and regulatory success, launch dates plus other revenue and cost assumptions. 80Valuation of uncertain tax positions, including transfer pricing Accounts impacted: Corporation tax payable, Deferred tax liabilities and Taxation chargeRefer to Note 14 to the financial statementsCritical Audit Matter DescriptionThe Group operates in numerous jurisdictions and there are open tax and transfer pricing matters and exposures with UK, US and overseas tax authorities that give rise to uncertain tax positions. There is a wide range of possible outcomes for provisions a nd contingencies. Certain judgements in respect of estimates of tax exposures and contingencies are required in order to assess th e adequacy of tax provisions, which are sometimes complex as a result of the considerations required over multiple tax laws and regulations. At 31 December 2022, the Group has recorded provisions of \u00a3858 million in respect of uncertain tax positions. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit With the support of tax specialists, we assessed the appropriateness of the uncertain tax provisions by performing the followin g audit procedures amongst others: Assessed and challenged provisions for uncertain tax positions through the evaluation of possible outcomes. Our procedures were focused on those jurisdictions where the Group has the greatest potential exposure and where the highest level ofjudgement is required; Assessed the assumptions and judgements that are required to determine the range of possible outcomes for recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions in compliance with the requirements of IFRIC 23; Involved our transfer pricing specialists to evaluate the transfer pricing methodology of the Group and associated approach t o provision recognition and measurement; Considered evidence such as the actual results from the recent tax authority audits and enquiries, third-party tax advice obtained by the Group and our tax specialists' own knowledge of market practice in relevant jurisdictions; and Tested key controls over preparation, review and reporting of judgmental tax balances and transactions, which include provisions for uncertain tax provisions. 81Consumer Healthcare Demerger Accounts impacted: Profit after taxation from discontinued operations and all balance sheet accounts Refer to Note 41 to the financial statementsCritical Audit Matter DescriptionOn 18 July 2022, GSK plc separated its Consumer Healthcare business from the GSK Group to form Haleon, an independent listed company. The separation was effected by way of a demerger of 80.1% of GSK's 68% holding in the Consumer business toGSK shareholders. GSK retained 13.5% of Haleon (7.5% are held by Scottish Limited Partnership structures (SLPs)) which are recognised as an equity investment as set out in Note 22. The Group derecognised net assets and liabilities of \u00a312.9bn and reco gnised a gain on demerger of \u00a310.1bn. The Consumer Healthcare trading results to the demerger date have been presented as a part of discontinued operations and the comparative results have been restated on a consistent basis. At the demerger date the assets and liabilities of the Consumer b usiness have been derecognised from the balance sheet, with the difference between the value of the net assets and the fair value of th e demerged business recognised in the consolidated income statement as a gain on demerger. The cumulative exchange differences arising on translation of those Consumer Healthcare foreign currency net assets, previously included in other comprehensive inc ome, have also been recognised in the consolidated income statement. We identified the demerger of Consumer Healthcare as a critical audit matter because of the significant estimates related to ca lculating the gain on demerger and remeasuring the retained stake upon demerger, assessing the perimeters of the demerged business, validatin g the cumulative exchange differences arising on translation of the foreign currency net assets of the divested businesses, evaluatin g the Group's tax treatment of the demerger and assessing the impact on relevant IT systems prior to the demerger. This required a hi gh degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our technical accounting, tax, and IT spec ialists, when performing audit procedures. The matter is also discussed in the Audit & Risk Committee report within the Corporate Governance section of the Annual Report. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit We performed the following audit procedures, amongst others, related to the Consumer Healthcare demerger: Consulted with technical accounting specialists to evaluate the entity's accounting conclusions in respect of the relevant accounting standards for the demerger steps including: o the presentation of Consumer Healthcare results as a part of discontinued operations; o the calculation of the gain on demerger; and o the retained stake upon demerger. Recalculated the gain on demerger and the fair value of the Consumer Healthcare business at the demerger date; Tested the accuracy and completeness of the perimeters of the demerged business by inspecting legal agreements and recalculating the cumulative exchange differences arising on translation of the foreign currency net assets; Engaged tax specialists to assess the impact of the demerger on the Group tax balances; Engaged IT specialists to assess the impact on the relevant IT systems prior to the demerger of Consumer Healthcare; and Tested key controls over IT and the reporting of the Consumer Healthcare Demerger including the review and approval of the accounting considerations, accuracy and completeness of transactions to the demerger date, the cumulative exchangereserve and the adjustments required in relation to the classification between continued and discontinued operations. 82Valuation of the contingent liabilities and significant legal proceedings Accounts impacted: Contingent liabilities and Other operating expense Refer to Notes 35 and 47 to the financial statementsCritical Audit Matter DescriptionThe Group operates in an environment where it is subject to significant legal and administrative proceedings, including product liability, intellectual property, tax, anti-trust, consumer fraud and governmental regulations. The Group is currently exposed to a number of regulatory and litigation matters. In the current year, the Group classified the Zantac litigation as a significant legal matter due to the increase in cases. The Group's provision for these matters is \u00a3218m at 31 D ecember 2022. Other matters are disclosed as contingent liabilities where the criteria for recognising a provision under IAS 37 Provisi ons, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets are not met. We identified contingent liabilities and significant legal proceedings as a critical audit matter because of the significant ju dgement required by the Group in determining whether, under IAS 37, in particular in relation to the Zantac matter, as to: Whether the outcome will result in a probable outflow, particularly where the outcome of litigation is uncertain and subject to additional court proceedings; The determination of a reliable estimate can be made of the amounts of the obligation; and The nature and extent of any contingent liabilities and underlying significant estimation uncertainties disclosed. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit We performed the following audit procedures: Tested the Group's controls over the completeness of provisions, the robustness of the provision against the requirements of IAS 37, the appropriateness of judgements used to determine a 'best estimate' and completeness and accuracy of data usedin the process; Evaluated the assessment of the provisions, associated probabilities, and potential outcomes in accordance with IAS 37; Evaluated the methodology, data and significant judgements and assumptions used in the valuation of the provisions are appropriate in the context of the applicable financial reporting framework; Inquired with and inspected correspondence from the Group's internal and external counsel to assess the litigation matter and evaluate the Group's significant judgements and assumptions; Where no provision was made, we critically evaluated the Group's conclusion supportive and contradictory evidence and the requirements of IAS 37, particularly with respect to the Zantac matter; In respect of the Zantac matter, we inspected the evidence presented in relevant scientific studies and the outcomes of other product liability litigation in the same jurisdictions alongside the entity's assessment of possible outcomes of each ongoing a nd future trials; and Evaluated whether the disclosures made in the financial statements appropriately reflect the facts and critical accounting judgements.

(F) Unless the board otherwise determines or the uncertificated securities rules otherwise require, any shares issued or created out of or in respect of any uncertificated shares shall be uncertificated shares and any shares issued or createdout of or in respect of any certificated shares shall be certificated shares. (G) The company shall be entitled to assume that the entries on any record of securities maintained by it in accordance with the uncertificated securities rules and regularly reconciled with the relevant Operator register of securities are acomplete and accurate reproduction of the particulars entered in the Operator register of securities and shall accordinglynot be liable in respect of any act or thing done or omitted to be done by or on behalf of the company in reliance on suchassumption; in particular, any provision of these articles which requires or envisages that action will be taken in reliance on information contained in the register shall be construed to permit that action to be taken in reliance on information contained in any relevant record of securities (as so maintained and reconciled). 814.

Approved Depositaries 68. Meaning of Approved Depositary (A) In these articles, unless the context otherwise requires, \" Approved Depositary \" means a person approved by the board and appointed: (i) to hold the company's shares or any rights or interests in any of the company's shares; and (ii) to issue securities, documents of title or other documents which evidence that the holder of them owns or is entitled to receive the shares, rights or interests held by the Approved Depository, and shall include a nominee acting for a person appointed to do these things. (B) The trustees of any scheme or arrangements for or principally for the benefit of employees of the company and its associated companies will be deemed to be an Approved Depositary for the purposes of these articles unless the boardresolves otherwise. 23 (C) References in these articles to an Approved Depositary or to shares held by it refer only to an Approved Depositary and to its shares held in its capacity as an Approved Depositary. 69. Appointment of Approved Depositaries Subject to these articles and to applicable law, an Approved Depositary may appoint as its proxy or proxies in relation to any ordinary shares which it holds, anyone it thinks fit and may determine the manner and terms of any such appointment. Each appointment must state the number and class of shares to which it relates and the total number of shares of each class in respect of which appointments exist at any one time, which must not exceed the total number of shares of each such classregistered in the name of the Approved Depositary or its nominee (the \" Depositary Shares \") at that time. 70. Register of Approved Depositaries The Approved Depositary must keep a register (the \" Proxy Register \") of each person it has appointed as a proxy under Article 72 (an \" Appointed Proxy \") and the number of Depositary Shares (their \" Appointed Number \") to which the appointment relates. The directors will determine the requisite information to be recorded in the Proxy Register relating to each Appointed Proxy. Any person authorised by the company may inspect the Proxy Register during usual business hours and the Approved Depositary will give such person any information which that person requests as to the contents of the Proxy Register. 71. Approved Depositaries' Attendance at General Meetings (A) An Appointed Proxy may only attend a general meeting if they provide the company with written evidence of their appointment as such. This must be in a form agreed between the directors and the Approved Depositary. (B) Subject to applicable law and to these articles, and so long as the Approved Depositary or a nominee of the Approved Depositary holds at least their Appointed Number of shares, an Appointed Proxy is entitled to attend a general meeting which holders of that class of shares are entitled to attend, and they are entitled to the same rights, and subject to thesame obligations, in relation to their Appointed Number of Depositary Shares as if they had been validly appointed inaccordance with Articles 74 to 78 by the registered holder of these shares as its proxy in relation to those shares. 72. Proxies of Appointed Depositaries An Appointed Proxy may appoint another person as their proxy for their Appointed Number of Depositary Shares, provided the appointment is made and deposited in accordance with Articles 74 to 78. These articles apply to that appointment and to the person so appointed as though those Depositary Shares were registered in the name of the Appointed Proxy and the appointment was made by them in that capacity. The directors may require such evidence as they think appropriate to decidethat such appointment is effective. 2473. Identifying Appointed Proxies (A) For the purposes of determining who is entitled as an Appointed Proxy to exercise the rights conferred by Articles 71 and 72 and the number of Depositary Shares in respect of which a person is to be treated as having been appointed as an Appointed Proxy for these purposes, the Approved Depositary may decide that the Appointed Proxies who are soentitled are the persons entered in the Proxy Register at a time and on a date (a \" Record Time \") agreed between the Approved Depositary and the company. (B) When a Record Date is decided for a particular purpose: (i) an Appointed Proxy is to be treated as having been appointed for that purpose for the number and class of shares appearing against their name in the Proxy Register as at the Record Time; and (ii) changes to entries in the Proxy Register after the Record Time will be ignored for this purpose. (C) Except for recognising the rights given in relation to General Meetings by appointments made by Appointed Proxies pursuant to Article 72, the company is entitled to treat any person entered in the Proxy Register as an Appointed Proxy as the only person (other than the Approved Depositary) who has any interest in the Depositary Shares in respect ofwhich the Appointed Proxy has been appointed. (D) At a general meeting the chair has the final decision as to whether any person has the right to vote or exercise any other right relating to any Depositary Shares. In any other situation, the directors have the final decision as to whether any person has the right to exercise any right relating to any Depositary Shares. Proxies 74. Appointment of Proxies The appointment of a proxy shall be in writing signed by the appointor or their duly authorised attorney or, if the appointor i s a corporation, shall either be executed under its seal or signed by an officer, attorney or other person authorised to sign it. I f a member appoints more than one proxy and the proxy forms appointing those proxies would give those proxies the apparent right to exercise votes on behalf of the member in a general meeting over more shares than are held by the member, then each ofthose proxy forms will be invalid and none of the proxies so appointed will be entitled to attend, speak or vote at the relevan t general meeting. 75. Receipt of Proxies (A) The appointment of a proxy must: (i) in the case of an appointment made in hard copy form, be received at the office (or such other place in the United Kingdom or in the United States as may be specified by the company for the receipt of appointments ofproxy in 25 hard copy form) not less than 48 hours (or such shorter time as the board may determine) before the time appointed for holding the meeting or adjourned meeting at which the person named in the appointment proposes to vote together with (if required by the board) any authority under which it is made or a copy of the authority, certified notarially or in accordance with the Powers of Attorney Act 1971 or in some other mannerapproved by the board; (ii) in the case of an appointment made by electronic means, be received at the address specified by the company for the receipt of appointments of proxy by electronic means not less than 48 hours (or such shorter time as the board may determine) before the time appointed for holding the meeting or adjourned meeting at which theperson named in the appointment proposes to vote. Any authority pursuant to which such an appointment ismade or a copy of the authority, certified notarially or in accordance with the Powers of Attorney Act 1971 or insome other manner approved by the board, must, if required by the board, be received at such address or at the office (or such other place in the United Kingdom as may be specified by the company for the receipt of such documents) not less than 48 hours (or such shorter time as the board may determine) before the timeappointed for holding the meeting or adjourned meeting at which the person named in the appointmentproposes to vote; (iii) in the case of an appointment delivered by an Approved Depositary (except in respect of a proxy appointed in accordance with Article 69) be delivered to the appropriate place referred to in (i) or (ii) above, as appropriate, depending on whether the appointment is made in hard copy or electronic form; (iv) in the case of a vote taken more than 48 hours subsequently to the date of the meeting or adjourned meeting, be received as aforesaid not less than 24 hours (or such shorter time as the board may determine) before thetime appointed for the taking of the vote; and (v) in the case of a vote taken not more than 48 hours subsequently to the date of the meeting or adjourned meeting, be received as aforesaid by the time at which the vote was demanded (or at such later time as the board may determine), and an appointment of a proxy which is not, or in respect of which the authority or copy thereof is not, received in a manner so permitted shall be invalid. When two or more valid but differing appointments of a proxy are received in respect of the same share for use at the same meeting or poll, the one which is last received (regardless of its date or ofthe date of its signature) shall be treated as replacing and revoking the others as regards that share; if the company is unable to determine which was last received, none of them shall be treated as valid in respect of that share. Theappointment of a proxy shall not preclude a member from attending and voting in person at the meeting or pollconcerned. The proceedings at a general meeting shall not be invalidated where an appointment of a proxy in respect of that meeting is sent in electronic form as provided in these articles, but because of a technical problem it cannot be read by the recipient. 26 (B) The board may at its discretion determine that in calculating the periods mentioned in this article no account shall be taken of any part of a day that is not a working day. 76. Maximum Validity of Proxy No appointment of a proxy shall be valid after 12 months have elapsed from the date of its receipt save that, unless the contra ry is stated in it, an appointment of a proxy shall be valid for use at an adjourned meeting or vote after a meeting or an adjourn ed meeting even after 12 months, if it was valid for the original meeting. 77. Form of Proxy The appointment of a proxy shall be in any usual form or in such other form as the board may approve. The appointment of a proxy shall be deemed to confer authority to vote on any amendment of a resolution put to, or any other business which may properly come before, the meeting for which it is given as the proxy thinks fit. The appointment of a proxy shall, unless thecontrary is stated in it, be valid as well for any adjournment of the meeting as for the meeting to which it relates. 78. Cancellation of Proxy's Authority A vote given by a proxy or by the duly authorised representative of a corporation shall be valid notwithstanding the previous determination of the authority of the person voting, unless notice in writing of the determination was received by the company at the office (or such other place or address as was specified by the company for the receipt of appointments of proxy) not later than the last time at which an appointment of a proxy should have been received in order to be valid for use at the meeting atwhich the vote was given. Class Meetings 79. Separate General Meetings The provisions of these articles relating to general meetings shall apply, with any necessary modifications to any separate general meeting of the holders of shares of a class convened otherwise than in connection with the variation or abrogation of t he rights attached to the shares of that class. For this purpose, a general meeting at which no holder of a share other than an ordinary share may, in their capacity as a member, attend or vote shall also constitute a separate general meeting of the holde rs of the ordinary shares. Appointment, Retirement and Removal of Directors 80. Number of Directors Unless otherwise determined by ordinary resolution of the company, the directors (disregarding alternate directors) shall be no t less than two nor more than 24 in number. 81.

If the board acts in good faith, it shall not incur any liability to the holders of any shares for any loss they may suffer in consequence of the payment of an interim or fixed dividend on any otherclass of shares ranking pari passu with or after those shares. 121. Calculation and Currency of Dividends (A) Except in so far as the rights attaching to, or the terms of issue of, any share otherwise provide: (i) all dividends shall be declared and paid according to the amounts paid up on the share in respect of which the dividend is paid, but no amount paid up on a share in advance of calls shall be treated for the purposes of this article as paid up on the share; (ii) all dividends shall be apportioned and paid pro rata according to the amounts paid up on the share during any portion or portions of the period in respect of which the dividend is paid; and 41 (iii) dividends may be declared or paid in any currency. (B) The board may decide the basis of conversion for any currency conversions that may be required and how any costs involved are to be met. (C) The board may also decide that a particular Approved Depositary should be able to receive dividends in a currency other than the currency in which it is declared and may make arrangements accordingly. In particular, if an ApprovedDepositary has chosen or agreed to receive dividends in another currency, the directors may make arrangements withthat Approved Depositary for payment to be made to them for value on the date on which the relevant dividend is paid,or a later date decided on by the directors. 122. Amounts Due on Shares may be Deducted from Dividends The board may deduct from any dividend or other moneys payable to a member by the company on or in respect of any shares all sums of money (if any) presently payable by that member to the company on account of calls or otherwise in respect ofshares of the company.

(C) If: (i) a shareholder (or all joint shareholders) does not specify an address, or does not specify an account of a type prescribed by the directors, or does not specify other details, and in each case that information is necessary in order to make payment of the dividend or other money in the way in which under this article the directors havedecided that the payment is to be made or by which the shareholder (or all joint shareholders) has validly elected to receive the payment; or (ii) payment cannot be made by the company using the information provided by the shareholder (or all joint shareholders), then the dividend or other money will be treated as unclaimed for the purposes of these articles. (D) For joint shareholders or persons jointly entitled to shares by law, payment can be made to the shareholder whose name stands first in the register.

(E) Cheques, warrants and similar financial instruments are sent, and payment in any other way is made, at the risk of the person who is entitled to the money. The company is treated as having paid a dividend if the cheque, warrant or similar financial instrument is cleared or if a payment is made through CREST, bank transfer or other electronic means. Thecompany will not be responsible for any payment which is lost or delayed. (F) Where a person is entitled by transmission to a share, any dividend or other sum payable by the company in respect of the share may be paid as if that person were a holder of the share and that person's address noted in the register were that person's registered address and where two or more persons are so entitled, 43 any one of them may give effectual receipts for any dividends or other moneys payable or property distributable on or in respect of the shares. 125. Uncashed Dividends The company may cease to send any cheque, warrant or similar financial instrument through the post or to employ any other means of payment, including payment by means of a relevant system, for any dividend payable on any shares in the company which is normally paid in that manner on those shares if in respect of at least two consecutive dividends payable on those shar es the cheques, warrants or similar financial instruments have been returned undelivered or remain uncashed during or at the endof the period for which the same are valid or that means of payment has failed. In addition, the company may cease to send anycheque, warrant or similar financial instrument through the post or may cease to employ any other means of payment if, inrespect of one dividend payable on those shares, the cheque, warrant or similar financial instrument has been returned undelivered or remains uncashed during or at the end of the period for which the same is valid or that means of payment has failed and reasonable enquiries have failed to establish any new postal address or account of the holder. Subject to theprovisions of these articles, the company must recommence sending cheques, warrants or similar financial instruments oremploying such other means in respect of dividends payable on those shares if the holder or person entitled by transmissionrequests such recommencement in writing. 126. Forfeiture of Unclaimed Dividends All dividends or other sums payable on or in respect of any shares which remain unclaimed may be invested or otherwise made use of by the board for the benefit of the company until claimed. Any dividend or other sum unclaimed after a period of 6 years from the date when it was declared or became due for payment shall be forfeited and shall revert to the company unless theboard decides otherwise and the payment by the board of any unclaimed dividend or other sum payable on or in respect of ashare into a separate account shall not constitute the company a trustee in respect of it. 127. Dividends Not in Cash Any general meeting declaring a dividend may, upon the recommendation of the board, by ordinary resolution direct, and the board may in relation to any interim dividend direct, that it shall be satisfied wholly or partly by the distribution of assets , and in particular of paid up shares or debentures of any other company, and where any difficulty arises in regard to the distribution the board may settle it as it thinks expedient, and in particular may authorise any person to sell and transfer any fractions or ma y ignore fractions altogether, and may fix the value for distribution purposes of any assets or any part thereof to be distribute d and may determine that cash shall be paid to any members upon the footing of the value so fixed in order to secure equality ofdistribution and may vest any assets to be distributed in trustees as may seem expedient to the board. 128. Scrip Dividends and Dividend Plans Generally The board may, if authorised by an ordinary resolution of the company, offer any holders of ordinary shares (excluding any member holding shares as treasury shares) the right to elect to receive ordinary shares, credited as fully paid, instead of cas h in respect of the 44whole (or some part, to be determined by the board) of any dividend specified by the ordinary resolution. The following provisions shall apply: (i) an ordinary resolution may specify some or all of a particular dividend (whether or not already declared) or may specify some or all of any dividends declared or paid within a specified period, but such period may not end later than the thirdanniversary of the date of the meeting at which the ordinary resolution is passed; (ii) the entitlement of each holder of ordinary shares to new ordinary shares shall be such that the relevant value of the entitlement shall be as nearly as possible equal to (but not greater than) the cash amount (disregarding any tax credit) ofthe dividend that such holder elects to forgo. For this purpose \" relevant value \" shall be calculated by reference to the average of the middle market quotations for the company's ordinary shares on the London Stock Exchange as derivedfrom the Daily Official List (or any other publication of a recognised investment exchange showing quotations for the company's ordinary shares) on such five consecutive dealing days as the board shall determine provided that the first ofsuch days shall be on or after the day on which the ordinary shares are first quoted \"ex\" the relevant dividend or in such other manner as may be determined by or in accordance with the ordinary resolution. A certificate or report by theauditors as to the amount of the relevant value in respect of any dividend shall be conclusive evidence of that amountand in giving such a certificate or report the auditors may rely on advice or information from brokers or other sources of information as they think fit; (iii) no fraction of any ordinary share shall be allotted. The board may make such provisions as it thinks fit for any fractiona l entitlements including provisions whereby, in whole or in part, the benefit thereof accrues to the company and/or under which fractional entitlements are accrued and/or retained without interest and in each case accumulated on behalf of any holder of ordinary shares and such accruals or retentions are applied to the allotment by way of bonus to or cashsubscription on behalf of such holder of fully paid ordinary shares and/or provisions whereby cash payments may bemade to such holders in respect of their fractional entitlements; (iv) the board, if it intends to offer an election in respect of any dividend, shall give notice to the holders of ordinary shar es of the right of election offered to them, and specify the procedure to be followed which, for the avoidance of doubt, mayinclude an election by means of a relevant system and the place at which, and the latest time by which, elections mustbe lodged in order for elections to be effective; no such notice need be given to holders of ordinary shares who havepreviously given election mandates in accordance with this article and whose mandates have not been revoked; the accidental omission to give notice of any right of election to, or the non receipt (even if the company becomes aware ofsuch non-receipt) of any such notice by, any holder of ordinary shares entitled to the same shall neither invalidate any offer of an election nor give rise to any claim, suit or action; (v) the board shall not proceed with any election unless the company has sufficient reserves or funds that may be capitalised, and the board has authority to allot sufficient shares, to give effect to it after the basis of allotment is determined; 45 (vi) the board may exclude or restrict from any offer any shareholder who is an Approved Depositary or a nominee for an Approved Depositary if the offer or exercise of the right to or by the persons on whose behalf the Approved Depositary holds the shares would suffer legal or practical problems of the kind mentioned in Article 128(vii). If other shareholders (other than those excluded under Article 128(vii)) have the right to opt for new shares, the directors must be satisfied that an appropriate dividend reinvestment plan or similar arrangement is available to a substantial majority of the people onwhose behalf the Approved Depositary holds shares or that such arrangement will be available promptly and the firstsentence of this Article 128(vi) does not apply until the directors are satisfied of this; (vii) the board may exclude from any offer or make other arrangement in relation to any holders of ordinary shares where the board believes that such exclusion or arrangement is necessary or expedient in relation to legal or practical problemsunder the laws of, or the requirements of any recognised regulatory body or any stock exchange in, any territory, or theboard believes that for any other reason the offer should not be made to them; (viii) the dividend (or that part of the dividend in respect of which a right of election has been offered) shall not be payable on ordinary shares in respect of which an election has been made (for the purposes of this article \" the elected ordinary shares \") and instead additional ordinary shares shall be allotted to the holders of the elected ordinary shares on the basis of allotment calculated as stated. For such purpose the board shall capitalise, out of any amount standing to thecredit of any reserve or fund (including the retained earnings) at the relevant time whether or not the same is availablefor distribution as the board may determine, a sum equal to the aggregate nominal amount of the additional ordinaryshares to be allotted on that basis and apply it in paying up in full the appropriate number of ordinary shares forallotment and distribution to the holders of the elected ordinary shares on that basis. The board may do all acts andthings considered necessary or expedient to give effect to any such capitalisation; (ix) the additional ordinary shares when allotted shall rank pari passu in all respects with the fully-paid ordinary shares then in issue except that they will not be entitled to participation in the relevant dividend; (x) unless the board otherwise determines, or unless the uncertificated securities rules otherwise require, the new ordinary share or shares which a member has elected to receive instead of cash in respect of the whole (or some part) of thespecified dividend declared or paid in respect of their elected ordinary shares shall be in uncertificated form (in respectof the member's elected ordinary shares which were in uncertificated form on the date of the member's election) and incertificated form (in respect of the member's elected ordinary shares which were in certificated form on the date of the member's election); (xi) the board may also from time to time establish or vary a procedure for election mandates, which, for the avoidance of doubt, may include an election by means of a relevant system, under which a holder of ordinary shares may elect inrespect of future rights of election offered to that holder under this article until the election mandate is revoked or deemed to be revoked in accordance with the procedure; 46 (xii) the board may decide how any costs relating to making new shares available in place of a cash dividend will be met, including deciding to deduct an amount from the entitlement of a shareholder under this article; and (xiii) at any time before new ordinary shares are allotted instead of cash in respect of any part of a dividend, the board may determine that such new ordinary shares will not be allotted. Any such determination may be made before or after anyelection has been made by holders of ordinary shares in respect of the relevant dividend. Capitalisation of Reserves 129. Power to Capitalise Reserves and Funds The company may, upon the recommendation of the board, at any time and from time to time pass an ordinary resolution to the effect that it is desirable to capitalise all or any part of any amount standing to the credit of any reserve or fund (includin g retained earnings) at the relevant time whether or not the same is available for distribution and accordingly that the amount t o be capitalised be set free for distribution among the members or any class of members who would be entitled to it if it weredistributed by way of dividend and in the same proportions, on the footing that it is applied either in or towards paying up th e amounts unpaid at the relevant time on any shares in the company held by those members respectively or in paying up in full shares, debentures or other obligations of the company to be allotted and distributed credited as fully paid up among thosemembers, or partly in one way and partly in the other, but so that, for the purposes of this article: (i) a share premium accou nt and a capital redemption reserve, and any reserve or fund representing unrealised profits, may be applied only in paying up infull shares of the company that are to be allotted and distributed as fully paid up; and (ii) where the amount capitalised is a pplied in paying up in full shares that are to be allotted and distributed as fully paid up, the company will also be entitled to part icipate in the relevant distribution in relation to any shares of the relevant class held by it as treasury shares and the proportionateentitlement of the relevant class of members to the distribution will be calculated accordingly. The board may authorise anyperson to enter into an agreement with the company on behalf of the persons entitled to participate in the distribution and theagreement shall be binding on those persons. 130. Settlement of Difficulties in Distribution Where any difficulty arises in regard to any distribution of any capitalised reserve or fund the board may settle the matter as it thinks expedient and in particular may authorise any person to sell and transfer any fractions or may resolve that the distribu tion should be as nearly as may be practicable in the correct proportion but not exactly so or may ignore fractions altogether, andmay determine that cash payments shall be made to any members in order to adjust the rights of all parties, as may seem expedient to the board. Record Dates 131.

A. Description of Ordinary Shares This summary of the general terms and provisions of our ordinary shares does not purport to be complete and is subject to and q ualified in its entirety by reference to our Articles of Association (the \"Articles\"), which are incorporated herein by reference to the Form 2 0-F filed on [ ], 2023 (File No. 001-15170). GSK has ordinary shares in issue which are in registered form and are governed by the laws of England and Wales. The holders of ordinary shares have statutory pre-emption rights under the UK Companies Act 2006 (the \"Companies Act\") on the i ssuance of new ordinary shares or rights to subscribe for, or to convert into, ordinary shares. Under the Companies Act, such pre-emption rights may be dis-applied by special resolution of the shareholders of GSK. The shareholders of GSK passed a special resolution on May 4, 2022 to allow D irectors to be empowered to (i) disapply pre-emption rights in relation to an allotment of equity securities that is otherwise made on a pre-e mptive basis in order to deal appropriately with fractional entitlements, jurisdictional issues and other legal, regulatory or practical problems and (ii) al lot equity securities for cash and/or to sell ordinary shares held by GSK as treasury shares for cash up to an amount of \u00a363,548,425 in nominal share capital as if pre-emption rights did not apply. This authorization is set to expire at the end of GSK's Annual General Meeting held in 2023 (or, if earlier, clo se of business on June 30, 2023). As at December 31, 2022 there were 4,311,343,341 ordinary shares of 31 14 pence each in issue. Our Articles contain provisions to the following effect: Dividends All ordinary shares rank pari passu in respect of dividends and other distributions of profits. Subject to the provisions of th e Articles and applicable legislation, GSK at any general meeting may declare dividends on the ordinary shares by ordinary resolution, but suc h dividends may not exceed the amount recommended by the board of directors of GSK (the \"Board\"). The Board may also pay interim or fixed rate divi dends if it appears they are justified by our financial position. All unclaimed dividends payable in respect of any share may be invested or otherwise made use of by the Board for the benefit o f GSK until claimed. If a dividend is not claimed after 6 years of it being declared or becoming payable, it is forfeited and reverts to us . GSK may, if authorized by an ordinary resolution, offer any holders of ordinary shares (excluding any member holding shares as treasury shares) the right to elect to receive ordinary shares, credited as fully paid, instead of cash in respect of the whole (or some part, to be determined by the Board) of any dividend specified by the ordinary resolution. Voting Subject to any special terms as to voting upon which any shares may be issued or may at the relevant time be held and to any ot her provisions of the Articles, members shall be entitled to vote at a general meeting as provided in the Companies Act. At any general meeting, a resolution that is put to the vote of the meeting shall be decided on a poll, which shall be taken in such manner as the chair of the meeting shall direct, including by means of electronic vote casters. The result of the vote shall be deemed to be the resolution of the meeting at which the vote was demanded. A vote to elect the chair of the meeting or to adjourn the meeting must be taken immediately at the meeting. Any other vote may be taken at any other time (within 30 days of the meeting) and place determined by the chair. In the case of joint hol ders, only the vote of the senior holder (as determined by order in the share register) or his or her proxy may be counted. If any sum payable remains unp aid in relation to a member's shareholding, that member is not entitled to vote that share or exercise any other right in relation to a meeting of G SK unless the Board determines otherwise. For a proxy vote to be valid, the Board must have received satisfactory evidence such that the authority of the person claiming to exercise the right to vote or such other right has been received by the Company not later than the last time at which appointme nts of proxy should have been received in order to be valid for use at that meeting or on the holding of that poll.Any objection or error shall be referred to the chair of the meeting and shall only vitiate the decision of the meeting on any resolution if the chair decides that the objection or error may have affected the decision of the meeting. Transfers Ordinary shares may be held in either certificated or uncertificated form. Certificated ordinary shares shall be transferred in any usual or other form approved by the Board and executed by or on behalf of the transferor. Transfers of uncertificated ordinary shares shall be made in accordance with the Companies Act and Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, as amended. The Board is not bound to register (i) a transfer of partly paid ordinary shares, (ii) uncertificated shares in the circumstanc es set out in the Companies Act and Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001 and (iii) transfers of uncertificated securities to joint holders where the number of such joint holders exceeds four. The Board may also decline to register an instrument of transfer of certificated ordinary shares un less (i) it is duly stamped, duly certified or otherwise shown to the satisfaction of the Board to be exempt from stamp duty and deposited at the prescribed place and accompanied by the share certificate(s) and such other evidence as reasonably required by the Board to evidence right to transfer, (ii) it is in respect of one class of shares only, and (iii) in the case of a transfer to joint holders, the number of joint holders to whom the share is to be trans ferred does not exceed four. Redemption Subject to any rights attached to existing shares, any share may be issued on terms that it is, at our option or the option of the holder of such share, redeemable. The directors are authorized to determine the terms, conditions and manner of redemption of any such shares under the Articles. Calls on capital The directors may make calls upon the members in respect of any monies unpaid on their shares. A person upon whom a call is mad e remains liable even if the shares in respect of which the call is made have been transferred. Interest will be chargeable on any unpaid amount called at a rate determined by the Board (not exceeding the Bank of England base rate by more than 5%). If a member fails to pay any call or installment of a call in full (following notice from the Board that such failure will resu lt in forfeiture of the relevant shares), such shares (including any dividends declared but not paid) may be forfeited by a resolution of the Board, an d will become the property of GSK. Forfeiture shall not absolve a previous member for amounts payable by him/her (which may continue to accrue interest). GSK also has a lien over all of our partly paid shares for all monies payable or called on such shares and over the debts and l iabilities of a member to GSK. If any monies which are the subject of the lien remain unpaid after a notice from the Board demanding payment, w e may sell such shares. Other Shareholder Rights On a distribution of capital on a winding-up, the ordinary shares rank pari passu with each other but behind the rights of all of GSK's creditors. Variation of Rights The rights attached to any class of shares may be varied either with the consent in writing of the holders of at least 75% in n ominal value of the issued shares of that class or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the sha res of that class. If new shares are created or issued which rank equally with any other existing shares, or if the Company purchases or redeems a ny of its own shares, the rights of the existing shares will not be regarded as changed or abrogated unless the terms of the existing shares expressly say otherwise. Limitations on Share Ownership There are no limitations on the rights of shareholders to own ordinary shares. In addition, there are no restrictions imposed b y the Articles or (subject to the effect of any economic sanctions or UK or EU merger control laws that may be in force from time to time) by cur rent UK laws which relate to non-residents or foreign shareholders and which limit the rights of such non-residents or foreign shareholders to hold or (w hen entitled to do so) exercise voting rights on the ordinary shares.

The principal executive office of the Depositary is 383 Madison Avenue, Floor 11, New York, New York 10179. Each ADS represents the right to receive two ordinary shares of GSK. An ADR may evidence any number of ADSs. Our American Depositary Receipts are admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \"GSK\". Voting The Depositary or, if the deposited securities are registered in the name of or held by its nominee, its nominee, subject to an d in accordance with the constituent documents of GSK irrevocably appointed each Holder for the time being on the record date (the \"Voting Record Da te\") fixed by the Depositary in respect of any meeting (at which holders of deposited securities are entitled to vote) as its proxy to attend, vo te and speak at the relevant meeting (or any adjournment thereof) in respect of the deposited securities represented by the ADS registered on the books of t he Depositary in the name of such Holder on the Voting Record Date. In respect of any such meeting each such Holder can appoint any person as its substit ute proxy to attend, vote and speak on behalf of the Holder subject to and in accordance with the provisions of the Deposit Agreement and the constituent documents of GSK. As soon as practicable after receipt of notice of any meeting at which the holders of deposited securities are entitled to vote , or of solicitation of consents or proxies from holders of deposited securities, the Depositary shall fix the Voting Record Date in respect of such me eting or solicitation. The Depositary or, if GSK so determines, GSK, shall distribute to Holders of record on such Voting Record Date: (a) such informatio n as is contained in such notice of meeting or in the solicitation materials, (b) an ADR proxy card in a form prepared by the Depositary, (c) a statement that each Holder at the close of business on the Voting Record Date will be entitled, subject to any applicable law, GSK's constituent documents and the prov isions of or governing the deposited securities, either (i) to use such ADR proxy card in order to attend, vote and speak at such meeting as the proxy of the Depositary or its nominee solely with respect to the ordinary shares or other deposited securities represented by ADSs evidenced by such Holder's ADRs or (ii) to appoint any other person as the substitute proxy of such Holder, solely with respect to the ordinary shares or other deposited securiti es represented by ADSs evidenced by such Holder's ADRs, or (iii) to renounce the proxy initially provided by the Depositary or its nominee to such Hol der or such Holder's substitute proxy and to provide voting instructions to the Depositary as to the exercise of the voting rights pertaining to the ordinary shares or other deposited securities represented by ADSs evidenced by their respective ADRs (\"Voting Instructions\"), and (d) if the Depositary is to be given Voting Instructions by such Holder, a brief statement as to the manner in which Voting Instructions may be given to the Depositary. Ea ch Holder shall be solely responsible for the forwarding of voting information to the persons or entities having a beneficial ownership interest in ADSs (the \"Beneficial Owners\") registered in such Holder's name. There is no guarantee that Holders and Beneficial Owners generally or any Holder or Beneficia l Owner in particular will receive the notice described above with sufficient time to enable such Holder or Beneficial Owner to return any voting instruct ions to the Depositary in a timely manner or for the Holder to arrange to attend, vote and/or speak at the relevant meeting. GSK shall provide notice to th e Depositary of such vote or meeting in a timely manner and at least 30 days prior to the date of such vote or meeting (unless less than 30 days' notice of the meeting has been given in accordance with GSK's Articles of Association and English law, in which case GSK will provide to the Depositary such advance notice of the meeting as may be possible under the circumstances); provided that if the Depositary receives less than 30 days' notice of such vote or me eting, the Depositary shall only make such distribution to the extent it deems it to be practicable. Upon actual receipt by the ADR department responsible for proxies and voting instructions (including, without limitation, instr uctions of any entity or entities acting on behalf of the nominee for the Depositary Trust Company (\"DTC\")) of Voting Instructions of a Holder on the Voting Record Date in the manner and on or before the time established by the Depositary for such purpose, the Depositary shall endeavor, insofar as prac ticable and permitted under applicable law, the provisions of GSK's constituent documents and the provisions of the deposited securities, to vote or cause to be voted the deposited securities represented by the ADSs evidenced by such Holder's ADRs in accordance with such Voting Instructions insofa r as practicable and permitted under the provisions of or governing deposited securities.

Holders and their substitute proxy (other than the Depositary) shall only be permitted to attend, vote and speak at meetings at which holders of deposited securities are entitled to vote as the proxy of the Depositary or its nominee with respect to the whole number of ord inary shares represented by the ADSs evidenced by ADRs held by such Holders on the record date set by the Depositary. For the avoidance of doubt, when the Depositary receives Voting Instructions from a substitute proxy of a Holder (including, without limitation, instructions from Broadridge Financial Solutions or any other entity acting on behalf of participants and/or customers of participants within DTC) or their agents, and such registered Holder has n otified the Depositary that it holds ADRs on behalf of such substitute proxies, the Depositary shall treat such Voting Instructions as coming from an entity t hat holds ADRs on behalf of such substitute proxies and the Depositary shall vote or cause to be voted the deposited securities in accordance with such ins tructions. Holders are strongly encouraged to forward their Voting Instructions as soon as possible. Voting Instructions will not be deeme d received until such time as the ADR department responsible for proxies and voting has received such Voting Instructions notwithstanding that s uch Voting Instructions may have been physically received by the Depositary prior to such time. Notwithstanding anything contained in the Deposit Agreement or any ADR, the Depositary may, to the extent not prohibited by any law, rule or regulation or the rules and/or requirements of the stock exchange on which the ADSs are listed, in lieu of distribution of the materials provided to the Depositary in connection with any meeting of or solicitation of consents or proxies from holders of deposited securities, distr ibute to the Holders a notice, after consulting GSK as to the form of such notice to the extent practicable, that provides Holders with, or otherwise publiciz es to Holders, instructions on how to retrieve such materials or receive such materials upon request (i.e., by reference to a website containing the materials for retrieval or a contact for requesting copies of the materials). Procedures for Transmitting Notices, Reports and Proxy Soliciting Material In addition to the procedures for transmitting notices discussed above under \"Voting\", the Depositary or its agent will keep, a t a designated transfer office (the \"Transfer Office\"), (i) a register (the \"ADR Register\") for the registration, registration of transfer, co mbination and split-up of ADRs and (ii) facilities for the delivery and receipt of ADRs. Title to an ADR (and to deposited securities represented by the ADSs), wh en properly endorsed (in the case of ADRs in certificated form) or upon delivery to the Depositary of proper instruments of transfer, is transferable by del ivery with the same effect as in the case of negotiable instruments under the laws of the State of New York; provided that the Depositary, notwithstanding any n otice to the contrary, may treat the person in whose name such ADR is registered on the ADR Register as the absolute owner hereof for all purposes and nei ther the Depositary nor GSK will have any obligation or be subject to any liability under the Deposit Agreement or any ADR to any Beneficial Owner, unl ess such Beneficial Owner is the Holder hereof. Such ADR is transferable on the ADR Register and may be split into other ADRs or combined with othe r ADRs into one ADR, evidencing the aggregate number of ADSs surrendered for split-up or combination, by the Holder hereof or by duly authorized att orney upon surrender of this ADR at the Transfer Office properly endorsed (in the case of ADRs in certificated form) or upon delivery to the Depositary of proper instruments of transfer and duly stamped as may be required by applicable law; provided that the Depositary may close the ADR Register at any time or from time to time when deemed expedient by it and it shall also close the issuance book portion of the ADR Register when reasonably requeste d by GSK in order to enable GSK to comply with applicable law. At the request of a Holder, the Depositary shall, for the purpose of substituting a c ertificated ADR with a Direct Registration ADR (defined below), or vice versa, execute and deliver a certificated ADR or a Direct Registration ADR, as the ca se may be, for any authorized number of ADSs requested, evidencing the same aggregate number of ADSs as those evidenced by the certificated ADR or Direct Registration ADR, as the case may be, substituted. The Deposit Agreement, the provisions of or governing deposited securities and any written communications from GSK, which are b oth received by the custodian or its nominee as a holder of deposited securities and made generally available to the holders of deposited se curities, are available for inspection by Holders at the offices of the Depositary and its agent or agents (the \"Custodian\"), at the Transfer Office, on th e U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (the \"Commission\") website, or upon request from the Depositary (which request may be refused by the Depo sitary at its discretion). The Depositary will distribute copies of such communications (or English translations or summaries thereof) to Hol ders when furnished by GSK. GSK is subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Act and accordingly files certain reports with the Commission . Such reports and other information may be inspected and copied through the Commission's EDGAR system or at public reference facilities maintained by t he Commission located at the date hereof at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549. \"Direct Registration ADR\" means an ADR, the ownership of which is recorded on the Direct Registration System.\"Direct Registration System\" means the system for the uncertificated registration of ownership of securities established by DTC and utilized by the Depositary pursuant to which the Depositary may record the ownership of ADRs without the issuance of a certificate, which o wnership shall be evidenced by periodic statements issued by theDepositary to the Holders entitled thereto. Sale or Exercising of Rights The Depositary will distribute to each Holder entitled thereto on the record date set by the Depositary therefor at such Holder 's address shown on the ADR Register, in proportion to the number of deposited securities (on which the following distributions on deposited sec urities are received by the Custodian) represented by ADSs evidenced by such Holder's ADRs: (i) warrants or other instruments in the discretion of the Depo sitary representing rights to acquire additional ADRs in respect of any rights to subscribe for additional Shares or rights of any nature available to the Depositary as a result of a distribution on deposited securities (\"Rights\"), to the extent that GSK timely furnishes to the Depositary evidence satisf actory to the Depositary that the Depositary may lawfully distribute the same (GSK has no obligation to so furnish such evidence), or (ii) to the extent GSK does not so furnish such evidence and sales of Rights are practicable, any U.S. dollars available to the Depositary from the net proceeds of sales of Ri ghts as in the case of cash, or (iii) to the extent GSK does not so furnish such evidence and such sales cannot practicably be accomplished by reason of the nontransferability of the Rights, limited markets therefor, their short duration or otherwise, nothing (and any Rights may lapse). Deposit or Sale of Securities Resulting from Dividends, Splits or Plans of Reorganization If GSK makes a dividend payable at the election of the holders of ordinary shares in either cash or additional ordinary shares that it wishes to be made available to the Holders, GSK shall give notice thereof to the Depositary at least 30 days prior to the proposed distribut ion stating whether or not it wishes such elective distribution to be made available to the Holders. The Depositary shall make such elective distribution ava ilable to the Holders only if, among other things, GSK has timely requested that the elective distribution is available to the Holders and the Depositary shal l have determined that such distribution is reasonably practicable. If the conditions for making the elective distribution available to the Holders are sat isfied, the Depositary will establish procedures to enable the Holders to elect the receipt of either cash or additional ADSs. If the conditions for making the elective distribution available to the Holders are not satisfied, the Depositary will, to the extent permitted by law, distribute either cash or addi tional ADSs to the Holders on the basis of the same determination as is made in the local market in respect of the ordinary shares for which no election is made. There can be no assurance that Holders generally, or any Holder in particular, will be given the opportunity to receive elective distributions on the same terms and conditions as the holders of ordinary shares. To the extent the Depositary deems distribution of securities or property available to the Depositary resulting from any distri bution on deposited securities (other than cash, ordinary shares or Rights) not to be equitable and practicable, the Depositary may distribute any U.S. dollars available to the Depositary from net proceeds of sale of such securities or property. The Depositary may, in its discretion, and shall if reasonably requested by GSK, distribute additional or amended ADRs or cash, securities or property to reflect any change in par value, split-up, consolidation, cancellation or other reclassification of deposited secur ities, any ordinary share distributions or other distributions not distributed to Holders or any cash, securities or property available to the Depositary in respect of deposited securities from (and the Depositary is hereby authorized to surrender any deposited securities to any person and, irrespective of whether such deposited securities are surrendered or otherwise cancelled by operation of law, rule, regulation or otherwise, to sell by public or priv ate sale any property received in connection with) any recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, liquidation, receivership, bankruptcy or sale of all or substantially all the assets of the Company. To the extent the Depositary does not amend ADRs or make a distribution to Holders to reflect any of the foregoing, or the net proceeds thereof, whatever cash, securities or property results from any of the foregoing shall constitute deposited securities and each ADS evidenced by this ADR shall automatically represent its pro rata interest in the deposited securities as then constituted. Promptly upon the occurrence of any of the aforementioned changes affecting deposited securities, GSK shall notify the Depositary in writing of such occurrence and as soo n as practicable after receipt of such notice from GSK, may instruct the Depositary to give notice thereof, at GSK's expense, to Holders in accordance with the provisions hereof. Upon receipt of such instruction, the Depositary shall give notice to the Holders in accordance with the terms thereof, as soon as reasonably practicable. For all cash dividends and other cash distributions that are made available to the Depositary after the date that will be publi shed on www.adr.com (as updated by the Depositary from time to time, \"ADR.com\") and communicated to then current Holders by mail, the D epositary will distribute any cash to Holders solely via electronic funds transfer (\"EFT\"), except as otherwise provided in this paragraph. In order to receive such amounts, Holders must provide their bank deposit details to the Depositary in accordance with the instructions provided by the Depositary for this purpose. Subject to the last sentence of this paragraph, all such amounts owing to Holders who do not provide such bank deposit details shall be held by the Depositary on behalf of such Holders until such bank deposit details have been provided. All amounts so held by the Deposit ary will be reported for tax purposes as if paid to all Holders as of the date that funds are first made available to Holders and will neither accrue in terest nor be invested for Holders while they are being held. A Holder will be unable to receive cash dividends or other cash distributions to which it is entitled until such time as such Holder either (i) provides its bank deposit details to the Depositary in accordance with the instructions provided by theDepositary for this purpose, (ii) transfers such Holder's ADS position into DTC or (iii) cancels its ADSs (whereupon, in the ca se of a transfer to DTC or a cancellation, such Holder will receive a check for the aggregate amount of cash dividends and/or cash distributions being held on its behalf). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Depositary shall, if instructed by GSK, distribute cash dividends and other cash distributio ns by check or by such other means as GSK and the Depositary may agree. Foreign Exchange Related Matters To facilitate the administration of various depositary receipt transactions, including disbursement of dividends or other cash distributions and other corporate actions, the Depositary may engage the foreign exchange desk within JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the \"Bank\") and/ or its affiliates in order to enter into spot foreign exchange transactions to convert foreign currency into U.S. dollars (\"FX Transactions\"). For c ertain currencies, FX Transactions are entered into with the Bank or an affiliate, as the case may be, acting in a principal capacity. For other curr encies, FX Transactions are routed directly to and managed by an unaffiliated local custodian (or other third party local liquidity provider), and neither the Bank nor any of its affiliates is a party to such FX Transactions. The foreign exchange rate applied to an FX Transaction will be either (a) a published benchmark rate, or (b) a rate determined by a third party local liquidity provider, in each case plus or minus a spread, as applicable. The Depositary will disclose which foreign exchan ge rate and spread, if any, apply to such currency on ADR.com. Such applicable foreign exchange rate and spread may (and neither the Depositary, the Bank n or any of their affiliates is under any obligation to ensure that such rate does not) differ from rates and spreads at which comparable transac tions are entered into with other customers or the range of foreign exchange rates and spreads at which the Bank or any of its affiliates enters into forei gn exchange transactions in the relevant currency pair on the date of the FX Transaction. Additionally, the timing of execution of an FX Transaction varies according to local market dynamics, which may include regulatory requirements, market hours and liquidity in the foreign exchange market or other factors . Furthermore, the Bank and its affiliates may manage the associated risks of their position in the market in a manner they deem appropriate without re gard to the impact of such activities on GSK, the Depositary, Holders or Beneficial Owners. The spread applied does not reflect any gains or losses that m ay be earned or incurred by the Bank and its affiliates as a result of risk management or other hedging related activity. To the extent the Company provides U.S. dollars to the Depositary, neither the Bank nor any of its affiliates will execute an F X Transaction. In such case, the Depositary will distribute the U.S. dollars received from the Company. Further details relating to the applicable foreign exchange rate, the applicable spread and the execution of FX Transactions wi ll be provided by the Depositary on ADR.com. The Company, Holders and Beneficial Owners each acknowledge and agree that the terms applicable to F X Transactions disclosed from time to time on ADR.com will apply to any FX Transaction executed pursuant to the Deposit Agreement. Amendment and Termination of the Deposit Agreement The form of ADRs evidencing ADSs and any provisions of the Deposit Agreement relating to those ADRs may be amended by GSK and t he Depositary. Any amendment that imposes or increases any fees or charges, other than taxes and other governmental charges, trans fer or registration fees, transmission costs, delivery costs or other such expenses, or that otherwise prejudices any substantial existing right of the Holders or Beneficial Owners, will not take effect as to any ADRs until 30 days after notice of the amendment has been given to the Holders. Every Ho lder and Beneficial Owner of any ADR, at the time an amendment becomes effective, will be deemed to continue to hold such ADR and to consent and ag ree to the amendment and to be bound by the Deposit Agreement or the ADR as amended. No amendment may impair the right of any Holder to su rrender ADRs and receive in return the deposited securities represented by the ADSs. If any governmental body or regulatory body should adop t new laws, rules or regulations which would require amendment or supplement of the Deposit Agreement or the form of ADR to ensure compliance therew ith, GSK and the Depositary may amend or supplement the Deposit Agreement and the ADR at any time in accordance with such changed laws, rules or regulations. Such amendment or supplement to the Deposit Agreement in such circumstances may become effective before a notice of such amendment o r supplement is given to Holders or within any other period of time as required for compliance. Whenever GSK directs, the Depositary has agreed to terminate the Deposit Agreement as to ADRs evidencing ADSs by mailing a term ination notice to the Holders then outstanding at least 30 days before the date fixed in the notice of termination. The Depositary may likewise terminate the Deposit Agreement as to ADRs evidencing ADSs by mailing a termination notice to GSK and the Holders then outstanding at least 3 0 days before the date of termination, under the following circumstances: (i) in the event of GSK's bankruptcy or insolvency, (ii) if the ordinar y shares cease to be listed on an internationally recognized stock exchange, (iii) if GSK effects (or will effect) a redemption of all or substantially all of the deposited securities, or a cash or share distribution representing a return of all or substantially all of the value of the deposited securities, or (iv) there occurs a merger, consolidation, sale of assets or other transaction as a result of which securities or other property are delivered in exchange for or in lieu of deposited securities, except where such transaction was commenced, announced by GSK or notified to the Depositary prior to the effective date ofthe Deposit Agreement. After the date so fixed for termination, the Depositary and its agents will perform no further acts under the Deposit Agreement and this ADR, except to receive and hold (or sell) distributions on deposited securities and deliver deposited securities being withdrawn. As soon as practicable after the date so fixed for termination, the Depositary shall use its reasonable efforts to sell the deposited securities and shall there after (as long as it may lawfully do so) hold in an account (which may be a segregated or unsegregated account) the net proceeds of such sales, together with any other cash then held by it under the Deposit Agreement, without liability for interest, in trust for the pro rata benefit of the Holders of ADRs not theretofore surrendered. After making such sale, the Depositary shall be discharged from all obligations in respect of the Deposit Agreement and this ADR, exc ept to account for such net proceeds and other cash. After the date so fixed for termination, GSK shall be discharged from all obligations under the De posit Agreement except for its obligations to the Depositary and its agents. Rights of Holders to Inspect the Transfer Books of the Depositary and the List of Holders The Depositary will keep books for the registration and transfer of ADRs as well as facilities for the delivery and receipt of ADRs at the Transfer Office. These books will be open for inspection by Holders at all reasonable times. However, this inspection may not be for the purpose of communicating with Holders in the interest of a business or object other than GSK business or a matter related to the Deposit Agreement or th e ADRs. Restrictions on the Right to Transfer or Withdraw the Underlying Securities As a condition precedent to the issue, registration, registration of transfer, split-up or combination of any ADR, the delivery of any distribution in respect thereof, or the withdrawal of any deposited securities, GSK, the Depositary, or custodian may require payment of a sum sufficient to reimburse it for any tax or other governmental charge and any stock transfer or registration fee with respect thereto (including any such ta x or charge and fee with respect to ordinary shares or other deposited securities being registered) and payment of any applicable fees as therein provid ed, may require the production of proof satisfactory to it as to the identity and genuineness of any signature, as well as such other information, including without limitation, information as to citizenship, residence, exchange control approval, beneficial or other ownership of any securities, complianc e with applicable law, regulations, provisions of or governing deposited securities and terms of the Deposit Agreement and ADR, as it may deem necessa ry or proper, and may also require compliance with any regulations the Depositary may establish consistent with the provisions of the Deposit Agreeme nt. The issuance of ADRs, the acceptance of deposits of ordinary shares, the registration, registration of transfer, split-up or co mbination of ADRs or the withdrawal of deposited securities may be suspended, generally or in particular instances, when the ADR Register or any reg ister for deposited securities is closed or when any such action is deemed advisable by the Depositary or GSK at any time or from time to time.

As used herein, \"business day\" means any day other than a Saturday, a Sunday or a day on which banking institutions in the City of New York or London, England are authorized or obligated by law, regulation or executive order to be closed. We or any of our subsidiaries may at any time and from time to time purchase the Notes in the open market or by tender or by pr ivate agreement, if applicable law allows. The Notes purchased by us or any of our subsidiaries may be held, resold or surrendered by the purchaser thereof through us to the trustee or any paying agent for cancellation. Interest The Notes will bear interest at the interest rate shown in the table above and accrue interest from October 1, 2020, or from th e most recent date to which interest has been paid (or provided for), to but not including the next date upon which interest is required to be pai d. Interest is payable on the Notes twice a year, on April 1 and October 1, commencing April 1, 2021, to the person in whose name a Note is registered at the close of business on the March 17 or September 16 that precedes the date on which interest will be paid. Inte rest on the Notes will be paid on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. If an interest payment date or redemption date, or the maturity date, for the Notes, as the case may be, would fall on a day th at is not a business day, then the required payment will be made on the next succeeding business day, but no additional interest shall be paid unles s we fail to make payment on such next succeeding business day. Covenants Subject to certain exceptions, if we are required to withhold or deduct any amount for or on account of any U.K. or U.S. withho lding tax from any payment made on the Notes, we will pay additional amounts on those payments so that the amount received by noteholders will equ al the amount that would have been received if no such taxes had been applicable. See \"\u2014Payment of Additional Amounts.\" As contemplated by the last paragraph under \"Description of Debt Securities\u2014Defeasance\" below, the satisfaction of certain cond itions will permit us to omit to comply with some or all of our obligations, covenants and agreements under the Indenture with respect to t he Notes. In addition, we may omit to comply with certain covenants through covenant defeasance. We refer you to the information under \"Description of De bt Securities\u2014 Defeasance\" below for more information on how we may do this. Except as described herein, the Indenture does not contain any covenants or other provisions designed to protect holders of the Notes against a reduction in our creditworthiness in the event of a highly leveraged transaction or that would prohibit other transactions that might adversely affect holders of the Notes, including, among other things, through the incurrence of additional indebtedness. Payment of Additional Amounts The provisions of the Indenture described under \"Description of Debt Securities\u2014Covenants\u2014Payment of Additional Amounts\" do not apply to the Notes. The following payment of additional amounts provisions apply to the Notes. Payments made by us under or with respect to the Notes will be free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for or on account of any present or future tax, duty, levy, impost, assessment or other governmental charge of any nature whatsoever imposed or levied b y or on behalf of (i) the government of the United Kingdom or of any territory of the United Kingdom or by any authority or agency therein or thereof hav ing the power to tax or (ii) the government ofthe United States or any state or territory of the United States or by any authority or agency therein or thereof having the po wer to tax, which we refer to collectively as \"Taxes,\" unless we are required to withhold or deduct Taxes by law. If we are required to withhold or deduct any amount for or on account of Taxes from any payment made with respect to the Notes, we will pay such additional amounts as may be necessary so that the net amount received by each holder (including additional amounts) after such withholding or deduction will not be less than the amount the holder would have received if the Taxes had not been withheld or deducted; provi ded that no additional amounts will be payable with respect to Taxes: that would not have been imposed but for the existence of any present or former connection between such holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of, or possessor of a power over, such holder or ben eficial owner, if such holder or beneficial owner is an estate, trust, partnership or corporation) and the United Kingdom or the United States or any political subdivision or territory or possession thereof or therein or area subject to its jurisdiction, including, without limitation, s uch holder or beneficial owner (or such fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member, shareholder or possessor) being or having been a citizen or resident th ereof or treated as a resident thereof or domiciled thereof or a national thereof or being or having been present or engaged in trade or busines s therein or having or having had a permanent establishment therein; that are estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property, wealth or similar taxes, duties, assessments or other governmental charges, payable other than by withholding from payments of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the Notes; that would not have been imposed but for the failure of the applicable recipient of such payment to comply with any certifica tion, identification, information, documentation or other reporting requirement to the extent such compliance is required by applicable law or admini strative practice or an applicable treaty as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in, the rate of deduction or withholding of such Taxes; that would not have been imposed but for the presentation of the Notes (where presentation is required) for payment on a date more than 30 days after the date on which such payment became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof was duly provided for, wh ichever occurred later; that would not have been imposed if presentation for payment of the Notes had been made to a paying agent other than the payi ng agent to which the presentation was made; that are imposed solely by reason of the holder or beneficial owner owning or having owned, actually or constructively, 10% o r more of the total combined voting power of all classes of our stock entitled to vote; that would not have been imposed but for a failure by the holder or beneficial owner (or any financial institution through wh ich the holder or beneficial owner holds any security through which payment on the security is made) to comply with any certification, informatio n, identification, documentation or other reporting requirements (including entering into and complying with an agreement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service) imposed pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code as in effect on the date of i ssuance of the Notes or any successor or amended version of such provisions; or any combination of the foregoing items; nor shall additional amounts be paid with respect to any payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the Not es to any such holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership or a beneficial owner who is other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment to the extent a beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary or a member of such partnership or a beneficial owner would not have been entitled to such additional amounts had it been the holder of such Notes. We have agreed in the Indenture that at least one paying agent for the Notes will be located outside the United Kingdom. Our obligation to pay additional amounts if and when due will survive the termination of the Indenture and the payment of all a mounts in respect of the Notes. Tax Redemption In the event of changes in U.K. or U.S. withholding taxes applicable to payments of interest, we may redeem the Notes in whole (but not in part) at any time prior to maturity, at a price equal to 100% of their principal amount plus accrued interest to the redemption date.

Events of Default The events of default under the Indenture with respect to the Notes are defined under \"Description of Debt Securities\u2014Events of Default\" below. Further Issuances We initially offered the Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $1,250,000,0000. We may from time totime, without the consent of the holders of the Notes, create and issue further debt securities of the same series having the s ame terms and conditions in all respects as the Notes being offered hereby, except for the issue date, the issue price and, in certain cases, the first pay ment of interest thereon. Any such additional debt securities shall be issued under a separate CUSIP or ISIN number unless the additional debt securities are issued pursuant to a \"qualified reopening\" of the original series, are otherwise treated as part of the same \"issue\" of debt instruments as the orig inal series or are issued with no more than a de minimis amount of original discount, in each case for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Book-Entry System We issued the Notes in the form of one or more fully registered global securities. We deposited these global securities with, o r on behalf of, DTC and register these securities in the name of DTC's nominee. Direct and indirect participants in DTC will record beneficial owne rship of the Notes by individual investors. The transfer of ownership of beneficial interests in a global security will be effected only through reco rds maintained by DTC or its nominee, or by participants or persons that hold through participants. Investors may elect to hold beneficial interests in the global securities through either DTC, Clearstream Banking S.A. (\"Clears tream\") or Euroclear Bank SA/NV (\"Euroclear\") if they are participants in these systems, or indirectly through organizations which are par ticipants in these systems. Beneficial interests in the global securities will be held in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. Upon receipt of any payment in respect of a global security, DTC or its nominee will immediately credit participants' accounts with amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in the principal amount of the global security as shown in the records o f DTC or its nominee. Payments by participants to owners of beneficial interests in a global security held through participants will be governed by s tanding instructions and customary practices and will be the responsibility of those participants. DTC holds securities of institutions that have accounts with it or its participants. Through its maintenance of an electronic b ook-entry system, DTC facilitates the clearance and settlement of securities transactions among its participants and eliminates the need to deliv er securities certificates physically. DTC's participants include securities brokers and dealers, including the underwriters of this offering, banks, trus t companies, clearing corporations and other organizations. DTC is partially owned by some of these participants or their representatives. Access to DTC's book-entry system is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relatio nship with a participant, either directly or indirectly. DTC agrees with and represents to its participants that it will administer its book-entry system in accordance with its rules and bylaws and requirements of law. The rules applicable to DTC and its participants are on file with the U.S. Securities and Excha nge Commission's (the \"Commission\"). Clearstream and Euroclear hold interests on behalf of their participants through customers' securities accounts in Clearstream' s and Euroclear's names on the books of their respective depositaries, which in turn will hold interests in customers' securities accounts in the depositaries' names on the books of DTC. At the date of the prospectus supplement, Citibank, N.A. acts as U.S. depositary for Clearstream and JPMorgan Cha se Bank, N.A. acts as U.S. depositary for Euroclear, or, collectively, the \"U.S. Depositaries.\" Clearstream holds securities for its participating organizations, or \"Clearstream Participants,\" and facilitates the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between Clearstream Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of Clearstream Parti cipants, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates. Clearstream provides to Clearstream Participants, among other thing s, services for safekeeping, administration, clearance and settlement of internationally traded securities and securities lending and borrowing . Clearstream interfaces with domestic markets in several countries. Clearstream is registered as a bank in Luxembourg and as such is subject to regulation by the Commission de Surveillance du Sec teur Financier and the Banque Centrale du Luxembourg, which supervise and oversee the activities of Luxembourg banks. Clearstream Pa rticipants are worldwide financial institutions, including underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and clearing c orporations, and may include the underwriters or their affiliates. Indirect access to Clearstream is available to other institutions that clear through or m aintain a custodial relationship with a Clearstream Participant. Clearstream has established an electronic bridge with Euroclear as the operator of the Euroclea r System, or the \"Euroclear Operator,\" in Brussels to facilitate settlement of trades between Clearstream and the Euroclear Operator. Distributions with respect to the Notes held beneficially through Clearstream will be credited to cash accounts of Clearstream Participants in accordance with its rules and procedures, to the extent received by the U.S. Depositary for Clearstream. Euroclear holds securities and book-entry interests in securities for participating organizations, or \"Euroclear Participants\" and facilitates the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between Euroclear Participants, and between Euroclear Participants and part icipants of certain other securities intermediaries through electronic book-entrychanges in accounts of such participants or other securities intermediaries. Euroclear provides Euroclear Participants with, am ong other things, safekeeping, administration, clearance and settlement, securities lending and borrowing, and related services. Euroclear Participants are investment banks, securities brokers and dealers, banks, central banks, supranationals, custodians, investment managers, corporations, trust companies and certain other organizations and may include the underwriters or their affiliates. N on-participants in Euroclear may hold and transfer beneficial interests in a global security through accounts with a Euroclear Participant or any other secu rities intermediary that holds a book-entry interest in a global security through one or more securities intermediaries standing between such other securities intermediary and Euroclear. Distributions with respect to Notes held beneficially through Euroclear will be credited to the cash accounts of Euroclear Part icipants in accordance with the Terms and Conditions, to the extent received by the U.S. Depositary for Euroclear. Transfers between Euroclear Participants and Clearstream Participants will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with t heir respective rules and operating procedures. Cross-market transfers between DTC's participating organizations, or the \"DTC Participants,\" on the one hand, and Euroclear Par ticipants or Clearstream Participants, on the other hand, will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC's rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by its U.S. Depositary; however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and procedures and within the established deadlines (Eu ropean time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instr uctions to its U.S. Depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the global security in DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day fund settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear Participants and Clearstream Partic ipants may not deliver instructions directly to their respective U.S. Depositaries. Due to time zone differences, the securities accounts of a Euroclear Participant or Clearstream Participant purchasing an inter est in a global security from a DTC Participant in DTC will be credited, and any such crediting will be reported, to the relevant Euroclear Par ticipant or Clearstream Participant during the securities settlement processing day (which must be a business day for Euroclear or Clearstream) immedia tely following the settlement date of DTC. Cash received in Euroclear or Clearstream as a result of sales of interests in a global security by or through a Euroclear Participant or Clearstream Participant to a DTC Participant will be received with value on the settlement date of DTC but will be available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account only as of the business day for Euroclear or Clearstream following DTC's settlement date. The information in this section concerning DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream and their book-entry systems has been obtained from s ources that we believe to be reliable, but we take no responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of that information. None of us, any of the underwriters and the trustee will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear or Clear stream or their respective participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations. Although DTC, Clearstream and Euroclear have agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of securities among participants of DTC, Clearstream and Euroclear, they are under no obligations to perform or continue to perform such procedures and they may discontinue the procedures at any time. Same-Day Settlement and Payment Initial settlement for the Notes was made in immediately available funds. Secondary market trading between DTC participants wil l occur in the ordinary way in accordance with DTC rules and will be settled in immediately available funds using DTC's Same-Day Funds Settlem ent System. b.

See \"\u2014Payment of Additional Amounts.\" As contemplated by the last paragraph under \"Description of Debt Securities\u2014Defeasance\" below, the satisfaction of certain cond itions will permit us to omit to comply with some or all of our obligations, covenants and agreements under the GSK Capital Inc.

If we are required to withhold or deduct any amount for or on account of Taxes from any payment made with respect to the Notes, we will pay such additional amounts as may be necessary so that the net amount received by each holder (including additional amounts) after such withholding or deduction will not be less than the amount the holder would have received if the Taxes had not been withheld or deducted; provi ded that no additional amounts will be payable with respect to Taxes: that would not have been imposed but for the existence of any present or former connection between such holder or beneficial owner of the applicable Notes (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of, or possessor of a power over, such ho lder or beneficial owner, if such holder or beneficial owner is an estate, trust, partnership or corporation) and the United Kingdom or the United States or any political subdivision or territory or possession thereof or therein or area subject to its jurisdiction, including, without lim itation, such holder or beneficial owner (or such fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member, shareholder or possessor) being or having been a citizen or resident thereof or treated as a resident thereof or domiciled thereof or a national thereof or being or having been present or engaged in trade or business therein or having or having had a permanent establishment therein; that are estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property, wealth or similar taxes, duties, assessments or othe r governmental charges; payable other than by withholding from payments of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the applicable Notes; that would not have been imposed but for the failure of the applicable recipient of such payment to comply with any certifica tion, identification, information, documentation or other reporting requirement to the extent such compliance is required by applicable law or admini strative practice or an applicable treaty as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in, the rate of deduction or withholding of such Taxe s; that would not have been imposed but for the presentation of the applicable Notes (where presentation is required) for paymen t on a date more than 30 days after the date on which such payment became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof was duly provided for, whichever occurred later; that would not have been imposed if presentation for payment of the applicable Notes had been made to a paying agent other th an the paying agent to which the presentation was made; that are imposed solely by reason of the holder or beneficial owner owning or having owned, actually or constructively, 10% o r more of the total combined voting power of all classes of our stock entitled to vote; that would not have been imposed but for a failure by the holder or beneficial owner (or any financial institution through wh ich the holder or beneficial owner holds any security through which payment on the security is made) to comply with any certification, informatio n, identification, documentation or other reporting requirements (including entering into and complying with an agreement with the U.S. Internal R evenue Service) imposed pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code as in effect on the date of issuance of the ap plicable Notes or any successor or amended version of such provisions; or any combination of the foregoing items; nor shall additional amounts be paid with respect to any payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on any Not es to any such holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership or a beneficial owner who is other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment to the extent a beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary or a member of such partnership or a beneficial owner would not have been entitled to such additional amounts had it been the holder of such Notes. We have agreed in the GSK Capital Inc. Indenture that at least one paying agent for the Notes will be located outside the Unite d Kingdom. Our obligation to pay additional amounts if and when due will survive the termination of the GSK Capital Inc. Indenture and the payment of all amounts in respect of the Notes.

The debt securities will be issued in one or more series under an indenture dated as of March 4, 2008 between GSK and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee (the \"trustee\") (as successor to Law Debenture Trust Company of New York, pursuant to an Instrumen t of Resignation, Appointment and Acceptance dated April 12, 2017 among GSK, the trustee and Law Debenture Trust Company of New York), as supplem ented by a first supplemental indenture dated as of March 21, 2014 between GSK and the trustee (for purposes of this \"Description of Debt Securi ties,\" the \"GSK plc Indenture\"), an indenture dated as of April 6, 2004 among GSK Capital plc, GSK, as guarantor, and the trustee (as successor to Law Debenture Trust Company of New York, pursuant to an Instrument of Resignation, Appointment and Acceptance dated April 12, 2017 among GSK Capita l plc, the guarantor, the trustee and Law Debenture Trust Company of New York), as supplemented by a first supplemental indenture dated as of March 21, 2014 among GSK Capital plc, the guarantor and the trustee (for purposes of this \"Description of Debt Securities,\" the \"GSK Capital p lc Indenture\"), or an indenture dated as of April 6, 2004 among GSK Capital Inc., the guarantor and the trustee (as successor to Law Debenture Trust Company of New York, pursuant to an Instrument of Resignation, Appointment and Acceptance dated April 12, 2017, among GSK Capital Inc., the guaranto r, the trustee and Law Debenture Trust Company of New York), as supplemented by a first supplemental indenture dated as of March 18, 2013 among GSK Ca pital Inc., the guarantor and the trustee and a second supplemental indenture dated as of March 21, 2014 among GSK Capital Inc., the guarantor and the trustee (for purposes of this \"Description of Debt Securities,\" the \"GSK Capital Inc. Indenture\"). Each of the GSK plc Indenture, the GSK Ca pital plc Indenture and the GSK Capital Inc. Indenture has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the \"Trust Indenture Act\"). In the following discussion, we sometimes refer to these indentures collectively as the \"indentures.\" This \"Description of Debt Securities\" briefly outlines the provisions of the indentures and is qualified in its entirety by ref erence to the indentures. The terms of the indentures will include both those stated in the indentures and those made part of the indentures by the Trust Indenture Act. The indentures have been filed as exhibits to the registration statement of which the base prospectus forms a part, and you sho uld read the indentures for provisions that may be important to you. The indentures do not contain any covenants or other provisions designed to protect holders of the debt securities against a re duction in the creditworthiness of GSK or the finance subsidiaries in the event of a highly leveraged transaction or that would prohibit other transactions that might adversely affect holders of the debt securities. Issuances in Series The indentures do not limit the amount of debt securities that may be issued. The debt securities may be issued in one or more series with the same or various maturities, at a price of 100% of their principal amount or at a premium or a discount. Not all debt securities of any one series need be issued at the same time, and, unless otherwise provided, any series may be reopened, without the consents of the holders of deb t securities of that series, for issuances of additional debt securities of that series. Except in the limited circumstances described below under \" \u2014Covenants\u2014Limitation on Liens,\" the debt securities will not be secured by any property or assets of GSK, as issuer or guarantor, or the finance subsid iaries. The terms of any authorized series of debt securities will be described in a prospectus supplement. These terms will include so me or all of the following: the title, aggregate principal amount and denominations of the debt securities; the date or dates on which principal will be payable; the percentage of the principal amount at which the debt securities will be issued and whether the debt securities will be \"o riginal issue discount\" securities for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If original issue discount debt securities are issued (generally, securities t hat are issued at a substantial discount below their principal amount), the special U.S. federal income tax and other considerations of a purchase of original issue discount debt securities will be described; the rate or rates, which may be fixed or variable, at which the debt securities will bear interest; the interest payment dates; any optional or mandatory redemption terms; whether any sinking fund is required; the currency in which the debt securities will be denominated or principal, premium or interest will be payable, if other th an U.S. dollars; whether the debt securities are to be issued as individual certificates to each holder or in the form of global certificates held by a depositary on behalf of beneficial owners; information describing any book-entry features; the names and duties of any co-trustees, depositaries, authenticating agents, paying agents, transfer agents or registrars f or any series; the applicability of the defeasance and covenant defeasance provisions described herein, or any modifications of those provi sions; any deletions from, modifications of or additions to the events of default or covenants with respect to the debt securities; and any other terms, conditions, rights or preferences of the debt securities. Debt securities that have a maturity of less than one year from their date of issue and in respect of which the proceeds are to be received by us in the United Kingdom will have a minimum denomination of \u00a3100,000 (or its equivalent in another currency). The prospectus supplement relating to any series of debt securities may add to or change statements contained in the base prosp ectus. The prospectus supplement may also include, if applicable, a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax and U.K. income tax cons iderations. GSK Guarantees Debt securities issued by the GSK Capital Inc. or GSK Capital plc (the \"finance subsidiaries\") will be fully and unconditionall y guaranteed by GSK. If for any reason the applicable finance subsidiary does not make any required payment in respect of its debt securities w hen due, whether on the normal due date, on acceleration, redemption or otherwise, GSK will cause the payment to be made to or to the order of the trus tee. The holder of a guaranteed debt security will be entitled to payment under the applicable guarantee of GSK without taking any action whatsoever against the finance subsidiary. Payment and Transfer The debt securities will be issued only as registered securities, which means that the name of the holder will be entered in a register that will be kept by the trustee or another agent appointed by us. Unless stated otherwise in a prospectus supplement, and except as describ ed under \"\u2014Book-Entry System\" below, payments of principal, interest and additional amounts, if any, will be made at the office of the paying agent o r agents named in the prospectus supplement or by check mailed to you at your address as it appears in the register. Unless other procedures are described in a prospectus supplement and except as described under \"\u2014Book Entry System\" below, you will be able to transfer registered debt securities at the office of the transfer agent or agents named in the prospectus supplement. Y ou may also exchange registered debt securities at the office of the transfer agent for an equal aggregate principal amount of registered debt secur ities of the same series having the same maturity date, interest rate and other terms as long as the debt securities are issued in authorized denominati ons. Neither we nor the trustee will impose any service charge for any transfer or exchange of a debt security; however, we may ask you to pay any taxes or other governmental charges in connection with a transfer or exchange ofdebt securities. Book-Entry System Debt securities may be issued under a book-entry system in the form of one or more global securities. The global securities wil l be registered in the name of a depositary or its nominee and deposited with that depositary or its custodian. Unless stated otherwise in the pro spectus supplement, The Depository Trust Company, New York, New York, or DTC, will be the depositary if a depositary is used. DTC has advised us as follows: DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a \"banking organization\" within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a \"clearing corporation\" within the meaning of the New York Uniform C ommercial Code and a \"clearing agency\" registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act; DTC was created to hold securities of its participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transacti ons, such as through transfers and pledges, among its participants in such securities through electronic book-entry changes to accounts of its parti cipants, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates; DTC's participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other or ganizations, some of whom (and/or their representatives) own DTC; access to DTC's book-entry system is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a participant, either directly or indirectly; and the DTC rules applicable to its participants are on file with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. According to DTC, the foregoing information with respect to DTC has been provided to the financial community for informational purposes only and is not intended to serve as a representation, warranty or contract modification of any kind. Following the issuance of a global security in registered form, the depositary will credit the accounts of its participants wit h the debt securities upon our instructions. Only persons who hold directly or indirectly through financial institutions that are participants in the depositary can hold beneficial interests in the global securities. Since the laws of some jurisdictions require certain types of purchasers to take physical d elivery of such securities in definitive form, you may encounter difficulties in your ability to own, transfer or pledge beneficial interests in a global sec urity. So long as the depositary or its nominee is the registered owner of a global security, we and the trustee will treat the deposi tary as the sole owner or holder of the debt securities for purposes of the applicable indenture. Therefore, except as set forth below, you will not be entitled to have debt securities registered in your name or to receive physical delivery of certificates representing the debt securities. Accordingl y, you will have to rely on the procedures of the depositary and the participant in the depositary through whom you hold your beneficial interest in order to e xercise any rights of a holder under the indenture. We understand that under existing practices, the depositary would act upon the instructions of a pa rticipant or authorize that participant to take any action that a holder is entitled to take. We will make all payments of principal, interest and additional amounts, if any, on the debt securities to the depositary. It i s expected that the depositary will then credit participants' accounts proportionately with these payments on the payment date and that the partici pants will in turn credit their customers' accounts in accordance with their customary practices. Neither we nor the trustee will be responsible for making any payments to participants or customers of participants or for maintaining any records relating to the holdings of or payments to participants and their c ustomers, and you will have to rely on the procedures of the depositary and its participants. Global securities are generally not transferable. Physical certificates will be issued to beneficial owners in lieu of a global security only in the special situations described in the sixth paragraph under the heading \"Legal Ownership of Debt Securities\u2014Global Securities\" be low. Consolidation, Merger or Sale We and the finance subsidiaries have agreed in the indentures not to consolidate with or merge with or into any other person or convey or transfer all or substantially all of our respective properties and assets to any person (except that the finance subsidiaries m ay merge into us), unless: we or the applicable finance subsidiary, as the case may be, are the continuing person, or the successor expressly assumes by supplemental indenture our obligations under the applicable indenture; the continuing person is a U.S. or U.K. company or is organized and validly existing under the laws of a jurisdiction that is a member country of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (or any successor) and, if i t is not a U.S. or U.K. company, the continuing person agrees by supplemental indenture to be bound by a covenant comparable to that described bel ow under \"\u2014Covenants\u2014 Payment of Additional Amounts\" with respect to taxes imposed in the continuing person's jurisdiction of organizati on (in which case the continuing person will benefit from a redemption option comparable to that described below under \"\u2014Optional Redemption for Tax Reasons\" in the event of changes in taxes in that jurisdiction after the date of the consolidation, merger or sale); immediately after the transaction, no default under the debt securities has occurred and is continuing; and we deliver to the trustee an officer's certificate and, if neither we nor the applicable subsidiary are the continuing person , an opinion of counsel, in each case stating, among other things, that the transaction and the supplemental indenture, if required, comply with these p rovisions and the indenture. Covenants Payment of Additional Amounts Payments made by us under or with respect to the debt securities will be free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for or on account of any present or future tax, duty, levy, impost, assessment or other governmental charge of any nature whatsoever imposed or l evied by or on behalf of the government of the United Kingdom or of any territory of the United Kingdom or by any authority or agency therein or thereof having the power to tax or (ii) solely with respect to debt securities issued under the GSK Capital Inc. Indenture, the government of the United States or any state or territory of the United States or by any authority or agency therein or thereof having the power to tax, which we refer to collectively as \"Taxe s,\" unless we are required to withhold or deduct Taxes by law. If we are required to withhold or deduct any amount for or on account of Taxes from any payment made with respect to the debt s ecurities, we will pay such additional amounts as may be necessary so that the net amount received by each holder (including additional amoun ts) after such withholding or deduction will not be less than the amount the holder would have received if the Taxes had not been withheld or deducted; provided that no additional amounts will be payable with respect to Taxes: that would not have been imposed but for the existence of any present or former connection between such holder or beneficial owner of the debt securities (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of, or possessor of a power over, such holder o r beneficial owner, if such holder or beneficial owner is an estate, trust, partnership or corporation) and the United Kingdom or, solely with respect to debt securities issued under the GSK Capital Inc. Indenture, the United States or, as applicable, any political subdivision or territory or pos session thereof or therein or area subject to its jurisdiction, including, without limitation, such holder or beneficial owner (or such fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member, shareholder or possessor) being or having been a citizen or resident thereof or treated as a resident thereof or domici led thereof or a national thereof or being or having been present or engaged in trade or business therein or having or having had a permanent es tablishment therein; that are estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property, wealth or similar taxes, duties, assessments or othe r governmental charges; payable other than by withholding from payments of principal of or interest on the debt securities; that would not have been imposed but for the failure of the applicable recipient of such payment to comply with any certifica tion, identification, information, documentation or other reporting requirement to the extent such compliance is required by applicable law or admini strative practice or an applicable treaty as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in, the rate of deduction or withholding of such Taxe s; that would not have been imposed but for the presentation of a debt security (where presentation is required) for payment on a date more than 30 days after the date on which such payment became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof was duly provided for, whichever occurred later; that are imposed on a payment to an individual and are required to be made pursuant to European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any other Directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting of November 26-27, 2000 on the taxation of savings income, or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such Directive; that would not have been imposed if presentation for payment of the relevant debt securities had been made to a paying agent other than the paying agent to which the presentation was made; that would not have been imposed but for a failure by the holder or beneficial owner (or any financial institution through wh ich the holder or beneficial owner holds any debt security through which payment on the debt security is made) to comply with any certification, information, identification, documentation or other reporting requirements (including entering into and complying with an agreement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or any other governmental authority) imposed pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Intern al Revenue Code as in effect on the date of issuance of the Notes or any successor or amended version of such provisions, or any agreement entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, or any fiscal or regulatory legislation, rules or practices adop ted pursuant to any intergovernmental agreement entered into in connection with the implementation of such Sections of the U.S. Internal Revenue Co de (or any law implementing such intergovernmental agreement); solely with respect to debt securities issued under the GSK Capital Inc. Indenture, that are imposed solely by reason of the holder or beneficial owner owning or having owned, actually or constructively, 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of the Company's stock entitled to vote; or any combination of the foregoing items; nor shall additional amounts be paid with respect to any payment of the principal of or interest on any debt security to any su ch holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership or a beneficial owner who is other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment to the extent a beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary or a member of such partnership or a beneficial owner would not have been entitled to such additional amounts ha d it been the holder of the debt security. We have agreed in each indenture that at least one paying agent for each series of debt securities will be located outside the United Kingdom. We have also agreed that if we maintain a paying agent with respect to a particular series of debt securities in any member sta te of the European Union, we will maintain a paying agent in at least one member state (other than the United Kingdom) that will not be obliged to withho ld or deduct taxes pursuant to any law implementing European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any other Directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting of November 26-27, 2000 on the taxation of savings income, provided there is at least one member state that does not require a pay ing agent to withhold or deduct pursuant to such Directive. Our obligation to pay additional amounts if and when due will survive the termination of the indentures and the payment of all amounts in respect of the debt securities. Limitation on Liens We have agreed in the indentures not to incur or assume (or permit any of our subsidiaries to incur or assume) any lien on or w ith respect to any of our or our subsidiaries' property, assets or revenues, present or future, to secure any relevant indebtedness (as this term is defined below) without making (or causing our subsidiaries to make) effective provision for securing the debt securities equally and ratably with such relevant indebtedness as to such property, assets or revenues, for as long as such relevant indebtedness is so secured. The restrictions on liens will not apply to: liens arising by operation of law; liens on property, assets or revenues of any person, which liens are existing at the time such person becomes a subsidiary; and liens on property, assets or revenues of a person existing at the time such person is merged with or into or consolidated wit h us or any of our subsidiaries or at the time of a sale, lease or other disposition to us of the properties of a person as an entirety or substan tially as an entirety. For purposes of the limitation on liens covenant, the term \"relevant indebtedness\" means any of our debt that: is in the form of or represented by bonds, notes, loan stock, depositary receipts or other securities issued (otherwise than to constitute or by banks or other lending institutions); is denominated in, or confers any right of payment by reference to, any currency other than the currency of the country in wh ich the issuer of the indebtedness has its principal place of business, or is denominated in or by reference to the currency of such country but more than 20% of which is placed or offered for subscription or sale by or on behalf of, or by agreement with, the issuer outside such country; and at its date of issue is, or is intended by the issuer to become, quoted, listed, traded or dealt in on any stock exchange, ov er-the-counter market or other securities market. Additional Covenants We may be subject to additional covenants, including restrictive covenants in respect of a particular series of debt securities . Such additional covenants will be set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement and, to the extent necessary, in the supplemental indenture or board resolution relating to that series of debt securities.Optional Redemption for Tax Reasons We may redeem any series of debt securities in whole but not in part at any time, on giving not less than 30 nor more than 60 d ays' notice of such redemption, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount plus accrued interest, if any, to the date fixed for redemption (except in the case of discounted debt securities, which may be redeemed at the redemption price specified by the terms of each series of such debt se curities), if: we determine that, as a result of any change in or amendment to the laws or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder of the United Kingdom (or of any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof) or, solely with respect to debt securities issued under t he GSK Capital Inc. Indenture, the United States (or of any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof), or any change in the application or official interpretation of such laws, regulations or rulings, or any change in the application or official interpretation of, or any execution of or amend ment to, any treaty or treaties affecting taxation to which any such jurisdiction is a party, which change, execution or amendment becomes effective o n or after the issue date or such other date specified in the debt securities of that series: we would be required to pay additional amounts (as described under \"\u2014Covenants--Payment of Additional Amounts\" above) with re spect to that series of debt securities on the next succeeding interest payment date and the payment of such additional amounts canno t be avoided by the use of reasonable measures available to us; or withholding tax has been or would be required to be withheld with respect to interest income received or receivable by the ap plicable finance subsidiary directly from the guarantor (or any affiliate) and such withholding tax obligation cannot be avoided by the use of reasonable measures available to the applicable finance subsidiary or the guarantor (or any affiliate); or we determine, based upon an opinion of independent counsel of recognized standing that, as a result of any action taken by an y legislative body of, taxing authority of, or any action brought in a court of competent jurisdiction in, the United Kingdom (or any political su bdivision or taxing authority thereof) or, solely with respect to debt securities issued under the GSK Capital Inc. Indenture, the United States (o r any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof) (whether or not such action was taken or brought with respect to GSK, as issuer or gua rantor, or the applicable finance subsidiary, as the case may be), which action is taken or brought on or after the issue date or such other d ate specified in the debt securities of that series, there is a substantial probability that the circumstances described above would exist; provided , however, that such notice of redemption may be given earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which we would be obligated to pay such ad ditional amounts. We will also pay to each holder, or make available for payment to each such holder, on the redemption date any additional amoun ts resulting from the payment of such redemption price. Prior to the publication of any notice of redemption, we will deliver to the trustee : an officer's certificate stating that we are entitled to effect a redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing t hat the conditions precedent of the right so to redeem have occurred; or an opinion of counsel to the effect that the conditions specified above have been satisfied. Any notice of redemption will be irrevocable once we deliver the officer's certificate to the trustee. Events of Default Unless otherwise specified in a prospectus supplement, an event of default with respect to a series of debt securities occurs u pon: default in payment of the principal (or premium, if any) of any debt security of that series when due (including as a sinking fund installment), and, in the case of technical or administrative difficulties, the continuance of that default for more than two business days; default in payment of interest on, or any additional amounts payable in respect of, any debt security of that series when due and payable, and the continuance of that default for 30 days; default in performing any other covenant in the indenture applicable to that series for 90 days after the receipt of written notice specifying such default from the trustee or from the holders of 25% in principal amount of the debt securities of that series; default under any bond, debenture, note or other evidence of indebtedness for money borrowed of GSK or either finance subsidi ary, as the case may be (not including any indebtedness for which recourse is limited to property purchased), having in any particular case an o utstanding principal amount in excess of \u00a3100,000,000 (or its equivalent in any other currency) where any such failure results in such ind ebtedness being accelerated and becoming due and payable prior to its stated maturity and such acceleration shall not have been rescinded or annulled or such indebtedness shall not have been discharged; provided that there shall not be deeme d to be an Event of Default if such acceleration is rescinded or annulled or such payment is made within 10 days after there has been give n to GSK and either finance subsidiary by the trustee or to either finance subsidiary, GSK and the trustee by the holders of 25% or more in aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of such series a written notice specifying such default and requiring it to be remedied and stati ng that such notice is a \"Notice of Default\" hereunder; certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of GSK or either finance subsidiary, as the case may be; any other event of default provided with respect to that particular series of debt securities. Any additional or different events of default applicable to a particular series of debt securities will be described in the pro spectus supplement relating to such series. An event of default with respect to a particular series of debt securities will not necessarily constitute an event of default with respect to any other series of debt securities. The trustee may withhold notice to the holders of debt securities of any default (except in the payment of principal, premium o r interest) if it, in good faith considers such withholding of notice to be in the best interests of the holders. A default is any event which is an event of default described above or would be an event of default but for the giving of notice or the passage of time. If an event of default occurs and continues, the trustee or the holders of the aggregate principal amount of the debt securitie s specified below may require us to repay immediately, or accelerate: the entire principal of the debt securities of such series; or if the debt securities are original issue discount securities, such portion of the principal as may be described in the appli cable prospectus supplement. If the event of default occurs because of a default in a payment of principal or interest on the debt securities of any series, then the trustee or the holders of at least 25% of the aggregate principal amount of debt securities of that series can accelerate that series of debt securities. If the event of default occurs because of a failure to perform any other covenant in the applicable indenture or any covenant for the benefit o f one or more, but not all, of the series of debt securities, then the trustee or the holders of at least 25% of the aggregate principal amount of debt securi ties of all series affected, voting as one class, can accelerate all of the affected series of debt securities. If the event of default occurs because of ba nkruptcy proceedings, then all of the debt securities under the indenture will be accelerated automatically. Therefore, except in the case of a default on a p ayment of principal or interest on the debt securities of your series or a default due to our bankruptcy or insolvency, it is possible that you may not be able to accelerate the debt securities of your series because of the failure of holders of other series to take action. The holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of all affected series, voting as one class, can rescind this accelerated payment requirement or waive any past default or event of default or allow noncompliance with any provision of the applicable indenture. However, they cannot waive a default in payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any of the debt securities whe n due otherwise than as a result of acceleration. After an event of default, the trustee must exercise the same degree of care a prudent person would exercise under the circumst ances in the conduct of her or his own affairs. Subject to these requirements, the trustee is not obligated to exercise any of its rights or powers under the applicable indenture at the request, order or direction of any holders, unless the holders offer the trustee indemnity satisfactory to it. If they provide this indemnity, the holders of a majority in principal amount of all affected series of debt securities, voting as one class, may direct the ti me, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee, or exercising any power conferred upon the trustee, for any series of debt securities. However, the trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the indenture or is unduly prejudicial to th e rights of other holders. No holder will be entitled to pursue any remedy with respect to the indenture unless the trustee fails to act for 60 days after it is given: notice of default by that holder; a written request to enforce the indenture by the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of all outstanding debt se curities of any affected series; and an indemnity to the trustee, reasonably satisfactory to the trustee; and during this 60-day period the holders of a majority in principal amount of all outstanding debt securities of suchaffected series do not give a direction to the trustee that is inconsistent with the enforcement request. These provisions will not prevent any holder of debt securities from enforcing payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the debt securities at the relevant due dates. If an event of default with respect to a series of debt securities occurs and is continuing, the trustee will mail to the holde rs of those debt securities a notice of the event of default within 90 days after it occurs. However, except in the case of a default in any pay ment in respect of a series of debt securities, the trustee shall be protected in withholding notice of an event of default if it determines in good faith tha t this is in the interests of the holders of the relevant debt securities. Modification of the Indentures In general, rights and obligations of us and the holders under the indentures may be modified if the holders of a majority in a ggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of each series affected by the modification consent to such modification. However, ea ch of the indentures provides that, unless each affected holder agrees, an amendment cannot: make any adverse change to any payment term of a debt security such as extending the maturity date, extending the date on whi ch we have to pay interest or make a sinking fund payment, reducing the interest rate, reducing the amount of principal we have to repay, cha nging the currency in which we have to make any payment of principal, premium or interest, modifying any redemption or repurchase right, or right to convert or exchange any debt security, to the detriment of the holder and impairing any right of a holder to bring suit for pay ment; waive any payment default; reduce the percentage of the aggregate principal amount of debt securities needed to make any amendment to the applicable ind enture or to waive any covenant or default; or make any other change to the amendment provisions of the applicable indenture. However, if we and the trustee agree, the applicable indenture may be amended without notifying any holders or seeking their co nsent if the amendment does not materially and adversely affect any holder. We and the trustee are permitted to make modifications and amend ments to the applicable indenture without the consent of any holder of debt securities for any of the following purposes: to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency in the indenture; to comply with sections of the indenture governing when we may merge and substitute obligors; to comply with any requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the qualification of the in denture under the Trust Indenture Act; to evidence and provide for the acceptance by a successor trustee of appointment under the indenture with respect to the debt securities of any or all series; to establish the form or forms or terms of the debt securities of any series or of the coupons appertaining to such debt secu rities as permitted under the indenture; to provide for uncertificated debt securities and to make all appropriate changes for such purpose; to provide for a further guarantee from a third party on outstanding debt securities of any series and the debt securities of any series that may be issued under the indenture; to change or eliminate any provision of the indenture; provided that any such change or elimination will become effective onl y when there are no outstanding debt securities of any series created prior to the execution of such supplemental indenture that is entitled to the benefit of such provision; to supplement any of the provisions of the indenture to such extent as will be necessary to permit or facilitate the defeasan ce and discharge of any series of debt securities pursuant to the indenture; provided that any such action will not adversely affect the interests of the holders of such or any other series of debt securities in any material respect; or to make any change that does not materially and adversely affect the rights of any holder of the debt securities. Defeasance The term defeasance means discharge from some or all of the obligations under the indentures. If we deposit with the trustee su fficient cash or government securities to pay the principal, interest, any premium and any other sumsdue to the stated maturity date or a redemption date of the debt securities of a particular series, then at our option: we will be discharged from our respective obligations with respect to the debt securities of such series; or we will no longer be under any obligation to comply with the restrictive covenants, if any, contained in the applicable inden ture and any supplemental indenture or board resolution with respect to the debt securities of such series, and the events of default relati ng to failures to comply with covenants will no longer apply to us. If this happens, the holders of the debt securities of the affected series will not be entitled to the benefits of the applicab le indenture except for registration of transfer and exchange of debt securities and replacement of lost, stolen or mutilated debt securities. Instead, the holders will only be able to rely on the deposited funds or obligations for payment. We must deliver to the trustee an opinion of counsel to the effect that the deposit and related defeasance would not cause the holders of the debt securities to recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We may, in lieu of an opinion of counse l, deliver a ruling to such effect received from or published by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. Substitution of Issuer We may at our option at any time, without the consent of any holders of debt securities, cause GSK or any other subsidiary of G SK to assume the obligations of the applicable finance subsidiary under any series of debt securities, provided that the new obligor executes a supplemental indenture in which it agrees to be bound by the terms of those debt securities and the relevant indenture. If the new obligor is not a U. S. or U.K. company, it must be organized and validly existing under the laws of a jurisdiction that is a member country of the Organisation for Economic Coope ration and Development (or any successor) and it must also agree in the supplemental indenture to be bound by a covenant comparable to that described above under \"\u2014 Covenants\u2014 Payment of Additional Amounts\" with respect to taxes imposed in its jurisdiction of organization (in which case the new obligor will benefit from a redemption option comparable to that described above under \"\u2014Optional Redemption for Tax Reasons\" in the event of changes in ta xes in that jurisdiction after the date of the substitution). In the case of such a substitution, the applicable finance subsidiary will be relieved of any further obligation under the assumed series of debt securities. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, a substitution of obligors as described above generally would be treated as a deemed taxa ble exchange of debt securities for new debt securities issued by the new obligor. As discussed further in the applicable prospectus supplem ent, a United States person who holds debt securities or owns a beneficial interest therein generally will recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equa l to the difference between the issue price of the new debt securities and such person's adjusted tax basis in the debt securities. Such persons should con sult their own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of a deemed taxable exchange in the event of a substitution of obligors. Information Concerning the Trustee Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, 60 Wall Street, 16th Floor, New York, NY 10005, will be the trustee. The trustee will be required to perform only those duties that are specifically set forth in the indentures, except when a default has occurred and is continui ng with respect to the debt securities. After a default, the trustee must exercise the same degree of care that a prudent person would exercise under the ci rcumstances in the conduct of her or his own affairs. Subject to these requirements, the trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of th e powers vested in it by the indentures at the request of any holder of debt securities unless the holder offers the trustee indemnity satisfactory to it ag ainst the costs, expenses and liabilities that might be incurred by exercising those powers. Governing Law The debt securities, the related guarantees and the indentures will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. Legal Ownership of Debt Securities \"Street Name\" and Other Indirect Holders We generally will not recognize investors who hold debt securities in accounts at banks or brokers as legal holders of those de bt securities. Holding securities in accounts at banks or brokers is called holding in \"street name.\" If an investor holds debt securities in street name, we recognize only the bank or broker or the financial institution the bank or broker uses to holdthe debt securities. These intermediary banks, brokers and other financial institutions pass along principal, interest and othe r payments on the debt securities, either because they agree to do so in their customer agreements or because they are legally required to do so. If y ou hold debt securities in street name, you should check with your own institution to find out: how it handles payments and notices with respect to securities; whether it imposes fees or charges; how it would handle voting if ever required; how and when you should notify it to exercise on your behalf any rights or options that may exist under the debt securities; whether and how you can instruct it to send you securities registered in your own name so you can be a direct holder as desc ribed below; and how it would pursue rights under the debt securities if there were a default or other event triggering the need for holders t o act to protect their interests. Registered Holders Our obligations, as well as the obligations of the trustee and those of any third parties employed by us or the trustee, extend only to persons who are registered as holders of debt securities. As noted above, we do not have obligations directly to you if you hold in street name or through other indirect means, either because you choose to hold debt securities in that manner or because the debt securities are issued in the form o f global securities as described below. For example, once we make payment to the registered holder, we have no further responsibility for the payment even if that holder is legally required to pass the payment along to you but does not do so. Global Securities A global security is a special type of indirectly held security. If we choose to issue debt securities in the form of global se curities, the ultimate beneficial owners of the debt securities will be indirect holders. We do this by requiring that the global security be register ed in the name of a financial institution we select and by requiring that the debt securities represented by the global security not be registered in the nam e of any other holder except in the special situations described below. The financial institution that acts as the sole registered holder of the global securit y is called the depositary. Any person wishing to own a debt security may do so indirectly through an account with a broker, bank or other financial institutio n that in turn has an account with the depositary. The prospectus supplement will indicate whether your series of debt securities will be issued only as glob al securities. Transfers of debt securities represented by the global security will be made only on the records of the depositary or its nomin ee by transferring such debt securities from the account of one broker, bank or financial institution to the account of another broker, bank or fi nancial institution. These transfers are made electronically only and are also known as book-entry transfers. Securities in global form are sometimes also referred to as being in book-entry form. As an indirect holder, your rights relating to a global security will be governed by the account rules of your broker, bank or financial institution and of the depositary, as well as general laws relating to securities transfers. We will not recognize you as a holder of debt secu rities and instead will deal only with the depositary that holds the global security. You should be aware that if debt securities are issued only in the form of a global security: except in very limited circumstances described below, you will not have any right to have debt securities registered in your own name; you cannot receive physical certificates for your interest in the debt securities; you will be a street name holder and must look to your own broker, bank or financial institution for payments on the debt sec urities and protection of your legal rights relating to the debt securities; you may not be able to sell interests in the debt securities to some insurance companies and other institutions that are requ ired by law to own securities in the form of physical certificates; the depositary's policies will govern payments, transfers, exchanges and other matters relating to your indirect interest in the global security. We and the trustee will have no responsibility for any aspect of the depositary's actions or for its records of ownership interest s in the global security. We and the trustee also will not supervise the depositary in any way; and the depositary will require that indirect interests in the global security be purchased or sold within its system using same- day funds for settlement.In a few special circumstances described below, the global security will terminate and the indirect interests in it will be exc hanged for registered debt securities represented by physical certificates. After that exchange, the choice of whether to hold debt securities in reg istered form or in street name will be up to you. You must consult your broker, bank or financial institution to find out how to have your interests in debt s ecurities transferred to your name, so that you will be a registered holder of the debt securities. Unless we specify otherwise in the prospectus supplement, the special circumstances for termination of a global security are: when the depositary notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary and we do not or cannot appoint a su ccessor depositary within 90 days; the depositary ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act and we do not appoint a successor depositary within 90 days; an event of default has occurred and is continuing and beneficial owners representing a majority in principal amount of the a pplicable series of debt securities have advised the depositary to cease acting as the depositary; or we decide we do not want to have the debt securities of that series represented by a global security. The prospectus supplement may also list additional circumstances for terminating a global security that would apply only to the particular series of debt securities covered by the prospectus supplement. When a global security terminates, the depositary (and not us or the t rustee) is responsible for deciding the names of the institutions that will be the initial registered holders. The Term \"Holder\" In the descriptions of the debt securities included herein, when we refer to the \"holder\" of a given debt security as being ent itled to certain rights or payments, or being permitted to take certain actions, we are in all cases referring to the registered holder of the debt sec urity. While you would be the registered holder if you held a certificated security registered in your name, it is likely that the hol der will actually be either the broker, bank or other financial institutions where you have your street name account, or, in the case of a global se curity, the depositary. If you are an indirect holder, you will need to coordinate with the institution through which you hold your interest in a debt securit y in order to determine how the provisions involving holders described in the descriptions of the debt securities included herein will actually apply to you. F or example, if the debt security in which you hold a beneficial interest in street name can be repaid at the option of the holder, you cannot exercise the optio n yourself by following the procedures described in the prospectus supplement. Instead, you would need to cause the institution through which you hold your interest to take those actions on your behalf. Your institution may have procedures and deadlines different from or additional to those described in t he prospectus supplement relating to the debt security. 2. Notes offered pursuant to the Base Prospectus dated March 4, 2011 a. Prospectus Supplement (March 13, 2013) -4.200% Notes due 2043 Description of the Notes General We issued the 4.200% Notes due 2043 pursuant to an indenture, dated April 6, 2004, among GSK, as guarantor, GSK Capital Inc., a s issuer, and Law Debenture Trust Company of New York, the trustee for the notes (as successor to Citibank, N.A., pursuant to an Instrume nt of Resignation, Appointment and Acceptance dated December 27, 2007 among GSK Capital Inc., GSK, Law Debenture Trust Company of New York and Cit ibank, N.A.), as supplemented by a first supplemental indenture thereto dated March 18, 2013 (for purposes of this description of the notes o nly, the \"indenture\"). References in this \"Description of the Notes\" to the \"notes\" refer to the 4.200% Notes due 2043. The notes are each a series of our debt securities. GSK Capital Inc. issued the notes in the aggregate principal amount of $500,000,000. The notes will mature on March 18, 2043 unless redeemed or repurchased prior to such date as permitted below. GSK Capital Inc. issued the notes only in book-entry form, in minimum denomi nations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. The notes each bear interest at the applicable interest rate shown in the table above and accrue interest from March 18, 2013, or from the most recent date to which interest has been paid (or provided for), to but not including thenext date upon which interest is required to be paid. Interest is payable on the notes twice a year, on March 18 and September 18, commencing September 18, 2013, to the person in wh ose name a note is registered at the close of business on the March 3 or September 3 that precedes the date on which interest will be paid . Interest on the notes is paid on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. \"Business day\" means any day other than a Saturday, a S unday or a day on which banking institutions in the City of New York or London, England are authorized or obligated by law, regulation or executi ve order to be closed. If an interest payment date or redemption date, or the maturity date, for the notes, as the case may be, would fall on a day th at is not a business day, then the interest payment date or redemption date, or the maturity date, as the case may be, will be postponed to the next succeeding business day, but no additional interest shall be paid unless we fail to make payment on such next succeeding business day. The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by GSK. If, for any reason, GSK Capital Inc. does not make any required paym ent in respect of the notes when due, whether on the normal due date, on acceleration, redemption or otherwise, GSK will cause the payment to be made to or to the order of the trustee. You will be entitled to payment under the guarantee of GSK without taking any action whatsoever against u s. Covenants Subject to certain exceptions, if we are required to withhold or deduct any amount for or on account of any U.K. or U.S. withho lding tax from any payment made on the notes, we will pay additional amounts on those payments so that the amount received by noteholders will equ al the amount that would have been received if no such taxes had been applicable. See \"\u2014Payment of Additional Amounts.\" As contemplated by the last paragraph under \"Description of Debt Securities\u2014Defeasance\" below, the satisfaction of certain cond itions will permit us to omit to comply with some or all of our obligations, covenants and agreements under the indenture with respect to t he notes. In addition, we may omit to comply with certain covenants through covenant defeasance. We refer you to the information under \"Description of De bt Securities\u2014 Defeasance\" below for more information on how we may do this. Except as described herein, the indenture for the notes does not contain any covenants or other provisions designed to protect holders of the notes against a reduction in our creditworthiness in the event of a highly leveraged transaction or that would prohibit other t ransactions that might adversely affect holders of the notes, including, among other things, through the incurrence of additional indebtedness. Payment of Additional Amounts The provisions of the indenture described under \"Description of Debt Securities\u2014Covenants\u2014Payment of Additional Amounts\" below do not apply to the notes. The following payment of additional amounts provisions apply to the notes. Payments made by us under or with respect to the notes will be free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for or on account of any present or future tax, duty, levy, impost, assessment or other governmental charge of any nature whatsoever imposed or levied b y or on behalf of (i) the government of the United Kingdom or of any territory of the United Kingdom or by any authority or agency therein or thereof hav ing the power to tax or (ii) the government of the United States or any state or territory of the United States or by any authority or agency therein o r thereof having the power to tax, which we refer to collectively as \"Taxes,\" unless we are required to withhold or deduct Taxes by law. If we are required to withhold or deduct any amount for or on account of Taxes from any payment made with respect to the notes, we will pay such additional amounts as may be necessary so that the net amount received by each holder (including additional amounts) after such withholding or deduction will not be less than the amount the holder would have received if the Taxes had not been withheld or deducted; provi ded that no additional amounts will be payable with respect to Taxes: that would not have been imposed but for the existence of any present or former connection between such holder or beneficial owner of the notes (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of, or possessor of a power over, such holder or ben eficial owner, if such holder or beneficial owner is an estate, trust, partnership or corporation) and the United Kingdom or the United States or any political subdivision or territory or possession thereof or therein or area subject to its jurisdiction, including, without limitation, s uch holder or beneficial owner (or such fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member, shareholder or possessor) being or having been a citizen or resident th ereof or treated as a resident thereof or domiciled thereof or a national thereof or being or having been present or engaged in trade or busines s therein or having or having had a permanent establishment therein; that are estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property, wealth or similar taxes, duties, assessments or other governmental charges; payable other than by withholding from payments of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the notes; that would not have been imposed but for the failure of the applicable recipient of such payment to comply with any certifica tion, identification, information, documentation or other reporting requirement to the extent such compliance is required by applicable law or admini strative practice or an applicable treaty as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in, the rate of deduction or withholding of such Taxe s; that would not have been imposed but for the presentation of notes (where presentation is required) for payment on a date mor e than 30 days after the date on which such payment became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof was duly provided for, whichev er occurred later; that are imposed on a payment to an individual and are required to be made pursuant to European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any other Directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting of November 26-27, 2000 on the taxation of savings income, or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such Directive; that would not have been imposed if presentation for payment of the relevant notes had been made to a paying agent other than the paying agent to which the presentation was made; that are imposed solely by reason of the holder or beneficial owner owning or having owned, actually or constructively, 10% o r more of the total combined voting power of all classes of our stock entitled to vote; that would not have been imposed but for a failure by the holder or beneficial owner (or any financial institution through wh ich the holder or beneficial owner holds any Security through which payment on the security is made) to comply with any certification, informatio n, identification, documentation or other reporting requirements (including entering into and complying with an agreement with the U.S. Internal R evenue Service) imposed pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code as in effect on the date of issuance of the No tes or any successor or amended version of such provisions; or any combination of the foregoing items; nor shall additional amounts be paid with respect to any payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on any not es to any such holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership or a beneficial owner who is other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment to the extent a beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary or a member of such partnership or a beneficial owner would not have been entitled to such additional amounts had it been the holder of notes. We have agreed in the indenture that at least one paying agent for the notes will be located outside the United Kingdom. We hav e also agreed that if we maintain a paying agent with respect to the notes in any member state of the European Union, we will maintain a payi ng agent in at least one member state that will not be obliged to withhold or deduct taxes pursuant to any law implementing European Council Directive 2 003/48/EC or any other Directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting of November 26-27, 2000 on the taxation of savings income, provided there is at least one member state that does not require a paying agent to withhold or deduct pursuant to such Directive. Our obligation to pay additional amounts if and when due will survive the termination of the indenture and the payment of all a mounts in respect of the notes. Optional Make-Whole Redemption We may redeem the notes, in whole or in part, at our option at any time and from time to time at a redemption price equal to th e greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed on that redemption date; and (ii) as determined by the quotation agent (as defined below), the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the notes being redeemed on that red emption date (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption), discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate, plus 0.175%, plus accrued and unpaid interes t thereon to, but excluding, the date of redemption. Notwithstanding the foregoing, installments of interest on notes to be redeemed that are due and payable on an interest payment date falling on or prior to a redemption date will be payable on the interest payment date to the registered h olders as of the close of business on the relevant record date according to the notes and the indenture. \"Comparable Treasury Issue\" means the United States Treasury security selected by the quotation agent as having a maturity comp arable to the remaining term (as measured from the date of redemption) of the notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of sel ection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining t erm of such notes.\"Comparable Treasury Price\" means, with respect to any redemption date, (i) the average of four Reference Treasury Dealer Quota tions (as defined below) for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or ( ii) if the quotation agent for the notes obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations, or (iii) i f only one Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation is received, the quotation. \"Quotation agent\" means any Reference Treasury Dealer appointed by us.\"Reference Treasury Dealer\" means (i) each of Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Goldman, Sachs & Co., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC a nd UBS Securities LLC (or their respective affiliates that are Primary Treasury Dealers) and their respective successors; provided, ho wever, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. government securities dealer in the United States (a \"Primary Treasury Dealer\"), we will substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer, and (ii) any other Primary Treasury Dealer selected by us. \"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations\" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the avera ge, as determined by us, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the quotation agent by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third busin ess day preceding such redemption date. \"Treasury Rate\" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to mat urity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amoun t) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for that redemption date. Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each registere d holder of the notes to be redeemed by us or by the trustee on our behalf. Notice of redemption will be published in a daily newspaper of gene ral circulation in the United States, and we will give notice of any such redemption to any exchange on which such notes are listed. On and after any redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the notes or portions thereof called for redemption. On or before the redemption date, we will deposit with a paying agent (or the trustee) money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued interest on the notes to be redeemed on that date. If less than all of the notes are to be redeemed, the notes to be redeemed shall be selected by lot by The Depository Trust Company (\"DTC\"), in the case of notes re presented by a global security, or by the trustee by such method as the trustee deems to be fair and appropriate, in the case of notes that are not r epresented by a global security. Events of Default The definitions of an event of default with respect to a series of debt securities under \"Description of Debt Securities\u2014Events of Default\" below do not apply to the notes. The following are events of default under the indenture with respect to the notes of a series: default in payment of the principal of (or premium, if any, on) any such note when due, and, in the case of technical or admi nistrative difficulties, the continuance of that default for more than two business days; default in payment of interest on, or any additional amounts payable in respect of, any such note when due and payable, and t he continuance of that default for 30 days; default in performing any other covenant in the indenture applicable to any such note for 90 days after the receipt of writte n notice specifying such default from the trustee or from the holders of 25% in principal amount of such notes; default under any bond, debenture, note or other evidence of indebtedness for money borrowed of GSK or GSK Capital Inc. (not including any indebtedness for which recourse is limited to property purchased), having in any particular case an aggregate outstanding princ ipal amount in excess of \u00a3100,000,000 (or its equivalent in any other currency) whether such indebtedness now exists or shall hereafter be cre ated, which default results in such indebtedness becoming or being accelerated and declared due and payable prior to its stated maturity an d such acceleration shall not have been rescinded or annulled or such indebtedness shall not have been discharged; provided that there shall not be deemed to be an event of default if such acceleration is rescinded or annulled or such payment is made within 10 days after the receipt of written notice specifying such default from the trustee or from the holders of 25% in principal amount of such notes; and certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of GSK or GSK Capital Inc. Because the applicable threshold amount of indebtedness the acceleration of which would give rise to an event of default under the indenture is lower, and the number of days that must pass before the ongoing default in theperformance of any covenant under the indenture other than the payment of principal, interest or additional amounts that would give rise to an event of default under the indenture is lower, for each series of debt securities issued under the indenture before the date of the firs t supplemental indenture, the acceleration of outstanding indebtedness of GSK or GSK Capital Inc. or the ongoing default in the performance of any covenant i n the indenture other than payment of principal, premium, interest or additional amounts may constitute an event of default with respect to one or mo re of such previously issued series, but may not constitute an event of default under the respective terms of the notes offered by the prospectus sup plement. Further Issuances We initially offered the notes in the aggregate principal amount of $500,000,000. We may from time to time, without the consent of the holders of a series of notes, create and issue further notes of the same series having the same terms and conditions in all respects as th e applicable notes being offered hereby, except for the issue date, the issue price and the first payment of interest thereon. We will not issue any fur ther notes unless such further notes have no more than a de minimis amount of original issue discount or such issuance would constitute a \"qualified reopening\" for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Additional notes issued in this matter will be consolidated with and will form a single series with the notes bei ng offered hereby. Book-Entry System We issued the notes of each series in the form of one or more fully registered global securities. We deposited these global sec urities with, or on behalf of, DTC and register these securities in the name of DTC's nominee. Direct and indirect participants in DTC will record beneficial ownership of the notes by individual investors. The transfer of ownership of beneficial interests in a global security will be effected only thr ough records maintained by DTC or its nominee, or by participants or persons that hold through participants. Investors may elect to hold beneficial interests in the global securities through either DTC, Clearstream Banking S.A. (\"Clears tream\") or Euroclear Bank SA/NV (\"Euroclear\") if they are participants in these systems, or indirectly through organizations which are par ticipants in these systems. Beneficial interests in the global securities will be held in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. Upon receipt of any payment in respect of a global security, DTC or its nominee will immediately credit participants' accounts with amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in the principal amount of the global security as shown in the records o f DTC or its nominee. Payments by participants to owners of beneficial interests in a global security held through participants will be governed by s tanding instructions and customary practices and will be the responsibility of those participants. DTC holds securities of institutions that have accounts with it or its participants. Through its maintenance of an electronic b ook-entry system, DTC facilitates the clearance and settlement of securities transactions among its participants and eliminates the need to deliv er securities certificates physically. DTC's participants include securities brokers and dealers, including the underwriters of this offering, banks, trus t companies, clearing corporations and other organizations. DTC is partially owned by some of these participants or their representatives. Access to DTC's book-entry system is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relatio nship with a participant, either directly or indirectly. DTC agrees with and represents to its participants that it will administer its book-entry system in accordance with its rules and bylaws and requirements of law. The rules applicable to DTC and its participants are on file with the U.S. Securities and Excha nge Commission. Clearstream and Euroclear hold interests on behalf of their participants through customers' securities accounts in Clearstream' s and Euroclear's names on the books of their respective depositaries, which in turn will hold interests in customers' securities accounts in the depositaries' names on the books of DTC. At the date of the prospectus supplement, Citibank, N.A. acts as U.S. depositary for Clearstream and JPMorgan Cha se Bank, N.A. acts as U.S. depositary for Euroclear, or, collectively, the \"U.S. Depositaries.\" Clearstream holds securities for its participating organizations, or \"Clearstream Participants,\" and facilitates the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between Clearstream Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of Clearstream Parti cipants, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates. Clearstream provides to Clearstream Participants, among other thing s, services for safekeeping, administration, clearance and settlement of internationally traded securities and securities lending and borrowing . Clearstream interfaces with domestic markets in several countries. Clearstream is registered as a bank in Luxembourg and as such is subject to regulation by the Commission de Surveillance du Sec teur Financier and the Banque Centrale du Luxembourg, which supervise and oversee the activities of Luxembourg banks. Clearstream Pa rticipants are worldwide financial institutions, including underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and clearing c orporations, and may include the underwriters or their affiliates. Indirect access to Clearstream is available to other institutions that clear through or m aintain a custodial relationship with a Clearstream Participant. Clearstream has established an electronic bridge with Euroclear as theoperator of the Euroclear system, or the \"Euroclear Operator,\" in Brussels to facilitate settlement of trades between Clearstre am and the Euroclear Operator. Distributions with respect to the notes of a series held beneficially through Clearstream will be credited to cash accounts of Clearstream Participants in accordance with its rules and procedures, to the extent received by the U.S. Depositary for Clearstream. Euroclear holds securities and book-entry interests in securities for participating organizations, or \"Euroclear Participants\" and facilitates the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between Euroclear Participants, and between Euroclear Participants and part icipants of certain other securities intermediaries through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of such participants or other securities intermedia ries. Euroclear provides Euroclear Participants with, among other things, safekeeping, administration, clearance and settlement, securities lending and borrowing, and related services. Euroclear Participants are investment banks, securities brokers and dealers, banks, central banks, supranationals, custodians, investment managers, corporations, trust companies and certain other organizations and may include the underwriters or their affiliates. N on-participants in Euroclear may hold and transfer beneficial interests in a global security through accounts with a Euroclear Participant or any other secu rities intermediary that holds a book-entry interest in a global security through one or more securities intermediaries standing between such other securities intermediary and Euroclear. Distributions with respect to notes of a series held beneficially through Euroclear will be credited to the cash accounts of Eu roclear Participants in accordance with the Terms and Conditions, to the extent received by the U.S. Depositary for Euroclear. Transfers between Euroclear Participants and Clearstream Participants will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with t heir respective rules and operating procedures. Cross-market transfers between DTC's participating organizations, or the \"DTC Participants,\" on the one hand, and Euroclear Par ticipants or Clearstream Participants, on the other hand, will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC's rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by its U.S. Depositary; however, such cross- market transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclea r or Clearstream, as the case may be, by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and procedures and within the established deadline s (European time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its U.S. Depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the global security in DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day fund settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear Participants and Clearst ream Participants may not deliver instructions directly to their respective U.S. Depositaries. Due to time zone differences, the securities accounts of a Euroclear Participant or Clearstream Participant purchasing an inter est in a global security from a DTC Participant in DTC will be credited, and any such crediting will be reported, to the relevant Euroclear Par ticipant or Clearstream Participant during the securities settlement processing day (which must be a business day for Euroclear or Clearstream) immedia tely following the settlement date of DTC. Cash received in Euroclear or Clearstream as a result of sales of interests in a global security by or through a Euroclear Participant or Clearstream Participant to a DTC Participant will be received with value on the settlement date of DTC but will be available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account only as of the business day for Euroclear or Clearstream following DTC's settlement date. The information in this section concerning DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream and their book-entry systems has been obtained from s ources that we believe to be reliable, but we take no responsibility for the accuracy of that information. None of us, any of the underwriters and the trustee will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear or Clear stream or their respective participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations. Although DTC, Clearstream and Euroclear have agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of securities among participants of DTC, Clearstream and Euroclear, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures and they may discontinue the procedures at any time.

Secondary market trading between DTC participants wil l occur in the ordinary way in accordance with DTC rules and will be settled in immediately available funds using DTC's Same-Day Funds Settlem ent System.b. Base Prosp ectus - March 4, 2011 Description of Debt Securities General As used in this \"Description of Debt Securities,\" \"debt securities\" means the debentures, notes, bonds, guarantees and other ev idences of indebtedness that GSK issues or that GSK Capital Inc. or GSK Capital plc (the \"finance subsidiaries\") issues and GSK fully and unconditionally guarantees and, in each case, the trustee authenticates and delivers under the applicable indenture. The debt securities will b e our direct unsecured obligations and will rank equally and ratably without preference among themselves and at least equally with all of our other un secured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The debt securities will be issued in one or more series under an indenture between GSK and Law Debenture Trust Company of New York, as trustee, or under indentures among the finance subsidiaries, Law Debenture Trust Company of New York, as trustee (as successor to Citibank, N.A., pursuant to Instruments of Resignation, Appointment and Acceptance among the finance subsidiaries, the guarantor, Law Debenture Trust Company of New York and Citibank, N.A.), and GSK, as guarantor. The indentures applicable to GSK, GSK Capital Inc. and GSK Capital plc wil l each be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, or the Trust Indenture Act. In the following discussion, we sometimes refer to these indentures collectively as the \"indentures.\" This \"Description of Debt Securities\" briefly outlines the provisions of the indentures and is qualified in its entirety by ref erence to the indentures. The terms of the indentures will include both those stated in the indentures and those made part of the indentures by the Trust Indenture Act. The forms of the indentures have been filed as exhibits to the registration statement of which the base prospectus forms a part, and you sho uld read the indentures for provisions that may be important to you. The indentures do not contain any covenants or other provisions designed to protect holders of the debt securities against a re duction in the creditworthiness of GSK or the finance subsidiaries in the event of a highly leveraged transaction or that would prohibit other transactions that might adversely affect holders of the debt securities. Issuances in Series The indentures do not limit the amount of debt securities that may be issued. The debt securities may be issued in one or more series with the same or various maturities, at a price of 100% of their principal amount or at a premium or a discount. Not all debt securities of any one series need be issued at the same time, and, unless otherwise provided, any series may be reopened, without the consents of the holders of deb t securities of that series, for issuances of additional debt securities of that series. Except in the limited circumstances described below under \" \u2014 Covenants \u2014 Limitation on Liens,\" the debt securities will not be secured by any property or assets of GSK, as issuer or guarantor, or the finance subsid iaries. The terms of any authorized series of debt securities will be described in a prospectus supplement. These terms will include so me or all of the following: the title, aggregate principal amount and denominations of the debt securities; the date or dates on which principal will be payable; the percentage of the principal amount at which the debt securities will be issued and whether the debt securities will be \"o riginal issue discount\" securities for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If original issue discount debt securities are issued (generally, securities t hat are issued at a substantial discount below their principal amount), the special U.S. federal income tax and other considerations of a purchase of original issue discount debt securities will be described; the rate or rates, which may be fixed or variable, at which the debt securities will bear interest; the interest payment dates; any optional or mandatory redemption terms; whether any sinking fund is required; the currency in which the debt securities will be denominated or principal, premium or interest will be payable, if other th an U.S. dollars; whether the debt securities are to be issued as individual certificates to each holder or in the form of global certificates held by a depositary on behalf of beneficial owners; information describing any book-entry features; the names and duties of any co-trustees, depositaries, authenticating agents, paying agents, transfer agents or registrars f or any series; the applicability of the defeasance and covenant defeasance provisions described herein, or any modifications of those provi sions; any deletions from, modifications of or additions to the events of default or covenants with respect to the debt securities; and any other terms, conditions, rights or preferences of the debt securities. Debt securities that have a maturity of less than one year from their date of issue and in respect of which the proceeds are to be received by us in the United Kingdom will have a minimum denomination of \u00a3100,000 (or its equivalent in another currency). The prospectus supplement relating to any series of debt securities may add to or change statements contained in the base prosp ectus. The prospectus supplement may also include, if applicable, a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax and U.K. income tax cons iderations. GSK Guarantees Debt securities issued by the finance subsidiaries will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by GSK. If for any reason the a pplicable finance subsidiary does not make any required payment in respect of its debt securities when due, whether on the normal due date, on ac celeration, redemption or otherwise, GSK will cause the payment to be made to or to the order of the trustee. The holder of a guaranteed debt security will be entitled to payment under the applicable guarantee of GSK without taking any action whatsoever against the finance subsidiary. Payment and Transfer The debt securities will be issued only as registered securities, which means that the name of the holder will be entered in a register that will be kept by the trustee or another agent appointed by us. Unless stated otherwise in a prospectus supplement, and except as describ ed under \"\u2014 Book-Entry System\" below, payments of principal, interest and additional amounts, if any, will be made at the office of the paying agent o r agents named in the prospectus supplement or by check mailed to you at your address as it appears in the register. Unless other procedures are described in a prospectus supplement and except as described under \"\u2014 Book Entry System\" below, you will be able to transfer registered debt securities at the office of the transfer agent or agents named in the prospectus supplement. Y ou may also exchange registered debt securities at the office of the transfer agent for an equal aggregate principal amount of registered debt secur ities of the same series having the same maturity date, interest rate and other terms as long as the debt securities are issued in authorized denominati ons. Neither we nor the trustee will impose any service charge for any transfer or exchange of a debt security; however, we may ask you to pay any taxes or other governmental charges in connection with a transfer or exchange of debt securities. Book-Entry System Debt securities may be issued under a book-entry system in the form of one or more global securities. The global securities wil l be registered in the name of a depositary or its nominee and deposited with that depositary or its custodian. Unless stated otherwise in the pro spectus supplement, The Depository Trust Company, New York, New York, or DTC, will be the depositary if a depositary is used. DTC has advised us as follows: DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a \"banking organization\" within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a \"clearing corporation\" within the meaning of the New York Uniform C ommercial Code and a \"clearing agency\" registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act; DTC was created to hold securities of its participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transacti ons, such as through transfers and pledges, among its participants in such securities through electronic book-entry changes to accounts of its parti cipants, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates; DTC's participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other or ganizations, some of whom (and/or their representatives) own DTC; access to DTC's book-entry system is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a participant, either directly or indirectly; and the DTC rules applicable to its participants are on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. According to DTC, the foregoing information with respect to DTC has been provided to the financial community for informational purposes only and is not intended to serve as a representation, warranty or contract modification of any kind. Following the issuance of a global security in registered form, the depositary will credit the accounts of its participants wit h the debt securities upon our instructions. Only persons who hold directly or indirectly through financial institutions that are participants in the depositary can hold beneficial interests in the global securities. Since the laws of some jurisdictions require certain types of purchasers to take physical d elivery of such securities in definitive form, you may encounter difficulties in your ability to own, transfer or pledge beneficial interests in a global sec urity. So long as the depositary or its nominee is the registered owner of a global security, we and the trustee will treat the deposi tary as the sole owner or holder of the debt securities for purposes of the applicable indenture. Therefore, except as set forth below, you will not be entitled to have debt securities registered in your name or to receive physical delivery of certificates representing the debt securities. Accordingl y, you will have to rely on the procedures of the depositary and the participant in the depositary through whom you hold your beneficial interest in order to e xercise any rights of a holder under the indenture. We understand that under existing practices, the depositary would act upon the instructions of a pa rticipant or authorize that participant to take any action that a holder is entitled to take. We will make all payments of principal, interest and additional amounts, if any, on the debt securities to the depositary. It i s expected that the depositary will then credit participants' accounts proportionately with these payments on the payment date and that the partici pants will in turn credit their customers' accounts in accordance with their customary practices. Neither we nor the trustee will be responsible for making any payments to participants or customers of participants or for maintaining any records relating to the holdings of participants and their customers, and y ou will have to rely on the procedures of the depositary and its participants. Global securities are generally not transferable. Physical certificates will be issued to beneficial owners in lieu of a global security only in the special situations described in the sixth paragraph under the heading \"Legal Ownership of Debt Securities \u2014 Global Securities\" below. Consolidation, Merger or Sale We and the finance subsidiaries have agreed in the indentures not to consolidate with or merge with or into any other person or convey or transfer all or substantially all of our respective properties and assets to any person (except that the finance subsidiaries m ay merge into us), unless: we or the applicable finance subsidiary, as the case may be, are the continuing person, or the successor expressly assumes by supplemental indenture our obligations under the applicable indenture; the continuing person is a U.S. or U.K. company or is organized and validly existing under the laws of a jurisdiction that is a member country of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (or any successor) and, if it is not a U.S. or U.K. company, the cont inuing person agrees by supplemental indenture to be bound by a covenant comparable to that described below under \"\u2014 Covenants \u2014 Payment of A dditional Amounts\" with respect to taxes imposed in the continuing person's jurisdiction of organization (in which case the continuing pe rson will benefit from a redemption option comparable to that described below under \"\u2014 Optional Redemption for Tax Reasons\" in the event of chang es in taxes in that jurisdiction after the date of the consolidation, merger or sale); immediately after the transaction, no default under the debt securities has occurred and is continuing; and we deliver to the trustee an officer's certificate and, if neither we nor the applicable subsidiary are the continuing person , an opinion of counsel, in each case stating, among other things, that the transaction and the supplemental indenture, if required, comply with these p rovisions and the indenture. Covenants Payment of Additional Amounts Payments made by us under or with respect to the debt securities will be free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for or on account of any present or future tax, duty, levy, impost, assessment or other governmental charge of any nature whatsoever imposed or l evied by or on behalf of the government of the United Kingdom or of any territory of the United Kingdom or by any authority or agency therein or thereof having the power to tax or (ii) the government of the United States or any state or territory of the United States or by any authority or agencytherein or thereof having the power to tax, which we refer to collectively as \"Taxes,\" unless we are required to withhold or de duct Taxes by law. If we are required to withhold or deduct any amount for or on account of Taxes from any payment made with respect to the debt s ecurities, we will pay such additional amounts as may be necessary so that the net amount received by each holder (including additional amoun ts) after such withholding or deduction will not be less than the amount the holder would have received if the Taxes had not been withheld or deducted; provided that no additional amounts will be payable with respect to Taxes: that would not have been imposed but for the existence of any present or former connection between such holder or beneficial ow ner of the debt securities (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of, or possessor of a power over, such holder o r beneficial owner, if such holder or beneficial owner is an estate, trust, partnership or corporation) and the United Kingdom or the United States or any political subdivision or territory or possession thereof or therein or area subject to its jurisdiction, including, without limitation, such holder or b eneficial owner (or such fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member, shareholder or possessor) being or having been a citizen or resident thereof or treated as a resi dent thereof or domiciled thereof or a national thereof or being or having been present or engaged in trade or business therein or having or having had a permanent establishment therein; that are estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property, wealth or similar taxes, duties, assessments or othe r governmental charges; payable other than by withholding from payments of principal of or interest on the debt securities; that would not have been imposed but for the failure of the applicable recipient of such payment to comply with any certifica tion, identification, information, documentation or other reporting requirement to the extent: such compliance is required by applicable law or administrative practice or an applicable treaty as a precondition to exempti on from, or reduction in, the rate of deduction or withholding of such Taxes; and at least 30 days before the first payment date with respect to which such additional amounts shall be payable, we have notifi ed such recipient in writing that such recipient is required to comply with such requirement; that would not have been imposed but for the presentation of a debt security (where presentation is required) for payment on a date more than 30 days after the date on which such payment became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof was duly provided for, whichever occurred later; that are imposed on a payment to an individual and are required to be made pursuant to European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any other Directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting of November 26-27, 2000 on the taxation of savings income, or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such Directive; that would not have been imposed if presentation for payment of the relevant debt securities had been made to a paying agent other than the paying agent to which the presentation was made; or any combination of the foregoing items; nor shall additional amounts be paid with respect to any payment of the principal of or interest on any debt security to any su ch holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership or a beneficial owner who is other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment to the extent a beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary or a member of such partnership or a beneficial owner would not have been entitled to such additional amounts ha d it been the holder of the debt security. We have agreed in each indenture that at least one paying agent for each series of debt securities will be located outside the United Kingdom. We have also agreed that if we maintain a paying agent with respect to a particular series of debt securities in any member sta te of the European Union, we will maintain a paying agent in at least one member state (other than the United Kingdom) that will not be obliged to withho ld or deduct taxes pursuant to any law implementing European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any other Directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting of November 26-27, 2000 on the taxation of savings income, provided there is at least one member state that does not require a pay ing agent to withhold or deduct pursuant to such Directive. Our obligation to pay additional amounts if and when due will survive the termination of the indentures and the payment of all amounts in respect of the debt securities. Limitation on Liens We have agreed in the indentures not to incur or assume (or permit any of our subsidiaries to incur or assume) any lien on or w ith respect to any of our or our subsidiaries' property, assets or revenues, present or future, to secureany relevant indebtedness (as this term is defined below) without making (or causing our subsidiaries to make) effective provis ion for securing the debt securities equally and ratably with such relevant indebtedness as to such property, assets or revenues, for as long as such rel evant indebtedness is so secured. The restrictions on liens will not apply to: liens arising by operation of law; liens on property, assets or revenues of any person, which liens are existing at the time such person becomes a subsidiary; and liens on property, assets or revenues of a person existing at the time such person is merged with or into or consolidated wit h us or any of our subsidiaries or at the time of a sale, lease or other disposition to us of the properties of a person as an entirety or substan tially as an entirety. For purposes of the limitation on liens covenant, the term \"relevant indebtedness\" means any of our debt that: is in the form of or represented by bonds, notes, loan stock, depositary receipts or other securities issued (otherwise than to constitute or represent advances made by banks or other lending institutions); is denominated in, or confers any right of payment by reference to, any currency other than the currency of the country in wh ich the issuer of the indebtedness has its principal place of business, or is denominated in or by reference to the currency of such country but more than 20% of which is placed or offered for subscription or sale by or on behalf of, or by agreement with, the issuer outside such country; and at its date of issue is, or is intended by the issuer to become, quoted, listed, traded or dealt in on any stock exchange, ov er-the-counter market or other securities market. Additional Covenants We may be subject to additional covenants, including restrictive covenants in respect of a particular series of debt securities . Such additional covenants will be set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement and, to the extent necessary, in the supplemental indenture or board resolution relating to that series of debt securities. Optional Redemption for Tax Reasons We may redeem any series of debt securities in whole but not in part at any time, on giving not less than 30 nor more than 60 d ays' notice of such redemption, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount plus accrued interest, if any, to the date fixed for redem ption (except in the case of discounted debt securities, which may be redeemed at the redemption price specified by the terms of each series of such debt se curities), if: we determine that, as a result of any change in or amendment to the laws or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder of the United Kingdom (or of any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof) or the United States (or of any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof), or any change in the application or official interpretation of such laws, regulations or rulings, or any change in the applicat ion or official interpretation of, or any execution of or amendment to, any treaty or treaties affecting taxation to which any such jurisdictio n is a party, which change, execution or amendment becomes effective on or after the issue date or such other date specified in the debt securities of that series: we would be required to pay additional amounts (as described under \"\u2014 Covenants \u2014 Payment of Additional Amounts\" above) with respect to that series of debt securities on the next succeeding interest payment date and the payment of such additional amoun ts cannot be avoided by the use of reasonable measures available to us; or withholding tax has been or would be required to be withheld with respect to interest income received or receivable by the ap plicable finance subsidiary directly from the guarantor (or any affiliate) and such withholding tax obligation cannot be avoided by the use of reasonable measures available to the applicable finance subsidiary or the guarantor (or any affiliate); or we determine, based upon an opinion of independent counsel of recognized standing that, as a result of any action taken by an y legislative body of, taxing authority of, or any action brought in a court of competent jurisdiction in, the United Kingdom (or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof) or the United States (or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof) (wheth er or not such action was taken or brought with respect to GSK, as issuer or guarantor, or the applicable finance subsidiary, as the case may be), which action is taken or brought on or after the issue date or such other date specified in the debt securities of that series, there is a substantial probability that the circumstances described above would exist; provided, however, that no such notice of redemption may be given earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which we would be obligated to pay such additional amounts. We will also pay to each holder, or make available for payment to each such holder, on the redemption date any additional amoun ts resulting from the payment of such redemption price. Prior to the publication of any notice of redemption, we will deliver to the trustee : an officer's certificate stating that we are entitled to effect a redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing t hat the conditions precedent of the right so to redeem have occurred; or an opinion of counsel to the effect that the conditions specified above have been satisfied. Any notice of redemption will be irrevocable once we deliver the officer's certificate to the trustee. Events of Default Unless otherwise specified in a prospectus supplement, an event of default with respect to a series of debt securities occurs u pon: default in payment of the principal (or premium, if any) of any debt security of that series when due (including as a sinking fund installment), and, in the case of technical or administrative difficulties, the continuance of that default for more than two business days; default in payment of interest on, or any additional amounts payable in respect of, any debt security of that series when due and payable, and the continuance of that default for 30 days; default in performing any other covenant in the indenture applicable to that series for 60 days after the receipt of written notice specifying such default from the trustee or from the holders of 25% in principal amount of the debt securities of that series; default under any bond, debenture, note or other evidence of indebtedness for money borrowed of GSK or either finance subsidi ary, as the case may be (not including any indebtedness for which recourse is limited to property purchased), having in any particular case an o utstanding principal amount in excess of $25,000,000 (or its equivalent in any other currency) where any such failure results in such inde btedness being accelerated and becoming due and payable prior to its stated maturity and such acceleration shall not have been rescinded or an nulled or such indebtedness shall not have been discharged; certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of GSK or either finance subsidiary, as the case may be; any other event of default provided with respect to that particular series of debt securities. Any additional or different events of default applicable to a particular series of debt securities will be described in the pro spectus supplement relating to such series. An event of default with respect to a particular series of debt securities will not necessarily constitute an event of default with respect to any other series of debt securities. The trustee may withhold notice to the holders of debt securities of any default (except in the payment of principal, premium o r interest) if it, in good faith, considers such withholding of notice to be in the best interests of the holders. A default is any event which is an event of default described above or would be an event of default but for the giving of notice or the passage of time. If an event of default occurs and continues, the trustee or the holders of the aggregate principal amount of the debt securitie s specified below may require us to repay immediately, or accelerate: the entire principal of the debt securities of such series; or if the debt securities are original issue discount securities, such portion of the principal as may be described in the appli cable prospectus supplement. If the event of default occurs because of a default in a payment of principal or interest on the debt securities of any series, then the trustee or the holders of at least 25% of the aggregate principal amount of debt securities of that series can accelerate that series of debt securities. If the event of default occurs because of a failure to perform any other covenant in the applicable indenture or any covenant for the benefit o f one or more, but not all, of the series of debt securities, then the trustee or the holders of at least 25% of the aggregate principal amount of debt securi ties of all series affected, voting as one class, can accelerate all of the affected series of debt securities. If the event of default occurs because of ba nkruptcy proceedings, then all of the debt securities under the indenture will be accelerated automatically. Therefore, except in the case of a default on a p ayment of principal or interest on the debt securities of your series or a default due to our bankruptcy or insolvency, it is possible that you may not be able to accelerate the debt securities ofyour series because of the failure of holders of other series to take action. The holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of all affected series, voting as one class, can rescind this accelerated payment requirement or waive any past default or event of default or allow noncompliance with any provision of the applicable indenture. However, they cannot waive a default in payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any of the debt securities whe n due otherwise than as a result of acceleration. After an event of default, the trustee must exercise the same degree of care a prudent person would exercise under the circumst ances in the conduct of her or his own affairs. Subject to these requirements, the trustee is not obligated to exercise any of its rights or powers under the applicable indenture at the request, order or direction of any holders, unless the holders offer the trustee reasonable indemnity. If they provide this reasonable indemnity, the holders of a majority in principal amount of all affected series of debt securities, voting as one class, may di rect the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee, or exercising any power conferred upon the trustee, for a ny series of debt securities. However, the trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the indenture or is unduly preju dicial to the rights of other holders. No holder will be entitled to pursue any remedy with respect to the indenture unless the trustee fails to act for 60 days after it is given: notice of default by that holder; a written request to enforce the indenture by the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of all outstanding debt se curities of any affected series; and an indemnity to the trustee, satisfactory to the trustee; and during this 60-day period the holders of a majority in principal amount of all outstanding debt securities of such affected series do not give a direction to the trustee that is inconsistent with the enforcement request. These provisions will not prevent any holder of debt securiti es from enforcing payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the debt securities at the relevant due dates. If an event of default with respect to a series of debt securities occurs and is continuing, the trustee will mail to the holde rs of those debt securities a notice of the event of default within 90 days after it occurs. However, except in the case of a default in any pay ment in respect of a series of debt securities, the trustee shall be protected in withholding notice of an event of default if it determines in good faith tha t this is in the interests of the holders of the relevant debt securities. Modification of the Indentures In general, rights and obligations of us and the holders under the indentures may be modified if the holders of a majority in a ggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of each series affected by the modification consent to such modification. However, ea ch of the indentures provides that, unless each affected holder agrees, an amendment cannot: make any adverse change to any payment term of a debt security such as extending the maturity date, extending the date on whi ch we have to pay interest or make a sinking fund payment, reducing the interest rate, reducing the amount of principal we have to repay, cha nging the currency in which we have to make any payment of principal, premium or interest, modifying any redemption or repurchase right, or right to convert or exchange any debt security, to the detriment of the holder and impairing any right of a holder to bring suit for pay ment; waive any payment default; reduce the percentage of the aggregate principal amount of debt securities needed to make any amendment to the applicable ind enture or to waive any covenant or default; or make any other change to the amendment provisions of the applicable indenture. However, if we and the trustee agree, the applicable indenture may be amended without notifying any holders or seeking their co nsent if the amendment does not materially and adversely affect any holder. We and the trustee are permitted to make modifications and amend ments to the applicable indenture without the consent of any holder of debt securities for any of the following purposes: to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency in the indenture; to comply with sections of the indenture governing when we may merge and substitute obligors; to comply with any requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the qualification of the in denture under the Trust Indenture Act; to evidence and provide for the acceptance by a successor trustee of appointment under the indenture with respect to the debt securities of any or all series; to establish the form or forms or terms of the debt securities of any series or of the coupons appertaining to such debt secu rities as permitted under the indenture; to provide for uncertificated debt securities and to make all appropriate changes for such purpose; to provide for a further guarantee from a third party on outstanding debt securities of any series and the debt securities of any series that may be issued under the indenture; to change or eliminate any provision of the indenture; provided that any such change or elimination will become effective onl y when there are no outstanding debt securities of any series created prior to the execution of such supplemental indenture that is entitled to the benefit of such provision; to supplement any of the provisions of the indenture to such extent as will be necessary to permit or facilitate the defeasan ce and discharge of any series of debt securities pursuant to the indenture; provided that any such action will not adversely affect the interests of the holders of such or any other series of debt securities in any material respect; or to make any change that does not materially and adversely affect the rights of any holder of the debt securities. Defeasance The term defeasance means discharge from some or all of the obligations under the indentures. If we deposit with the trustee su fficient cash or government securities to pay the principal, interest, any premium and any other sums due to the stated maturity date or a redem ption date of the debt securities of a particular series, then at our option: we will be discharged from our respective obligations with respect to the debt securities of such series; or we will no longer be under any obligation to comply with the restrictive covenants, if any, contained in the applicable inden ture and any supplemental indenture or board resolution with respect to the debt securities of such series, and the events of default relati ng to failures to comply with covenants will no longer apply to us. If this happens, the holders of the debt securities of the affected series will not be entitled to the benefits of the applicab le indenture except for registration of transfer and exchange of debt securities and replacement of lost, stolen or mutilated debt securities. Instead, the holders will only be able to rely on the deposited funds or obligations for payment. We must deliver to the trustee an opinion of counsel to the effect that the deposit and related defeasance would not cause the holders of the debt securities to recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We may, in lieu of an opinion of counse l, deliver a ruling to such effect received from or published by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. Substitution of Issuer We may at our option at any time, without the consent of any holders of debt securities, cause GSK or any other subsidiary of G SK to assume the obligations of the applicable finance subsidiary under any series of debt securities, provided that the new obligor execute s a supplemental indenture in which it agrees to be bound by the terms of those debt securities and the relevant indenture. If the new obligor is not a U. S. or U.K. company, it must be organized and validly existing under the laws of a jurisdiction that is a member country of the Organisation for Economic Coope ration and Development (or any successor) and it must also agree in the supplemental indenture to be bound by a covenant comparable to that described above under \"\u2014 Covenants \u2014 Payment of Additional Amounts\" with respect to taxes imposed in its jurisdiction of organization (in which case the new obligor will benefit from a redemption option comparable to that described above under \"\u2014 Optional Redemption for Tax Reasons\" in the event of chang es in taxes in that jurisdiction after the date of the substitution). In the case of such substitution, the applicable finance subsidiary will be r elieved of any further obligation under the assumed series of debt securities. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, a substitution of obligors as described above generally would be treated as a deemed taxa ble exchange of debt securities for new debt securities issued by the new obligor. As discussed further in the applicable prospectus supplem ent, a United States person who holds debt securities or owns a beneficial interest therein generally will recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equa l to the difference between the issue price of the new debt securities and such person's adjusted tax basis in the debt securities. Such persons should con sult their own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of a deemed taxable exchange in the event of a substitution of obligors. Information Concerning the TrusteeLaw Debenture Trust Company of New York will be the trustee. The trustee will be required to perform only those duties that are specifically set forth in the indentures, except when a default has occurred and is continuing with respect to the debt securities. After a defa ult, the trustee must exercise the same degree of care that a prudent person would exercise under the circumstances in the conduct of her or his own affairs. Subject to these requirements, the trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the powers vested in it by the indentures at the reque st of any holder of debt securities unless the holder offers the trustee reasonable indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities that might be incurred by exercising those powers. Governing Law The debt securities, the related guarantees and the indentures will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. Legal Ownership of Debt Securities \"Street Name\" and Other Indirect Holders We generally will not recognize investors who hold debt securities in accounts at banks or brokers as legal holders of those de bt securities. Holding securities in accounts at banks or brokers is called holding in \"street name.\" If an investor holds debt securities in street name, we recognize only the bank or broker or the financial institution the bank or broker uses to hold the debt securities. These intermediary banks, brokers and other financial institutions pass along principal, interest and other payments on the debt securities, either because they agree to do so in th eir customer agreements or because they are legally required to do so. If you hold debt securities in street name, you should check with your own institut ion to find out: how it handles payments and notices with respect to securities; whether it imposes fees or charges; how it would handle voting if ever required; how and when you should notify it to exercise on your behalf any rights or options that may exist under the debt securities; whether and how you can instruct it to send you securities registered in your own name so you can be a direct holder as desc ribed below; and how it would pursue rights under the debt securities if there were a default or other event triggering the need for holders t o act to protect their interests. Registered Holders Our obligations, as well as the obligations of the trustee and those of any third parties employed by us or the trustee, extend only to persons who are registered as holders of debt securities. As noted above, we do not have obligations to you if you hold in street name or t hrough other indirect means, either because you choose to hold debt securities in that manner or because the debt securities are issued in the form of globa l securities as described below. For example, once we make payment to the registered holder, we have no further responsibility for the payment even if th at holder is legally required to pass the payment along to you as a street name customer but does not do so. Global Securities A global security is a special type of indirectly held security. If we choose to issue debt securities in the form of global se curities, the ultimate beneficial owners of the debt securities will be indirect holders. We do this by requiring that the global security be register ed in the name of a financial institution we select and by requiring that the debt securities represented by the global security not be registered in the nam e of any other holder except in the special situations described below. The financial institution that acts as the sole registered holder of the global securit y is called the depositary. Any person wishing to own a debt security may do so indirectly through an account with a broker, bank or other financial institutio n that in turn has an account with the depositary. The prospectus supplement will indicate whether your series of debt securities will be issued only as glob al securities. Transfers of debt securities represented by the global security will be made only on the records of the depositary or its nomin ee by transferring such debt securities from the account of one broker, bank or financial institution to the account of another broker, bank or fi nancial institution. These transfers are made electronically only and are also known as book- entry transfers. Securities in global form are sometimes als o referred to as being in book-entry form. As an indirect holder, your rights relating to a global security will be governed by the account rules of yourbroker, bank or financial institution and of the depositary, as well as general laws relating to securities transfers. We will not recognize you as a holder of debt securities and instead will deal only with the depositary that holds the global security. You should be aware that if debt securities are issued only in the form of a global security: you cannot have debt securities registered in your own name; you cannot receive physical certificates for your interest in the debt securities; you will be a street name holder and must look to your own broker, bank or financial institution for payments on the debt sec urities and protection of your legal rights relating to the debt securities; you may not be able to sell interests in the debt securities to some insurance companies and other institutions that are requ ired by law to own securities in the form of physical certificates; the depositary's policies will govern payments, transfers, exchanges and other matters relating to your indirect interest in the global security. We and the trustee will have no responsibility for any aspect of the depositary's actions or for its records of ownership interest s in the global security. We and the trustee also will not supervise the depositary in any way; and the depositary will require that indirect interests in the global security be purchased or sold within its system using same- day funds for settlement. In a few special situations described below, the global security will terminate and the indirect interests in it will be exchan ged for registered debt securities represented by physical certificates. After that exchange, the choice of whether to hold debt securities in register ed form or in street name will be up to you. You must consult your broker, bank or financial institution to find out how to have your interests in debt securi ties transferred to your name, so that you will be a registered holder. Unless we specify otherwise in the prospectus supplement, the special situations for termination of a global security are: when the depositary notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary and we do not or cannot appoint a su ccessor depositary within 90 days; the depositary ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act and we do not appoint a successor depositary within 90 days; an event of default has occurred and is continuing and beneficial owners representing a majority in principal amount of the a pplicable series of debt securities have advised the depositary to cease acting as the depositary; or we decide we do not want to have the debt securities of that series represented by a global security. The prospectus supplement may also list additional situations for terminating a global security that would apply only to the pa rticular series of debt securities covered by the prospectus supplement. When a global security terminates, the depositary (and not us or the trus tee) is responsible for deciding the names of the institutions that will be the initial registered holders. The Term \"Holder\" In the descriptions of the debt securities included herein, when we refer to the \"holder\" of a given debt security as being ent itled to certain rights or payments, or being permitted to take certain actions, we are in all cases referring to the registered holder of the debt sec urity. While you would be the registered holder if you held a certificated security registered in your name, it is likely that the hol der will actually be either the broker, bank or other financial institution where you have your street name account, or, in the case of a global sec urity, the depositary. If you are an indirect holder, you will need to coordinate with the institution through which you hold your interest in a debt security in order to determine how the provisions involving holders described in this prospectus and any prospectus supplement will actually apply to you. For example , if the debt security in which you hold a beneficial interest in street name can be repaid at the option of the holder, you cannot exercise the option y ourself by following the procedures described in the prospectus supplement. Instead, you would need to cause the institution through which you hold your interest to take those actions on your behalf. Your institution may have procedures and deadlines different from or additional to those described in t he prospectus supplement relating to the debt security. 3. Notes offered pursuant to the Base Prospectus dated March 4, 2008 a. Prospectus Supplement (May 6, 2008) - 6.375% Notes due 2038Description of the Notes General We issued the 6.375% Notes due 2038 pursuant to an indenture, dated April 6, 2004, among GSK, as guarantor, GSK Capital Inc., a s issuer, and Law Debenture Trust Company of New York, the trustee for the notes (as successor to Citibank, N.A., pursuant to an Instrume nt of Resignation, Appointment and Acceptance dated December 27, 2007 among GSK Capital Inc., GSK, Law Debenture Trust Company of New York and Cit ibank, N.A.) (for purposes of this description of the 6.375% Notes due 2038 only, the \"indenture\"). References in this \"Description of the N otes\" to the \"notes\" refer to the 6.375% Notes due 2038. The notes are a series of our debt securities. GSK Capital Inc. issued the notes in the aggregate pr incipal amount of $2,750,000,000. The notes will mature on May 15, 2038. GSK Capital Inc. issued the notes only in book-entry form, in minimum de nominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by GSK. If, for any reason, GSK Capital Inc. does not make any required paym ent in respect of the notes when due, whether on the normal due date, on acceleration, redemption or otherwise, GSK will cause the payment to be made to or to the order of the trustee. You will be entitled to payment under the guarantee of GSK without taking any action whatsoever against u s. Interest Payments The notes bear interest at the applicable interest rate shown in the table above and accrued interest from May 13, 2008, or fro m the most recent date to which interest has been paid (or provided for), to but not including the next date upon which interest is required to b e paid. Interest is payable on the notes twice a year, on May 15 and November 15, commencing November 15, 2008, to the person in whose name a note is registered at the close of business on the May 1 or November 1 that precedes the date on which interest will be paid. I nterest on the notes are paid on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. \"Business day\" means any day other than a Saturday, a S unday or a day on which banking institutions in the City of New York or London, England are authorized or obligated by law, regulation or executi ve order to be closed. If an interest payment date or redemption date, or the maturity date, for the notes, as the case may be, would fall on a day th at is not a business day, then the interest payment date or redemption date, or the maturity date, as the case may be, will be postponed to the next succeeding business day, but no additional interest shall be paid unless we fail to make payment on such next succeeding business day. Covenants Subject to certain exceptions, if we are required to withhold or deduct any amount for or on account of any U.K. or U.S. withho lding tax from any payment made on the notes, we will pay additional amounts on those payments so that the amount received by noteholders will equ al the amount that would have been received if no such taxes had been applicable. See \"Description of Debt Securities \u2014 Covenants \u2014 Payment of Add itional Amounts\" below. As contemplated by the last paragraph under \"Description of Debt Securities \u2014 Defeasance\" below, the satisfaction of certain co nditions will permit us to omit to comply with some or all of our obligations, covenants and agreements under the indenture with respect to t he notes. In addition, we may omit to comply with certain covenants through covenant defeasance. We refer you to the information under \"Description of De bt Securities \u2014 Defeasance\" below for more information on how we may do this. Except as described herein, the indenture for the notes does not contain any covenants or other provisions designed to protect holders of the notes against a reduction in our creditworthiness in the event of a highly leveraged transaction or that would prohibit other t ransactions that might adversely affect holders of the notes, including, among other things, through the incurrence of additional indebtedness. Optional Make-Whole Redemption We may redeem the notes, in whole or in part, at our option at any time and from time to time at a redemption price equal to th e greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed on that redemption date; and (ii) as determined by the quotation agent (as defined below), the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the notes being redeemed on that red emption date (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption), discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate, plus 0.25%, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the date of redemption. Notwithstanding the foregoing, installments of interest on notes to be redeemed that are due and payable on interest payment dates falling on or prior to a redemption date will be payable on the interest payment date to the registered holders a s of the close of business on the relevant record date according to the notes and the indenture.\"Comparable Treasury Issue\" means the United States Treasury security selected by the quotation agent as having a maturity comp arable to the remaining term (as measured from the date of redemption) of the notes to be redeemed that would be utilized, at the time of sel ection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining t erm of the notes. \"Comparable Treasury Price\" means, with respect to any redemption date, (i) the average of four Reference Treasury Dealer Quota tions (as defined below) for such redemption date, after excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or ( ii) if the quotation agent for the notes obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, the average of all such quotations, or (iii) i f only one Reference Treasury Dealer Quotation is received, the quotation. \"Quotation agent\" means any Reference Treasury Dealer appointed by us. \"Reference Treasury Dealer\" means (i) each of Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Lehman Brothers In c. (or their respective affiliates that are Primary Treasury Dealers) and their respective successors; provided, however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S. government securities dealer in New York City (a \"Primary Treasury Dealer\"), we will substitute therefor another P rimary Treasury Dealer, and (ii) any other Primary Treasury Dealer selected by us. \"Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations\" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any redemption date, the avera ge, as determined by us, of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the quotation agent by such Reference Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third busin ess day preceding such redemption date. \"Treasury Rate\" means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to mat urity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, assuming a price for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amoun t) equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for that redemption date. Notice of any redemption will be mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each registere d holder of the notes to be redeemed by us or by the trustee on our behalf. Notice of redemption will be published in a daily newspaper of gene ral circulation in the United States, and we will give notice of any such redemption to any exchange on which the notes are listed. On and after any r edemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the notes or portions thereof called for redemption. On or before the redemption date, we will deposit with a paying agent (or the trustee) money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued interest on the notes to be redeemed on that date. If less than all of the notes are to be redeemed, the notes to be redeemed shall be selected by lot by The Depository Trust Company (\"DTC\"), in the case of notes re presented by a global security, or by the trustee by such method as the trustee deems to be fair and appropriate, in the case of notes that are not r epresented by a global security. Further Issuances We initially offered the notes in the aggregate principal amount of $2,750,000,000. We may from time to time, without the conse nt of the holders of a series of notes, create and issue further notes of the same series having the same terms and conditions in all respects as the applicable notes being offered hereby, except for the issue date, the issue price and the first payment of interest thereon. We will not issue any fur ther notes unless such further notes have no more than a de minimis amount of original issue discount or such issuance would constitute a \"qualified reopening\" for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Additional notes issued in this manner will be consolidated with and will form a single series with the notes bei ng offered hereby. Book-Entry System We issued the notes of each series in the form of one or more fully registered global securities. We deposited these global sec urities with, or on behalf of, DTC and register these securities in the name of DTC's nominee. Direct and indirect participants in DTC will record beneficial ownership of the notes by individual investors. The transfer of ownership of beneficial interests in a global security will be effected only thr ough records maintained by DTC or its nominee, or by participants or persons that hold through participants. Investors may elect to hold beneficial interests in the global securities through either DTC, Clearstream Banking S.A. (\"Clears tream\") or Euroclear Bank SA/NV (\"Euroclear\") if they are participants in these systems, or indirectly through organizations which are par ticipants in these systems. Beneficial interests in the global securities will be held in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. Upon receipt of any payment in respect of a global security, DTC or its nominee will immediately credit participants' accounts with amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in the principal amount of the global security as shown in the records o f DTC or its nominee. Payments by participants to owners of beneficial interests in a global security held through participants will be governed by s tanding instructions and customary practices and will be the responsibility of those participants. DTC holds securities of institutions that have accounts with it or its participants. Through its maintenance of an electronic b ook-entry system, DTC facilitates the clearance and settlement of securities transactions among its participants and eliminates the need to deliv er securities certificates physically. DTC's participants include securities brokers and dealers, including the underwriters of this offering, banks, trus t companies, clearing corporations and other organizations. DTC is owned by a number of its participants andby the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., the American Stock Exchange, Inc. and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc . Access to DTC's book- entry system is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a c ustodial relationship with a participant, either directly or indirectly. DTC agrees with and represents to its participants that it will administer its book -entry system in accordance with its rules and bylaws and requirements of law. The rules applicable to DTC and its participants are on file with the U.S. Securi ties and Exchange Commission. Clearstream and Euroclear hold interests on behalf of their participants through customers' securities accounts in Clearstream' s and Euroclear's names on the books of their respective depositaries, which in turn will hold interests in customers' securities accounts in the depositaries' names on the books of DTC. At the date of the prospectus supplement, Citibank, N.A. acts as U.S. depositary for Clearstream and JPMorgan Cha se Bank, N.A. acts as U.S. depositary for Euroclear, or, collectively, the \"U.S. Depositaries.\" Clearstream holds securities for its participating organizations, or \"Clearstream Participants,\" and facilitates the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between Clearstream Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of Clearstream Parti cipants, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates. Clearstream provides to Clearstream Participants, among other thing s, services for safekeeping, administration, clearance and settlement of internationally traded securities and securities lending and borrowing . Clearstream interfaces with domestic markets in several countries. Clearstream is registered as a bank in Luxembourg and as such is subject to regulation by the Commission de Surveillance du Sec teur Financier and the Banque Centrale du Luxembourg, which supervise and oversee the activities of Luxembourg banks. Clearstream Pa rticipants are worldwide financial institutions, including underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and clearing c orporations, and may include the underwriters or their affiliates. Indirect access to Clearstream is available to other institutions that clear through or m aintain a custodial relationship with a Clearstream Participant. Clearstream has established an electronic bridge with Euroclear as the operator of the Euroclea r System, or the \"Euroclear Operator,\" in Brussels to facilitate settlement of trades between Clearstream and the Euroclear Operator. Distributions with respect to the notes of a series held beneficially through Clearstream will be credited to cash accounts of Clearstream Participants in accordance with its rules and procedures, to the extent received by the U.S. Depositary for Clearstream. Euroclear holds securities and book-entry interests in securities for participating organizations, or \"Euroclear Participants\" and facilitates the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between Euroclear Participants, and between Euroclear Participants and part icipants of certain other securities intermediaries through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of such participants or other securities intermedia ries. Euroclear provides Euroclear Participants with, among other things, safekeeping, administration, clearance and settlement, securities lending and borrowing, and related services. Euroclear Participants are investment banks, securities brokers and dealers, banks, central banks, supranationals, custodians, investment managers, corporations, trust companies and certain other organizations and may include the underwriters or their affiliates. N on-participants in Euroclear may hold and transfer beneficial interests in a global security through accounts with a Euroclear Participant or any other secu rities intermediary that holds a book-entry interest in a global security through one or more securities intermediaries standing between such other securities intermediary and Euroclear. Distributions with respect to notes of a series held beneficially through Euroclear will be credited to the cash accounts of Eu roclear Participants in accordance with the Terms and Conditions, to the extent received by the U.S. Depositary for Euroclear. Transfers between Euroclear Participants and Clearstream Participants will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with t heir respective rules and operating procedures. Cross-market transfers between DTC's participating organizations, or the \"DTC Participants,\" on the one hand, and Euroclear Par ticipants or Clearstream Participants, on the other hand, will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC's rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by its U.S. Depositary; however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and procedures and within the established deadlines (Eu ropean time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instr uctions to its U.S. Depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the global security in DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day fund settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear Participants and Clearstream Partic ipants may not deliver instructions directly to their respective U.S. Depositaries. Due to time zone differences, the securities accounts of a Euroclear Participant or Clearstream Participant purchasing an inter est in a global security from a DTC Participant in DTC will be credited, and any such crediting will be reported to the relevant Euroclear Part icipant or Clearstream Participant during the securities settlement processing day (which must be a business day for Euroclear or Clearstream) immedia tely following the settlement date of DTC. Cash received in Euroclear or Clearstream as a result of sales of interests in a global security by or through a Euroclear Participant or Clearstream Participant to a DTC Participant will be received with value on the settlement date of DTC but will be available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account only as of the business day for Euroclear or Clearstream following DTC's settlement date. The information in this section concerning DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream and their book-entry systems has been obtained from s ources that we believe to be reliable, but we take no responsibility for the accuracy of that information. None of us, any of the underwriters and the trustee will have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear orClearstream or their respective participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their ope rations. Although DTC, Clearstream and Euroclear have agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of securities among participants of DTC, Clearstream and Euroclear, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures and they may discontinue the procedures at any time. Same-Day Settlement and Payment Initial settlement for the notes was made in immediately available funds. Secondary market trading between DTC participants wil l occur in the ordinary way in accordance with DTC rules and will be settled in immediately available funds using DTC's Same-Day Funds Settlem ent System. b. Base Prospectus - March 4, 2008 Description of Debt Securities General As used in this \"Description of Debt Securities,\" \"debt securities\" means the debentures, notes, bonds, guarantees and other ev idences of indebtedness that GSK issues or that GSK Capital Inc. or GSK Capital plc (the \"finance subsidiaries\") issues and GSK fully and unconditionally guarantees and, in each case, the trustee authenticates and delivers under the applicable indenture. The debt securities will b e our direct unsecured obligations and will rank equally and ratably without preference among themselves and at least equally with all of our other un secured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The debt securities will be issued in one or more series under an indenture between GSK and Law Debenture Trust Company of New York, as trustee, or under indentures among the finance subsidiaries, Law Debenture Trust Company of New York, as trustee (as successor to Citibank, N.A., pursuant to Instruments of Resignation, Appointment and Acceptance among the finance subsidiaries, the guarantor, Law Debenture Trust Company of New York and Citibank, N.A.), and GSK, as guarantor. The indentures applicable to GSK, GSK Capital Inc. and GSK Capital plc wil l each be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. In the following discussion, we sometimes refer to these indentures collecti vely as the \"indentures.\" This \"Description of Debt Securities\" briefly outlines the provisions of the indentures. The terms of the indentures will inclu de both those stated in the indentures and those made part of the indentures by the Trust Indenture Act. The forms of the indentures have been filed as exhibits to the registration statement of which this \"Description of Debt Securities\" forms a part, and you should read the indentures for prov isions that may be important to you. The indentures do not contain any covenants or other provisions designed to protect holders of the debt securities against a re duction in the creditworthiness of GSK or the finance subsidiaries in the event of a highly leveraged transaction or that would prohibit other transactions that might adversely affect holders of the debt securities. Issuances in Series The indentures do not limit the amount of debt securities that may be issued. The debt securities may be issued in one or more series with the same or various maturities, at a price of 100% of their principal amount or at a premium or a discount. Not all debt securities of any one series need be issued at the same time, and, unless otherwise provided, any series may be reopened, without the consents of the holders of deb t securities of that series, for issuances of additional debt securities of that series. Except in the limited circumstances described below under \" \u2014 Covenants \u2014 Limitation on Liens,\" the debt securities will not be secured by any property or assets of GSK, as issuer or guarantor, or the finance subsid iaries. The terms of any authorized series of debt securities will be described in a prospectus supplement. These terms will include so me or all of the following: the title, aggregate principal amount and denominations of the debt securities; the date or dates on which principal will be payable; the percentage of the principal amount at which the debt securities will be issued and whether the debt securities will be \"o riginal issue discount\" securities for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If original issue discount debt securities are issued (generally, securities t hat are issued at a substantial discount below their principal amount), the special U.S. federal income tax and other considerations of a purchase of original issue discount debt securities will be described; the rate or rates, which may be fixed or variable, at which the debt securities will bear interest; the interest payment dates; any optional or mandatory redemption terms; whether any sinking fund is required; the currency in which the debt securities will be denominated or principal, premium or interest will be payable, if other th an U.S. dollars; whether the debt securities are to be issued as individual certificates to each holder or in the form of global certificates held by a depositary on behalf of beneficial owners; information describing any book-entry features; the names and duties of any co-trustees, depositaries, authenticating agents, paying agents, transfer agents or registrars f or any series; the applicability of the defeasance and covenant defeasance provisions described herein, or any modifications of those provi sions; any deletions from, modifications of or additions to the events of default or covenants with respect to the debt securities; and any other terms, conditions, rights or preferences of the debt securities. Debt securities that have a maturity of less than one year from their date of issue and in respect of which the proceeds are to be received by us in the United Kingdom will have a minimum denomination of \u00a3100,000 (or its equivalent in another currency). The prospectus supplement relating to any series of debt securities may add to or change statements contained in the base prosp ectus. The prospectus supplement may also include, if applicable, a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax and U.K. income tax cons iderations. GSK Guarantees Debt securities issued by the finance subsidiaries will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by GSK. If for any reason the a pplicable finance subsidiary does not make any required payment in respect of its debt securities when due, whether on the normal due date, on ac celeration, redemption or otherwise, GSK will cause the payment to be made to or to the order of the trustee. The holder of a guaranteed debt security will be entitled to payment under the applicable guarantee of GSK without taking any action whatsoever against the finance subsidiary. Payment and Transfer The debt securities will be issued only as registered securities, which means that the name of the holder will be entered in a register that will be kept by the trustee or another agent appointed by us. Unless stated otherwise in a prospectus supplement, and except as describ ed under \"\u2014 Book-Entry System\" below, payments of principal, interest and additional amounts, if any, will be made at the office of the paying agent o r agents named in the prospectus supplement or by check mailed to you at your address as it appears in the register. Unless other procedures are described in a prospectus supplement and except as described under \"\u2014 Book Entry System\" below, you will be able to transfer registered debt securities at the office of the transfer agent or agents named in the prospectus supplement. Y ou may also exchange registered debt securities at the office of the transfer agent for an equal aggregate principal amount of registered debt secur ities of the same series having the same maturity date, interest rate and other terms as long as the debt securities are issued in authorized denominati ons. Neither we nor the trustee will impose any service charge for any transfer or exchange of a debt security; however, we may ask you to pay any taxes or other governmental charges in connection with a transfer or exchange of debt securities. Book-Entry System Debt securities may be issued under a book-entry system in the form of one or more global securities. The global securities wil l be registered in the name of a depositary or its nominee and deposited with that depositary or its custodian. Unless stated otherwise in the pro spectus supplement, The Depository Trust Company, New York, New York, or DTC, will be the depositary if a depositary is used. DTC has advised us as follows: DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a \"banking organization\" within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a \"clearing corporation\" within the meaning of the New York Uniform C ommercial Code and a \"clearing agency\" registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act; DTC was created to hold securities of its participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transacti ons, such as through transfers and pledges, among its participants in such securities through electronic book-entry changes to accounts of its parti cipants, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates; DTC's participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other or ganizations, some of whom (and/or their representatives) own DTC; and access to DTC's book-entry system is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a participant, either directly or indirectly. According to DTC, the foregoing information with respect to DTC has been provided to the financial community for informational purposes only and is not intended to serve as a representation, warranty or contract modification of any kind. Following the issuance of a global security in registered form, the depositary will credit the accounts of its participants wit h the debt securities upon our instructions. Only persons who hold directly or indirectly through financial institutions that are participants in the depositary can hold beneficial interests in the global securities. Since the laws of some jurisdictions require certain types of purchasers to take physical d elivery of such securities in definitive form, you may encounter difficulties in your ability to own, transfer or pledge beneficial interests in a global sec urity. So long as the depositary or its nominee is the registered owner of a global security, we and the trustee will treat the deposi tary as the sole owner or holder of the debt securities for purposes of the applicable indenture. Therefore, except as set forth below, you will not be entitled to have debt securities registered in your name or to receive physical delivery of certificates representing the debt securities. Accordingl y, you will have to rely on the procedures of the depositary and the participant in the depositary through whom you hold your beneficial interest in order to e xercise any rights of a holder under the indenture. We understand that under existing practices, the depositary would act upon the instructions of a pa rticipant or authorize that participant to take any action that a holder is entitled to take. We will make all payments of principal, interest and additional amounts, if any, on the debt securities to the depositary. It i s expected that the depositary will then credit participants' accounts proportionately with these payments on the payment date and that the partici pants will in turn credit their customers' accounts in accordance with their customary practices. Neither we nor the trustee will be responsible for making any payments to participants or customers of participants or for maintaining any records relating to the holdings of participants and their customers, and y ou will have to rely on the procedures of the depositary and its participants. Global securities are generally not transferable. Physical certificates will be issued to beneficial owners in lieu of a global security only in the special situations described in the sixth paragraph under the heading \"Legal Ownership of Debt Securities \u2014 Global Securities\" below. Consolidation, Merger or Sale We and the finance subsidiaries have agreed in the indentures not to consolidate with or merge with or into any other person or convey or transfer all or substantially all of our respective properties and assets to any person (except that the finance subsidiaries m ay merge into us), unless: we or the applicable finance subsidiary, as the case may be, are the continuing person, or the successor expressly assumes by supplemental indenture our obligations under the applicable indenture; the continuing person is a U.S. or U.K. company or is organized and validly existing under the laws of a jurisdiction that is a member country of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (or any successor) and, if it is not a U.S. or U.K. company, the cont inuing person agrees by supplemental indenture to be bound by a covenant comparable to that described below under \"\u2014 Covenants \u2014 Payment of A dditional Amounts\" with respect to taxes imposed in the continuing person's jurisdiction of organization (in which case the continuing pe rson will benefit from a redemption option comparable to that described below under \"\u2014 Optional Redemption for Tax Reasons\" in the event of chang es in taxes in that jurisdiction after the date of the consolidation, merger or sale); immediately after the transaction, no default under the debt securities has occurred and is continuing; and we deliver to the trustee an officer's certificate and, if neither we nor the applicable subsidiary are the continuing person , an opinion of counsel, in each case stating, among other things, that the transaction and the supplemental indenture, if required, comply with these p rovisions and the indenture.Covenants Payment of Additional Amounts Payments made by us under or with respect to the debt securities will be free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for or on account of any present or future tax, duty, levy, impost, assessment or other governmental charge of any nature whatsoever imposed or l evied by or on behalf of the government of the United Kingdom or of any territory of the United Kingdom or by any authority or agency therein or thereof having the power to tax or (ii) the government of the United States or any state or territory of the United States or by any authority or agency therein o r thereof having the power to tax, which we refer to collectively as \"Taxes,\" unless we are required to withhold or deduct Taxes by law. If we are required to withhold or deduct any amount for or on account of Taxes from any payment made with respect to the debt s ecurities, we will pay such additional amounts as may be necessary so that the net amount received by each holder (including additional amoun ts) after such withholding or deduction will not be less than the amount the holder would have received if the Taxes had not been withheld or deducted; provided that no additional amounts will be payable with respect to Taxes: that would not have been imposed but for the existence of any present or former connection between such holder or beneficial owner of the debt securities (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder of, or possessor of a power over, such holder o r beneficial owner, if such holder or beneficial owner is an estate, trust, partnership or corporation) and the United Kingdom or the United States or any political subdivision or territory or possession thereof or therein or area subject to its jurisdiction, including, without limitation, s uch holder or beneficial owner (or such fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member, shareholder or possessor) being or having been a citizen or resident th ereof or treated as a resident thereof or domiciled thereof or a national thereof or being or having been present or engaged in trade or business t herein or having or having had a permanent establishment therein; that are estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property, wealth or similar taxes, duties, assessments or othe r governmental charges; payable other than by withholding from payments of principal of or interest on the debt securities; that would not have been imposed but for the failure of the applicable recipient of such payment to comply with any certifica tion, identification, information, documentation or other reporting requirement to the extent: such compliance is required by applicable law or administrative practice or an applicable treaty as a precondition to exempti on from, or reduction in, the rate of deduction or withholding of such Taxes; and at least 30 days before the first payment date with respect to which such additional amounts shall be payable, we have notifi ed such recipient in writing that such recipient is required to comply with such requirement; that would not have been imposed but for the presentation of a debt security (where presentation is required) for payment on a date more than 30 days after the date on which such payment became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof was duly provided for, whichever occurred later; that are imposed on a payment to an individual and are required to be made pursuant to European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any other Directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting of November 26-27, 2000 on the taxation of savings income, or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such Directive; that would not have been imposed if presentation for payment of the relevant debt securities had been made to a paying agent other than the paying agent to which the presentation was made; or any combination of the foregoing items; nor shall additional amounts be paid with respect to any payment of the principal of or interest on any debt security to any su ch holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership or a beneficial owner who is other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment to the extent a beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary or a member of such partnership or a beneficial owner would not have been entitled to such additional amounts ha d it been the holder of the debt security. We have agreed in each indenture that at least one paying agent for each series of debt securities will be located outside the United Kingdom. We have also agreed that if we maintain a paying agent with respect to a particular series of debt securities in any member sta te of the European Union, we will maintain a paying agent in at least one member state (other than the United Kingdom) that will not be obliged to withho ld or deduct taxes pursuant to any law implementing European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any other Directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council meeting of November 26-27, 2000 on the taxation of savings income, provided there is at least onemember state that does not require a paying agent to withhold or deduct pursuant to such Directive. Our obligation to pay additional amounts if and when due will survive the termination of the indentures and the payment of all amounts in respect of the debt securities. Limitation on Liens We have agreed in the indentures not to incur or assume (or permit any of our subsidiaries to incur or assume) any lien on or w ith respect to any of our or our subsidiaries' property, assets or revenues, present or future, to secure any relevant indebtedness (as this term is defined below) without making (or causing our subsidiaries to make) effective provision for securing the debt securities equally and ratably with such relevant indebtedness as to such property, assets or revenues, for as long as such relevant indebtedness is so secured. The restrictions on liens will not apply to: liens arising by operation of law; liens on property, assets or revenues of any person, which liens are existing at the time such person becomes a subsidiary; and liens on property, assets or revenues of a person existing at the time such person is merged with or into or consolidated wit h us or any of our subsidiaries or at the time of a sale, lease or other disposition to us of the properties of a person as an entirety or substan tially as an entirety. For purposes of the limitation on liens covenant, the term \"relevant indebtedness\" means any of our debt that: is in the form of or represented by bonds, notes, loan stock, depositary receipts or other securities issued (otherwise than to constitute or represent advances made by banks or other lending institutions); is denominated in, or confers any right of payment by reference to, any currency other than the currency of the country in wh ich the issuer of the indebtedness has its principal place of business, or is denominated in or by reference to the currency of such country but more than 20% of which is placed or offered for subscription or sale by or on behalf of, or by agreement with, the issuer outside such country; and at its date of issue is, or is intended by the issuer to become, quoted, listed, traded or dealt in on any stock exchange, ov er-the-counter market or other securities market. Additional Covenants We may be subject to additional covenants, including restrictive covenants in respect of a particular series of debt securities . Such additional covenants will be set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement and, to the extent necessary, in the supplemental indenture or board resolution relating to that series of debt securities. Optional Redemption for Tax Reasons We may redeem any series of debt securities in whole but not in part at any time, on giving not less than 30 nor more than 60 d ays' notice of such redemption, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount plus accrued interest, if any, to the date fixed for redem ption (except in the case of discounted debt securities, which may be redeemed at the redemption price specified by the terms of each series of such debt se curities), if: we determine that, as a result of any change in or amendment to the laws or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder of the United Kingdom (or of any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof) or the United States (or of any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof), or any change in the application or official interpretation of such laws, regulations or rulings, or any change in the applicat ion or official interpretation of, or any execution of or amendment to, any treaty or treaties affecting taxation to which any such jurisdictio n is a party, which change, execution or amendment becomes effective on or after the issue date or such other date specified in the debt securities of that series: we would be required to pay additional amounts (as described under \"\u2014 Covenants \u2014 Payment of Additional Amounts\" above) with respect to that series of debt securities on the next succeeding interest payment date and the payment of such additional amoun ts cannot be avoided by the use of reasonable measures available to us; or withholding tax has been or would be required to be withheld with respect to interest income received or receivable by the ap plicable finance subsidiary directly from the guarantor (or any affiliate) and such withholding tax obligation cannot be avoided by the use of reasonable measures available to the applicable finance subsidiary or the guarantor (or any affiliate); or we determine, based upon an opinion of independent counsel of recognized standing that, as a result of any action taken by an y legislative body of, taxing authority of, or any action brought in a court of competent jurisdiction in, the United Kingdom (or any political su bdivision or taxing authority thereof) or the United States (or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof) (whether or not such action was taken or brought with respect to GSK, as issuer or guarantor, or the applicable finance subsidiary, as the case may be), which action is taken o r brought on or after the issue date or such other date specified in the debt securities of that series, there is a substantial probability tha t the circumstances described above would exist; provided, however, that no such notice of redemption may be given earlier than 90 days prior to th e earliest date on which we would be obligated to pay such additional amounts. We will also pay to each holder, or make available for payment to each such holder, on the redemption date any additional amoun ts resulting from the payment of such redemption price. Prior to the publication of any notice of redemption, we will deliver to the trustee : an officer's certificate stating that we are entitled to effect a redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing t hat the conditions precedent of the right so to redeem have occurred; or an opinion of counsel to the effect that the conditions specified above have been satisfied. Any notice of redemption will be irrevocable once we deliver the officer's certificate to the trustee. Events of Default Unless otherwise specified in a prospectus supplement, an event of default with respect to a series of debt securities occurs u pon: default in payment of the principal (or premium, if any) of any debt security of that series when due (including as a sinking fund installment), and, in the case of technical or administrative difficulties, the continuance of that default for more than two business days; default in payment of interest on, or any additional amounts payable in respect of, any debt security of that series when due and payable, and the continuance of that default for 30 days; default in performing any other covenant in the indenture applicable to that series for 60 days after the receipt of written notice from the trustee or from the holders of 25% in principal amount of the debt securities of that series; default under any bond, debenture, note or other evidence of indebtedness for money borrowed of GSK or either finance subsidi ary, as the case may be (not including any indebtedness for which recourse is limited to property purchased), having in any particular case an o utstanding principal amount in excess of $25,000,000 (or its equivalent in any other currency) where any such failure results in such inde btedness being accelerated and becoming due and payable prior to its stated maturity and such acceleration shall not have been rescinded or an nulled or such indebtedness shall not have been discharged; certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of GSK or either finance subsidiary, as the case may be; any other event of default provided with respect to that particular series of debt securities. Any additional or different events of default applicable to a particular series of debt securities will be described in the pro spectus supplement relating to such series. An event of default with respect to a particular series of debt securities will not necessarily constitute an event of default with respect to any other series of debt securities. The trustee may withhold notice to the holders of debt securities of any default (except in the payment of principal, premium o r interest) if it, in good faith, considers such withholding of notice to be in the best interests of the holders. A default is any event which is an event of default described above or would be an event of default but for the giving of notice or the passage of time. If an event of default occurs and continues, the trustee or the holders of the aggregate principal amount of the debt securitie s specified below may require us to repay immediately, or accelerate: the entire principal of the debt securities of such series; or if the debt securities are original issue discount securities, such portion of the principal as may be described in the appli cable prospectus supplement. If the event of default occurs because of a default in a payment of principal or interest on the debt securities of any series, then the trustee or the holders of at least 25% of the aggregate principal amount of debt securities of that series can accelerate that series of debt securities. If the event of default occurs because of a failure to perform anyother covenant in the applicable indenture or any covenant for the benefit of one or more, but not all, of the series of debt s ecurities, then the trustee or the holders of at least 25% of the aggregate principal amount of debt securities of all series affected, voting as one class, c an accelerate all of the affected series of debt securities. If the event of default occurs because of bankruptcy proceedings, then all of the debt secu rities under the indenture will be accelerated automatically. Therefore, except in the case of a default on a payment of principal or interest on the debt secu rities of your series or a default due to our bankruptcy or insolvency, it is possible that you may not be able to accelerate the debt securities of your series because of the failure of holders of other series to take action. The holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the debt securities of all affected series, voting as one class, can rescind this accelerated payment requirement or waive any past default or event of default or allow noncompliance with any provision of the applicable indenture. However, they cannot waive a default in payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on any of the debt securities whe n due otherwise than as a result of acceleration. After an event of default, the trustee must exercise the same degree of care a prudent person would exercise under the circumst ances in the conduct of her or his own affairs. Subject to these requirements, the trustee is not obligated to exercise any of its rights or powers under the applicable indenture at the request, order or direction of any holders, unless the holders offer the trustee reasonable indemnity. If they provide this reasonable indemnity, the holders of a majority in principal amount of all affected series of debt securities, voting as one class, may di rect the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee, or exercising any power conferred upon the trustee, for a ny series of debt securities. However, the trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the indenture or is unduly preju dicial to the rights of other holders. No holder will be entitled to pursue any remedy with respect to the indenture unless the trustee fails to act for 60 days after it is given: notice of default by that holder; a written request to enforce the indenture by the holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of all outstanding debt se curities of any affected series; and an indemnity to the trustee, satisfactory to the trustee; and during this 60-day period the holders of a majority in principal amount of all outstanding debt securities of such affected series do not give a direction to the trustee that is inconsistent with the enforcement request. These provisions will not prevent any holder of debt securiti es from enforcing payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the debt securities at the relevant due dates. If an event of default with respect to a series of debt securities occurs and is continuing, the trustee will mail to the holde rs of those debt securities a notice of the event of default within 90 days after it occurs. However, except in the case of a default in any pay ment in respect of a series of debt securities, the trustee shall be protected in withholding notice of an event of default if it determines in good faith tha t this is in the interests of the holders of the relevant debt securities. Modification of the Indentures In general, rights and obligations of us and the holders under the indentures may be modified if the holders of a majority in a ggregate principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of each series affected by the modification consent to such modification. However, ea ch of the indentures provides that, unless each affected holder agrees, an amendment cannot: make any adverse change to any payment term of a debt security such as extending the maturity date, extending the date on whi ch we have to pay interest or make a sinking fund payment, reducing the interest rate, reducing the amount of principal we have to repay, cha nging the currency in which we have to make any payment of principal, premium or interest, modifying any redemption or repurchase right, or right to convert or exchange any debt security, to the detriment of the holder and impairing any right of a holder to bring suit for pay ment; waive any payment default; reduce the percentage of the aggregate principal amount of debt securities needed to make any amendment to the applicable ind enture or to waive any covenant or default; or make any other change to the amendment provisions of the applicable indenture. However, if we and the trustee agree, the applicable indenture may be amended without notifying any holders or seeking their co nsent if the amendment does not materially and adversely affect any holder. We and the trustee are permitted to make modifications and amend ments to the applicable indenture without the consent of any holder of debt securities for any of the following purposes: to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency in the indenture; to comply with sections of the indenture governing when we may merge and substituted obligors; to comply with any requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the qualification of the in denture under the Trust Indenture Act; to evidence and provide for the acceptance by a successor trustee of appointment under the indenture with respect to the debt securities of any or all series; to establish the form or forms or terms of the debt securities of any series or of the coupons appertaining to such debt secu rities as permitted under the indenture; to provide for uncertificated debt securities and to make all appropriate changes for such purpose; to provide for a further guarantee from a third party on outstanding debt securities of any series and the debt securities of any series that may be issued under the indenture; to change or eliminate any provision of the indenture; provided that any such change or elimination will become effective onl y when there are no outstanding debt securities of any series created prior to the execution of such supplemental indenture that is entitled to the benefit of such provision; to supplement any of the provisions of the indenture to such extent as will be necessary to permit or facilitate the defeasan ce and discharge of any series of debt securities pursuant to the indenture; provided that any such action will not adversely affect the interests of the holders of such or any other series of debt securities in any material respect; or to make any change that does not materially and adversely affect the rights of any holder of the debt securities. Defeasance The term defeasance means discharge from some or all of the obligations under the indentures. If we deposit with the trustee su fficient cash or government securities to pay the principal, interest, any premium and any other sums due to the stated maturity date or a redem ption date of the debt securities of a particular series, then at our option: we will be discharged from our respective obligations with respect to the debt securities of such series; or we will no longer be under any obligation to comply with the restrictive covenants, if any, contained in the applicable inden ture and any supplemental indenture or board resolution with respect to the debt securities of such series, and the events of default relati ng to failures to comply with covenants will no longer apply to us. If this happens, the holders of the debt securities of the affected series will not be entitled to the benefits of the applicab le indenture except for registration of transfer and exchange of debt securities and replacement of lost, stolen or mutilated debt securities. Instead, the holders will only be able to rely on the deposited funds or obligations for payment. We must deliver to the trustee an opinion of counsel to the effect that the deposit and related defeasance would not cause the holders of the debt securities to recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We may, in lieu of an opinion of counse l, deliver a ruling to such effect received from or published by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. Substitution of Issuer We may at our option at any time, without the consent of any holders of debt securities, cause GSK or any other subsidiary of G SK to assume the obligations of the applicable finance subsidiary under any series of debt securities, provided that the new obligor executes a supplemental indenture in which it agrees to be bound by the terms of those debt securities and the relevant indenture. If the new obligor is not a U. S. or U.K. company, it must be organized and validly existing under the laws of a jurisdiction that is a member country of the Organisation for Economic Coope ration and Development (or any successor) and it must also agree in the supplemental indenture to be bound by a covenant comparable to that described above under \"\u2014 Covenants \u2014 Payment of Additional Amounts\" with respect to taxes imposed in its jurisdiction of organization (in which case the new obligor will benefit from a redemption option comparable to that described above under \"\u2014 Optional Redemption for Tax Reasons\" in the event of chang es in taxes in that jurisdiction after the date of the substitution). In the case of such a substitution, the applicable finance subsidiary will be relieved of any further obligation under the assumed series of debt securities. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, a substitution of obligors as described above generally would be treated as a deemed taxa ble exchange of debt securities for new debt securities issued by the new obligor. As discussed further in the applicable prospectus supplem ent, a United States person who holds debt securities or owns a beneficial interest therein generally will recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equa l to the difference between the issue priceof the new debt securities and such person's adjusted tax basis in the debt securities. Such persons should consult their own t ax advisors regarding the tax consequences of a deemed taxable exchange in the event of a substitution of obligors. Information Concerning the Trustee Law Debenture Trust Company of New York will be the trustee. The trustee will be required to perform only those duties that are specifically set forth in the indentures, except when a default has occurred and is continuing with respect to the debt securities. After a defa ult, the trustee must exercise the same degree of care that a prudent person would exercise under the circumstances in the conduct of her or his own affairs. Subject to these requirements, the trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the powers vested in it by the indentures at the reque st of any holder of debt securities unless the holder offers the trustee reasonable indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities that might be incurred by exercising those powers. Governing Law The debt securities, the related guarantees and the indentures will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. Legal Ownership of Debt Securities \"Street Name\" and Other Indirect Holders We generally will not recognize investors who hold debt securities in accounts at banks or brokers as legal holders of those de bt securities. Holding securities in accounts at banks or brokers is called holding in \"street name.\" If an investor holds debt securities in street name, we recognize only the bank or broker or the financial institution the bank or broker uses to hold the debt securities. These intermediary banks, brokers and other financial institutions pass along principal, interest and other payments on the debt securities, either because they agree to do so in th eir customer agreements or because they are legally required to do so. If you hold debt securities in street name, you should check with your own institut ion to find out: how it handles payments and notices with respect to securities; whether it imposes fees or charges; how it would handle voting if ever required; how and when you should notify it to exercise on your behalf any rights or options that may exist under the debt securities; whether and how you can instruct it to send you securities registered in your own name so you can be a direct holder as desc ribed below; and how it would pursue rights under the debt securities if there were a default or other event triggering the need for holders t o act to protect their interests. Registered Holders Our obligations, as well as the obligations of the trustee and those of any third parties employed by us or the trustee, extend only to persons who are registered as holders of debt securities. As noted above, we do not have obligations to you if you hold in street name or t hrough other indirect means, either because you choose to hold debt securities in that manner or because the debt securities are issued in the form of globa l securities as described below. For example, once we make payment to the registered holder, we have no further responsibility for the payment even if th at holder is legally required to pass the payment along to you as a street name customer but does not do so. Global Securities A global security is a special type of indirectly held security. If we choose to issue debt securities in the form of global se curities, the ultimate beneficial owners of the debt securities will be indirect holders. We do this by requiring that the global security be register ed in the name of a financial institution we select and by requiring that the debt securities represented by the global security not be registered in the nam e of any other holder except in the special situations described below. The financial institution that acts as the sole registered holder of the global securit y is called the depositary. Any person wishing to own a debt security may do so indirectly through an account with a broker, bank or other financial institutio n that in turn has an account with the depositary. The prospectus supplement will indicate whether your series of debt securities will be issued only as glob al securities. Transfers of debt securities represented by the global security will be made only on the records of thedepositary or its nominee by transferring such debt securities from the account of one broker, bank or financial institution to the account of another broker, bank or financial institution. These transfers are made electronically only and are also known as book- entry transfers. Securi ties in global form are sometimes also referred to as being in book-entry form. As an indirect holder, your rights relating to a global security will be governed by the account rules of your broker, bank or financial institution and of the depositary, as well as general laws relating to securities transfers. We will not recognize you as a holder of debt secu rities and instead will deal only with the depositary that holds the global security. You should be aware that if debt securities are issued only in the form of a global security: you cannot have debt securities registered in your own name; you cannot receive physical certificates for your interest in the debt securities; you will be a street name holder and must look to your own broker, bank or financial institution for payments on the debt sec urities and protection of your legal rights relating to the debt securities; you may not be able to sell interests in the debt securities to some insurance companies and other institutions that are requ ired by law to own securities in the form of physical certificates; the depositary's policies will govern payments, transfers, exchanges and other matters relating to your indirect interest in the global security. We and the trustee will have no responsibility for any aspect of the depositary's actions or for its records of ownership interest s in the global security. We and the trustee also will not supervise the depositary in any way; and the depositary will require that indirect interests in the global security be purchased or sold within its system using same- day funds for settlement. In a few special situations described below, the global security will terminate and the indirect interests in it will be exchan ged for registered debt securities represented by physical certificates. After that exchange, the choice of whether to hold debt securities in register ed form or in street name will be up to you. You must consult your broker, bank or financial institution to find out how to have your interests in debt securi ties transferred to your name, so that you will be a registered holder. Unless we specify otherwise in the prospectus supplement, the special situations for termination of a global security are: when the depositary notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary and we do not or cannot appoint a su ccessor depositary within 90 days; the depositary ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act and we do not appoint a successor depositary within 90 days; an event of default has occurred and is continuing and beneficial owners representing a majority in principal amount of the a pplicable series of debt securities have advised the depositary to cease acting as the depositary; or we decide we do not want to have the debt securities of that series represented by a global security. The prospectus supplement may also list additional situations for terminating a global security that would apply only to the pa rticular series of debt securities covered by the prospectus supplement. When a global security terminates, the depositary (and not us or the trus tee) is responsible for deciding the names of the institutions that will be the initial registered holders. The Term \"Holder\" In the descriptions of the debt securities included herein, when we refer to the \"holder\" of a given debt security as being ent itled to certain rights or payments, or being permitted to take certain actions, we are in all cases referring to the registered holder of the debt sec urity. While you would be the registered holder if you held a certificated security registered in your name, it is likely that the hol der will actually be either the broker, bank or other financial institution where you have your street name account, or, in the case of a global sec urity, the depositary. If you are an indirect holder, you will need to coordinate with the institution through which you hold your interest in a debt security in order to determine how the provisions involving holders described in this prospectus and any prospectus supplement will actually apply to you. For example , if the debt security in which you hold a beneficial interest in street name can be repaid at the option of the holder, you cannot exercise the option y ourself by following the procedures described in the prospectus supplement. Instead, you would need to cause the institution through which you hold your interest to take those actions on your behalf. Your institution may have procedures and deadlines different from or additional to those described in t he prospectus supplement relating to the debt security.Exhibit 4.8 CERTAIN CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS EXHIBIT, MARKED BY [***], HAS BEEN OMITTED FROM THIS EXHIBIT BECAUSE IT IS BOTH (I) NOT MATERIAL AND (II) WOULD LIKELY CAUSE COMPETITIVE HARM TO THE COMPANY IFPUBLICLY DISCLOSED.

Following the demerger of our consumer healthcare business to form Haleon in July, we are now a fully focused biopharma company. We prioritise innovation in vaccines and specialty medicines, maximising theincreasing opportunities to prevent and treatdisease At the heart of this is our R&D focus on the science of the immune system, human genetics and advanced technologies, and our world-leading capabilities in vaccines and medicines development. We focus on four therapeutic areas: infectious diseases, HIV,immunology/respiratory and oncology. We're confident in our future Our bold ambitions for patients are reflected in our commitments to a step-change in growth and performance over the period to 2026. This means more GSK vaccines and medicines, including innovative new products, will reach more people than ever before.Being a responsible business means getting ahead of disease together in the right way That's why environmental, social and governance (ESG) impacts are embedded in our strategy and support our sustainable performance and long-term growth. They help us build trust with our stakeholders, reduce risk to our operations and deliver positive social impact. Culture at GSK is something we all own It powers our purpose, drives delivery of our strategy and helpsmake GSK a place where people can thrive. Our culture of being ambitious for patients, accountable for impact and doing the right thing is the foundation for how, together, we'll deliver for our patients, shareholders and GSK people.

I was delighted by the seamless transition of Tony Wood into the Chief Scientific Officer role in August, replacing Hal Barron. Tony is an outstanding and highly respected scientist and has been a key architect in rebuilding our pipeline. 1 Compound annual growth rate As I said last year, the programme ofchange Emma and her team are delivering is designed to fundamentally reconstruct and strengthen GSK's operational capability. Clear, ambitious priorities have been set to sharpen commercial execution and cost discipline; improve the pipeline and R&D productivity; tackle the Group's structure and capital allocation capacity; and shift GSK's culture to be more competitive and performance focused. We are seeing clear evidence of success of this strategic transformation. But, as always, there is more to do. We delivered the demerger and separation of GSK's Consumer Healthcare business to form Haleon, a separate company listed in London, in July. This was the largest demerger in Europe for 20 years and the culmination of a huge amount of work over several years.We have created two attractive and competitive businesses with compelling investment propositions: a world-leading consumer healthcare business, and a newly focused GSK with a strengthened balance sheet to enable increased investment in R&D and future growth. We are already seeing evidence of the benefits of a simpler, more focused, business model. Operational performance for GSK in 2022 was excellent, with strong growth in sales of vaccines and specialty medicines and double-digit growth in operating profit and EPS. This is the start of a new, sustained period of growth for the Group, with sales and operating profit forecast to grow by more than 5% and 10% CAGR 1, respectively over the period to 2026. The Board is very confident in delivery of these targets, underpinned by the improvement we are seeing in the Group's commercial execution and competitiveness.Increasing R&D productivity and building a culture of performance, which take longer to embed, are critical levers of longer-term value creation for GSK. Progress in R&D We are making good progress in R&D. In the past five years, over 20 new medicines and vaccines have been approved and more than 18 new medicines are currently in late-stage clinical trial development. It was good to see clear progress in our pipeline reflected in important milestones during 2022. Our respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine candidate for older adults achieved exceptional phase III results, and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of our long-acting HIV medicine administered every two months reaffirms GSK's leadership in next-generation HIV treatment and prevention. We also remain ambitious to support the pipeline and future growth through business development, with acquisitions of Sierra Oncology and Affinivax completed during the year. GSK Annual Report 2022 Chair's statement continued 05 Engaging with shareholders The Board and management continue to maintain very significant engagement with shareholders. It is clear from these conversations that the vast majority of shareholders support the strategy the company is implementing. Nevertheless - and despite the progress that is being made - the Board recognises that there is more to do to increase investor confidence in the ability of the Group to sustain growth over the next decade. This is important as GSK has underperformed in terms of TSR and share price performance for many years and the Board understands the need to deliver on this. In the short term, this means consistent, year-on-year delivery of the targets for sales and operating profit, including successful launch of the company's key new product opportunities such as the RSV vaccine in 2023. Looking beyond 2026, successful delivery and strengthening of the late-stage pipeline is critical across vaccines and specialty medicines, including for our long-acting HIV portfolio, supported by targeted business development. Longer term, the Board is confident that the progress the company is making to develop industry-leading AI and machine learning capabilities, and application of deep understanding of genetics, can provide us with an edge to be able toidentify, develop and launch products that make a difference for patients and deliver value for our shareholders. Zantac litigation The Group's share price performance in the second half of the year was impacted by the uncertainties associated with the Zantac product liability litigation in the US.While this is disappointing, the company remains clear on its position on these matters, namely that the scientific consensus is that there is no consistent or reliable evidence that Zantac (ranitidine) increases the risk of any cancer. The decision in December by the US Federal Court in Southern Florida to dismiss all claims and cases relating to ranitidine was very welcome and GSK will continue to defend itself vigorously against claims brought at the State level. Targets and governance The Board did not adopt the targets for sales and operating profit growth lightly. These commitments were a very important demonstration of our confidence in the business and our determination to be held accountable for delivery. In line with this, we introduced a new remuneration policy in 2022 linking executive remuneration to reward for outperformance. We engaged extensively with shareholders to develop these proposals, recognising thenew reward system is a fundamental part of the architecture of GSK post-separation to ensure we build a performance culture and generate sustained delivery of shareholder value. While we were pleased the policy achieved a positive shareholder vote, we recognise a sizeable minority of shareholders voted against. We will continue to engage with shareholders to demonstrate why we believe incentivising outperformance against the targets will ultimately be rewarded through shareholder value creation. Operating responsibly Operating responsibly is a foundation stone on which GSK has been built. We are committed to ensuring ESG considerations are properly embedded into our strategy. This supports long-term growth, reduces risk and helps us build trust with stakeholders. The Board was pleased to see continued progress in many ESG areas during 2022, including GSK again topping the independent Access to Medicines Index.Board evolution Delivery of the demerger obviously resulted in changes to the Board, including departures of Vindi Banga and Vivienne Cox to Haleon and the retirement of Laurie Glimcher. I would like to thank them all fortheir significant contributions to GSK over recent years. We committed to using the opportunity of the demerger to deepen the GSK Board's biopharma experience and credentials. I was delighted to welcome Dr Vishal Sikka and Elizabeth McKee Anderson to the Board during the year. Vishal is a world-leading technologist and Elizabeth has deep commercial expertise, across both large and specialty biopharma. Together with the continued involvement of Hal Dietz and Hal Barron, I believe the scientific credentials of GSK's Board are among the strongest in the industry. We also look forward to the future appointment of the highly experienced Julie Brown as our new CFO, starting 1 May 2023. I would like to thank outgoingCFO Iain Mackay for his outstanding work and support over the last four years. I would also like to note the appointments of Anne Beal, who joined the Board in May 2021 as Chair of the Corporate Responsibility Committee, and Charles Bancroft, currently Audit & Risk Committee Chair, as our new Senior Independent Director. Finally, I would like to thank all employees, partners, shareholders and customers fortheir support and commitment through the last year and I look forward to what promises to be an exciting 2023 for GSK. Sir Jonathan Symonds Chair GSK Annual Report 2022 06CEO's statement 2022 was a landmark year for GSK. We enter 2023 with strong momentum and as a focused global biopharma company. Our strong momentum underpins our confidence in delivering the ambitioussales and profit outlooks we have set for 2026. At the same time, we continue to build a stronger portfolio and pipeline based on science of the immune system, to absorb the loss of revenues from future patent expirations, and to put us in a strong position to deliver growth through the decade and beyond. Creating a focused global biopharma company 2022 was a landmark year for GSK. We successfully delivered the demerger of Haleon which is the most significant corporate change for the company in 20 years, and began a new chapter of competitive and profitable growth. We enter 2023 with strong momentum and as a focused global biopharma company with the ambition and purpose to unite science, technology and talent, to get ahead of disease together. Strong 2022 performance increases confidence in delivering growth through 2026 and beyond Group sales were \u00a329.3 billion in 2022, up 13% CER, driven by strong growth in both Vaccines and Specialty Medicines. Adjusted operating profit grew 14% and adjusted EPS by 15% (both CER).Reflecting the huge progress we have made to improve the competitiveness of our commercial execution, we now have 10 products exceeding \u00a31 billion in annual sales, a record year with \u00a33 billion of sales. HIV sales, including Dovato , were \u00a35.7 billion, up 12% CER. Vaccines and Specialty Medicines now represent nearly two-thirds of our sales, compared to 46% in 2017, and we are well on track to achieve our target of 75% of revenues from Vaccines and Specialty Medicines by 2026. This evolving portfolio,together with prioritised investment in innovation and good cost discipline, is reflected in the further expansion of our operating margin.Strong operational performance has enabled us to increase annual investment in R&D to over \u00a35 billion and, through the demerger, we have also significantly strengthened GSK's balance sheet, creating additional flexibility to invest in growth and innovation. In 2022, we acquired the Boston-based vaccine company, Affinivax, which gave us access to the disruptive MAPS technology - for higher valency and broader coverage in a single vaccine - and a phase II next- generation 24-valent vaccine for pneumococcal disease. We also acquired Sierra Oncology, including the myelofibrosis treatment, momelotinib, which we hope to see approved in 2023, and signed an exclusive licenceagreement with Spero Therapeutics for tebipenem, a novel oral antibiotic in late- stage development for complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs). We expect to do more targeted business development in 2023. In addition, we generated over \u00a33.3 billion of free cash flow in 2022, supporting investments and a dividend of 61.25 pence per share for the year. GSK Annual Report 2022 CEO's statement continued 07 1 Vaccine efficacy (VE) 94% (1 of 12,466 versus 17 of 12,494) Innovation supports future growth We now have a pipeline of 69 vaccines and specialty medicines, many with the potential to be first-or best-in-class. In August, Tony Wood took up his new role as GSK's Chief Scientific Officer, succeeding Hal Barron. With his proven expertise in science, data and new technologies, Tony is well placed to capture the value and opportunities we see with our R&D approach. We are focused across four core therapeutic areas: infectious diseases; HIV; immunology/respiratory and oncology. Overall, infectious diseases and HIV represent around two-thirds of our pipeline and our primary focus for R&D. In infectious diseases, we have developed a potential best-in-class vaccine for RSV in older adults. We were excited to present the phase III results in late 2022, which demonstrated 94%1 efficacy against severe disease - an exceptional result. The world has been waiting more than 50 years for an RSV vaccine, so this is asignificant scientific achievement. We have submitted this data to regulators and hope to see approval during 2023. Alongside our existing in-house capabilities, such as adjuvants, MAPS through our Affinivax acquisition and our collaboration with CureVac in mRNA, we now have the broadest suite of vaccine platform technologies of any company in the sector. We also made important advances in the clinical development of two late-stage assets: gepotidacin, a new novel antibiotic for uncomplicated urinary tract infections (uUTIs), and bepirovirsen, which has thepotential to provide a first-in-class functional cure for chronic hepatitis B, where there remains a significant unmet medical need. One in three people around the globe have been infected with the virus and more than 300 million are living with chronic hepatitis B infection today. Current standard of care for chronic hepatitis B achieves functional cure for very few patients, fewer than 5%.With bepirovirsen, which is now undergoing final stage trials, and other assets in our pipeline, we aim to be at the forefront of a new wave of treatments for this ancient disease. In HIV, we launched Apretude , the first and only long-acting injectable for HIV prevention which, alongside Cabenuva , the first and only complete long-acting HIV treatment regimen, means we are changing the landscape for HIV patients. We also made further progress during the year in the development of next-generation pipelineoptions, including presenting promising early-stage data for N6LS, our new broadly neutralising antibody, and we look forward to providing further visibility on these pipeline options during 2023. In immunology/respiratory, we increased R&D investment to support the phase III programme for depemokimab, a promising potential new long-acting medicine to treat severe asthma - an area in which GSK has long-standing expertise and proven commercial capability. In oncology, we reported very positive data for Jemperli as a potential treatment for patients with primaryadvanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. Following discussions with the FDA, we took the decision to withdraw Blenrep from the US market in November, based on the previously announced outcome of the DREAMM-3 trial. Building trust, reducing risk and delivering positive social impact We are committed to running a responsible business, which builds trust and reduces risk to deliver sustainable health impact at scale, shareholder returns and to support our people to thrive. As we set out later in this report, we are making good progress in strengthening our culture, which is key to how we deliver our ambition and purpose. We are committed to making GSK a place where talented people can thrive, with a culture where we are all ambitious for patients, accountable for impact, and do the right thing. In June 2022, we introduced our newCode, which sets out our culture, as well as commitments GSK and our people make, so we can deliver our ambition and purpose in the right way. Our ESG focus is on: access to healthcare, global health and health security, environment, diversity, equity and inclusion, ethical standards, and product governance. In 2022, we made excellent progress, maintaining our number one position in the Access to Medicines Index for the 8th consecutive time and ranking2nd in the S&P Corporate Sustainability Assessment for the pharmaceutical industry. As I talked about last year, investors and other stakeholders are demanding transparent reporting of performance on ESG matters. We are introducing a new ESG Performance Rating, to track delivery. I am pleased to report that our performance in 2022 is 'on track' with details set out on page 42. As Jon has made clear on the Zantac product liability litigation in the US, the scientific consensus is that there is no consistent or reliable evidence that Zantac (ranitidine) increases the risk of any cancer. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in the State cases. From my perspective, it is important that as we do that, the company does not get distracted from our main priority - continuing to deliver on our strategy for patients, shareholders and our people. Looking ahead with confidence As we enter 2023, I believe GSK has compelling prospects. As ever, its ourpeople who fuel this confidence and I want to thank them for all they have achieved during 2022 and the strong momentum they are delivering. I am very optimistic for the future and excited by what we can achieve together.

This means we support our people to do things better and faster, focusing on what matters most. It means setting clear objectives and accountability for results and giving everyone the support and space they need to succeed. It means doing everything responsibly with care and integrity, because people and patients around the world count on us. During 2022, we have dedicated significant leadership energy in bringing to life our Ahead Together purpose, strategy and culture across GSK. We have also placed real emphasis on individualownership of the culture and the small changes we each need to make it a reality. This change has been supported by team conversation guides and simple tools used globally to support better and faster decision making, greater clarity of accountabilities and more ambitious, focused objectives. In June, we introduced The Code. This sets out our culture as well as the commitments GSK and our people make so we can deliver on our ambition in the right way. GSK people sign up to The Code annually and personally commit 'I'm in'. +See The Code on gsk.com 1 Making GSK a place where people thrive Core to our Ahead Together ambition is to make GSK a place where people thrive. Although how people thrive is very individual, we also believe there are common themes that matter for all. Firstly, a belief in our purpose and a desire to live our culture and contribute to delivering our ambition. Secondly, feeling included and able to be yourself with opportunities to keep growing, with the support, feedback and space needed to succeed. And finally, feeling good, with positive mental, physical, financial and social wellbeing. This all requires GSK to be a place where people feel welcome and valued, with an environment (including our policies, workplaces and ways of working) which wholeheartedly enables and supports each person to deliver at their best.Supporting our people managers Our people managers play a crucial role in helping their teams to thrive and bring culture to life. We expect people managers to Motivate, Focus, Care for and Develop their teams. Over the last two years we have delivered First Line Leader training, anchored in these four areas, to over 80% of this population. In addition, in 2022, we launched a new senior leader programme, Leading Leaders, to further build on our leadership development at more senior levels of the organisation. In preparation for 2023, we brought all people managers together in a virtual event to bring to life our biggest priorities and support managers in setting focused, ambitious objectives with their teams, aligned to our Innovation, Performance, Trust and Culture priorities. Focusing on diversity, equity and inclusion We are continuing our focus on building a more diverse organisationand an equitable and inclusive culture so that everyone feels welcome, valued and included. We are delivering our leadership representation aspirations, have implemented annual diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) training for all, and invested in development tools to build more inclusive leaders. We support an award-winning leadership development programme, Accelerating Difference, to support women and ethnically diverse leaders. We have also continued to evolve our people policies, processes and practices to support recruitment, retention and development of a more diverse workforce. More details on our aspirational targets for DEI for our people, business and suppliers, can be found in theResponsible Business section on page 47. Driving Performance with Choice Performance with Choice - our approach to hybrid working for those in office-based roles (about a quarter of our people) continues to allow us to find the right balance of on-site and remote working. This framework, balanced in driving collective and individual performance, as well as supporting individual flexibility, is supporting personal wellbeing, driving performance and making us attractive as an employer. This year we have been clear in our expectations so that we spend enough time together in person to help us continue to build our sense of community, connectedness, enable development and better achieve our Ahead Together ambition.

All GSK people are expected to have an agreed development plan, regardless of grade or role, that is underpinned by a robust conversation to understand the space and support needed for them to succeed. We continue to invest in development initiatives and training that can be accessed by all through our Keep Growing Campus - a central platform for our training and knowledge sharing. In 2022, we have also redesigned our talent framework - focusing our reviews for our people against performance, living our culture and future potential. This gives us a simpler assessment process, in line with our culture, to support placing our best people in our most critical roles, with strong and diverse succession plans. This allows us to spend more time on development and action planningand less on process. Health and wellbeing improvements We have announced improvements to our health and wellbeing benefits, to better support people through different life stages and to make sure our offerings are fair and inclusive. These include a new global minimum standard of 18 weeks' parental leave for primary and secondary carers for all forms of family, a new global minimum standard for care of a family member for end of life or serious health emergencies, insured benefits to include same sex partners wherever possible, a new financial wellbeing service and mental health training - available to everyone. In November, we gave a one-time discretionary payment to our people who were feeling the greatest impact of rising cost-of-living challenges. This payment was given to almost half of our global workforce in 47 of our 83 countries, using consistent criteria to determine eligible countries.Understanding how our people experience GSK We regularly measure how our people experience GSK, includingprogress in our culture focus areas and as a place to work. This includes an annual survey for all employees featuring questions on engagement, confidence, inclusivity, our culture focus areas and trust priorities. We also run a series of pulse surveys each year, with a statistically significant population, to get timely insights on our culture progress as well as hot topics of the moment. Over the last year, our progress is demonstrated by increased engagement at 81% in 2022, up from 78% in 2021, confidence in delivery of our ambitions, and positive trends in Ambitions for Patients, Accountability for Impact, Doing the Right Thing, and measures of inclusion. To measure the effectiveness of our global manager population, their teams provide feedback via an annual One80 survey.Managers receive anonymised aggregate feedback on their effectiveness in motivating their team, focusing people on what matters most, leading with care, inclusive leadership and supporting performance and development. In 2022, 77% of our managers were rated as highly effective by their reports. Recognising and rewarding our people Sharing our success and recognising and rewarding our people, not just on the progress we have made but how we have made it, continues to be an important part of our culture. In addition to our bonus scheme that rewards performance across the company, each year we award 10% of our population with extra 'Ahead Together' awards for those delivering exceptional performance in line with our culture. And 5% of people are identified as Missed Performance forthose that do not deliver on their objectives or live the culture. This year, in addition to our annual bonus and long-term incentive structure, we also gave a special thank you to all our people (excluding the GSK Leadership Team (GLT)), allowing us to recognise in real time what we achieved together in preparation for separation and the unprecedented transformation of GSK: everyone received a one-off week's salary in March, separate to our 2021 bonus pay-out. We remain energised to continually live and evolve our culture in line with the internal and external environment. It is part of everyone's objectives, starting at the top, with all leadership team members having ambitious goals to embed and grow culture, and shows up in how we act every day. GSK Annual Report 2022 12Our external environment Here, we set out five major themes that have influenced our environment - and how we work with governments, regulators and industry partners to keepproviding medicines and vaccines to patients worldwide. Life sciences continue to be shaped by new technology Rapid advances in science and technology are changing life sciences R&D. This is particularly evident in the expansion of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML), which has the potential to transform outcomes for patients by making R&D more precise and productive. Research has identified nearly 270 companies working in the AI-driven drug discovery industry.1 We're investing in building our own AI/ML capabilities and forging partnerships to further strengthen our position. Other biopharma companies are also collaborating with AI organisations, with 46 partnerships struck in 2022, compared to 28 in 2016.2 The pivotal role of innovation in managing the COVID-19 pandemic underscored the potential of new technologies and approaches to improve patient outcomes. Growth areas include next-generation vaccines, where there has been a substantial increase in assets in development, driven by the advancement of mRNA and DNA vaccine technology. Greater use of new technologies and digital tools, as well as growth of decentralised trials, is accelerating a drive towards modernisation of clinical trial and regulatory processes. Governments and regulators are continuing to build on lessons learned from COVID-19 and expand international collaboration on complex trials and further develop policies and infrastructure for responsible access to public datasets. As AI/ML advances, different regulatory approaches on the use of AI in medicines are emerging. Collaboration is also needed to create common models and standards for AI regulation that support innovation and benefit patients. +Read about our focus on data and platform technologies on pages 18 and 19 Geopolitical tensions prompt countries to shift their priorities and focus Scientific and technological advances offer significant promise for patients. But geopolitical tensions are putting pressure on the systems needed to deliver this innovation. Rising nationalism and friction between countries, due to the conflict in Ukraine and tensions between the US and China, bring potential risk and disruption. In the face of these tensions, governments are taking more interventionist actions to protect their domestic economic competitiveness, strengthen national security, create domestic jobs and improve public health. There were notable examples of solidarity during the year. Constructive World Trade Organization discussions about reducing tariffs demonstrated that governments recognise the importanceof minimising trade friction. But domestic interests remain the priority with governments encouraging companies to localise and shorten value chains 3, prioritising strategic resilience over efficiency. Policies to restrict trade and secure access to essential items including medical goods have persisted. For example, in 2022, governments introduced over 150 harmful policy interventions affecting trade in pharmaceutical goods.4 In an environment defined by tensions, trade disruption and economic uncertainty, health and life sciences continue to be viewed as sectors of strategic importance for governments across advanced markets, including the US, Europe and the UK. In March 2022, the US enacted a new federal agency - Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health - to improve the government's ability to speed biomedical and health research. Life sciences was earmarked as a key strength in the UK government's new Growth Plan.5 Given their potential to bolster economic productivity and protect lives, healthcare and life sciences are likely to be subject to more muscular industrial policy interventions such as additional support for R&D, as well as state scrutiny over supply chain resilience. 1AI in biopharma research: A time to focus and scale | McKinsey 10 October 2022 2Deep Pharma Intelligence, Artificial Intelligence for Drug Discovery Landscape Overview Q3 2022 3KPMG Singapore, six key trends impacting global supply chains in 2022 4Global Trade Alert 5HM Treasury, The Growth Plan 2022, September 2022 GSK Annual Report 2022 Our external environment continued 13 Economic slowdown as energy crisis and inflation bite Lockdowns at the height of the pandemic weighed on economies worldwide and the outlook continued to weaken in 2022. Global growth was forecast to slow to 3.2% in 20226 amid surging inflation, heightened geopoliticaluncertainty and tightening financial conditions. Energy prices soared across Europe due to increased demand and restricted supply, contributing to rising inflation. This has had immediate and challenging consequences for individuals and businesses. With energy prices climbing, governments have staged significant and costly interventions to protect households, seek alternative energy sources, and invest in renewable energyinfrastructure. Government interventions on this scale risk growing fiscal deficits and put pressure on other areas of public spending, including healthcare. During the pandemic, healthcare spending increased as governments rolled out vaccination programmes. But spending is estimated to have fallen in real terms during2022 as it failed to keep pace with inflation. 7 Medicines spending is expected to return topre-pandemic growth rates by 2024, albeit withpricing and value under increasing scrutinyover the next few years due to economicpressures and geopolitical disruption. 8 As governments meet economic headwinds, cost containment measures are on the rise, with healthcare budgets facing significant pressures in the UK, EU and other advanced markets. In August 2022, the US President signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act. This includes provisions to drive down US national debt through higher taxes, lowering energy costs, and lowering drug prices. Parts of the Act that focus on patients are welcome as they bring benefits to people who would otherwise face challenges accessing important vaccines.But there are concerns over negotiation provisions,allowing the federal health secretary to negotiate prices of certain expensive drugs each year for Medicare. This could potentially limit investment in innovation. As well as cost containment, we are also seeing more examples of innovative contracting to support prudent stewardship of healthcare spending. Companies and payers are continuing to explore innovative pricing models, which facilitate patient access and support payer confidence in the value of a medicine or vaccine at the time of launch. +Read more about pricing and access on page 43 Green transition disrupted but long-term momentum remains The energy crisis has not only weakened economies, but also disrupted the green transition. Amid concerns over reliability, supply and affordability, policymakers face conflicting priorities. While energy transition is necessary to mitigate climate change, immediate energy needs are driving renewed investment in traditional fossil fuel energy sources. European countries announced plans to revert to higher coal usage to produce electricity, while the US has taken steps such as reopening oil and gas leasing on public lands. Investor sentiment, particularly in the US,has seen similar shifts as the ESG agenda becomes increasingly polarised and politicised. During the year, Florida and Texas implemented measures banning their pension funds from investing through any asset managers that have policies on excluding fossil fuels or taking ESG factors into account. Against this fractured backdrop, corporate net zero efforts remain in the spotlight with stakeholder expectations on credibility and transparency on net zero continuing to rise. But voluntary commitments and coalitions are being tested with, for example, the UN-backed Race to Zero dropping its explicit bar on support for new coal projects. Despite the disruption seen during 2022,getting ahead of climate change remains a long-term investor and societal expectation, and a government priority. This was reinforced by the $369 billion clean energy investment in the US Inflation Reduction Act. Any setback to the energy transition is likely to be time-limited, so companies must continue to demonstrate leadership on the issue and remain committed to cutting their climate impact. +Read more about climate and nature on pages 45 and 46 6IMF, World Economic Outlook, October 2022 7Economist Intelligence Unit, Healthcare outlook 2023 (eiu.com) 8IQVIA, Global Use of Medicines 2023 GSK Annual Report 2022 14Our external environment continued Access in focus as COVID-19 shines light on health inequity Our position 9 Financial Times, COVID-19 vaccine tracker: the global race to vaccinate, as at 23 December 2022 COVID-19 demonstrated the value of the life sciences sector and the potential for delivering innovative interventions at speed. But the pandemic also raised questions about the pace at which medicines and vaccines could be rolled out, shining a light on inequalities in access and healthcare outcomes both within and between countries. Around 26% of people in low-income countries are partially or fully vaccinated against COVID-19, compared with 80% in high-income countries.9 Scrutiny of the COVID-19 vaccine rollouthas reignited the debate around the intersection between intellectual property (IP) rights and access to medicines and vaccines. This was evidenced by the TRIPS waiver, agreed in June 2022, which temporarily removes developing country obligations on patent protections for COVID-19 vaccines. Such a step doesn't address inequitable access and instead undermines industry's ability to partner, invest at risk, and respond quickly to future pandemics.Industry has sought to encourage a more holistic approach to realising equitable and timely access during future pandemics. This recognises the multiple factors that enable access, such as sustainable funding and free trade. The international pharmaceutical industry, along with biotechs and vaccine manufacturers based in developing countries, united behind a vision for access in future pandemics, known as the Berlin Declaration. This outlined industry's willingness to reserve an allocation of real- time production for distribution to priority populations during future pandemics. Thesuccess of such an approach will rely on having a strong innovation ecosystem; removal of regulatory and trade barriers to export; procurement mechanisms for low- and middle-income countries; and robust health systems. More resilient health systems are needed not only to counter the increasing threat of infectious disease emergencies, but also to manage the growing burden of non-communicable diseases. Delays to cancer diagnosisand treatment during the pandemic could have an adverse effect on survival for years to come. As health systems continue to manage the long-term repercussions of the pandemic, there is an opportunity to move towards new models of care that enable earlier action to prevent, diagnose and treat disease. Investing in prevention to get ahead of disease has a clear return. It improves health outcomes, is cost- effective, and contributes to healthier lives, societies and economies. +See pages 43 to 45 for more on pricing and access, and global health and health security In a challenging economic and political landscape, it's more important than ever that we invest in a pipeline of vaccines and specialty medicines that will meet changing and unmet healthcare needs. At the same time, we have to work with governments, regulators and industry partners to make sure these medicines and vaccines can reach patients, bringing value to both the people who need them and payers. Scientific innovation and improving health remain a critical pathway to sustainable economic growth. We therefore continue towork with our peers and governments to make sure that the policy and regulatory environment stimulates and sustains innovation. This includes, for example,advocating for appropriate IP protections; a balanced regulatory framework that supports the discovery and delivery of vaccines and medicines developed through emerging technologies; and reinforcing the importance of global, diversified supply chains. As the pricing environment becomes tougher, we are well placed to offer a differentiated, high-value pipeline across prevention and treatment of disease. This is built on using new technology and techniques to make our R&D faster and smarter. Demand for data and real-worldevidence to support continued reimbursement of new products is likely to increase. We continue to work with payers to design innovative solutions that manage theirrisk and uncertainty, while also recognising the full health, social and economic value of innovative medicines and vaccines. We also continue to collaborate with global health partners to increase our reach to patients in lower income countries. To support delivery of innovative medicines and vaccines, we continue to advocate for investment in resilient healthcare systems around the world. More robust infrastructure is needed to support, for example, routine life-course immunisation. Getting ahead of future pandemics, andmanaging them more effectively when they do happen, starts with investing in health systems and improving public health now. GSK Annual Report 2022 Research and development Science and technology have never before opened up so many possibilities for new vaccines and medicines for patients. In 2022, we've continued to harness the science of the immune system alongside genetics, genomics and advanced technology to continue to strengthen our pipeline. GSK Annual Report 2022 16Research and development Highlights 69 >20 2/3rds vaccines and medicines in the pipeline new approvals since 2017 of our pipeline comes from infectious diseases and HIV -Potential best-in-class RSV older adults candidate vaccine filed in US, EU, Japan -Shingrix interim 10-year data presented at ID Week 2022 -Continued progress in development of long-acting HIV treatments; positive phase II data on N6LSbroadly-neutralising antibody presented at HIVGlasgow -Pivotal phase III trials for gepotidacin antibiotic for uUTIs stopped early for efficacy -Positive phase IIb data for bepirovirsen, our investigational treatment for chronic hepatitis B, andstarted phase III study in early 2023 -Expansion of depemokimab phase III programme with trials for inhibitor threeadditional eosinophil-driven diseases -Business development including: acquisition of Affinivax giving access to disruptive MAPS technology and phase II next-generation vaccinefor pneumococcal disease; acquisition of SierraOncology (regulatory submission EU, US); and licence with SperoTherapeutics giving access to tebipenem HBr, alate-stage antibiotic for cUTIs Our R&D approach R&D is central to our purpose to get ahead of disease together. By combining the science of the immune system, genetics, genomics, advanced technologies and outstanding talent, we discover and develop vaccines and medicines to make a transformational impact on people's lives. In 2022, R&D expenditure was \u00a35,488 million, up 9% at AER, 4% at CER, from 2021 and we have strengthened our pipeline and platform capabilities through strategic business development. This means we have 22 vaccines and 47 medicines in development (see page 28). Many have the potential to be first-in-class. Our late-stage R&D aligns to four therapeutic areas: - infectious diseases, see page 20 - HIV, see page 23 - immunology/respiratory, see page 24 - oncology, see page 25Our research team takes an approach that follows the science to identify opportunities with the greatest probability of success to lead to differentiated vaccines and medicines, including opportunities outside these four areas. Our scientists prioritise genetically identified targets that are at least twice as likely to succeed in the clinic. They also prioritise infectious disease targets and immune- modulators that have greater lifecycle opportunities. Prioritising execution and technology Our priorities are: - flawless execution of our late-stage pipeline and acceleration of our organically derived pipeline - doubling down on technology to deliver further innovation faster - finding new ways to help patients through lifecycle innovation - targeted business development to push towards new discoveries GSK Annual Report 2022 Research and development continued 17 Flawless execution and acceleration of our pipeline Our pipeline, across all phases, has 69 potential vaccines and medicines, more than 70% of them modulating the immune system and more than 70% with human genetic validation. In 2022, we started 16 phase I programmes, moved nine candidates into phase II and started five phase III programmes. We also achieved industry-leading milestones, including the approval and launch of the first long-acting HIV medicines and the FDA priority review of the exceptional RSV older adult vaccinecandidate with a potential best-in-class profile. We also presented new data at IDWeek 2022 showing that Shingrix can provide at least 10 years of protection against shingles in the over 50s, and completed our acquisition of Affininax. We have made significant progress in improving key measures of productivity. We reduced overall cycle times by 20% from the start of new drug discovery projects through to the end of phase I (for 2019-2021 compared to 2016-2018), and we now have a phase I portfolio that includes many potential first-in-class medicines. Doubling down on technology to deliver further innovation faster We believe the combination of science and technology holds the key to fundamentally transforming medical discovery, improving success rates and shaping how we treat and prevent even the most challenging diseases. This is why technology plays a growing role in progressing our R&D towards vaccines and medicines not previously thought possible. It covers: - data technology, which helps us to understand the patient and human biology, choose targets and design clinical trials. We have access to large, rich datasets thanks to our data-focused collaborations, including our recent collaboration with Tempus (see page 19) as well as established partnerships, for example with 23andMe, the UK Biobank, and the Laboratory of Genomic Research with the University of California (see page 18) - platform technology, for the efficient design and development of new vaccines and medicines. We have access to a broad set of platform technologies, including an unrivalled suite within vaccines like mRNA, MAPS and adjuvant science, and a growing investment in oligonucleotides (see page 19)Finding new ways to help patients through lifecycle innovation We look to innovate throughout the lifecycle of our vaccines and medicines by exploring new ways for them to treat patients. Examples include: - approval in the US for Boostrix , for immunisation during pregnancy to prevent whooping cough in newborn babies - FDA approval for a new, more convenient presentation of our Rotarix vaccine to prevent gastroenteritis caused by rotavirus - approval for Priorix , our vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella, in the US for children over 12 months - approval of a two-dose regimen for Cervarix , our human papillomavirus vaccine for girls aged 9 to 14, in China - approval in China for Benlysta to treat adults with active lupus nephritis (LN) and FDA approval for Benlysta for paediatric patients with active LN - continue to develop a new monoclonal antibody, depemokimab, under development for its high affinity and long-acting suppression of IL-5 function Pushing towards new discoveries through strategic business development We work with commercial organisations and academic institutions to find new research and discovery opportunities, access new technology platforms or to progress the development of our pipeline. We remain agile and ambitious, looking for opportunities that address high unmet medical needs and complement our R&D strategy. We look to grow our pipeline through acquisitions. In 2022, these included Affinivax adding a novel class of next-generation pneumococcal vaccine candidates and innovative MAPS technology (see page 20), and Sierra Oncology adding momelotinib for the treatment of mylefibrosis (see page 25). We also announced five new collaborations, giving us access to exciting new vaccines, medicines and technologies, and deepening our understanding of how to prevent and treat disease. We partnered with precision medicine company Tempus, with oncology being a first area of focus. We added to our pipeline through new partnerships with Mersana Therapeutics for an option to T-cell engaging antibodies for oncology and with Zheming to progress a phase I TLR8 agonist for hepatitis B virus (HBV). We announced a new partnership with Wave Life Sciences to drive discovery and development of oligonucleotide therapeutics, including a programme for alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency with a novel RNA-editing mechanism of action, and we also announced an exclusive licence agreement with Spero Therapeutics for tebipenem HBr, a that may treat cUTIs. GSK Annual Report 2022 Research and development continued 18 Genetics, genomics and advanced technologies To get ahead of disease, we use innovative tools to maximise our chances of success and accelerate the pace of discovery. Genomics and the predictive power of AI/ML are changing how we find the right medicines for the right patients. Advanced technologies and real-world data are bringing patients into the discovery and development process earlier. This, in turn, improves how researchers can integrate data into decision making. For diseases like cancer or neurological conditions, we're investigating how tools like genetic validation, wearables, genomics and AI/ML can provide important insights that make us better at choosing drug targets and the specific groups of patients in which to study them. Data produced using these tools helps us: - select novel targets that are genetically validated and so more likely to become approved medicines and vaccines - design clinical trials to include the patients most likely to benefit from our potential medicines and vaccines - recruit these patients faster, and accelerate the pace of our clinical trials Improving drug discovery with the power of genomics and partnerships Today, more than 70% of the projects in our pipeline are supported by human genetic evidence, informed by the large genetic datasets from our ongoing collaborations with the UK Biobank, 23andMe and FinnGen. In 2022, we were a founding member in the creation of Our Future Health, an ambitious UK effort aiming to recruit up to five million people to capture a wide range of medical and genetic information. We're also working with Genes & Health and Discover Me South Africa to further expand this work and ensure a diverse and robust genetic representation of diseases. In our collaboration with the consumer genetics and research company 23andMe we have approximately 50 active joint drug discovery programmes for genetically validated targets. In 2022, we extended our collaboration for a fifth year to identify and validate additional new drug targets until July 2023. This year we also took on sole development responsibility for phase I of the collaboration programme consisting of an investigational antibody targeting CD96 as a novel immuno-oncology agent. This is an investigational antibody that is currently being evaluated for cancer alongside other GSK medicines.Several collaborations in functional genomics are providing further insight to improve our target selection. We work with a range of institutions innovating in this fast-moving field, from CRISPR pioneers to start-ups. In the US, this includes dedicated genomics research centres, such as the Altius Institute in Seattle and the Broad Institute affiliated with MIT and Harvard University in Boston. We continue to partner with Adrestia, a British biotech, and with Open Targets, a UK consortium where we're a founding member. These advances complement the progress we're making at the genomics lab we founded in 2019 with CRISPR pioneers at the University of California in San Francisco. The Laboratory for Genomic Research is now advancing a portfolio of 16 active technology and biology projects. By automating and advancing CRISPR, our scientists work side by side with academic researchers to uncover new knowledge about disease mechanisms forimmunology, oncology and neurology. Scientists are creating new technologies that stem from CRISPR, and they are identifying additional applications of these technologies to find better starting points for new medicines. CRISPR and other tools contribute to the data we have to understand the underlying causes of disease. Other information sources range from tissue and blood samples to human behaviour from wearable technology. Our proprietary AI/ML capabilities help our researchers interpret this volume of data and also make connections and predictions that help identify which targets are most likely to succeed. As assets move through our pipeline, both AI/ML and functional genomics continue to play a role, including in optimising clinical trial design, for example as happening now with bepivorisen. Building in-house AI/ML teams and expanding our collaborations AI/ML enables us to generate deeper insights from our own research data and our collaborations. Our work in applied AI/ML primarily focuses on two areas in R&D: at the early discovery stage to find genetically validated targets, and at the clinical stage to match patients with the right medicines. We've built one of the largest in-house functions dedicated to AI/ML, and we work with partners to lead the way in these fields. Our AI/ML team includes more than 160 experts based at key GSK R&D sites, including London, San Francisco, Tel Aviv, Philadelphia and Boston. Combining our team with the resources and expertise of our partners helps us collect more data, find patterns in genetic data faster than we could before and, ultimately, helps us increase our success rates in making life-changing medicines. We continue to expand our partnerships with world leader data aggregation companies such as Tempus to further complement our internally generated data. GSK Annual Report 2022 Research and development continued 19 Our models are becoming more and more advanced with every iteration. We've created a new imaging tool using AI/ML that we are using to inform target selection and potential business development opportunities in a challenging and complex disease area, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Also, through a partnership with King's College London, we're using tumour models alongside digital pathology and AI to develop personalised immuno-oncology treatments for several solid cancers, including lung, gastrointestinal and women's cancers. The Oxford-GSK Institute of Molecular and Computational Medicine (IMCM), which we established in partnership with Oxford University in December 2021, combines human genetics with functional genomics and ML to focus on neurological diseases like ALS, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Our collaborations in data technology complement our existing capabilities and resources and include ongoing work with Cerebras, the pioneer in high performance AI computer systems, and NVIDIA, a global leader in AI hard and software. In 2022, we started two other data collaborations: - PathAI, a global leader in AI-powered pathology, aimed at accelerating R&D in oncology and NASH. We'll combine our predictive and data-driven approach to drug discovery and trials with PathAI's models to build algorithms that uncover new insights. We'll integrate these into trials to help us predict which patients will be impacted most - Tempus, which enables access to their library of de-identified patient data. Tempus' dataset draws from its work with over 40% of oncologists in the US at academic medical centres and community hospitals. We will work with Tempus to improve clinical trial design, speed up enrolment and identify drug targets, with an initial focus on oncology Platform technology across vaccines and medicines Our work to use technology to drive drug discovery also includes expanding our platform capabilities. These technologies allow us to broaden the range of options for future medicines and vaccines, going beyond existing modalities like small molecules, antibodies and adjuvants to help immune responses to vaccines, but importantly also ensure we remain highly competitive by being faster and more confident in identifying new medicines from our genetically validated targets. We develop these technologies ourselves and through external collaborations. Key areas for new medicine and vaccine technologies that we're actively investing in include: - MAPS (multiple antigen presenting system), a novel and highly efficient vaccine technology platform that potentially enables broader coverage, generating higher antibody responses. MAPS has mainly been directed at preventing pneumococcal disease and has also shown promise in addressing other infectious disease pathogens, including those that cause hospital-acquired infections - mRNA, which was validated by the launch of the COVID-19 vaccines in 2020 and could potentially be applied across a number of diseases. We're progressing the development of the mRNA technology in-house, in parallel with our CureVac collaboration. We're currently evaluating a second generationmRNA backbone, which we developed with CureVac, in a phase I trial featuring modified mRNA vaccine candidates targeting COVID-19 and flu. Based on the promising preliminary analysis of these studies, evaluating safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity, we are preparing to move these candidates into late-stage clinical testing - RNAi and oligonucleotides including: ARO-HSD, a phase II programme for NASH, in-licensed from Arrowhead in 2021, consisting of an RNA interference (RNAi) molecule against a genetically validated target; and bepirovirsen, an anti-sense oligonucleotide designed to recognise HBV DNA, in phase III, which we in-licensed from Ionis in 2019. We also announced a collaboration with Wave Life Sciences, which allows us toadvance up to eight preclinical programmes using Wave's PRISM oligonucelotide platform and includes the in-licensing of a novel RNA-editing oligonucleotide to treat liver and lung disease caused by alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency - monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) such as Xevudy for COVID-19, co-developed with Vir Biotechnology, as well as other research programmes - new ways to understand the biology and pharmacology of genetically validated targets and how best to intervene in theirdisease processes. Our Chemical Biology group has developed several such methods, including chemogenomic libraries, encoded libraries, and reactive fragments, in part in collaboration with the Francis Crick Institute. These novel technologies help find critical starting points for drug discovery projects - natural products derived from the biosphere, such as the collaboration we started with LifeMine Therapeutics in 2022, which gives us access to its platform for proprietary evolutionary-derived genomic drug discovery - bi-specific antibodies for multiple auto-immune diseases that are advancing through preclinical phases - digitisation to optimise each phase of vaccine development and production. Working with Siemens and Atos, two of the world's leading digital transformation and technology companies, we've developed a 'digital twin', a complete and real-time simulation of the vaccine manufacturing process. GSK Annual Report 2022 Research and development continued 20 Infectious diseases Two-thirds of the vaccines and medicines in our pipeline address the global public health burden of infectious diseases, such as those caused by HIV, RSV, meningococci, hepatitis B, rotavirus and antibiotic resistant bacteria. These diseases cause significant morbidity and mortality and put strain on global healthcare systems. In 2022, we generated pivotal data for our RSV candidate vaccine for older adults and positive interim analysis readout for gepotidacin, our antibiotic to treat uUTIs and gonorrhoea. Both have the potential to be first and best-in-class. We also sought opportunities to boost our pipeline through business development. In 2022, we completed our acquisition ofthe clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company Affinivax. It has pioneered a novel class of next-generation pneumococcal vaccine candidates. These include a 24-valent vaccine candidate for adults, which has completed phase II, and a paediatric version currently in phase II. A 30-plus valent pneumococcal vaccine programme is in pre-clinical development. These vaccines incorporate the MAPS technology (see page 19). Our new partnership with Spero Therapeutics, Inc. gave us an exclusive licence agreement for tebipenem HBr, a late-stage antibiotic being developed by Spero. This is the first oral carbapenem antibiotic, and it has the potential to treat cUTIs. With a clear FDA regulatory path to potential approval, tebipenem HBr will address an unmet medical need for a novel oral antibiotic as an alternative to intravenous hospital therapy for drug-resistantcUTIs. RSV RSV is a major cause of acute respiratory illness in older adults and is currently one of the major infectious diseases without a vaccine. RSV can worsen underlying conditions and cause pneumonia. It leads to approximately 420,000 hospitalisations and over 29,000 deaths a year in adults in industrialised countries. Around 94% of people hospitalised with RSV have underlying comorbidities. In 2022, we became the first company to announce positive phase III efficacy data for a RSV older adult vaccine candidate. Interim results from our ARESVI-006 phase III pivotal trial showed vaccine efficacy of over 94%1 observed against RSV lower respiratory tract disease (RSV-LRTD) in adults with at least one comorbidity of interest and in those with severe disease. Overall vaccine efficacy against RSV-LRTD was 82.6%1, meeting the trial's primary endpoint. Consistent high vaccine efficacy was observed across a range of pre-specified secondary endpoints, including against severe disease, in adults aged 70-79 and across RSV A and B strains.The vaccine was generally well tolerated, with a favourable safety profile. These data were presented as part of the Infectious Disease Society of America's IDWeek 2022 annual meeting in Washington, DC, in October. We also shared positive data on the co-administration of our RSV older adult vaccine candidate with a flu vaccine, a key finding for practical immunisation. Based on these data, the vaccine candidate was granted Priority Review by the FDA. It was also accepted for accelerated assessment by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and for review by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW). We're committed to finding solutions for people at high risk of the serious consequences of RSV infection. In 2022, we started a clinical trial exploring the effect of the RSV older adult vaccine candidate in people aged 50-59, including those at increased risk of RSV-LRTD, compared to people 60 and over. We also began two further flu co-administration trials. The ARESVI-006 trial will also continue to evaluate an annual revaccination schedule and longer- term protection over multiple seasons. Shingles Approximately one in three adults develop shingles, a painful and potentially serious illness. Shingrix is the first approved shingles vaccine to combine a non-live antigen with one of our adjuvants. It may help overcome the natural age-related decline in immunity that contributes to the challenge of protecting people aged 50 and overfrom this disease. Shingrix is now available in 26 countries, and we've continued to broaden access to it in 2022. In Japan, where Shingrix is already approved for people over 50, we've also submitted an application to extend the indications to include over 18-year-olds at risk, such as those with immune suppression and immune deficiency. The US Cancer Network has recommended Shingrix for cancer survivors over 19, and the vaccine has a preferential recommendation from the Brazilian Immunization Society. We presented new data at IDWeek 2022 showing that Shingrix can provide at least 10 years of protection against shingles in the over50s. In the primary endpoint analysis, the interim data showed overall efficacy of more than 80% 2 in the follow-up period of approximately six to ten years after initial vaccination. No new safety concerns were identified during the follow-up period. These data significantly add to the real-world evidence demonstrating the long- term benefit of Shingrix . 1 VE 94.1% (1 of 12,466 versus 17 of 12,494); 94.6% (1 of 4,937 versus 18 of 4,861); VE 82.6% (7 of 12,466 versus 40 of 12,494) 2 VE 81.6% (52 cases in 32673.8 283 cases* in 32673.8 f/u years); *cases for the placebo group are estimated from the ZOE-50/70 placebo groups toassess vaccine Research and development continued 21 Meningitis Around 1.2 million people develop invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) each year. It can be fatal, and 10-20% of survivors will have long-term disabilities such as brain damage, deafness, nervous system problems or loss of limbs. Bacterial meningitis is also of particular concern. One in 10 people who are diagnosed with bacterial meningitis end up dying, and 1 in 5 are left with severe complications. Bexsero , our meningitis B vaccine, and Menveo , our meningitis ACWY vaccine, are registered in more than 60 countries, and together protect against most forms of IMD. Since launch, more than 150 million doses of these vaccines have been distributed. In 2022, we received FDA approval in the US and ANVISA approval in Brazil for a fully liquid, ready-to-use single vial presentation of Menveo . This gives healthcare providers a more convenient option by removing the need to reconstitute the vaccine. Our investigational first generation MenABCWY candidate pentavalent (5-in-1) vaccine combines the technologies used in our Bexsero and Menveo vaccines. The goal of introducing a 5-in-1 meningitis vaccine is to protect people against the five serotypes that cause most disease with just one vaccine, not two. A 5-in-1 meningitis vaccine has the potential to help improve vaccination rates by providing a more convenient way to prevent IMD. MenABCWY is currently in phase III development, in a trial spanning five countries with 3,650 participants aged 10-25. We expect results in early 2023. New multivalent vaccines like thishave the potential to support the global strategy to defeat meningitis by 2030, set out in the World Health Organization's Global Road Map. A second-generation 5-in-1 meningitis vaccine is currently in phase II and is aimed at improving protection against B strains and allowing for broader age indications globally. COVID-19 By the end of 2022, more than 650 million cases of COVID-19 had been reported around the world, and there had been over 6.5 million deaths. The disease continues to challenge healthcaresystems. We and our innovation partners have been part of the response, developing treatments and vaccines. Treating COVID-19 with Xevudy Xevudy (sotrovimab) is our SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibody treatment, developed with Vir Biotechnology. It works by preventing the virus from entering and infecting healthy cells in the body. It has been an important part of early treatment to prevent high-risk patients from developing severe disease. With Vir, we developed sotrovimab from discovery to approval in less than 1.5 years. We have delivered over two million doses of Xevudy to over 30 countries including government purchases to meet current and future need.Providing solutions with new COVID-19 vaccines Our pandemic adjuvant technology is part of several protein-based COVID-19 vaccines we've developed, such as with Sanofi and SK bioscience, which are now licensed in some markets. Thesevaccines are important new options to help protect against COVID-19. Chronic hepatitis B Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is a major global health issue with approximately 300 million people infected and approximately 900,000 people dying annually due to liver complications, including cirrhosis and liver cancer. The mainstay of therapy includes nucleoside/nucleotide analogues (NA) which are often taken for life because they suppress but rarely clear the virus. Bepirovirsen is the only drug in development as a monotherapy for CHB that works to reduce virus replication, suppress surface antigen and stimulate the immune system. In November 2022,phase II full-study data published in The New England Journal of Medicine demonstrated that treatment with bepirovirsen resulted in sustained clearance of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and HBV DNA in a sub-group of patients followed for six months after discontinuation of their bepirovirsen. Levels of HBsAg and HBV DNA together are key efficacy measures. When HBsAg and HBV DNA remain undetectable for more than six months without medications, patients are considered to have a functional cure, an outcome associated with significant decreased risk developing cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and death. Currently, standard of care treatment with NA rarely achieves functional cure, which is why new therapies are needed for patients diagnosed with chronic HBV. Our phase III study which started in early 2023 will build our understanding of how bepirovirsen works. Our aim for bepirovirsen is for it to become a potential monotherapy or the backbone of future therapy for hepatitis B patients. We are exploring potential sequential treatment trials and expect to share data later in 2023. Other infectious diseases Diptheria, tetanus and pertussis Since 2010, there have been up to 48,000 cases of pertussis (whooping cough) in the US each year, with infants more likely to experience complications from the disease. Boostrix , our tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis vaccine (Tdap), received approval from the FDA in October 2022 for immunisation during the third trimester of pregnancy for the prevention of whooping cough in newborn infants. This makes it the first vaccine in the US approved specifically for use during pregnancy. The vaccine is approved in 80 countries, including in the EU, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. GSK Annual Report 2022 Research and development continued 22 Rotavirus In November 2022, the FDA approved the new fully liquid presentation of our Rotarix vaccine to prevent gastroenteritis caused by rotavirus. This new presentation makes it moreconvenient for healthcare providers to prepare Rotarix by removing the need to reconstitute the dose at the point of use. We expect it to be commercially available in early 2023. Varicella In February 2022, we started a phase II study in the US with children aged 12-15 months to compare the safety andimmunogenicity of our varicella (chickenpox) new strain candidate vaccine with the vaccine currently available. The aim is to develop a vaccine that fits the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices' (ACIP) recommended US immunisation schedule and offers healthcare professionals and parents an alternative to the current vaccine. This varicella new strain vaccine could also be used as a component of the measles-mumps-rubella-varicella vaccine in the US. Herpes simplex virus We have started a phase I study to investigate the potential of GSK 3943104A, an immunotherapeutic against herpes simplex virus (HSV). The aim is to offer a better solution for people with the virus than current standard of care. The study is gathering safety and immunogenicity data on GSK 3943104A in healthy people. Phase II development will focus on safety and immunogenicity, as well as proof-of-concept efficacy. Human papillomavirus Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common sexually transmitted infection - around 14 million people a year become infected in the US alone. It often has no symptoms but can cause genital warts or cancer. We've begun a phase I/II study of our next-generation adjuvanted vaccine, developed in collaboration with Innovax, to protect against nine types of HPV. The study is evaluating the reactogenicity, safety and immunogenicity of an adjuvanted vaccine candidate for girls and women aged 16-26. The aim is toidentify the most effective vaccine formulation to take into phase III trials. We also received approval in China for Cervarix , our human papillomavirus vaccine for girls aged nine to 14, in a two-dose regimen. Pneumococcal disease Pneumococcal disease is the term for any illness caused by the bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae, a leading cause of acute bacterial disease worldwide. Our acquisition of Affinivax adds a novel class of next-generation pneumococcal vaccine candidates that incorporate MAPS technology (see pages 19 and 20).Antibiotics and antimicrobial resistance According to the World Health Organization (WHO), antimicrobialresistance (AMR) is one of the top 10 global health threats. By undermining the effectiveness of antibiotics, it contributes to around 1.2 million worldwide deaths a year. We're using our expertise in developing prevention and treatment options to focus on pathogens that have the highest probability of developing AMR, as identified by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the WHO. Progressing towards a new treatment for urinary tract infections and gonorrhoea We are developing gepotidacin, a novel mechanism topoisomerase inhibitor, for uncomplicated UTIs and gonorrhoea, in partnership with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) in the US. In early November, we received positive results from EAGLE-2 and EAGLE-3 phase III trials evaluating gepotidacin, in female adults and adolescents with uUTIs. Following a recommendation by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) we stopped the trials early for efficacy and plan to submit aNew Drug Application to the FDA in 2023. We are also studying gepotidacin as a potential treatment for urogenital gonorrhoea (GC) in the EAGLE-3 phase III trial, with potential to read out in the second half of 2023. In November 2022, we started a phase I/II study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a new vaccine candidate for gonorrhoea prevention. This vaccine candidate, based on our proprietary GMMA (generalised modules for membrane antigens), aims at protecting adolescents and adults against gonorrhoea infections. In 2022, we also started a phase Ib study of our first-in-class FimH antagonist, a novel molecule that blocks binding of E. coli bacteria tothe bladder epithelium, as a treatment for recurrent urinary tract infection. Investigating our salmonella vaccine In July 2022, we started a phase I study with the University of Oxford to investigate our candidate vaccine for invasive non-typhoidal salmonellosis (iNTS). The vaccine uses our generalised modules for membrane antigens (GMMA) technology. To explore its potential, we're partnering with Vacc-iNTS, a consortium of 12 partners from eight countries, including some where iNTS is endemic. GSK Annual Report 2022 Research and development continued 23 HIV In recent years, we've made breakthroughs in treating and preventing HIV to transform patients' lives. We're now building on these achievements with new products, including long-acting injectables which, for many, means significantly reducing therapy to just a few times a year. HIV is one of the world's biggest health threats, with 1.5 million new cases in 2021, including approximately 38,000 in the US. Around 38 million people were living with HIV worldwide in 2021, over half of them in sub-Saharan Africa. In HIV, our work is through ViiV Healthcare, the world's only specialist HIV pharmaceutical company, which we majority own, with Pfizer and Shionogi as shareholders. Our goal is to treat,prevent and eventually cure HIV. Transforming the experience of patients living with HIV With our portfolio of 17 antiretroviral medicines, we're transforming the experience of people living with HIV. Instead of taking medicine orally every day, our Cabenuva (cabotegravir, rilpivirine) long- acting injectable regimen allows some patients to only have treatment six times a year. The treatment has established ViiVHealthcare as the industry leader in long-acting HIV medicines. Cabenuva is approved for dosing every two months in the US, and in Europe as the combination of Vocabria (cabotegravir) and Rekambys (rilpivirine). This combination received marketing approval in Japan in 2022, again for dosage every two months. The FDA has also approved a label update for Cabenuva that means patients no longer have to take cabotegravir and rilpivirine tablets for a month before starting Cabenuva injections. ViiV's dolutegravir is the world's most widely prescribed integrase inhibitor for HIV, taken by around 21 million people, or three out of four of those currently on HIV medications. It's the foundation forDovato and Juluca , our two-drug regimen oral therapies, which are as effective as three-drug regimens and allow people to take fewer drugs while still maintaining viral suppression. Working to prevent HIV Preventing HIV is a central part of ViiV Healthcare's work. In late 2021, we received FDA approval for Apretude (cabotegravir), the first and only long-acting injectable pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) option to reduce the risk of sexually acquired HIV-1. This approval was based on results from two pivotal phase III studies, HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) 083 and 084, demonstrating superiority over the established standard of care. In August 2022, we announced more data showing the continued superior efficacy of cabotegravir long-acting for PrEP over daily tablets. The unblinded portion of the HPTN 084 trial with women in sub-Saharan Africa showed a substantially lower rate of HIV acquisition.Offering a range of options for people living with HIV We offer different medicines to meet the varying needs of people living with HIV. Our portfolio of antiretrovirals also includes Tivicay and Triumeq , which contain dolutegravir. Triumeq now has US approval in a dispersible once-daily tablet formulation for children weighing 10kg and above and the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the EMA issued a positive opinion recommending marketing authorisation for Triumeq PD for children 14kg and above at the end of 2022. With 1.7 million children living with the virus, it's important that this medicine, the first fixed-dose tablet regimen forchildren, is now available in a form that's easier for them to take. The FDA has also lowered the minimum weight at which a child can be prescribed the Triumeq tablet from 40kg to 25kg. Our commitment is to leave no person with HIV behind. That includes working to develop medicines for heavily treatment- experienced adults who have very few treatment options because of safety concerns, intolerance, or resistance. In 2022, we announced five-year data for Rukobia (fostemsavir), a first-in-class attachment inhibitor. In the ongoing BRIGHTE study, week 240 data shows that these patients can take fostemsavir as part of their antiretroviral regimen and keep their virus suppressed over the long term. Exploring more ways to improve the lives of people living with HIV We're exploring new types of long-acting therapy, based on cabotegravir, that could give people living with HIV the option to take medicine at home. These involve combining cabotegravir with other assets in our early-stage pipeline to create medicines that patients can administer themselves. We're also investigating ultra-long-acting medicines with dosing every three months or longer. Based on studies in 2022 and 2023, we will choose partners for cabotegravir and begin phase IIb and phase III studies of these combinations in 2024. In October 2022, we announced positive phase IIa data for N6LS, a novel broadly neutralising antibody (bNAb). A study showed strong antiviral efficacy at two dosing levels. bNAbs can recognise different strains of HIV and stop them entering healthy cells, and so block the virus from replicating. They offer a potentially new approach to treatment and may help us combat treatment resistance in our efforts to end the HIV epidemic. A European study of Vocabria (cabotegravir injection) and Rekambys (rilpivirine long-acting injectable suspension) showed the treatment was well received by people living with HIV and by clinic staff. In the CARISEL study, 81% of participants said the injectable treatment was less stigmatising than daily tablets, and the combination showed a high clinical effectiveness and a low rate of viral failure. GSK Annual Report 2022 Research and development continued 24 Immunology/respiratory For 50 years, we have been leaders in medicines that advance the management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and we've sold products for respiratory problems since the 1880s. Now we draw on our expertise in the science of the immune system to develop medicines for immune-mediated conditions including lupus, eosinophilic-driven diseases such as severe eosinophilic asthma and other inflammatory diseases. Our innovative medicines help millions of people with immune and respiratory conditions. Widening access to Benlysta beyond systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) to include lupusnephritis (LN) SLE is a chronic autoimmune disease where the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in many parts of the body. It causes symptoms like swollen joints, fever, hair loss and facial rash, along with potential long-term complications including irreversible damage to vital organs like the heart and kidneys. SLE affects around five million people worldwide. LN, the kidney inflammation caused by lupus, can progress to kidney failure if left untreated. Approximately 40% of patients with SLE develop LN. Our innovative research into the role of B cells in autoimmune conditions led to the development of Benlysta (belimumab), the only biologic approved for both SLE and LN. Benlysta is a monoclonal antibody that targets B-lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS), an underlying cause of SLE and LN, reducing autoantibody levels to help treat the short-term symptoms of inflammation and prevent irreversible damage to vital organs. In 2022, we received approval in China for Benlysta to treat adults with active LN. We also received FDA approval for Benlysta for paediatric patients with active LN. These followed earlier approvals for adult treatment in markets including EU member states, Japan and Brazil. Our ambition is to improve outcomes for lupus patients with a 'treat to target' approach that aims for remission or reduced disease activity. Innovating to treat eosinophil-driven diseases Eosinophil-driven diseases are associated with heightened levels of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell. Increased levels of eosinophils in the blood or tissue can cause a range of symptoms across a variety of conditions. When eosinophils infiltrate certain tissues, they can cause inflammation and organ damage which, over time, can affect patients' day-to-day life.Eosinophil-driven diseases are associated with poor symptom control such as worsening asthma, and can cause breathing difficulties and interfere with taste, smell and sleep. Our first-in-class monoclonal antibody Nucala (mepolizumab), targets interleukin-5 (IL-5) to reduce the number of eosinophils. It's the only treatment in the US and Europe with indications across four eosinophilic diseases, including severe eosinophilic asthma (SEA), chronic (HES). In 2022 Nucala was approved in the US, Japan and Europe as a 40mg pre-filled syringe for 6-11-year-olds with SEA. The pre-filledsyringe allows healthcare professionals or caregivers to administer Nucala at home. Previously, children could only receive the medicine in hospitals or physicians' offices, as pre-filled syringes were only available in adult strength. We also continue to develop a new monoclonal antibody, depemokimab, under development for its high affinity and long- acting suppression of IL-5 function. Current IL-5 inhibitors are dosed every four weeks or every eight weeks. Depemokimab is designed to be administered every six months, which means it has the potential to be the first biologic to deliver ultra-long-acting treatment for patients with SEA. In 2022, we began phase III trials of depemokimab for CRSwNP, EGPA and HES, following initiation of trials in SEA in 2021. Otilimab Data from the ContRAst programme examining otilimab as apotential treatment for rheumatoid arthritis showed limited efficacy and did not support a suitable benefit/risk profile. As a result, we decided not to progress with regulatory submissions. Other clinical advances We moved two antibodies from phase I to phase II: anti-CCL17 - a novel anti-cytokine antibody for pain in both osteoarthritis and diabetic peripheral neuropathy, representing a novel non-opioid, non-NSAID analgesic therapy; and anti-IL18 - a novel anti-cytokineantibody for atopic dermatitis which was identified with the use of human genetics and human translational studies. GSK Annual Report 2022 Research and development continued 25 Oncology Cancer remains a leading cause of death with unmet patient need. We have an emerging portfolio in oncology and will develop programmes using the science of the immune system with human genetics and new technology. In oncology, we take a balanced and pragmatic approach to investment in our research areas of immuno-oncology, tumour cell- targeting therapies and synthetic lethality. We have 11 investigational medicines in our oncology pipeline that have the potential to make a meaningful difference for patients with cancer. We also grow our oncology pipeline through targeted business development with acquisitions and collaborations. In 2022, we acquired Sierra Oncology, a biopharmaceutical company focusedon therapies for rare forms of blood cancer, such as myelofibrosis. We also entered into an exclusive global licence option agreement with Mersana in a range of HER2-expressing tumours, such as breast, gastric and non-small-cell lung cancers, and an expanded global, non-exclusive licence and collaboration agreement with SpringWorks Therapeutics for multiple myeloma. In 2022, we also expanded our existing collaboration with precision medicine partner Tempus, with an initial focus in oncology (see page 19). Positive readouts for Jemperli Colorectal cancer is the third most common form of cancer, with over 1.9 million new cases in 2020. We're exploring an immunotherapy treatment with curative intent using Jemperli (dostarlimab) in a subset of rectal cancer. At ASCO 2022breakthrough findings were presented and published in The New England Journal of Medicine by researchers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) confirming a clinical complete response in all 14 patients who received treatment with Jemperli as a neoadjuvant treatment for mismatch repair-deficient locally advanced rectal cancer. In February 2023 the FDA Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) voted 8 to 5 that the two proposed single-arm trials would be sufficient to characterise the benefits and risks of Jemperli in the curative-intent setting for patients with mismatch repair-deficient/microsatellite instability- high locally advanced rectal cancer.In late 2022, our phase II PERLA study comparing Jemperli plus chemotherapy to pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy for metastatic non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer returned positive data. The results support our ambition for Jemperli to be the backbone of our immuno-oncology programme, either alone or combined with standard of care and novel cancer therapies, especially for patients with limited treatment options. Our phase III COSTAR trial is studying Jemperli in combination with cobolimab, an investigational selective anti-TIM-3 monoclonal antibody, and chemotherapy in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer who have progressed on anti-PD-(L)1 therapy and chemotherapy. The combination has the potential to be the first of its kind. CD226 axis Our work focused in immuno-oncology aims to help the immunesystem recognise and kill cancer cells more effectively. We're investigating how Jemperli , in combination with novel assets targeting the CD226 axis, can support anti-tumour activity. We are the only company with access to antibodies targeting all three checkpoints on the CD226 axis, including PVRIG, TIGIT and CD96. We're executing a comprehensive development plan that will combine these investigational antibodies with Jemperli , in both doublet and triplet therapies. In addition to several early phase trials that are underway, our phase II platform study in first-line non-small-cell lung cancer began dosing patients with an initialcombination and our TIGIT antibody, partnered with iTeos Therapeutics. Gynaecologic and breast cancers In 2020, nearly 1.4 million women around the world were diagnosed with a gynaecologic cancer. We continue to explore the potential for our existing treatments to advance the standard of care for hard-to-treat gynaecologic cancers, both alone and in combination with each other and other agents. In second-line endometrial cancer, the FDA granted full approval for Jemperli in February 2023 for the treatment of adult patients with mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR) recurrent or advanced endometrial cancer, as determined by an FDA-approved test, that has progressed on or following a prior platinum-containing regimen in any setting and are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation. GSK Annual Report 2022 Research and development continued 26 In December 2022, we announced positive headline results from the planned interim analysis, or Part 1, of our RUBY phase III trial investigating Jemperli in combination with chemotherapy as a frontline treatment for advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. It showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful progression-free survival (PFS) benefit in the prespecified dMMR/MSI-H patient subgroup and in the overall population. In Part 2 of the RUBY study, we will assess Jemperli in combination with Zejula in the same setting, with initial results anticipated in the second half of 2023. Our FIRST trial, is evaluating this combination as a potential new first-line maintenance therapy for ovarian cancer with results expected in the second half of 2023.1 Our phase III trial, ZEST, is exploring the efficacy and safety ofZejula (niraparib) as an early-stage treatment for breast cancer. The trial uses circulating tumour DNA technology for the first time in a pivotal breast cancer study. This offers the potential to detect tumour cells earlier at the molecular level and identify women at higher risk of recurrence. This means therapy with Zejula could start when the burden of disease is still low and may create an opportunity to slow or stop the cancer's progress more effectively. Investigating Zejula for lung cancer We're evaluating Zejula in our phase III ZEAL lung cancer trial, which is investigating Zejula as a first-line maintenance therapy for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (squamous and non-squamous histologies), after they have received platinum- based chemotherapy. The trial is studying the efficacy and safetyof Zejula in combination with the standard of care treatment. Blood cancers Myelofibrosis is a rare blood cancer that affects around 20,000 patients in the US, most of whom either have anaemia when they're diagnosed or develop it eventually. Patients often need transfusions, and around 30% stop treatment because of anaemia. Momelotinib may address the significant medical needs of myelofibrosis patients with anaemia by reducing dependence on transfusions while still treating other symptoms of the disease and enlarged spleen. A New Drug Application and Marketing Authorisation Application for momelotinib is currently under review with the FDA and EMA, respectively. Momelotinib is not currently approved in any market. We anticipate a US launch in 2023.Multiple myeloma is the world's third most common blood cancer, with more than 175,000 people developing it every year. Blenrep (belantamab mafodotin) is for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least four other therapies. Blenrep is approved in Europe and Hong Kong. Our DREAMM trials are investigating its potential in earlier lines of treatment, together with standard and novel therapies, as well as exploring dosing and scheduling modifications. In November 2022, we announced we would withdraw Blenrep from the US market following the request of the FDA. This request wasbased on the outcome of the DREAMM-3 confirmatory trial, which did not meet the requirements of the FDA Accelerated Approval regulations. Other trials in the DREAMM clinical trial programme will continue. They are designed to demonstrate the benefit of Blenrep in combination with novel therapies and standard-of-care treatments in earlier lines of therapy and dosing optimisation to maintain efficacy while reducing corneal events. We anticipate data from the DREAMM-7 and DREAMM-8 phase III trials in the second half of 2023. Early science and other collaborations In 2022, we announced an exclusive global licence HER2. It's designed to activate the innate immune system through STING signalling in immune cells in tumours, and tumour cells themselves. Mersana has initiated a phase I clinical trial of XMT-2056 to investigate its potential in a range of HER2- expressing tumours, such as breast, gastric, colorectal and non-small-cell lung cancers. The FDA has granted an orphan drug designation to XMT-2056 for the treatment of gastric cancer. Additionally, to further enhance our tumour-cell targeting portfolio, we entered into an agreement with WuXi Biologics for exclusive licences for up to four bi- and multi-specific T-cell engaging (TCE) antibodies developed using WuXi Biologics' proprietary technology platforms. This deal allows us to access potential best-in-class TCE antibodies that have been optimised for effective tumor killing with a desirable safety profile. 1 At the request of the FDA, in late 2022, we restricted the second-line ovarian cancer maintenance indication for Zejula in the US to only the patient population with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA mutations (gBRCAmut) GSK Annual Report 2022 Research and development continued 27 Opportunity driven As well as our portfolio across therapy areas, we pursue other opportunities where the emerging science indicates the potential for important new opportunities to have major impact in addressing unmet need. Transforming the treatment of anaemia with daprodustat Over 700 million people suffer from chronic kidney disease (CKD) worldwide, and an estimated one in seven of them has anaemia. For many, the treatment options are limited. When left untreated orundertreated, anaemia of CKD is associated with poor clinical outcomes and leads to a substantial burden on patients and healthcare systems. Daprodustat is our oral treatment in a class of medicines called oral hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors (HIF- PHIs). It's based on human genetics and Nobel Prize-winning science showing how cells sense and adapt to oxygen availability. Daprodustat offers a potentially easier oral treatment than the current injection-based standard of care, while still managing haemoglobin levels effectively. It's approved as Duvroq in Japan. In October 2022, we reported that the FDA Cardiovascular and Renal Drugs Advisory Committee (CRDAC) supported that the benefit of treatment with daprodustat outweighs the risks for adult dialysis patients with anaemia of CKD with a 13 to 3 vote. In adult non-dialysis patients with anaemia of CKD, the CRDAC did not support that the benefit of treatment with daprodustat outweighs the risks with a 5 to 11 vote. On 1 February 2023, the FDA approved daprodustat under the name Jesduvroq for the treatment of anaemia of chronic kidney disease in adults on dialysis. In March 2022, the EMA validated the marketing authorisation application for daprodustat, which is currently under regulatory review with a decision anticipated mid-2023.Progressing towards a new treatment for cholestatic pruritus in primary in patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). This is a rare autoimmune liver disease affecting approximately 15 per 100,000 people. Significant numbers of PBC patients suffer with cholestatic pruritus, a debilitating itch, and there has been no new pharmacologic therapy in this area in 60 years. Our development programme demonstrates how we are using digital technology to modernise drug development, using novel platforms to run our studies with the potential to increase trial diversity. An example of this is a new decentralised clinical trial(DCT) design with the potential to improve patient recruitment and retention in GLISTEN, the phase III trial of linerixibat for cholestatic pruritus in patients with PBC. This is an emerging trial model where assessment of patients can occur at a patient's own home, improving accessibility for patients who may not live near to a specialist. This is a first and we expect this innovation to continue. Linerixibat has received Orphan Drug Designation in Europe and the US.

Vaccines turnover was \u00a37,937 million, up 17% at AER, 11% at CER in total, and up 24% at AER, 17% at CER excluding pandemic adjuvant sales. The performance reflected a favourable comparator, which was impacted by COVID-19 related disruptions in several markets primarily in H1 2021, and strong commercial execution of Shingrix , particularly in the US and Europe. Shingrix sales grew 72% at AER, 60% at CER to \u00a32,958 million. All regions grew significantly reflecting post-pandemic rebound, strong uptake and new market launches with more than half of the growth contributed from outside of the US. In the US, Shingrix grew 46% at AER, 32% at CER to \u00a31,964 million due to higher non-retail andretail demand and strong commercial execution. Germany and China contributed strongly to the Shingrix growth. Shingrix was launched in nine markets during 2022 and is now available in 26 countries.Meningitis vaccines sales grew 16% at AER, 11% at CER to \u00a31,116 million mainly driven by Bexsero up 16% at AER, 12% at CER to \u00a3753 million resulting from higher CDC demand and increased share in the US. Menveo sales were also up 27% AER, 18% CER to \u00a3345 million, primarily driven by post-pandemic vaccination catch-up and higher public demand in International, together with favourable pricing mix and share gain in the US. Fluarix /FluLaval sales grew by 5% AER but decreased 4% CER to \u00a3714 million, primarily driven by lower post-pandemic demand in Europe and the US, partly offset by lower expected returns in the US. Established Vaccines grew 4% AER but was stable at CER to \u00a33,085 million mainly resulting from supply constraints in MMR/Vvaccines and lower tender demand in International for Synflorix . This was offset by hepatitis vaccines demand rebound in the US and Europe and Boostrix post-pandemic demand recovery and increased share in the US. GSK Annual Report 2022 Performance: Vaccines continued 31 Pandemic vaccines decreased 86% AER and CER primarily reflecting comparison to 2021 pandemic adjuvant sales to the US and Canadian governments partly offset by GSK's share of 2022 contracted European volumes related to the COVID-19 booster vaccine developed through a collaboration with Sanofi Pasteur (Sanofi). Our strategy for growth Vaccines play a critical role in our growth. We aim to reach 1.3 billion people with vaccines by 2031, a significant contribution to our overall ambition to positively impact the health of 2.5 billion people. We will achieve this through growth of our existing adult and paediatric vaccines and new launches. Our focus is onaccelerating the vaccines pipeline, particularly RSV and MenABCWY, ensuring manufacturing capability and capacity for RSV, Shingrix and our established portfolio, and entering new markets. We also prioritise targeted business development which complements our existing vaccine portfolio and gives us access to new patients. Vaccines are complex and highly technical both to develop and manufacture. As such there is no established generic industry and they therefore do not generally face the so-called 'patent cliff'. This longer lifecycle means that vaccines can remain in use for decades after their initial authorisation. For example Boostrix , Infanrix , Priorix and Engerix are beyond their patents but remain important parts of our portfolio in terms of contribution to performance. And importantly, our vaccines have a strong efficacy profile with 90% ofour portfolio by sales having an efficacy level of above 90% - helping to protect our portfolio from potential disruption from new technologies. Our portfolio of more than 20 marketed vaccines is one of the industry's broadest, helping to protect people throughout their lives against diseases, including meningitis, shingles, flu, polio, measles and many more. We deliver one and a half million doses of our vaccines every day; and around 40% of the world's children receive a GSK vaccine each year. The full benefits of vaccination go beyond the health of individuals. Vaccination programmes help minimise health inequity and reducecosts to the healthcare system, potentially promoting economic growth and societal wellbeing. With our acquisition of Affinivax and, if we get approval, the future launch of our RSV vaccine for older adults, we are well positioned in the adult vaccination segment, which will be a key growth driver of the global vaccines market.Our established platform technologies, and the new platforms we're building, such as the MAPS and mRNA technologies, are a key part of our vaccines growth strategy and are enabling us to tackle the most complex diseases from birth throughout adulthood (see page 19). Drivers of growth across the portfolio Record annual sales for Shingrix were driven by strong demand in existing markets and geographic expansion. Shingrix continues to be recommended for adults and at-risk groups in countries around the world, driving its uptake. By 2024, we aim to have launched in 35 markets which make up about 90% of the vaccine market by value. We continue to strengthen our leadership position in meningitis vaccines with an aim to double sales by 2031 through continued market share growth, the geographic expansion of Bexsero and the anticipated launch of our pentavalent vaccine. During the year, France approved Bexsero for its National Immunisation Programme and we also launched Bexsero in Taiwan and received marketing authorisation in South Korea, making Bexsero available in a total of 50 countries. We remain committed to growing our established portfolio, which represents about half of our total vaccines business. We continue to seek to expand the availability of our vaccines in markets around the world; our lifecycle management strategy has strengthened our presence in the US. For example, Priorix , our measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, has been protecting people worldwide for 25 years; its launch in the US this year underscores how it remains an important part of our established portfolio. Also in the US, we received FDA approval for fully liquid formulations of Rotarix , our rotavirus vaccine and Menveo , our meningitis ACWY vaccine. We were also first to receive FDA approval for a vaccine given inpregnancy, Boostrix maternal, which can be administered in the third trimester to help prevent whooping cough in young babies (see page 22). GSK Annual Report 2022 Performance: Vaccines continued 32 Meeting the needs of healthcare professionals and patients (HCPs) From the age of about 50, our immune system starts to decline and becomes less effective, leading to increased vulnerability to infectious diseases. Given this, we are focusing our efforts on helping to keep older adults healthy. We want to improve physician-patient dialogue on vaccination, to raise awareness in adults of vaccine-preventable diseases and to increase access to vaccination beyond the physician's office. Our Vaccine Study 2022 Report explored attitudes and beliefs of HCPs and those over 50 years to vaccination. The study showed that HCPs are a patient's number one source of information about vaccines. But HCPs can't always meet their patients' needs because they lack time, want to avoid conflict or don't have enough information and training. To ease some of the pressure on HCPs, we've started a digital channel partnership with NextDoor in the US, providing vaccination information directly to patients. We've also launched a consumer campaign about the importance of vaccination. We're working directly with HCPs through a series of Vaccinology Master Classes, helping to better equip them for conversations with their patients about vaccines. With US research company IQVIA, we also launched Vaccine Track, a data platform to help improve adult vaccination nationwide. The platform gives HCPs information about the uptake of recommended adult immunisations. With this data, HCPs can target their efforts to increase discussion about vaccination and improve coverage in areas showing a relative decline in immunisation. We're working with expert groups on adult vaccination calendars which show HCPs and their patients which vaccines they're eligible for. In 2022, we launched a first-ever shingles awareness week with the International Federation on Ageing, reaching more than 900 million people globally. Such campaigns remain an important way of increasing awareness of vaccine preventable diseases, prompting patients to seek HCP guidance on next steps, including preventative options. Globally, governments, policymakers and healthcare providers are recognising the potential advantages of having increased access to vaccination through additional channels such as vaccination centres as well as retail pharmacies. We're working with pharmacy chains to provide information for patients as they consider their vaccination options.Strengthening our manufacturing network to support vaccines growth In 2022, our 12 manufacturing sites in nine countries produced and delivered over 500 million vaccine doses. This was despite supply challenges with incoming materials and shipping impacts caused by COVID-19, the global economic environment and the conflict in Ukraine. Our sites are routinely inspected by multiple regulatory agencies. In 2022, there were 45 inspections by health authorities across our manufacturing sites. We are preparing our manufacturing and supply capabilities to support both our inline product growth and our pipeline products pending approval. This includes our RSV vaccine for older adults. In 2022, the RSV production facility in Wavre, Belgium, produced the first doses for the market at a 100% success rate. To be ready for demand, we announced a \u20ac70 million investment in a second manufacturing facility for RSV antigen production in Belgium. Also in Belgium, we invested in more capacity for lyophilised products as well as building our internal mRNA capabilities. Following the acquisition of Affinivax, we are adding MAPS to our production technology platforms by using capabilities at our Singapore site as well as new investments at GSK Binney Street in Cambridge, Boston. Overall, we're focused on increasing the control and robustness of our supply chain. A good example of this is the manufacturing of key adjuvants (AS01, AS03). We've brought production of MPL and QS21 (components of AS01) in-house at Hamilton. We've alsoformulated over 200 batches of adjuvant in Belgium since 2020 for current and future key assets such as Shingrix , Mosquirix or our RSV candidate vaccine for older adults. Throughout the year we invested in modernising, digitising and automating our manufacturing network. For example, our quality control laboratories at all our sites went completely paperless. We'll transition more than 50 production lines at 10 sites to electronic batch records by 2025 as we build on our digital capability for better operational efficiency, compliance, yield and shorter lead times.

Specialty Medicines, excluding sales of Xevudy , were \u00a38,960 million up 23% at AER, 15% at CER. HIV sales were \u00a35,749 million with growth of 20% at AER, 12% at CER. The performance benefited from strong patient demand for the new HIV medicines approximately three quarters of the growth. US pricing favourability and year-end inventory build together contributed one third of the growth which was partially offset by International tender decline.New HIV products delivered sales of over two billion to \u00a32,474 million, up 78% at AER, 67% at CER, representing 43% of the total HIV portfolio compared to 29% last year. Growth was primarily driven by sales of Dovato and Cabenuva . Dovato recorded sales of \u00a31,375 million up 75% at AER and 65% at CER and Cabenuva recorded sales of \u00a3340 million. Apretude delivered sales of \u00a341 million. Immuno-inflammation, Respiratory and Other sales were \u00a32,609 million up 29% at AER, 20% at CER on strong performance of Benlysta and Nucala . Benlysta sales were \u00a31,146 million, up 31% at AER, 20% at CER, representing strong underlying demand in US and worldwide. Nucala sales were \u00a31,423 million, up 25% at AER, 18% at CER, reflecting continued strong patient demand and the launch of additional indications. GSK Annual Report 2022 Performance: Specialty Medicines continued 35 Oncology sales were \u00a3602 million, up 23% at AER, 17% at CER. Zejula sales of \u00a3463 million were up 17% at AER, 12% at CER driven by the first-line indication, but with diagnosis and treatment rates continuing to be impacted by the pandemic especially in the US. Sales of Blenrep of \u00a3118 million grew 33% at AER, 25% at CER, and included the impact of withdrawal from US market in Q4 2022. Sales of Xevudy were \u00a32,309 million, compared to \u00a3958 million sales in 2021. Sales were delivered in all regions, comprising \u00a3828 million in the US, \u00a3456 million in Europe, and \u00a31,025 million in International. Our strategy for growth Our portfolio of Specialty Medicines is focused on four therapeuticareas: infectious diseases, HIV, immunology/respiratory and oncology. We're leaders in infectious diseases and HIV innovation and we're also building our positions in immunology and oncology. In the next five years, we expect Specialty Medicines and HIV as a part of Specialty to continue to be an important part of our growth. The increasing convergence of disease prevention and treatment and our expertise in vaccines and medicines mean we are uniquely placed to focus on connections between treatment and prevention. We do this by accelerating our pipeline as well as prioritising strategic business development which complements are existing portfolio, such as our acquisition of Sierra Oncology and global licence agreement with Mersana Therapeutics. Drivers of growth across the portfolio In HIV, our strategy for growth now and in the future is built on our innovative portfolio of medicines that are transforming the HIV treatment and prevention landscape. - Launched in 2019, our dolutegravir-based two-drug regimen, Dovato , continues to build positive momentum, benefiting over 143,000 people living with HIV globally and delivering \u00a31,375 million of revenue in 2022. - Our long-acting therapies are also central to our growth and are delivering results as they launch across our markets. - In 2021 we launched the only long-acting treatment regimen, Cabenuva (known as Vocabria + Rekambys in Europe and other markets). Non-inferior to daily anti-viral therapy and dosed onceevery two months, Cabenuva addresses the challenges associated with daily oral therapy of stigma, adherence and daily pill fatigue. - In January 2022 we launched Apretude in the US. It's the only long-acting medicine for HIV prevention offering superior efficacy to daily oral prevention (FTC/TDF tablets) and two-monthly dosing. The launch was supported by a direct-to-consumer campaign, as well as innovative community-driven interventions focused on reaching key populations who could benefit most from a preventative option. - By 2026 we estimate our long-acting regimens Cabenuva and Apretude will generate around \u00a32 billion of sales, representing around a third of HIV net sales.In immunology/respiratory, we continue to see strong demand from Benlysta . -Benlysta for systemic lupus erythematosus and lupus nephritis in adults and children continues to perform strongly, with around 9,000 US patients initiating therapy in 2022. It also became China's only biologic medicine of its kind, helping around 12,500 patients in 2022. We're focused on supporting earlier identification and greater urgency to treat patients before lupus progresses and organ damage occurs (see page 24) -Nucala , the only targeted biologic therapy approved for use across four eosinophilic diseases, continues to be a driver of growth. We expanded access to Nucala in 2022 with approvals in Europe, Japan and the US for a 40mg syringe for use at home with children. This follows earlier approvals for at-home use for adults. The evidence behind Nucala continues to grow, and in 2022 we shared two-year data from REALITI-A, the real-world study with Nucala in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma, demonstrating how IL-5 inhibition in everyday practice can help to achieve treatment goals. Our pioneering work in IL-5 inhibition continues with the research into depemokimab, a monoclonal antibody specifically engineered with an increased affinity for IL-5 and a longer duration of action to allow longer periods of time between injections (see page 24) In oncology, Zejula is the only monotherapy PARP inhibitor approved in first-line therapy for newly diagnosed patients with advanced ovarian cancer, regardless of biomarker. This group of patients represents a significant area of growth as healthcare providers are using PARPs more in a first-line setting. Since COVID-19 we have seen the number of patients presenting to theirdoctors with ovarian cancer symptoms decline and the volume of newly diagnosed ovarian cancer patients is 15-20% below pre-COVID (2019) monthly averages. We expect that numbers will increase again as patients return to normal health practices. We're now working to develop other combination therapies with Zejula (see page 26). Daprodustat, our treatment for anaemia of chronic kidney disease, is the market-leading and preferred HIF-PHI in Japan, where it's available as Duvroq . In February 2023 daprodustat was approved as Jesduvroq in the US for adults on dialysis. We are seeking approval in the EU and expect to have a decision mid-2023 (see page 27). Our COVID-19 treatment Xevudy , developed with Vir Biotechnology, continued to play an important role in pandemic response for vulnerable patients in 2022. To date we have delivered more than two million doses to over 30 countries, generating over \u00a33 billion in sales. GSK Annual Report 2022 Performance: Specialty Medicines continued 36 Building our commercial capabilities We are delivering growth across our portfolio by continuing to focus on disciplined commercial and medical execution, capability enhancement, competitive resourcing in customer-facing activity and rigorous investment allocation. Attaining and keeping leading positions in our markets means attracting and retaining the best people in our industry. We've focused on developing our leaders internally and we recruit specific marketing and commercial experts from outside the business. Over the last year, 67% of senior commercial leadership appointments in Specialty Medicines were internal. We recruited senior people externally to drive growth in oncology and supplement our specialty global marketing capability in our top 10 markets. We've also focused on strengthening sales execution capability in our markets. We appointed 16 general managers in 2022, bringing fresh leadership into 26% of these positions. Maintaining strong links with healthcare professionals and patients Connecting with HCPs and patients helps us to meet their needs. It also helps us to keep them informed about clinical data, products in our pipeline and upcoming launches. The more effectively weinteract, the better they understand the science behind our products, their benefits and how best to use them. We have scaled up our use of data-led omnichannel communication platforms to reach more patients face-to-face and digitally. To date, we've digitally enabled 27 brands and 447 campaigns across 44 markets, doubling our efforts compared to last year, and resulting in incremental growth and market share. Our use of digital, data and analytics in 2022 extends to drivingMedical Affairs effectiveness. Advanced analytics and text mining has produced medical insights which allow for high-quality scientificengagement with experts to improve patient outcomes. We'll continue to prioritise use of omnichannel communication platforms in Medical Affairs to engage HCPs on the latest scientific advances. Managing our global supply chain Our supply chain is a global network that enabled us to produce and deliver 1.8 billion packs in 2022. We've streamlined our network to make it smaller, more agile and more resilient, with the capacity and capability to bring the next generation of medicines to patients all over the globe. Amid geopolitical uncertainties, we're focused on the availability of energy and commodities, and on managing constraints around freight and other resources needed to supply medicines to patients.Despite these challenges, our programme of productivity and efficiency improvements remains on track. This year we delivered \u00a323 million in savings through the programme, taking the cumulative total to \u00a362 million. Our target for the programme is to deliver \u00a3119 million in savings by 2025. These savings support improvements in gross margin. We have 25 sites manufacturing medicines in our GSK network. Overall, site productivity has increased by 3.9% year on year over the last three years. Strengthening our manufacturing base Modern manufacturing facilities help us launch specialty medicinesquickly so we can build and strengthen our market positions and performance. In June 2022, we opened our new manufacturing facility at Barnard Castle in the UK. It is sustainably designed, paperless and fully automated, using robotic aseptic filling technology to increase efficiency. The facility will manufacture many of the existing and new biopharmaceutical assets in our pipeline. GSK Annual Report 2022 Performance: Specialty Medicines continued 37 We also opened our expanded facility at Upper Merion, Pennsylvania, which is now one of the most advanced single-use facilities for the manufacture of bulk drug substances and able to manufacture a wide range of biopharmaceutical pipeline assets, including monoclonal antibodies. Our expanded facility at Rockville, Maryland, is on target to start manufacturing in 2023. This facility combines single-use systems, large-scale stainless steel manufacturing and automation to produce our lupus treatment, Benlysta . The investment of more than $150 million will increase capacity at Rockville by around 50%. We're also investing over \u00a360 million in our new oral solid dose facility at Ware in the UK to help us deliver new products at pace, in partnership with R&D. Product performance qualification (thefirst set of batches that confirm the commercial manufacturing process performs as expected) is due to start in the second half of 2023. Streamlining our supply chain helps us control costs and allocate more capital to developing, launching and marketing medicines. This includes investing in AI/ML which helps us to optimise yield, inventory and on-time in-full (OTIF) delivery. Maintaining a consistent and reliable supply A reliable, high-quality supply of products is essential for us to meet patients' needs and maintain our performance. We routinelyupdate our quality management system (QMS) to keep pace with the evolving regulatory environment and new scientific understanding of our products and processes. We've also made our policies and procedures simpler to understand and implement. We've improved deviation rates, and reliability of supply remains strong with an OTIF measure of 97.2% across our full supply chain and 99.4% for Specialty Medicines. +For information on product governance and data on recalls, regulatory inspections and audits, see pages 49 and 50Supporting our Innovation ambition Our Specialty Medicines supply chain continues to support our innovation strategy by delivering launch products across therapy areas and regions worldwide. We are making our internal and external network flexible enough to enable on-time launches of our upcoming medicines. We're also working with R&D by investing in rapid knowledge transfer from chemistry manufacturing & control project teams to manufacturing sites. Following a successfully managed rapid launch of our COVID-19 therapeutic Xevudy (sotrovimab), by the end of 2022 over two million doses of Xevudy had been supplied globally. We are also preparing for the successful launch and supply of late-stage assets like daprodustat and momelotinib (if approved) in 2023. Our Specialty Medicines supply chain will support multiple late-stage clinical programmes and further upcoming launches in the secondhalf of 2023 and 2024. +For details about the General Medicines supply chain, see page 40 GSK Annual Report 2022 Commercial operations Performance: General Medicines From antibiotics to inhaled medicines for asthma and COPD, we have over 150 general medicine products, many of them leaders in their class, making life better for millions of people worldwide.

Respiratory sales were \u00a36,548 million, up 8% at AER, 3% at CER. The performance was driven by Trelegy sales of \u00a31,729 million, up 42% AER, 32% CER, including strong growth across all regions. Advair/Seretide sales of \u00a31,159 million decreased 15% at AER, 17% at CER predominantly reflecting the adverse impact of generic competition, with growth in certain International marketsdue to targeted promotion offsetting the decrease. Other General Medicines sales were \u00a33,570 million, decreasing 1% at AER, 2% at CER. Augmentin sales were \u00a3576 million, up 35% at AER, 38% at CER, reflecting the post-pandemic rebound of the antibiotic market since H2 2021 in the International and Europe regions.This partially offsets the ongoing adverse impact of generic competition, and approximately two percentage points impact at AER and CER from the divestment of cephalosporin products in Q4 2021. Our strategy for impact The General Medicines portfolio encompasses our primary care medicines from pre-launch R&D assets to growth and established products. In 2022, General Medicines contributed over one third of GSK's sales, helping to fuel growth and investment in R&D. Our combination of more than 150 products, several of which are market leaders, are expected to impact the lives of millions of patients over the next 10 years. Our products are supplied in more than 112 countries worldwide, delivering over 80% of our total medicines supply volume. Every day, these medicines improve health and make life better for millions of people all over the world. GSK Annual Report 2022 Performance: General Medicines continued 40 With expected growth from Trelegy , Anoro , the established products portfolio in emerging markets and, if successful, gepotidacin and, tebipenem, we are committed to positively impacting more lives every day. We continue to focus on maximising investment in our growth brands and new opportunities, while managing the expected decline of other products in mature markets as they lose their exclusivity. The decline in established products is well managed, through targeted investments towards growth opportunities and reflects continued strong demand for our core products. Drivers of growth across the portfolio Our main sources of growth in General Medicines in 2022 were Trelegy for asthma and COPD, has continued to accelerate strongly, with growth in all regions including the US and is the third biggest growth driver (excluding Xevudy ) across GSK's portfolio this year. Trelegy , is now prescribed in more than 63 countries, with dual indications in key markets. Several new approvals were received in 2022, further expanding Trelegy's availability to asthma patients in Argentina, Taiwan, New Zealand, Oman, Bahrain, South Korea and Kuwait, and COPD patients in Kuwait and Indonesia. Trelegy leads market share in our two largest markets, US and Japan, with market shares significantly exceeding the next largest competitor. In 2022 the competitive market position for Trelegy was further strengthened by a network meta-analysis of the triple therapy class demonstrating differentiation among the COPD single-inhaler triple therapies. We continue to expect Trelegy to be a key driver of growth in General Medicines in the coming years. Anoro is approved in approximately 70 countries for the treatment of symptomatic COPD. Anoro remains the global market leader in the LAMA/LABA class, with continued growth in global sales (ex-US). Anoro has a robust clinical data profile which includes head-to-head data within the LAMA/LABA class and versus other common initial maintenance therapy options, such as LAMA. Augmentin is a global leader in oral antibiotics and available in 95 countries. It has reached over 2.5 billion patients since launching 41 years ago, and continues to grow strongly in emerging markets. Augmentin grew 35% AER, 38% CER to \u00a3576 million with recovery in key emerging markets and Europe, recovering stronger than any competitor post-pandemic. Today, Augmentin is still being recognised for its impact and recently won the bronze in the bestpharmaceutical product category for the Prix Galien Golden Jubilee awards in October 2022. Two important products in our late-stage pipeline, anticipated to be future growth drivers for General Medicines, include gepotidacin, for uUTIs and urogenital gonorrhoea, and tebipenem stage licensed exclusively from Spero Therapeutics, that may treat cUTIs (see pages 20 and 22).Maximising commercial capabilities We have a targeted investment strategy to deliver returns, backing our largest opportunities, both branded and geographic, to maximise launches in new medicines and indications. In parallel, we target our investments appropriately to optimise returns in mature brands where there is a broader range of opportunity and risk. We continue to invest in omnichannel and digital customer engagement. Digital plays an important role in how we connect with our customers, and this is especially important in General Medicines given our expansive global footprint. Our data-driven customer experience (DDCX) programme for Trelegy was recognised externally by the International Customer Experience Awards (iCXA) across all sectors. In 2021, among 120 companies and 353 initiatives entered, we won three silver awards for Trelegy competing across all industries, in the following categories: - Best Business-to-Business Customer Experience Strategy - Business Change and Transformation - Customer Experience Team of the Year Maintaining an efficient supply chain Demand for many products in our General Medicines portfolio increased significantly as COVID-19 lockdowns lifted and global markets recovered from the effects of the pandemic. We increased packs supplied from 1.60 billion in 2021 to 1.64 billion in 2022. This growth demonstrated the resilience of our General Medicines brands. We anticipate this further increasing to 1.67 billion in 2023. To keep our supply chain lean, we continue to simplify our portfolio by standardising packaging and formats and discontinuing products. By the end of 2022, General Medicines had reduced the number of brands in the portfolio by a further 9% from 194 to 177, and we plan to further discontinue non-priority brands in 2023. We have also taken key decisions as part of our focus on productivity and efficiency, for example to outsource the manufacture of amoxicillin. We rigorously benchmark the performance of our General Medicines supply chain against the competition and make thoughtful choices on how we optimise both our cost and cash footprint for the portfolio. +For more about our global supply chain, which also covers Specialty Medicines, see pages 36 and 37 GSK Annual Report 2022 Responsible business Our approach to ESG is an integral part of our strategy and investment case. It helps us build trust and create value for our shareholders and society - so we can get ahead of disease together. GSK Annual Report 2022 42Responsible business External benchmarking Detailed below is how we perform in key ESG ratings that we are frequently asked about by investors: -Access to Medicines: Ranked 1st in the Access to Medicines Index in 2022 and an industry leader in the 2021 AntimicrobialResistance Benchmark -S&P Corporate Sustainability Assessment: Ranked 2nd in the pharmaceuticals industry with a score of 86 (as at 17 February 2023) and included in the DJSI World and Europe indices -FTSE4Good: Member of FTSE4Good Index since 2004 -CDP: A- in Climate change, B in Water security, A- in Forests (palm oil) and B in Forests (timber) -Sustainalytics: Low risk rating -MSCI: AA rating -Moody's ESG solutions: Ranked 2nd in the pharmaceuticals sector -ISS Corporate Rating: B+ rating +For full details of progress against our six focus areas, our latest materiality assessment and our ESG Performance Rating and 23 metrics, please see our ESG Performance Report Being a responsible business means getting ahead of disease together in the right way. We therefore need to consider ESG impacts across everything we do, from the lab to the patient. That's why ESG is embedded in our strategy and supports our sustainable performance and long-term growth. It helps us build trust with and deliver returns to our stakeholders, reduce risk to our operations and deliver positive social impact. Our six ESG focus areas We can only deliver on our purpose if we embed ESG intoeverything that we do. We have identified six ESG focus areas that address what is most material to our business and the issues that matter to our stakeholders. These focus areas are core to our strategy and are the areas where we can have the greatest positive impact on some of society's most urgent challenges. These focus areas are: - Access to healthcare - Global health and health security - Environment - Diversity, equity and inclusion - Ethical standards - Product governance Our approach is guided by extensive stakeholder engagement and the key issues relevant to our industry and company. The results ofour most recent materiality assessment reaffirmed that the most material issues for our business were well aligned with our six ESG focus areas. We are aware, however, that being a responsible business is not a static requirement and our operating environment continues to change at pace. We will continue to adapt, respond and proactively change our approach, to ensure GSK continues to deliver strong ESG performance. Our ESG Performance Rating To support the integration of ESG into strategy delivery and to make our ESG performance measurable and verifiable, we have introduced a new ESG Performance Rating. The rating is one of our corporate KPIs and measures progress against key metrics aligned to each of our six focus areas. In 2022, this included 23 metrics, and we cover our performance against these in this section of the report.The metrics were developed with stakeholder input, and our understanding of the key issues for our industry and our company. We are committed to ensuring that our ESG Performance Rating responds to stakeholder expectations, so we will continue to review the metrics as our business and external expectations change. To create the ESG Performance Rating, management sought metrics that: - Are well defined to ensure we have a standardised approach - Can be used consistently in future years - Are ambitious and achievable - Can be externally assured - Are meaningful for stakeholders How we assess performance GLT is accountable for delivering progress against the metrics and regularly reviews performance along with the Board's Corporate Responsibility Committee (CRC). Each individual metric is assessed as either: on track (metric met or exceeded); on track with work to do (at least 80% of metric has been achieved); or off track (metric missed by more than 20%). In addition, in order to calculate the overall ESG Performance Rating, performance across all metrics is aggregated to a single score to illustrate whether we are on track, on track with work to do, or off track. This rating is defined below: On track: 70% of all metrics are on track On track with work to do: more than 50% of all metrics are either on track, or on track with work to do Off track: more than 50% of all metrics are off track 2022 ESG Performance Rating Our 2022 ESG Performance Rating is on track , based on 83% of all performance metrics being met or exceeded. Assessment of performance against our annual targets has been reviewed, and the overall ESG Performance Rating score has been externally assured for 2022. GSK Annual Report 2022 Responsible business continued 43 Access Our ambition is to positively impact the health of 2.5 billion people by the end of 2030. We will achieve this by developing vaccines and medicines and making them available through responsible pricing, strategic access programmes and partnerships. Our commitment Make our products available at value-based prices that are sustainable for our business and implement access strategies that increase the use of our medicines and vaccines to treat and protect underserved people. How we assess performance - Develop and externally publish pricing and access principles - Progress towards our 2030 goal of reaching 1.3 billion people in lower income countries with our products Progress in 2022 Putting the right value on innovation We follow a set of pricing and access principles, published for the first time in 2022. These help us to get the balance right between responsible pricing and a sustainable, profitable business that allows us to re-invest financial returns in future innovation, while ensuring people can access medicines and vaccines. In 2022, in the US, through GSK and ViiV Healthcare's Patient Assistance Programs Foundation, we provided prescribed medicines and vaccines to more than 78,000 low-income uninsured, underinsured and Medicare Part D patients. In the US, during the year, our combined average net price (after discounts, rebates or other allowances) for our pharmaceutical and vaccines portfolio increased by 1.4%, while the average list price increased by 3.8% compared to 4.9% (list) for the industry, which demonstrates we are responsible in our pricing decisions1. Over the past five years, the average net price for our products decreased by 1.1% annually, while the average list price rose by 3.9% compared to 5.0% (list) for the industry1. Reaching patients in lower income countries Our goal is to reach 1.3 billion people in lower income countries with our products by the end of 2030, through access initiatives such as voluntary licensing, donations and our work with Gavi, theVaccine Alliance. In 2022, we reached 73 million people with our products and supplied an additional 533 million doses of albendazole 2. In 2022, we ranked first in the Access to Medicines Index for the eighth consecutive time. 1 Industry averages are sourced from Drug Channels annual brand-name drug list change report 2 The 73 million figure includes people reached with Synflorix , Rotarix , Cervarix , OPV and people with access to a generic dolutegravir product through our voluntary licensing agreements; however it does notinclude people reached through albendazole, for which an assessment will bemade in 2025 by the WHO and GSKVaccines We have been a partner with Gavi since its foundation in 2000. We reserve our lowest vaccine prices for Gavi and similar organisations and, in 2022, we passed the milestone of supplying Gavi with more than one billion vaccines since 2010. Our partnership includes supplying Cervarix , a critical vaccine in lower income countries for addressing cervical cancer. In 2022, we supplied around 40 million doses of our pneumococcal vaccine, Synflorix , to eight Gavi-eligible countries at our lowest price. Our Rotarix vaccine against rotavirus reaches children across 27 Gavi- eligible countries and four former Gavi countries. Since March 2021, as well as Synflorix , we have also offered Rotarix through the Humanitarian Mechanism, to civil society organisations serving refugees and working in other emergency situations. We are also a long-standing supplier of oral polio vaccines (OPV) through UNICEF and, in 2022 alone, supplied around 95 million doses to help eradicate polio. Neglected tropical diseases In 2022, we donated 533 million doses of albendazole, a medicine used to help eliminate lymphatic filariasis and treat soil-transmitted helminths. We have also extended our soil-transmitted helminths commitment to include preschool children and made an additional commitment to donate albendazole for treatment of echinococcosis. HIV In 2022, ViiV Healthcare and the Medicines Patent Pool (MPP) signed a new voluntary licensing agreement to allow generic manufacturers to develop, manufacture and supply cabotegravir long-acting for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis. ViiV Healthcare also has voluntary licensing agreements with 17 generic manufacturers to produce and sell low-cost single or fixed- dose combination products containing our HIV medicine dolutegravir for adults in 95 low- and middle-income countries, with one direct licence and the others via the MPP. There are similar agreements with 14 generic manufacturers for children, covering 123 countries. As a result of these voluntary licence agreements, around 21 million people living with HIV across 122 countries had access to a generic product containing dolutegravir by the end of 2022. This is at least 80% of people living with HIV on antiretrovirals in low- and middle- income countries. In 2022, ViiV Healthcare donated around 7,200 packs of antiretroviral medicines to NGO partners and national HIV and AIDSprogrammes to support people living with HIV who have been impacted by the conflict in Ukraine. ViiV has also provided over \u00a3800,000 through its Positive Action programme to support 11 community-based organisations with humanitarian response activities, both within Ukraine and in surrounding countries hosting refugees. GSK Annual Report 2022 Responsible business continued 44 Global health and health security Positive Action, ViiV Healthcare's community grant-giving programme, celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2022 with a year- long campaign to showcase the people at the heart of the programme, the partners in implementation and the progress made through collaboration. It invested more than \u00a312.6 million in 2022, reaching approximately 392,000 people and providing 137 grants across 33 countries. Malaria Working with our partners, more than 1.2 million children in Africa have now received at least one dose of our malaria vaccine, Mosquirix (RTS,S/AS01 E). In September 2022, the WHO awarded pre-qualification to the vaccine. This is a prerequisite for UN agencies to procure the vaccine, andan important step in rolling it out in countries with moderate to high P. falciparum malaria transmission. GSK, PATH and Bharat Biotech have agreed a product transfer to help ensure long-term supply of the RTS,S malaria vaccine. We have committed to supply up to 18 million doses over the next three years, in addition to our donation of up to 10 million doses to the WHO-coordinated Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi. +For full details of our progress against our six focus areas, please see our ESG Performance Report We use our expertise to address the biggest health challenges for underserved people around the world. Our commitment To develop novel products and technologies to treat and prevent priority diseases, including pandemic threats. How we assess performance - Progress three Global Health pipeline assets to address priority WHO diseases Progress in 2022 Global health R&D In June 2022, GSK, including ViiV Healthcare, announced a \u00a31 billion investment in R&D to help us get ahead of infectious diseases in lower income countries. The 10-year investment will support R&D on new medicines and vaccines to prevent and treat tuberculosis (TB), malaria, HIV, enteric diseases, and neglected tropical diseases, and to reduce AMR. In 2022, we progressed 12 Global Health pipeline assets to address priority WHO diseases, including malaria and TB, exceeding our target of three. We want to discover shorter, simpler and safer treatments for TB. In 2022, alongside our partners and through public-private research consortiums, we continued to progress our pipeline of novel TB medicines. In 2022, we announced positive phase IIastudy results for GSK3036656, a new first-in-class candidate medicine for patients with TB. Results of the study demonstrated the potential for the candidate to become a component of simpler treatment regimens in the future. In partnership with BioVersys, the University of Lille and the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) project, TRIC-TB, we also successfully completed phase I trials of BVL-GSK098, which has the potential to help tackle drug resistance by boosting the activity of an existing antibiotic. With our partners, we've brought two products for the prevention and treatment of malaria to market - the world's first vaccineagainst malaria, and a single-dose, radical cure for P. vivax malaria.In March 2022, the Australian regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, approved the use of single-dose medicine tafenoquine in children aged two and above in combination with chloroquine for the radical cure of P. vivax malaria. The FDA approved Triumeq PD, the first dispersible single tablet formulation containing dolutegravir for children weighing more than 10kg, which increases the age-appropriate treatment options for children living with HIV. At the end of 2022, the CHMP of the EMA also issued a positive opinion recommending marketing authorisation for Triumeq PD for children 14kg and above. Invasive non-typhoidal salmonella disease can be life-threatening for children in Africa and is a key driver of AMR. We're using our innovative vaccine technology in partnership with the University of Oxford and Vacc-iNTS, to develop a potential candidate vaccine using our Generalised Modules for Membrane Antigens technology. To help support global R&D, in December 2022, we announced the fourth call for proposals as part of the Africa Open Lab. The call for proposals is aimed at African early-career scientists who are based in sub-Saharan Africa, with a focus on infectious diseases which disproportionately affect sub-Saharan populations, such as malaria, TB and neglected tropical diseases. Getting ahead of antimicrobial resistance We have more than 30 R&D projects across medicines and vaccines that are relevant to AMR, ranging from early- to late-stage development. These include gepotidacin, which could be the first novel oral antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated urinary tract infections in over 20 years; and in 2022, we announced an exclusive licence agreement with Spero Therapeutics for tebipenem HBr, a late-stage antibiotic that may treat complicated urinary tractinfections. 13 of these projects target pathogens deemed 'critical' or 'urgent' by the WHO and the US CDC. See page 22 for more about our R&D pipeline. GSK Annual Report 2022 Responsible business continued 45 Environment Surveillance is central to tackling AMR. In 2022, we shared data from our long-running Survey of Antibiotic Resistance (SOAR) study, which tracks community-acquired respiratory infections, with the new AMR Register, developed by Vivli. In 2022, we also worked with the AMR Industry Alliance to publish a new Antibiotic Manufacturing Standard. This provides clear guidance to manufacturers in the global antibiotic supply chain to help ensure that their antibiotics are made responsibly and in compliance with scientifically robust discharge limits. +For full details of our progress against our six focus areas, please see our ESG Performance Report Future pandemic preparedness In July 2022, GSK, along with other major biopharmaceutical companies, signed up to the Berlin Declaration. This sets out the industry's vision for equitable access during future pandemics. The declaration stated the sector's willingness to reserve anallocation of real-time production of medicines and vaccines for distribution to priority populations, as determined by health authorities, during future pandemics. In 2022, GSK concluded a series of contracts under which we would provide at least 200 million doses of pandemic influenza vaccine to governments around the world. In February 2022, we extended our pandemic influenza vaccine stockpile contract with the United States government. This was followed by a renewed agreement, in June 2022, for supply ofpandemic influenza vaccines to the WHO, and in July 2022, a contract with the government of Canada for both seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines. We signed an agreement with Europe for the reservation and future production and supply of pandemic influenza vaccines. We are also continuing to partner with the BARDA to manufacture and assess the safety and immunogenicity of pandemic influenza vaccine candidates. We continue to work hard to do more to protect the environment, often in partnership with others. We've set clear and measurable targets to help achieve our goals. Our commitment Commit to a net zero, nature positive, healthier planet, with ambitious goals set for 2030 and 2045. How we assess performance The following metrics are included in our ESG Performance Rating and support delivery of our carbon and nature ambitions: - Climate - Operational emissions reduction (scope 1 and 2 market-based emissions) - Industrialisation of green Ventolin initiated, and clinical and non-clinical data available to support regulatory submissions - Percentage of carbon offset volume in project pipeline - Water - Average of the percentage of GSK sites and suppliers compliant with wastewater active pharmaceutical ingredient limits and the percentage of suppliers that are compliant with the AMR Industry Alliance Common Antibiotic Manufacturing Framework and discharge limits- Waste and materials - Operational waste and material reduction at our sites - Biodiversity - Number of high-risk materials implementing sustainable sourcing roadmaps Progress in 2022 Climate We have set a clear pathway to a net zero impact on climate with ambitious goals for 2030 and 2045. We have updated our climate targets to be in line with the new Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) Net-Zero Standard. By 2030, we aim to reduce carbon emissions across all scopes by 80%, against a 2020 baseline, with the remaining 20% offset through investment in high-quality nature- based solutions. We have also now set a longer-term target to reduce carbon emissions by at least 90% with the remainder tackled through high-quality offsets by 2045. For additional context on these changes see pages 16 and 17 of the ESG Performance Report. Targets1: - 80% reduction in carbon emissions and investment in nature- based solutions for the remaining 20% of our footprint by 2030 (all scopes)2 - 100% renewable electricity by 2025 (scope 2) - Net zero emissions across our full value chain by 2045 (all scopes)3 1 Targets are measured against a 2020 baseline 2 Previously stated as net zero by 2030 3 This is a new longer-term target, aligned to the SBTi Net-Zero Standard definition of net zero GSK Annual Report 2022 Responsible business continued 46 Performance In 2022, we reduced our scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions by 6% compared with 2021. This was primarily through increasing our use of renewable electricity and continued delivery of energy efficiencyacross our sites, such as the installation of new solar panels, upgraded lighting and replacing chillers to reduce the use of ozone depleting refrigerant. As a member of RE100, we have committed to source 100% renewable electricity by 2025. In 2022, we reached 73%, an increase of 6% since 2021 and 28% since 2020. Following the demerger of our Consumer Healthcare business, we are restating our value chain carbon footprint for our baseline year 2020. In 2021 (our latest available data), our scope 3 emissions reduced by 13% compared with 2020. These reductions reflect the evolution of our product portfolio. Approximately 29% of our total emissions footprint comes from the goods and services that we buy. In September 2022, we launched a Sustainable Procurement Programme, which will require oursuppliers to, among other things, disclose emissions, set carbon reduction targets aligned with 1.5 oC, and switch to renewable power and heat. We are also working with our peers through the Energize programme to encourage the use of renewable energy throughout the pharmaceutical sector's supply chain. In 2022, nine suppliers formed the first Energize buyer's cohort, who together will purchase two terawatt-hours of renewable electricity. See pages 55 to 62 for our disclosure on climate risk and resilience in line with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework. Nature We are committed to working towards our goal of having a net positive impact on nature by 2030, by reducing our environmental impacts across water, waste and materials, and biodiversity and by investing in protecting and restoring nature. Targets1: - Achieve good water stewardship at 100% of our sites by 20252 - Reduce overall water use in our operations by 20% by 2030 - Be water neutral in our own operations and at key suppliers in water-stressed regions by 20302 - Zero impact active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) levels for all sites and key suppliers by 20303 - Zero operational waste, including eliminating single-use plastics, by 20304 1 Targets are measured against a 2020 baseline 2 See our Environment Basis of reporting for definition 3 Zero impact against predicted no effect concentrations 4 Where regulatory obligations allow, and excluding plastics which are critical to product discovery and development and health & safety- 25% environmental impact reduction for our products and packaging by 2030 - 10% waste reduction from our supply chain by 2030 - Positive impact on biodiversity at all sites by 2030 - 100% agricultural, forestry and marine-derived deforestation free by 2030 PerformanceIn 2022, we reduced overall water use in our operations by 5% since 2021 and by 1% in sites in high water stress regions. This is a decrease of 23% for overall water use and 6% for sites in high water stress regions against our 2020 baseline. This achieved our 2030 overall water use reduction target, which we will now review. 100% of our sites are now good water stewards, in line with the Alliance for Water Stewardship's definition. We have initially identified three water basins in water-stressed areas in Algeria, India and Pakistan where we have manufacturing sites, and where we aim to be water neutral. At our manufacturing facility in Nashik, India, we have built plants for rainwater harvesting. In 2022, 100% of our sites and 98% of our suppliers that manufacture antibiotics complied with AMR Alliance industry standards on safe discharges. In 2022, we continued to reduce the waste from our sites and increase the amount of materials recovered through circular routes like reuse or recycling. We are also targeting materials across our existing product portfolio. We are progressing our plans for net positive biodiversity at our own sites by investing in individual site action plans that improve habitats, protect species and improve soil and water quality. In 2022, we completed baseline biodiversity assessments for 80% of our sites. We have commenced biodiversity uplift projects at our three largest R&D facilities. We have also completed a full assessment of our biodiversity impact (across the entire value chain) and will be taking targeted actions to address the highly-stressed areas. In the lead-up to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, the critical COP15 conference in Canada at the end of 2022, we worked with partners to call for mandatory disclosure by businesses and financial institutions of their impacts and dependencies on nature. We are part of the LEAF Coalition (Lowering Emissions by Accelerating Forest finance), a private-public effort to protect tropical forests. We are also testing a framework for voluntary carbon credits from the Voluntary Carbon Market Integrity Initiative, which is working to establish a globally-standardised benchmark to guide the use of carbon credits by companies. See pages 62 to 63 for how we plan to disclose on our impacts and dependencies on nature in line with the emerging Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) framework. +For full details of our progress against our six focus areas, please see our ESG Performance Report GSK Annual Report 2022 Responsible business continued 47 Diversity, equity and inclusion Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) are central to our purpose of getting ahead of disease together. Being an inclusive and diverse business - and doing business inclusively - makes us more successful, making the most of our people's potential and increasing our positive impact. Our commitment Create a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace; enhance recruitment of diverse patient populations in our clinical trials; and support diverse communities. How we assess performance - 75% of phase III trials initiated in 2022 will have proactive plans in place designed to enrol appropriately diverse trial participants, consistent with disease epidemiology - Performance towards 2025 aspirations through fair and equitable opportunities: - have women hold at least 45% of VP-and-above roles globally by the end of 2025 - have at least 30% ethnically diverse leaders in our roles at VP and above in the US, and increase the percentage of Black or African American, and Hispanic or Latinx VP-and-above leaders year on year - have at least 18% ethnically diverse leaders in our roles at VP and above in the UK, and increase the percentage of Black VP-and-above leaders year on year - Improve year-on-year spend with certified US-based diverse- owned suppliers Progress in 2022 Building an inclusive business We are committed to improving diversity in clinical trial enrolment and are already using our disease insights to set diversity enrolment goals. At the end of 2022, 100% of GSK's phase III trials had a diversity plan in place to enrol the groups most affected by the disease being studied, based on epidemiology data. For example, in our hepatitis B trials, a disease that disproportionately affects people of African and Asian descent, 52% of participants are of Asian origin, and we are actively working to improve the representation of participants of African descent. Our supplier diversity programme is well established in the US, and an expansion plan is being developed for the UK. We have a target to increase spend annually with certified US-based diverse- owned suppliers. This was significantly exceeded in 2022 through a combination of spend increases with selected suppliers in marketing, sales and technology, as well as identification of new global diverse suppliers and a strong multi-year strategy of engagement with key advocacy groups.Our GSK Science in the Summer initiative offers free, hands-on STEM learning to students in traditionally under-represented groups in STEM careers or from under-resourced communities in the US. In 2022, it reached more than 30,000 students nationwide. Nurturing all our people In 2022, 42% of women held VP-and-above roles globally, compared with 40% in 2021. Women made up 47% of all employees in 2022, and 50% of all management roles. We published our sixth UK gender pay gap report in 2022. Our gender pay gap for all permanent UK-based GSK employees is -1.36% (mean), compared to the national average of 13.9%. We published our first UK ethnicity pay gap report for 2022 using the same approach as our gender pay gap. Our ethnicity pay gap for all permanent UK-based GSK employees is 0.06% (mean), at this time there is no national average comparator. In those countries that meet our criteria for data confidentiality and anonymity, we disclose the race and ethnicity of our people at each level and set aspirational targets. Currently, the US and the UK meet those criteria. In the US in 2022, we have 31.3% of ethnically diverse leaders at VP level and above, reaching our 2025 aspirational target of at least 30%, and increasing the percentage of Black or African American and Hispanic or Latinx people in those roles year on year. In the UK in 2022, we have 14.3% of ethnically diverse leaders at VP and above, continuing to make progress towards our 2025 aspirational target of reaching at least 18%. Black representation at VP and above remains flat and we will be focused in our efforts to achieve our aspiration for year-on-year growth. We are members of the UK government's Disability Confident scheme and are an active member of the Valuable 500 pledge, a grouping of 500 global companies committed to placing disabilityinclusion on the leadership agenda. We are delivering on the scheme's objectives through our long-term, measurable, disability confidence plan, which includes educating our people on the issue. In 2022, we introduced a new global minimum standard of 18 weeks' parental leave for primary and secondary carers for all forms of family, a new global minimum standard for care of a family member for end of life or serious health emergencies, insured benefits to include same sex partners wherever possible, a new financial wellbeing service and mental health training - available to everyone. This year, we were recognised as a Gold employer within Stonewall's Top Global Employers Index. Our Allyship programmereceived an award recognising the tangible impact the campaign has had on the lives of LGBT+ employees. We also achieved the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's Best Places to Work for LGBT+ Equality standard in 2022. +For full details of our progress against our six focus areas, please see our ESG Performance Report GSK Annual Report 2022 Responsible business continued 48 Ethical standards Our culture guides our people to do the right thing and Speak Up about any concerns they have. It is important that all our people live up to this, and we expect the same of our suppliers. Our commitment Promote ethical behaviour across our business by supporting ouremployees to do the right thing and working with suppliers that share our standards and operate in a responsible way. How we assess performance - 100% of employees and complementary workers complete GSK's 2022 mandatory training - Percentage of employees who believe they 'can and do Speak Up if things don't feel right' is above the general industry benchmark1 - Number of employees leaving GSK's employment for misconduct in the last 12 months versus the three-year rolling average - 80% of direct high-risk suppliers achieve GSK's minimum EcoVadis score or have an improvement plan in place Progress in 2022 Supporting GSK people to do the right thing In 2022, we launched our new Code of Conduct which reflects our purpose to unite science, technology and talent to get ahead of disease together. Our new Code sets out the commitments we make as a company and to each other to deliver on our purpose and ambitions. In 2022, 100% of employees and 98% of complementary workers completed the accompanying global mandatory learning curriculum where due by year end. Those in certain high-risk roles or geographic regions also complete additional anti-bribery and corruption (ABAC) training. In 2022, 100% of employees and 96% of complementary workers completed this training where due by year end. Our approach to managing ABAC risk, and other risks relating to ethical standards, forms part of our well embedded risk management framework, which is described in detail on pages 51 to 52. Reporting and investigating concerns This year, we have updated how we report the breakdown of types of policy violations to provide more granularity by case class. In 2022, we saw an overall decrease in disciplinary cases, attributed to, in part, a revision to our procedures for discipline regarding latecompletion of mandatory training, now reported under the employee conduct category. 1 The general industry benchmark is 65% according to 2022 research by KornFerryUpholding our commitment to human rights We are signatories to the UN Global Compact and our Human Rights Position statement lays out our commitment to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. During the year, we established a Human Rights Steering Group, which has a formal reporting mechanism to the Board's Corporate Responsibility Committee. In 2022, we developed guidance to enhance supplier visits to help employees better understand labour and human rights non-compliances. To support this guidance, we also developed and delivered labour rights training to environment, health and safety(EHS) and procurement employees to better equip them to spot human rights issues when visiting suppliers. We are committed to the application of fair and equitable pay practices, which includes ensuring that all employees globally receive pay that is competitive in their local markets and sufficient to support a sustainable standard of living. In 2022, we completed the first global living wage review in partnership with the Fair Wage Foundation. We assessed the pay of all our employees (over 75,000 people in 87 countries) and differences were detected in fewer than 200 cases, in 11 countries. All necessary adjustments will be made by the end of the first quarter of 2023. We will be factoring the living wage data into our standard compensation processes to ensure that we continue to offer a fair wage, and have built an annual living wage review into our standard cycle. Working with third parties We expect our third parties to meet our ABAC and labour rights standards and to comply with our standards on quality, health and safety, and the environment. See pages 285 to 295 for furtherinformation. We updated our Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM) programme, which evaluates and mitigates risks introduced by third parties engaged by GSK to provide goods or services. In 2022, for our high-risk third parties - determined by location in high-risk markets and size of spend - we performed 7,168 assessments across 20 risk areas. Over 62% of these assessments presented risks in one or more areas. Most of these third parties are goods and services providers (77%), distributors and wholesalers (5%), contract manufacturers and suppliers (1%) and direct material suppliers (1%). We also use tools to assess how suppliers managerisks, including EcoVadis desktop assessments. GSK Annual Report 2022 Responsible business continued 49 Product governance We visit sites, in person or virtually, to help suppliers better understand and control their risks. The relaxation of travel restrictions has allowed us to increase in-person visits to identify and reduce risk, enabling us to conduct 50 physical visits across 63 priority suppliers this year1. We completed warehouse safety surveys for 54 priority suppliers, 38 contract manufacturing suppliers and 15 large warehouses that hold stock this year. These surveys have generated corrective and preventative action plans, all of which we expect to complete in 2023. In 2022, we conducted 47 supplier audits, compared with 49 in 2021, following industry standard Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative guidelines, with any corrective and preventative actions tracked to completion. We have also trained more than 600supplier employees on EHS and ESG fundamentals in 2022, revised EHS contractual obligations, tracked management actions to completion and have helped suppliers improve their EcoVadis scores 2. See page 293 for further information. Data and engagement We have created a new digital, privacy and information security team within Legal and Compliance, to streamline support and provide expertise around GSK's digital and data strategy.Privacy and the ethical use of data are part of the global mandatory learning curriculum Living our Code that all our people have to complete. We ensure that key privacy personnel have certifications and sufficient training and experience to carry out their roles effectively. We are investing in our AI/ML capability to, for example, help analyse patients' genetic data. We are mindful that AI and machine learning can raise ethical issues and are subject to evolving decisions from policymakers on how best to promote trust in these systems and avoid unintended outcomes or harmful impacts. In R&D, we have oversight boards and a new advisory panel that oversees controls to manage how we use or re-use data and respond to bioethical questions in our research activities. Political engagement As a major multinational company, we seek to contribute to public policy debate, especially in relation to life sciences and healthcare. In all of our political engagements, we are committed to ensuring that we adhere to the highest ethical standards and legislative requirements. We do not make corporate political contributions, nor do we sponsor party political meetings anywhere around the world. +For full details of our progress against our six focus areas, please see our ESG Performance Report Ensuring the quality, safety and reliable supply of our products is critical to protecting patients and delivering health impact. Our commitment We commit to maintaining robust quality and safety processes, and using data and new technologies responsibly. How we assess performance - Average number of critical and major findings by FDA/ MHRA/EMA regulators3 - Percentage of inspections from all regulators with no critical findings or official action indicated - Number of FDA warning letters- Total number of Class I/II external product recalls across all markets - Register and disclose all human subject research of GSK products. Specifically, register protocol summaries for studies initiated in 2022; and disclose results summaries for studies with results due in 2022 Progress in 2022 A focus on quality management Our GSK Quality Management System is a detailed and specific framework which describes how we comply with regulatory requirements and other standards across our markets. It addresses global and local regulations across manufacturing and distribution processes, and is based on principles defined by the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use. 1 Our EHS priority suppliers are API suppliers who are, or will be, medically-, R&D- or revenue-critical to GSK, or are high spend suppliers 2 The 600 supplier employees trained includes data from our previous Consumer Healthcare business 3 We consider any observations from the FDA as major GSK Annual Report 2022 Responsible business continued 50 Inspections, recalls and audit In 2022, we had 122 regulatory inspections at our manufacturing sites and local operating companies, compared with 111 in 2021. We remain prepared for inspections from regulators and receivedno warning letters from the US FDA or critical findings from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and EMA regulators in 2022; however we received one critical finding from the Chinese regulator 1. We continue to learn from and respond to all inspection findings, taking the necessary action to address them. Throughout 2022, we had no Class I product recalls. There were fewer Class II and III recalls than in 20212. We will not hesitate to voluntarily recall products to protect patients. Working with our suppliers on quality We expect all our contract manufacturers and suppliers to comply with GSK standards, and regularly conduct audits to verify that they do. In 2022, we conducted 1,060 quality audits of suppliers, with an increased focus on API suppliers. We have a comprehensive quality oversight model that is aligned to our Quality Management System and uses a risk-based approach to assess, qualify, manage and monitor our third-partysuppliers, driving continuous performance.Maintaining pharmacovigilance Pharmacovigilance aims to protect those who use medicines and vaccines and support public health programmes with reliable, comprehensive information on the overall benefit-risk balance of ourproducts. We have a well established and rigorous worldwide system to monitor and review the safety of our products throughout clinical development and after regulatory approval. Vigilance against falsified medicines and vaccines We have a robust approach to handling all falsified product incidents, ensuring that cases of confirmed counterfeit products arereported to the WHO and to relevant regulatory authorities. We actively participate in legal proceedings against illegal actors, provide regular training to customs and local authorities and we monitor online marketplaces and social media to request takedowns of sites illicitly selling prescription-only medicines. Committed to transparency As part of our commitment we have made 7,377 protocol summaries and 6,295 summaries of results available since the set-up of the GSK trial register in 2004. We have also listed 2,559 studies for data sharing via www.vivli.org and www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com. +For full details of our progress against our six focus areas, please see our ESG Performance Report 1 Critical finding from one inspection by the Chinese regulator of a third-party manufacturing facility used by GSK 2 Class I recalls are triggered by a reasonable probability that the use of or exposure to a violative product will cause serious adverse healthconsequences or death. Class II recalls address the use of or exposure to aviolative product which may cause temporary or medically reversible adversehealth consequences, or where the probability of serious adverse healthconsequences is remote. Class III recalls relate to the use of or exposure to aviolative product which is not likely to cause adverse health consequences GSK Annual Report 2022 Risk management 51Our Board continuously reviews and oversees our risk management and internal control framework, which reflects who we are as a responsiblebiopharma company with bold ambitions for patients. Managing our risks in line with our long-term priorities Our well embedded risk management and internal control framework gives our Board the ability to evaluate and oversee howthe company manages principal and emerging risks in line with our strategy and long-term priorities as a fully-focused biopharma company, following this year's demerger of Haleon. Our company- wide policy sets out the requirements, roles and responsibilities for the management and governance of risks and controls, as well as supporting guidance on the essential elements of our internal control framework. We routinely evaluate our framework for improvements. Board oversight of risk appetite and management systems The Board oversees our risk management system and establishes our risk appetite, supported by the Audit & Risk Committee (ARC). The Corporate Responsibility Committee (CRC) and Science Committee further assess the effectiveness of risk management strategies that fall within their defined remits. Our Risk Oversight & Compliance Council (ROCC) helps the ARC, CRC and Science Committee to oversee the risks, and the strategies used to address them. Alongside this, risk management and compliance boards across the Group promote the 'tone from the top', establish our risk culture and oversee the effectiveness of risk management activities, while also communicating information about internal controls. Management is held accountable for delivering on its objectives in line with the established risk appetite pertaining to principal risks. An enterprise risk owner is responsible for each principal risk, overseen by a GLT member. Risk owners report riskand mitigation to ROCC and the appropriate Board committee each quarter. Legal and Compliance support these efforts by advising on our business strategies, activities, risks and controls, and Audit & Assurance provides assessments of the adequacy and effectiveness of our framework.Assessing emerging and current risks Our risk assessment process considers the likelihood and impact ofrisks, and the timescale over which a risk could occur. As well as considering current risks, we evaluate emerging risks that could affect our ability to achieve our long-term priorities - that is, risks on the three-year horizon, in line with our viability statement. We also define risks as 'emerging' if we need to know more about how likely they are to materialise, or what impact they would have if they did. We'll evaluate whether to investigate further before classifying themas principal risks. Our risk management and compliance boards at all levels of the organisation identify emerging risks on an ongoing basis, and ROCC discusses emerging risks at each meeting. At the same time, we scan the risk horizon throughout the year to identify external trends that may be opportunities and/or emerging risks and monitor our business activities and internal environment. ROCC conducts an annual risk review to assess principal and emerging risks for the company. This review is supported by extensive analysis of external trends and insights, senior-level interviews and recommendations from risk management andcompliance boards and risk owners. ROCC shares this annual review with the ARC and Board for assessment, forming the basis for the following year's risk management focus. Enabling effective risk management, in line with our culture We define enterprise risk plans that include a description of the risk, its context, our assessment, risk appetite, how we will treat the risk, and the actions businesses need to take in line with our internalcontrol framework to mitigate the risk. These plans enable our Board committees to assess the effectiveness of our risk management strategies. We report risks to ROCC and the Board committees every quarter, to drive more dynamic, data-driven discussions, agile risk management strategies and oversight. We report on existing control measures, implementation, emerging risks, external insights and key risk indicators, with risk reporting thresholds aligned to risk appetite. We include risks and mitigations associated with relevant events around us, such as COVID-19 and geopolitical tensions. GSK Annual Report 2022 Risk management continued 52 Our Code sets out the overarching expectations for our employees and complementary workers. Our risk management framework complements our culture and Speak Up processes in making sure that we identify and mitigate risks effectively. We monitor our most important risks and take action to address issues. Our annual confirmation exercise checks that key risks are well managed, or that actions are in place to address gaps. Our principal risks include controls for responding to problems within their risk plans. We also have business continuity planning embedded in our framework and our critical processes, so we can continue business operations in the event of a crisis. Our current risks The table starting on page 53 shows our current principal risks andrespective trends, assessments and mitigation activities for the year. These are not in order of significance. For full risk definitions, potential impact, context and mitigating activities, see Principal risks and uncertainties on pages 285 to 295. The Separation principal risk was removed in July 2022 following successful demerger and analysis of any residual risk. Other risks, not at the level of principal risks, and opportunities, related to ESG, including environmental sustainability and climate change, are managed through our six focus areas, as described in our ESG Performance Report. Additional information on climate- related risk management is in our climate-related financial disclosures, see pages 55 to 61.COVID-19 pandemic The potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on GSK's tradingperformance and all its principal risks is continually assessed, with appropriate mitigation plans put in place on an as-needed basis. In 2022, GSK was encouraged by the uptake of its vaccines and medicines. The company remains confident in the underlying demand for its vaccines and medicines, especially given the significant number of COVID-19 vaccinations and boosters administered worldwide. However, the pandemic remains a dynamic ongoing risk, with the WHO continuing to monitor the emergence of new variants. The current rate of infection is predominantly driven by the circulation of the BA.5 subvariant and its descendent lineages, which are still the dominant subvariants of Omicron globally. While COVID-19 vaccines are being updated with Omicron variants to provide broader immunity against circulating and emerging variants, these subvariants and potential future variants of concern could potentially impact GSK's trading results, clinical trials, supply continuity and its employees materially. Changes to our risks for 2023 In our December 2022 annual risk review, the ARC agreed toROCC's recommendation of our principal risks for 2023, which remain largely unchanged. We identified a new principal risk, Legal Matters, which brings into greater focus a range of legal risks. As a result, Anti-bribery and Corruption will no longer be a stand-alone principal risk in 2023. Additionally, we expanded our Information Security principal risk to explicitly include cyber risks. We also identified data management as a new emerging risk for 2023, which we will evaluate during the year. The 2022 emerging risks of geopolitical tensions and healthcare reform were embedded in our risk management activities throughout the year and will not be reported separately for 2023. +Viability statement, see page 64 +ARC report, see page 124 +Internal control framework, see page 125 +Legal proceedings, see page 265 +Environment, see page 45 +Climate-related financial disclosures report, see page 55 GSK Annual Report 2022 2022 Principal risks summary 53Risk Trend versus prior year Assessment and mitigation activities Patient safety External The external risk environment remains stable. The regulatory environment remains challenging, with recent examples of evolving regulatory requirements related to safety reporting for clinical trials. Also, there is a risk that external parties, including regulatory agencies and technology companies, may reach conclusions and communicate information about the safety of our products based on real-world evidence that is not available to us. This could inhibit our ability to make timely decisions and take appropriate action in relation to the safety of our products, or to confirm or refute conclusions asserted by external parties. GSK Our risk exposure remains stable. We continue to balance resources between change programmes while maintaining routine activities. In 2022, we've allocated resources to optimise pharmacovigilance operations, advance innovative solutions for safety case management, and simplify key safety processes. Change initiatives have the short-term potential to distract focus from our key business priorities. However, such changes will reduce our overall risk exposure by increasing workload capacity and organisational capability. Product quality External The external risk environment is stabilising and remains high following COVID-19, with regulators resuming multiple on-site inspections to check that product quality expectations are met. There continues to be a focus on data governance and data integrity requirements, and on evaluation of products for the presence of nitrosamines. The regulatory environment is evolving with respect to continued use of titanium dioxide in medicines, with the EMA dueto make a decision on potential discontinuation in 2024. GSK Our risk exposure has stabilised as we return to pre-pandemic levels of health authority inspections. We continue with inspection readiness programmes to ensure full preparedness. We've continued to invest in technology and digital platforms to strengthen our controls around good data management practices. We've completed all nitrosamine product assessments in line with regulatory expectations. Financial controls and reporting External The external risk environment remains challenging due to political uncertainty, proposed increases in the obligations of directors and auditors, increasing threats of cyber attacks and fraud, and increasing ESG disclosure requirements. GSK Our risk exposure remains stable due to our ongoing focus on the resilience of personnel and the testing of our internal control framework. We implement optimal risk mitigation through transformational programmes, technology, centralised processes, and risk and control assessments, and maintain effective tax and treasury strategies. We continually strengthen our control frameworks and collaborate with external bodies on setting standards. Anti-bribery and corruption (ABAC) External The external risk environment remains stable. The enforcement of anti-corruption laws and regulations remains a priority in many countries, in particular the US and the UK, with a continued focus on investigating the use of third parties to bribe foreign public officials. As a result, rigorous anti-bribery and corruption controls are expected. Disruption to global supply chains and the commercial pressures caused by higher-than-usual inflation rates may increase the risks of bribery and corruption in certain contexts in the coming years. GSK Our risk exposure remains stable as we continuously improve our ABAC programme to make sure that our controls match evolving and emerging risks. We've enhanced our mandatoryABAC training for all employees, and we provide role- and risk-tailored ABAC training on an ongoing basis. We also impose stringent ABAC training requirements on certain third parties who provide services for or on our behalf. Commercial practices External The external risk environment has stabilised. Macroeconomic factors such as energy price increases, inflationary pressure, and ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic contribute to a challenging environment for all stakeholders. Competitive pressure remains intense across therapy areas and market segments. Governments remain focused on initiatives to drive down medicine and vaccine costs for consumers. GSK Our risk exposure remains stable. We have a mature and robust control environment, which has evolved to match the competitive enhancements to our commercial practices, includinghigher volumes of engagement with healthcare professionals and strengthened sales force incentive schemes. GSK Annual Report 2022 2022 Principal risks summary continued 54Risk Trend versus prior year Assessment and mitigation activities Scientific and patient engagement External The external risk environment remains stable. It continues to be characterised by complex, dynamic disease areas and treatments with increased patient-centric focus during all phases of the product lifecycle, increasing diversity of engagement platforms and more virtual engagements. GSK Our risk exposure remains stable. We continue to mitigate risk by modernising and adjusting our engagement practices and internal controls to the rapidly evolving environment. We have internal networks to foster collaboration and best practice sharing, as well as the identification of emerging risks associated with scientific and patient engagement activities. Data ethics and privacy External The external risk environment continues to increase as the global landscape of data protection, privacy and cyber laws develops. Given that the current pace of technology- focused innovation is expected to continue, companies need to be mindful of relevant potential legislation and regulations. The increasing trend for data sovereignty, initially affecting tech companies, could affect healthcare companies in their ability to drive medical innovation and to effectively operate internationally. GSK Our risk exposure is increasing in the context of an unstable privacy regulatory environment and our multinational footprint, as we re-align with our digital transformation and focus on data-driven science. Laws in our key markets such as the US, EU, UK, China and India continue to evolve, including those relating to international data transfer mechanisms. Research practices External The external risk environment remains stable. Research remains critical to the development of safe and effective products. Advances in technology, use of data, societal expectations and ethical considerations and new entrants to the sector continue to influence the environment. Global regulations and quality standards continue to evolve, and are particularly impactful when expectations change or there are country-specific requirements. GSK Our risk exposure remains stable, as laws and regulations are continually evolving. We continue to perform robust risk scanning and assessments that inform the evolution of our control framework in response to regulatory changes, ensuring clear accountabilities for actions. Environment, health and safety(EHS) External The external risk environment remains stable. Manufacturing sites are operating at full staffing levels. Work location arrangements have been made to maintain the safety and wellbeing of employees affected by the Ukraine conflict. GSK Our risk exposure remains stable. We've continued to focus on safety leadership training, embedding our Life Saving Rules, and adhering to our EHS standards. We're introducing our Safety Leadership Experience across Global Supply Chain, and R&D operations. This programme trains leaders to take EHS accountability and make sure all our people understand the importance of adhering to our EHS standards. Information security External The external risk environment continues to rise as digital footprints increase and threats from hackers become more sophisticated. Growing geopolitical conflicts have significantly increased cyber risk to large corporations. Governments are tightening regulatory frameworks with regards to data and information, and we are seeing a rise in enforcement of them. GSK Our risk exposure continues to increase as we operate in an increasingly digital healthcare ecosystem and continue to expand our own digital footprint. In response, our cyber security maturity programme continues to improve our controls and governance to identify, protect, detect, respond to and recover from cyber incidents. Supply continuity External The external risk environment is increasing due to unpredictable external forces that put pressure on the resilience of our supply chains. These include geopolitical tensions and growing nationalistic approaches (including US-China decoupling). GSK Our risk exposure remains stable. Across our Medicines and Vaccines supply chains, we continue to focus on strategic materials planning parameters, adapting to changes in the external environment, including inventory strategies, safety stocks and hedging. We'remaking a concerted effort to stabilise and accelerate newly acquired assets and we're focusing on making sure we recruit the right people to support our future portfolio. GSK Annual Report 2022 Risk management continued 55 Climate-related financial disclosures GSK climate-related financial disclosures are consistent with the recommendations and recommended disclosures of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) including the TCFD all-sector guidance, and in compliance with the requirements of LR 9.8.6R.(8) (UK Listing Rules). GSK has been reporting on climate-related financial disclosures in accordance with the TCFD recommendations since 2019, with the purpose of building trust and connecting both our strategic and financial disclosures to climate change. This year we have updated the climate scenarios used to model transition and physical risks, which enabled us to extend the timeframe to model risks to 2050 where data was available and to broaden the scope to include GSK's supply chain. We will continue to monitor for emerging risks and new data to include in future assessments. Governance Board The Board considers climate-related matters throughout the year assessing the risk management processes in place and challenging and endorsing the business plan and budgets, including overseeing major capital expenditures, acquisitions and divestments. The Committee that exercises oversight, provides guidance and reviews our ESG performance, including climate- related risks and opportunities, and environmental performance against targets is the CRC. The Committee is supported by GLT and ROCC which receive quarterly updates on environmental sustainability, including climate. Regular attendees include the CEO, and the President Global Supply Chain. See the CRC report on page 107 for further details of the Board architecture. In 2022 the CRC met four times. Key areas of focus were: - discussed climate-related issues on three separate occasions with management, including: progress in delivering against our climate ambitions; implications of the geopolitical landscape; key milestones and decisions required to achieve net zero targets - reviewed mid-year performance for key environmental metrics, including climate-related metrics, as part of reviewing GSK's ESG Performance Rating - approved GSK's TCFD statement and public environmental reporting and disclosures In 2022 the Remuneration Committee, with the support of the CRC, introduced a 10% measure into GSK's long-term incentive plan opportunity for senior leaders based on key metrics related to GSK's ESG performance.These metrics include climate-related metrics such as reduction in scope 1 & 2 emissions and reaching key milestones in the R&D programme to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in metered dose inhalers for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, see page 148. GSK Leadership Team (GLT) The GLT meets regularly and is an opportunity for members to discuss strategic, financial and reputational matters. Regis Simard, President, Global Supply Chain and GLT member has management responsibility for environmental sustainability, which includes climate change. He is responsible for governance and oversight of risks and opportunities and ensures there is an effective framework in place to manage the risks and opportunities across each of our business units along with delivering on the commitments made to a net zero, nature positive, healthier planet, with ambitious goals set for 2030 and 2045 across our entire value chain. Regis is supported by GSK's Vice President (VP) Sustainability who regularly reviews progress with him and who co-chairs the quarterly GSK Sustainability Council. In 2022 GLT reviewed and discussed the mid-year performance for key environmental metrics, including climate-related ones, as part of reviewing GSK's ESG Performance Rating. GSK Sustainability Council The Sustainability Council, held quarterly, is attended by senior leaders from across the business who play a key role in delivering our commitment to a net zero, nature positive, healthier planet, with ambitious goals set for 2030 and 2045 across our entire value chain. Members include leaders from procurement, finance, HR, Compliance, R&D and manufacturing. The Council is co-chaired by the President Global Supply Chain and the VP Sustainability and supported by the global sustainability team who provides specialist expertise and advice to the business. In 2022 the Council: - received monthly performance dashboards covering key performance metrics and escalations of any potential concerns or issues - held quarterly performance reviews across all areas of programme delivery and focused reviews of aspects of the programme such as the implementation of the sustainable sourcing strategy, and recommendations for refreshing GSK's Science Based Target commitments. The Council reviews include decisions on interventions or support required to maintain progress towards 2030 targets - reviewed insights on ESG trends and regulations - approved the proposed Sustainability Data Strategy GSK Annual Report 2022 Risk management continued 56 In order to address the key priorities of the climate impact from GSK's metered dose inhaler, a specific council was established in 2022 and is attended by senior leaders from across the commercial, supply chain, regulatory and R&D businesses aligned to GSK's respiratory business. This council is chaired by the President Global Supply Chain and is the decision-making body for: - the programme to reduce the climate impact of metered dose inhalers which contribute to approximately 50% of GSK's total GHG emissions by up to 90%, if the clinical trials are successful - advocacy and engagement with regulators and policymakers - industrialisation strategy and progress Other business support - the Sustainability Programme Steering Team co-ordinates the sustainability programme and associated workstreams and has oversight for monitoring performance and progress of the enablers required to deliver the sustainability programme - business unit sustainability councils meet quarterly to review business unit performance and delivery against the company sustainability ambition - the Capital Allocations Board (CAB) which includes the CFO and Group Financial Controller reviews climate-related capital expenditure as part of its annual planning and capital allocation process - the Finance Sustainability Network includes leaders from across Finance, Sustainability and Procurement and focuses on keyfinancial enablers to deliver the sustainability programme Strategy GSK's commitment to a net zero, nature positive, healthier planet is embedded in GSK's strategic long-term priorities, always considering the social, environmental and governance impacts of everything we do from laboratory to patient. There are many teams across GSK involved in this process, to ensure that we make sound strategic decisions. The process for identifying and assessing climate-related risks and opportunities is set out under Risk Management as part of this TCFD section. Toachieve our climate ambition, active holistic management of all climate-related risk components is important. In addition to risk, we also continue to identify opportunities for GSK. These risks and opportunities are described further in the table on pages 58 and 59. In order to achieve reductions in emissions across our operations by 2030, as part of our transition plans, we are focusing on: - maximising energy efficiency in our sites - transitioning to 100% renewable electricity by 2025 - increasing the use of electric vehicles by our sales fleetSupply chain emissions are a shared challenge across our sector, and we are working with our peers on collaborative initiatives such as: - the Activate programme to help Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) suppliers accelerate decarbonisation initiatives - the Energize programme to encourage the use of renewable energy throughout the pharmaceutical sector's supply chain - the Manufacture 2030 initiative to encourage suppliers to measure, manage and reduce their emissions In September 2022, we launched a Sustainable Procurement Programme which will require our suppliers to disclose emissions andset carbon reduction targets aligned with 1.5\u00b0C. The use of our metered dose inhalers by patients for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease makes up around 50% of our total climate impact. We are investing in an R&D programme to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from this vital medicine that could potentially reduce the climate impact by up to 90%. If the clinical studies confirm that the new propellant could be an appropriate replacement, GSK will work on securing approval from regulators in markets where the new product could be made available to patients.This process can take time, but GSK is focused on meeting our commitment and we have made considerable investments towards achieving this goal. The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) accredited our climate targets, set prior to our demerger, as aligned to the 1.5\u00b0C pathway. Our reduction pathway to 2030 is significantly more ambitious and we are currently seeking reaccreditation from the SBTi for our targets as a fully focused biopharma company. We recognise that the global energy crisis as described on page 13 is disrupting and delaying the green transition across the world. This may impact the pace of decarbonisation in the short term but anysetback to the energy transition is expected to be time-limited. In 2021, we developed a three-year plan to further embed climate risk analysis across material areas of our business and focused on risks impacting our direct operations. In 2022, we updated the climate scenarios used to model transition and physical risks, which enabled us to extend the timeframe to model climate risks out to 2050 where data was available and to broaden the scope to include GSK's sites and suppliers across all geographies with a strategic revenue dependency aligned to other supply chain risk management processes. GSK Annual Report 2022 Risk management continued 57 We will continue to monitor for emerging risks and new data to include in future assessments, using external parties to provide horizon scanning insights on ESG trends and regulations. GSK prioritised scenario modelling of the following risks in 2022: - changes to regulations governing the supply of high global warming potential (GWP) substances by the EU, UK and US governments could restrict GSK's ability to manufacture metered dose inhalers - future regulatory policy responses to address climate change could lead to the imposition of carbon taxes by countries where GSK manufactures and sources goods from third parties - increasing levels of water stress that could lead to interruptions to supply of water to GSK and third-party supply sites - increasing frequency and impact of extreme weather events that could cause disruption to GSK and third-party supplier sites Climate scenarios We reviewed and updated our climate scenarios, developing four climate scenarios. We used three of these scenarios for modelling transition risks (Net Zero, Low Carbon and Current Trajectory), and three scenarios for modelling physical risks (Low Carbon, Current Trajectory, and Breach of Planetary Boundaries). Net zero scenario (SSP 1 - RCP 1.9) This scenario sets out a narrow but achievable pathway for the global energy sector to achieve net zero CO 2 emissions by 20501. It does not rely on emissions reduction from outside the energy sector to achieve its goal. The scenario is consistent with limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C without a temperature overshoot. Net zero means huge declines in the use of coal, oil and gas and a shift to renewable energy sources. Low carbon scenario (SSP 1 - RCP 2.6) In this scenario, all current net zero pledges are achieved in full and there are extensive efforts to realise near-term emissions reductions; advanced economies reach net zero emissions by2050, China around 2060, and all other countries by 2070 at the latest 2. The scenario is consistent with limiting the global temperature rise to below 2\u00b0C. With some level of net negative emissions after 2070, the temperature rise could be reduced to 1.5\u00b0C in 2100.Current trajectory scenario (SSP2 - RCP4.5) This scenario sets out to show to what extent announced ambitions and targets are on the path to deliver the emissions reductions required to achieve net zero emissions by 20503. The temperature rise will exceed 2\u00b0C by 2100, with a more noticeable shift to happen in the latter half of the century. A net zero pledge for emissions within the scenario does not necessarily mean that CO 2 emissions from the energy sector need to reach net zero, there is an allocation for carbon offsetting within the pledges. Breach of planetary boundaries scenarios (SSP 5 - RCP 8.5) This scenario is not aligned to any of the pledges laid out within the Paris Agreement and is one where countries are unable to meet the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. This scenario will have the most severe physical consequences for the planet. The temperature rise will exceed 4\u00b0C by 2100, leading to high loss of biodiversity and species extinction. Each risk and opportunity was analysed including how they are being managed by GSK and the metrics and targets in place and the potential impact on our profit using a low (<\u00a3100 million), medium (\u00a3100 million-\u00a3250 million) or high (>\u00a3250 million) threshold. Due to the inherent uncertainty, and the nature of the risks across GSK strategy and business model, the climate-related issues are monitored within these time horizons: short term (less than 3 years); medium term (3-10 years) and long term (> 10 years). In comparison to the 2021 disclosure, we have extended the timeframe for climate risk assessments out to 2050 where data is available to be able to differentiate between the potential long-term outcomes in different climate scenarios. Based on the different climate scenarios analysis performed and taking into consideration the climate risk and opportunities identifiedacross all geographies, as described in the table below, we have tested the resilience of GSK's business strategy and did not identify any material impact to our business resilience. 1 IEA Net Zero emissions scenario, https://www.iea.org/reports/global-energy- and-climate-model/net-zero-emissions-by-2050-scenario-nze last accessed17 November 2022 2 IEA World Energy Outlook 2021, Chapter 2, p94, download report from https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2021/overview, lastaccessed 17 November 2022 3 IEA Announced Pledges, https://www.iea.org/reports/global-energy-and- climate-model/announced-pledges-scenario-aps last accessed 17 November 2022 GSK Annual Report 2022 Risk management continued 58Physical risk/ description GSK response Scenario Potential financial impact/timeframe Metrics Targets The risk from increasing levels of water stressleading to interruptionsto supply of water toGSK sites andthird-party supply sites. GSK and its third-partysuppliers use freshwateras the main source ofwater to manufacturemedicines and vaccines. If water availability was restricted at a factory,then productionoperations would beinterrupted. We have identified three water basins in water- stressed areas in Algeria, India and Pakistan wherewe have manufacturing sites, and where we aim tobe water neutral. At our manufacturing facility in Nashik, India we havebuilt plants for rainwater harvesting. The climate scenario analysis has identified anumber of sites and supplier sites located in waterbasins that could become water stressed by 2040which have been added to a watch list. We willmonitor changes to the risk levels and update oursite water risk assessments appropriately.

Extreme weather eventsfrom any one of precipitation (rainfall), flood from precipitation,tidal flood, extreme wind,wildfire, extreme heat orextreme cold can result inshort-term interruptions tomanufacturing at GSK orsupplier sites. The climate scenario modelling indicated that of the seven physical perils, flood from rainfall presents thehighest likelihood of an acute interruption. However, the risk of flooding from rainfall and from the other extreme weather events is expected to remain verylow. We have performed risk assessments for our manufacturing and other operations and have business continuity plans in place which arereviewed annually to respond to the impacts ofextreme weather events including adoptingappropriate mitigation plans. GSK has a well established loss prevention and riskengineering programme to identify a range of risksthat could impact our sites and where flood risksexist, we have taken action to mitigate the risk.

Current trajectoryscenario Long (> 10 years) Not applicable Not applicable GSK Annual Report 2022 Risk management continued 60 Risk management As described in the Risk management section on page 51, GSK's risk management policies are designed to address all types of risks, including the Group principal risks and uncertainties and our climate risk assessment follows the same policy and framework. The nature of the risks and opportunities from climate change depends not only on the physical aspects of climate change, but also regulatory and commercial changes in the markets in which GSK operates, including pressures to reduce the climate impact of GSK's metered dose inhaler medicines. In terms of GSK climate risk management policies, a specific and dedicated environmental sustainability risk management plan wasput in place in 2020. The risk management plan covers expectations that GSK is addressing its impact on the environment, and that the environment has increasing impacts on operational resilience such as access to energy, water and the natural resources used in products, along with any anticipated cost increases from regulatory changes or environmental taxes. Policy developments at global and national level are monitored for their potential impact. For example, as a result of the UN Montreal Protocol 2016 Kigali amendment that mandates a global phase down of the use of high global warming potential hydrofluoroalkane gases, governments are introducing or proposing to introduce quota restrictions to HFA134a that is used by GSK to manufacture metered dose inhalers used to treat asthma and COPD. GSK has been part of an industry consultation with the UK Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs as the UK government develops its UK specific regulations on the control of F-gases. GSK has policies and procedures in place to identify risks from climate change when things change, for example to assess the climate impact of merger and acquisition activity, or the construction of new buildings, or major capital expenditure. Furthermore, an internal control framework has been established for environmental sustainability, including the appointment of dedicated senior leaders for environmental sustainability to ensure that governance processes are in place and effective. For the purposes of our TCFD disclosures we have made use of the TCFD distinction between \"physical\" and \"transition\" climate- related risk. Risks which may be identified include potential effects on operations at asset level, performance at business level and developments at regional level from extreme weather or the transition to a lower carbon economy.Physical risks are typically identified at the asset or project level and are managed depending on the level of risk assessed. Increasing levels of water stress is a physical risk and could reduce the availability of water for our operations in affected locations. This is an important risk as GSK uses freshwater as the main source of water to manufacture medicines and vaccines. If water availability was restricted at a factory, then production operations could be interrupted. We perform water stewardship risk assessments for our manufacturing sites and update them every three years. Transition risks are typically identified at enterprise level and at market level. Currently the transitions risks which are a priority for GSK are regulatory and commercial risks which we manage through our investment decisions and through our sustainabilitytransformation programme. From a legal point of view, we consider risks which may arise from product claims based on environmental performance. To manage this risk, we use external accreditation processes and organisations to review the evidence used to support environmental claims for our products criteria. From a technological point of view, GSK has developed tools to incorporate eco-design principles into the design and development of new products and to identify opportunities to reduce the environmental impacts of existing products. Our communications and governance affairs team manages corporate reputation through identification and monitoring of climate-related issues and then undertake both proactive and reactive engagement with relevant stakeholder groups to communicate GSK's position. On an annual basis a cross-functional team from GSK's business units, sustainability team and finance perform a review of risks from climate change to identify any new or emerging risks and to determine if an updated risk assessment is required for any existing risks. Climate-related risks are considered from a strategic and operational perspective to ensure we maintain a comprehensive view of the different types of climate risks we face and the different time horizons in which they may affect GSK. This review is approved by the VP Sustainability and Finance VPs from each of GSK's business units. The identified risks are assessed by a climate risk working group who consider the likelihood and financial impact of each risk on GSK under different climate scenarios. The impact assessments are approved by the President, Global Supply Chain who has company level responsibility for Environmental Sustainability, the VPSustainability and Finance VPs from each of GSK's business units. The results are shared with Business Unit Risk Management Control Boards (RMCB) and the Finance RMCB to ensure risks are both contextualised with other business risks and managed appropriately. This allows management to take a holistic view and optimise risk mitigation responses, to ensure that responses to climate-related risks are properly integrated into the relevant businesses' and functions' activities.

The most recent Scope 3 data available is for 2021 as the process of compiling the 2022 data is not yet complete, except for 2022 Scope 3 emissions from patient use of inhalers which are disclosed in the ESG Performance Report. We will publish this data once it becomes available and it will be included in the 2023 ESG Performance Report Nature-related financial disclosure At GSK we are committed to playing our part to minimise our impact and dependencies on nature, as well as helping to protect and restore nature. We have performed a full assessment of our impacts on nature across our value chain and are setting targets to reduce these pressures in line with evolving guidance from Science Based Targets for Nature (SBTN). In line with our commitment to nature and building on the achievements of our climate-related financial disclosures, GSK is currently piloting the recommendations of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) ahead of the launch of the TNFD's final framework expected in September 2023. As part of the pilot, we are working to understand how we can utilise the TNFD guidelines to report the risks that our impacts and dependencies on nature present to our business. We are making an initial disclosure with a particular focus on strategy, metrics and targets. Some early findings from the results of our in-progress analysis are included below.Strategy We are committed to have a net positive impact on nature by 2030by reducing our environmental impacts across water, waste and materials biodiversity and by investing in nature protection and restoration. In 2022, we conducted an assessment of GSK's nature- related risks and opportunities, in line with the latest TNFD guidance from November 2022. By following the latest TNFD LEAP (Locate, Evaluate, Assess and Prepare) methodology, we have been able to better understand the magnitude of GSK's physical and transitional risks across each Nature pressure. We will continue to refine our assessment, following the methodology from TNFD, and will look to report against it once the final version is available. Additionally, GSK is one of the first companies to conduct a materiality assessment for its full value chain, in line with the SBTNmethodology, to better understand our impacts and dependencies.

As part of our commitment, we acknowledge that collaboration across different stakeholders will continue to be an imperative in this multi-year journey. Ultimately, the direction provided by the SBTN technical guidance will help shape our strategy to ensure we minimise our impacts and dependencies on nature globally. Metrics and targets To address GSK's pressures on Nature, we have existing targets across water, waste, materials and biodiversity (see page 46).Our targets will continue to evolve as we incorporate the findings of our materiality assessment and progress towards achieving Net Nature Positive by 2030. To support progress, we actively engage with external partners including the SBTN and World Business Council for Sustainable Development to ensure targets and metrics are meaningful and robust. Addressing our impacts on the natural world and understanding the impacts of the changing state of nature globally on GSK is no small undertaking, but we are proud to be pioneering the use of nature- related financial disclosures in our industry. Ultimately, delivering positive outcomes for the environment is fundamental to delivering positive outcomes on human health. At GSK we are excited to continue on this path, uniting science, technology and talent to getahead of disease together.

The Directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that GSK will continue to operate and meet its liabilities, as they fall due, over the next three years. The Directors' assessment has been made with reference to GSK's current position and prospects, our strategy, the Board's risk appetite and GSK's principal risks and how these are managed, as detailed on pages 51 to 54 in the Strategic report. The Board reviews our internal controls and risk management policies and approves our governance structure and code of conduct. It also appraises and approves major financing, investment and licensing decisions, and evaluates and monitorsthe performance and prospects of GSK as a whole. The focus is largely on improving our long-term financial performance through delivery of our company's business strategies and aligned priorities. The Board reviews GSK's strategy and makes significant capital investment decisions over a long-term time horizon, based on a multi-year assessment of return on capital, the performance of the company, and the market opportunities in medicines and vaccines. This approach is aligned to GSK's model of achieving balanced growth by investing in high quality, innovative products for patients and healthcare providers. However, since many internal and external parameters become increasingly unpredictable over longer time horizons, GSK focuses its detailed, bottom-up Plan on a three-year cycle. The Plan is reviewed at least annually by theDirectors, who approve business forecasts showing expected financial impact. The Directors believe that a three-year assessment period for the Viability statement is most appropriate as it aligns with the Group's well established business planning processes that balance the long-term nature of investments in medicines and vaccines with an assessment of the period over which analysis of near-term business performance is realistically visible. The Plan has been stress tested in a series of robust operational and principal risk downside scenarios as part of the Board's review on risk. The Plan assumes the next several years to be challenging for the healthcare industry with continued pressure on pricing of pharmaceuticals. GSK assumes no premature loss of exclusivity for key products over the period and for all anticipated launches toproceed as planned. Despite the ongoing recovery of healthcare systems from the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic, uncertain economic conditions prevail across many markets in which GSK operates.The downside scenarios consider GSK's cash flows, sustainability of dividends, funding strategy, insurance provision and recovery as well as other key financial ratios over the period. These metrics have been subject to sensitivity analysis, which involves flexing a number of the main assumptions underlying the forecasts both individually and in combination, along with mitigating actions that could realistically be taken to avoid or reduce the impact or occurrence of the underlying risk. The following hypothetical downside scenarios have been evaluated: Scenario 1: Business performance risks. These include key performance risks, including lower sales from new products, greater adverse impact from generic competition and other competitive launches to other GSK products, as well as possible supply and manufacturing challenges. Scenario 2: External and macroeconomic risks. This scenario reflects incremental risks to the business driven by outside factors, such as more intense competition, increased pricing pressure in both the US and Europe as well as the potential impact of material negative changes in the macroeconomic and healthcare environment. Scenario 3: Principal risks. This scenario includes a severe assessment of the potential loss impact from the principal risks related to patient safety, product quality, supply chain continuity and environmental harm as well as anti-bribery and corruption and any consequent regulatory actions, fines or significant litigation, all of which could fundamentally threaten our operations. These risks are managed through mitigating activities described on pages 285 to 295. Scenario 4: Put option exercise. This scenario evaluates the additional funding requirements assuming the earliest potential exercise of the outstanding put option held by our partner in the HIV business. The three-year review also makes certain assumptions about the normal level of capital recycling likely to occur and considers whether additional financing facilities will be required and the respective level of funding flexibility and headroom. The results of this stress testing show that certain combinations of these hypothetical scenarios could increase funding demands on GSK and require mitigating changes to the Group's funding strategy. However, in light of the liquidity available to the Group and based on this analysis, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that, even under these most severe stress tests, the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three-year period of assessment.

The 2021 and 2020 comparative results have been restated on a consistent basis from those previously published to reflect the demerger of the Consumer Healthcare business (see page 238) and the impact of the Share Consolidation implemented on 18 July 2022 (see page 233). Total Turnover Total turnover in 2022 was \u00a329,324 million, up 19% at AER, 13% at CER, reflecting strong performance in all three product groups.Commercial Operations turnover, excluding COVID-19 solution sales, grew 16% at AER, 10% at CER. Specialty Medicines included \u00a32,309 million sales of Xevudy , and double-digit growth across all therapy areas. Vaccines growth reflected strong Shingrix and Meningitis performance, partially offset by pandemic adjuvant sales in2021. General Medicines reflected the recovery of the antibioticsmarket and the strong performance of Trelegy in respiratory across all regions. Specialty Medicines Specialty Medicines sales were \u00a311,269 million, up 37% at AER, 29% at CER, driven by consistent double-digit growth in all therapy areas. Specialty Medicines, excluding sales of Xevudy , were \u00a38,960 million up 23% at AER, 15% at CER. Vaccines Vaccines turnover was \u00a37,937 million, up 17% at AER, 11% at CER intotal, and up 24% at AER, 17% at CER excluding pandemic adjuvantsales. The performance reflected a favourable comparator, which wasimpacted by COVID-19 related disruptions in several markets primarilyin H1 2021, and strong commercial execution of Shingrix , particularly in the US and Europe. General Medicines General Medicines sales in the year were \u00a310,118 million, up 5% atAER, 1% at CER, with the impact of generic competition in US, Europeand Japan offset by Trelegy growth in respiratory and the post- pandemic rebound of the antibiotic market since H2 2021, in OtherGeneral Medicines.Total Continuing Operating Profit Total operating profit from continuing operations was \u00a36,433 millioncompared with \u00a34,357 million in 2021. This included the \u00a30.9 billion upfront income received from the settlement with Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead), increased profits onturnover growth of 13% at CER and fair value gains on investments,partly offset by higher remeasurement charges for contingentconsideration liabilities. Total continuing Adjusted operating profit Adjusted operating profit was \u00a38,151 million, 26% higher at AER and 14% at CER than 2021. The Adjusted operating margin of 27.8% was 1.5 percentage points higher at AER and 0.3 percentage points higher atCER compared to 2021. This primarily reflected the impact from lowmargin COVID-19 solutions sales ( Xevudy ). This was offset by operating leverage from strong sales growth, mix benefit, lower inventoryadjustments and write-offs and higher royalty income. Total Earnings per Share Total EPS was 371.4p compared with 109.6p in 2021. The increaseprimarily reflected the profit after taxation for discontinued operationsrecognised on the Consumer Healthcare business demerger, upfrontincome received from the settlement with Gilead, increased profits andfair value gains on investments, partly offset by higher remeasurementcharges for contingent consideration liabilities and an unfavourablecomparison due to a credit of \u00a3397 million to Taxation in 2021. GSK Annual Report 2022 Group financial review continued 67 Total continuing Earnings per Share Total EPS from continuing operations was 110.8p compared with 82.9p in 2021. This primarily reflected the upfront income received from thesettlement with Gilead, increased profits from turnover growth and fairvalue gains on investments, partly offset by higher remeasurementcharges for contingent consideration liabilities and an unfavourablecomparison due to a credit of \u00a3430 million to Taxation in 2021. Total discontinued Earnings per Share EPS from discontinued operations was 260.6p, compared with 26.7p in2021. The increase primarily reflected the gain arising on the demergerof Consumer Healthcare recognised in Profit after taxation fordiscontinued operations. Adjusted Earnings per Share Adjusted EPS was 139.7p compared with 110.3p in 2021. Operatingleverage from strong sales growth, beneficial mix and lower inventoryadjustments and write-offs, higher royalty income and a lower effectivetax rate was partly offset by increased investment behind launches, higher supply chain, freight and distribution costs and higher non- controlling interests.Cash generated from operations attributable to continuing operations Cash generated from operations attributable to continuing operations for the year was \u00a37,944 million (2021: \u00a37,249 million). The increase primarily reflected a significant increase in operating profit, favourable exchange impact and favourable timing of collections, partly offset byunfavourable timing of profit share payments for Xevudy sales, increased cash contributions to the UK defined benefit pensionschemes, increased contingent consideration payments and a higherincrease in inventory. Free cash flow Free cash inflow from continuing operations was \u00a33,348 million for 2022(2021: \u00a33,301 million). The increase primarily reflected a significant increase in operating profit, favourable exchange, reduced purchases of intangible assets and favourable timing of collections. This was partlyoffset by unfavourable timing of profit share payments for Xevudy sales, increased cash contributions to pensions, increased contingentconsideration payments, higher tax payments, lower proceeds fromdisposals, higher capital expenditure and a higher increase in inventory.

GSK Annual Report 2022 Group financial review continued 69 Reporting framework Total and Adjusted results The Group financial review discusses the operating and financial performance of the Group, its cash flows and financial position and ourresources. The results for each year are compared primarily with theresults of the preceding year. Total results Total reported results represent the Group's overall performance. GSK also uses a number of adjusted, non-IFRS, measures to report the performance of its business. Adjusted results and other non-IFRSmeasures may be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute foror superior to, information presented in accordance with IFRS.Adjusted results are defined below and other non-IFRS measures aredefined on page 70. GSK believes that Adjusted results, when considered together with Total results, provide investors, analysts and other stakeholders withhelpful complementary information to understand better the financialperformance and position of the Group from period to period, and allowthe Group's performance to be more easily compared against the majority of its peer companies. These measures are also used by management for planning and reporting purposes. They may not bedirectly comparable with similarly described measures used by othercompanies. GSK encourages investors and analysts not to rely on any single financial measure but to review GSK's Annual Reports, including the financial statements and notes, in their entirety. Adjusted results Adjusted results exclude the profits from discontinued operations fromthe Consumer Healthcare business (see details on page 238) and thefollowing items in relation to our continuing operations from Totalresults, together with the tax effects of all of these items: - amortisation of intangible assets (excluding computer software and capitalised development costs) - impairment of intangible assets (excluding computer software) and goodwill - Major restructuring costs, which include impairments of tangible assets and computer software, (under specific Board approvedprogrammes that are structural, of a significant scale and where thecosts of individual or related projects exceed \u00a325 million) including integration costs following material acquisitions - transaction-related accounting or other adjustments related to significant acquisitions - proceeds and costs of disposals of associates, products and businesses; significant settlement income; significant legal charges(net of insurance recoveries) and expenses on the settlement oflitigation and government investigations; other operating incomeother than royalty income, and other itemsCosts for all other ordinary course smaller scale restructuring and legal charges and expenses are retained within both Total and Adjustedresults. As Adjusted results include the benefits of Major restructuring programmes but exclude significant costs (such as amortisation ofintangible assets except for computer software and capitaliseddevelopment costs, significant legal, major restructuring and transaction items), they should not be regarded as a complete picture of the Group's financial performance, which is presented in its Total results. Theexclusion of other Adjusting items may result in Adjusted earnings beingmaterially higher or lower than Total earnings. In particular, whensignificant impairments, restructuring charges and legal costs areexcluded, Adjusted earnings will be higher than Total earnings. GSK is undertaking a number of Major restructuring programmes in response to significant changes in the Group's trading environment oroverall strategy, or following material acquisitions. Costs, both cash andnon-cash, of these programmes are provided for as individual elementsare approved and meet the accounting recognition criteria. As a result,charges may be incurred over a number of years following the initiationof a Major restructuring programme. Significant legal charges and expenses are those arising from the settlement of litigation or government investigations that are not in thenormal course and are materially larger than more regularly occurringindividual matters. They also include certain major legacy matters. Reconciliations between Total and Adjusted results, providing further information on the key Adjusting items for 2022, 2021 and 2020, are setout on pages 81 to 83. GSK provides earnings guidance to the investor community on the basis of Adjusted results. This is in line with peer companies and expectationsof the investor community, supporting easier comparison of the Group'sperformance with its peers. GSK is not able to give guidance for Totalresults as it cannot reliably forecast certain material elements of theTotal results, particularly the future fair value movements on contingentconsideration and put options that can and have given rise to significantadjustments driven by external factors such as currency and othermovements in capital markets. GSK Annual Report 2022 Group financial review continued 70Reporting framework continued Historical record of Adjusting items The reconciliations between Total and Adjusted operating profit from continuing operations over the last three years (1) can be summarised as follows: 2022 \u00a3m 2021(2) 5,979 Intangible amortisation 739 761 724 Intangible impairment 296 347 200 Major restructuring 321 424 1,178 Transaction-related items 1,750 1,143 1,237 Divestments, significant legal Adjusted results 8,151 6,493 6,656 The analysis of the impact of transaction-related items on operating profit for each of the last three years is as follows: 2022 \u00a3m 2021(2) preferential dividends) 1,431 1,026 1,114 ViiV Healthcare put options and Pfizer preferential dividends 85 48 (52) Contingent consideration on former Novartis Vaccines business 193 27 172 Contingent consideration on acquisition of Affinivax 17 - - Other adjustments 24 42 3 Transaction-related items 1,750 1,143 1,237 (1) Three year financial data is presented reflecting the restated results following the demerger of Consumer Healthcare busines s. The financial results of 2019 and 2018 are not restated and are not presented. (2) The 2021 and 2020 comparative results have been restated on a consistent basis from those previously published to reflect th e demerger of the Consumer Healthcare business (see page 238). Full reconciliations between Total and Adjusted results for 2020-2022 including continuing and discontinued operations are set out on pages 81 to 83. Further explanations on the Adjusting items for 2022 are reported on pages 84 to 85. Other non-IFRS measures Free cash flow Free cash flow is defined as the net cash inflow/outflow from continuing operating activities less capital expenditure on property,plant and equipment and intangible assets, contingent considerationpayments, net finance costs, and dividends paid to non-controllinginterests plus proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipmentand intangible assets, and dividends received from joint ventures andassociates. It is used by management for planning and reportingpurposes and in discussions with and presentations to investmentanalysts and rating agencies. Free cash flow growth is calculated on a reported basis. A reconciliation of net cash inflow from continuing operating activities to free cash flow is set out on page 86. Working capital Working capital represents inventory and trade receivables less tradepayables. CER and AER growth In order to illustrate underlying performance, it is the Group's practiceto discuss its results in terms of constant exchange rate (CER) growth.This represents growth calculated as if the exchange rates used todetermine the results of overseas companies in Sterling had remainedunchanged from those used in the comparative period. CER%represents growth at constant exchange rates. \u00a3% or AER%represents growth at actual exchange rates.Return on capital employed Return on capital employed is calculated as total profit before taxationas a percentage of average net assets over the year. Total net debt Net debt is defined as total borrowings less cash, cash equivalents, liquid investments, and short-term loans to third parties that are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. Please see Note 30 'Net Debt'for the calculation of net debt. Total Operating Margin Total Operating margin is operating profit dividend by turnover. Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) CAGR is defined as the compound annual growth rate and shows theannualised average rate of revenue growth between a number of givenyears, assuming growth takes place at an exponentially compoundedrate. GSK Annual Report 2022 Group financial review continued 71Reporting framework continued Non-controlling interests in ViiV Healthcare Trading profit allocations As ViiV Healthcare is a subsidiary of the Group, 100% of its operating results (turnover, operating profit, profit after tax) are included withinthe Group income statement and then a portion of the earnings isallocated to the non-controlling interests owned by the other shareholders, in line with their respective equity shareholdings (Pfizer, Inc. (Pfizer) 11.7% and Shionogi & Co. Ltd (Shionogi) 10%). Each ofthe shareholders, including GSK, is also entitled to preferentialdividends determined by the performance of certain products that eachshareholder contributed. As the relative performance of these productschanges over time, the proportion of the overall earnings allocated toeach shareholder also changes. In particular, the increasing proportionof sales of dolutegravir and cabotegravir-containing products has a favourable impact on the proportion of the preferential dividends that is allocated to GSK. Adjusting items are allocated to shareholders basedon their equity interests. GSK was entitled to approximately 83% of theTotal earnings and 82% of the Adjusted earnings of ViiV Healthcare for2022. Remeasurements of the liabilities for the preferential dividendsallocated to Pfizer and Shionogi are included within other operatingincome/(expense). Acquisition-related arrangements As consideration for the acquisition of Shionogi's interest in the formerShionogi-ViiV Healthcare joint venture in 2012, Shionogi received the 10% equity stake in ViiV Healthcare and ViiV Healthcare also agreed to pay additional future cash consideration to Shionogi, contingent onthe future sales performance of the products being developed by thatjoint venture, dolutegravir and cabotegravir. Under IFRS 3 `Businesscombinations', GSK was required to provide for the estimated fairvalue of this contingent consideration at the time of acquisition and isrequired to update the liability to the latest estimate of fair value ateach subsequent period end. The liability for the contingent consideration recognised in the balance sheet at the date of acquisition was \u00a3659 million. Subsequent re-measurements arereflected within other operating income/(expense) and within Adjustingitems in the income statement in each period. Cash payments to settle the contingent consideration are made to Shionogi by ViiV Healthcare each quarter, based on the actual sales performance and other income of the relevant products in the previousquarter. These payments reduce the balance sheet liability and henceare not recorded in the income statement. The cash payments made toShionogi by ViiV Healthcare in 2022 were \u00a31,100 million. As the liability is required to be recorded at the fair value of estimated future payments, there is a significant timing difference between thecharges that are recorded in the Total income statement to reflectmovements in the fair value of the liability and the actual cashpayments made to settle the liability.The cash payments are reflected in the cash flow statement partly in operating cash flows and partly within investing activities. The tax reliefon these payments is reflected in the Group's Adjusting items as part ofthe tax charge. The part of each payment relating to the originalestimate of the fair value of the contingent consideration on theacquisition of the Shionogi-ViiV Healthcare joint venture in 2012 of\u00a3659 million is reported within investing activities in the cash flow statement and the part of each payment relating to the increase in the liability since the acquisition is reported within operating cash flows. Movements in contingent consideration payable to Shionogi were as follows: 2022 \u00a3m 2021 \u00a3m beginning of the year 5,559 5,359 Remeasurement through income statement and other movements 1,431 Cash payments: operating cash flows (1,031) (721) Cash payments: investing activities (69) (105) Contingent consideration at end of the year 5,890 5,559 Of the contingent consideration payable (on a post-tax basis) to Shionogi at 31 December 2022, \u00a3940 million (31 December 2021: \u00a3937million) is expected to be paid within one year. Exit rights Pfizer may request an IPO of ViiV Healthcare at any time and if eitherGSK does not consent to such IPO or an offering is not completed withinnine months, Pfizer could require GSK to acquire its shareholding.Under the original agreements, GSK had the unconditional right, so long as it made no subsequent distribution to its shareholders, to withhold its consent to the exercise of the Pfizer put option and, as a result, inaccordance with IFRS, GSK did not recognise a liability for the putoption on its balance sheet. However, during Q1 2016, GSK notifiedPfizer that it had irrevocably given up this right and accordinglyrecognised the liability for the put option on the Group's balance sheetduring Q1 2016 at an initial value of \u00a31,070 million. Consistent with thisrevised treatment, at the end of Q1 2016 GSK also recognised liabilities for the future preferential dividends anticipated to become payable to Pfizer and Shionogi on the Group's balance sheet. Pfizer has the right to require GSK to acquire its shareholding in ViiV Healthcare in certain circumstances at any time. A put option liability istherefore recorded on the Group's balance sheet as a current liability. It is measured on the gross redemption basis derived from an internal valuation of the ViiV Healthcare business. The closing balances of the liabilities related to Pfizer's shareholding are as follows: Report 2022 Group financial review continued 72Reporting framework continued Under the original agreements, Shionogi could also have requested GSK to acquire its shareholding in ViiV Healthcare in six-monthwindows commencing in 2017, 2020 and 2022. GSK had theunconditional right, so long as it made no subsequent distribution to its shareholders, to withhold its consent to the exercise of the Shionogi put option and, as a result, GSK did not recognise a liability for the putoption on its balance sheet. However, during Q1 2016, GSK notified Shionogi that it had irrevocably given up this right and accordingly recognised the liability for the put option on the Group's balance sheet during Q1 2016 at aninitial value of \u00a3926 million. In Q4 2016, Shionogi irrevocably agreed towaive its put option and as a result GSK de-recognised the liability forthis put option on the Group's balance sheet directly to equity. Thevalue of the liability was \u00a31,244 million when it was de-recognised. GSK also has a call option over Shionogi's shareholding in ViiV Healthcare, which under the original agreements was exercisable insix-month windows commencing in 2027, 2030 and 2032. GSK hasnow irrevocably agreed to waive the first two exercise windows, but thelast six-month window in 2032 remains. As this call option is at fairvalue, it has no value for accounting purposes. Settlement with Gilead On 1 February 2022, ViiV Healthcare reached agreement with Gileadto settle the global patent infringement litigation relating to thecommercialisation of Gilead's Biktarvy. Under the terms of the globalsettlement and licensing agreement, Gilead made an upfront paymentof $1.25 billion to ViiV Healthcare in February 2022. In addition, Gileadwill also pay a 3% royalty on all future US sales of Biktarvy and inrespect of the bictegravir component of any other future bictegravir- containing products sold in the US. These royalties will be payable by Gilead to ViiV Healthcare from 1 February 2022 until the expiry of ViiVHealthcare's US Patent No. 8,129,385 on 5 October 2027. Gilead'sobligation to pay royalties does not extend into any period of regulatorypaediatric exclusivity, if awarded. The impact of the settlement with Gilead on the contingent consideration liability (CCL) was to increase it by \u00a3288 million, on apost-tax basis in Q4 2021 due to the obligation ViiV Healthcare has topay future cash consideration to Shionogi for its share of the upfrontand of the future US sales performance of Biktarvy and productscontaining bictegravir. The liability which is discounted at 8% is\u00a35,890 million at 31 December 2022 on a post-tax basis. The impact ofthe settlement on the Pfizer put option liability was an increase of\u00a3114 million and was included in the re-measurement at 31 December 2021. Reporting definitions COVID-19 solutions COVID-19 solutions include the sales of pandemic adjuvant and other COVID-19 solutions including vaccine manufacturing and Xevudy and the associated costs but does not include reinvestment in R&D. Thiscategorisation is used by management and we believe is helpful toinvestors by providing clarity on the results of the Group by showing thecontribution to growth from COVID-19 solutions. General Medicines General medicines are usually prescribed in the primary care orcommunity settings by general healthcare practitioners. For GSK, thisincludes medicines in inhaled respiratory, dermatology, antibiotics andother diseases. Specialty Medicines Specialty medicines are typically prescription medicines used to treat complex or rare chronic conditions. For GSK, this comprises medicines in infectious diseases, HIV, oncology, immunology and respiratory. Share Consolidation Shareholders received 4 new Ordinary shares with a nominal value of31 1/4 pence each for every 5 existing Ordinary shares which had a nominal value of 25 pence each. Earnings per share, diluted earningsper share, adjusted earnings per share and dividends per share were retrospectively adjusted to reflect the Share Consolidation in all the periods presented. Earnings per share Earnings per share has been retrospectively adjusted for the ShareConsolidation on 18 July 2022, applying a ratio of 4 new Ordinaryshares for every 5 existing Ordinary shares. Total Earnings per share Unless otherwise stated, Total earnings per share refers to Total basicearnings per share. The same principle applies to continuing anddiscontinued earnings per share. GSK Annual Report 2022 73 Financial performance Group turnover Group turnover by business Group turnover by geographic region Group turnover GSK has revised its operating segments during the year. Previously, GSK reported results under four segments: Pharmaceuticals;Pharmaceuticals R&D; Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare. GSK now reports results under two segments namely Commercial Operations and Total R&D. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements formore details. The Commercial Operations segment has three product groups of Specialty Medicines, Vaccines and General Medicines.

HIV HIV sales were \u00a35,749 million with growth of 20% at AER, 12% at CER. The performance benefited from strong patient demand for the approximately three quarters of the growth. US pricing favourability and year-end inventory build together contributed one thirdof the growth which was partially offset by International tender decline. New HIV products delivered sales of over two billion to \u00a32,474 million, up 78% at AER, 67% at CER, representing 43% of the total HIV portfolio compared to 29% last year. Growth was primarily driven by sales of Dovato and Cabenuva . Dovato recorded sales of \u00a31,375 million up 75% at AER and 65% at CER and Cabenuva , the first long acting injectable for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, recorded sales of \u00a3340 million.Apretude , the first long acting injectable for the prevention of HIV-1 delivered sales of \u00a341 million.

Menveo sales were also up 27% AER, 18% CER to \u00a3345 million, primarily driven by post-pandemicvaccination catch-up and higher public demand in International, togetherwith favourable pricing mix and share gain in the US. Influenza Fluarix/FluLaval sales grew by 5% AER but decreased 4% CER to \u00a3714 million, primarily driven by lower post-pandemic demand in Europeand the US, partly offset by lower expected returns in the US. GSK Annual Report 2022 Group financial review continued 75Financial performance continued Shingles Shingrix sales grew 72% at AER, 60% at CER to \u00a32,958 million. All regions grew significantly reflecting post-pandemic rebound, strong uptake and new market launches with more than half of the growth contributed from outside of the US. In the US, Shingrix grew 46% at AER, 32% at CER to \u00a31,964 million due to higher non-retail and retaildemand and strong commercial execution. Germany and Chinacontributed strongly to the Shingrix growth. Shingrix was launched in 9 markets during 2022 and is now available in 26 countries. Established Vaccines Established Vaccines grew 4% AER but were stable at CER to\u00a33,085 million mainly resulting from supply constraints in MMR/Vvaccines and lower tender demand in International for Synflorix . This was offset by hepatitis vaccines demand rebound in the US andEurope and Boostrix post-pandemic demand recovery and increased share in the US. Pandemic Vaccines Pandemic Vaccines decreased 86% AER and CER primarily reflectingcomparison to 2021 pandemic adjuvant sales to the US and Canadiangovernments partly offset by GSK's share of 2022 contractedEuropean volumes related to the COVID-19 booster vaccinedeveloped through a collaboration with Sanofi Pasteur (Sanofi).

Trelegy was up 47% at AER, 32% at CER reflecting increased patient demand and growth of the single inhaler triple therapy market,and Flovent grew on launch of authorised generics in the year. Overall, there was a three-percentage point reduction in growth of US GeneralMedicines due to prior period Returns and Rebates (RAR) adjustments in the year. Europe In Europe, sales were \u00a36,348 million, up 18% at AER, 19% at CER, including COVID-19 solution sales of \u00a3513 million contributing 8percentage points of growth at AER and CER. In Specialty Medicines, HIV sales were \u00a31,310 million up 10% at AER, 10% at CER primarily driven by strong patient demand for Dovato , Cabenuva and Zejula Blenrep and Jemperli all continued to show strong double-digit growth. Vaccine sales were \u00a31,884 million, up 31% at AER, 32% at CER. The performance was driven by Shingrix sales of \u00a3688 million, >100% at AER and CER, particularly in Germany. Pandemic adjuvant sales of\u00a357 million contributed four percentage points of growth at AER andCER.General Medicines sales of \u00a32,079 million decreased 3% at AER and CER, reflecting the ongoing impact of generic competitive pressures onSeretide and the divestment in Q4 2021 of cephalosporin products which caused one percentage point of drag on growth at AER and CER.This was partly offset, however, by strong demand for Trelegy and the growth of Augmentin following the post-pandemic rebound of the antibiotic market since H2 2021. International International sales were \u00a38,434 million, up 14% at AER and CER,including Xevudy sales of \u00a31,025 million. Sales grew 7% AER and 6% CER excluding sales of COVID-19 solutions. In Specialty, HIV sales were \u00a3683 million, stable at AER and decreased 3% at CER, primarily driven by tender decline. Excluding tenders, International grew driven by strong Dovato growth. Combined Tivicay and Triumeq sales were \u00a3506 million, down 12% at AER and 15% at CER. Nucala sales of \u00a3242 million grew 24% at AER and 28% at CER reflecting strong market growth and patient uptake. Benlysta sales of \u00a3114 million grew 44% at AER, 43% at CER reflecting growth in thebiological market in Japan and inclusion on China's NationalReimbursement Drug List. Vaccine sales were \u00a31,810 million, down 3% at AER, 5% at CER, reflecting an 11 percentage points drag at AER and CER from COVID-19 vaccine adjuvant sales in 2021. Growth excluding COVID-19solutions was driven by strong Shingrix take-up in China, Canada and Japan more than offsetting the impact of supply constraints in MMR/Vvaccines and lower Synflorix tender demand across several markets. General Medicines sales were \u00a34,467 million up 5% at AER and CER. Respiratory sales of \u00a31,955 million increased 10% at AER, 9% at CER,with Trelegy sales up 47% at AER, 48% at CER reflecting strong demand and inclusion on China's National Reimbursement Drug List.Sales of Advair/Seretide were up 3% at AER, 1% at CER with the adverse impact of generic competition offset by growth in certain markets due to targeted promotion. Other General Medicines sales of\u00a32,512 million increased 1% at AER, 2% at CER, and reflected growthof Augmentin following the post-pandemic rebound of the antibiotic market since H2 2021, partially offset by generic competition and pricereductions in certain markets. GSK Annual Report 2022 Group financial review continued 77Financial performance continued Cost of sales 2022 \u00a3m 2021(1) \u00a3m \u00a3% Growth CER% Total cost of sales (9,554) (8,163) 17 16 Adjusted cost of sales (8,741) (7,346) 19 18 (1) The 2021 comparative results have been restated on a consistent basis from those previously published to reflect the demerger of the Consumer Healthcare business (see page 238). Total cost of sales as a percentage of turnover was 32.6%, 0.5 percentage points lower at AER and 0.9 percentage points higher inCER terms than 2021. Adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of turnover was 29.8%, 0.1 percentage points higher at AER and 1.3 percentage points higher atCER compared with 2021. This primarily reflected higher sales of lowermargin Xevudy compared to 2021 which included higher margin pandemic adjuvant sales, increasing cost of sales margin by 2.5percentage points at AER and CER, as well as the impact of increasedcommodity prices and freight costs. This was partially offset by afavourable mix primarily from increased sales of Shingrix in the US and Europe and increased sales of HIV medicines in the US, lower inventory adjustments and write offs in Vaccines and continuedcontribution from restructuring savings. Selling, general and administration 2022 \u00a3m 2021(1) \u00a3m Growth \u00a3% Growth CER% Total selling, general and administration (8,372) (7,070) 18 13 Adjusted selling, general and administration (8,128) (6,749) 20 15 (1) The 2021 comparative results have been restated on a consistent basis from those previously published to reflect the demerger of the Consumer Healthcare business (see page 238). Total SG&A costs as a percentage of turnover were 28.6%, 0.1 percentage points lower at AER and stable at CER compared to 2021. This included a reduction in restructuring charges. Adjusted SG&A costs as a percentage of turnover were 27.7%, 0.4 percentage points higher at AER and 0.5 percentage points higher atCER than in 2021. Adjusted SG&A costs increased 20% at AER, 15%at CER which primarily reflected an increased level of launch investment in Specialty Medicines particularly HIV and Vaccines including Shingrix to drive post-pandemic recovery demand and support market expansion. The growth in Adjusted SG&A also reflectedan unfavourable comparison to a beneficial legal settlement in 2021 aswell as impairment provisions relating to Russia and Ukraine. Thisgrowth was partly offset by the continuing benefit of restructuring andtight control of ongoing costs.Research and development 2022 \u00a3m 2021(1) Total research and development (5,488) (5,019) 9 4 Adjusted research and development (5,062) (4,525) 12 6 (1) The 2021 comparative results have been restated on a consistent basis from those previously published to reflect the demerger of the Consumer Healthcare business (see page 238). Total R&D expenditure was \u00a35,488 million up 9% at AER, 4% at CER. This included amortisation and impairments. Adjusted R&D expenditure in the full-year increased by 12% at AER, and 6% at CER, to \u00a35,062 million. This reflected continued increasedinvestment across Vaccines clinical development, including investmentsinto our mRNA technology platforms, continued investment in the late-stage portfolio and several early discovery programmes, as well as expenditure related to our recent acquisition of Affinivax, Inc (Affinivax). In addition, in Specialty Medicines, the level of R&D investment increased to support the phase III respiratory programme fordepemokimab, a potential new medicine to treat severe asthma, andbepirovirsen, our study in chronic hepatitis B, in preparation for the start of the phase III trial. In Oncology, investment increased in our early- stage immuno-oncology assets and in momelotinib (MMB), our potentialnew treatment of myelofibrosis patients with anaemia, acquired as partof the recent Sierra Oncology acquisition. These increases in investmentwere offset by decreases related to the completion of several late-stageclinical development programmes and reduced R&D investment inCOVID-19 pandemic solutions versus 2021. Royalty income Royalty income was \u00a3758 million (2021: \u00a3417 million), up 82% at AER,81% at CER, the increase primarily reflecting royalty income from Gileadunder the settlement and licensing agreement with Gilead announcedon 1 February 2022 and Gardasil royalty income increasing to\u00a3446 million due to higher sales. GSK Annual Report 2022 Group financial review continued 78Financial performance continued Other operating income/(expense) Net other operating expense was \u00a3235 million (2021: \u00a3504 million) reflecting accounting charges of \u00a31,726 million (2021: \u00a31,101 million)arising from the remeasurement of contingent consideration liabilitiesand the liabilities for the Pfizer put option and Pfizer and Shionogipreferential dividends in ViiV Healthcare. This included aremeasurement charge of \u00a31,431 million (2021: \u00a31,026 million) for thecontingent consideration liability due to Shionogi, including theunwinding of the discount of \u00a3410 million and a charge for \u00a31,021 million primarily from changes to exchange rates as well as adjustments to sales forecasts. This was partly offset by \u00a3922 millionupfront income received from the settlement with Gilead, fair valuegain on investments including \u00a3229 million on the retained stake inHaleon plc (Haleon), reflecting an increase in share price since listingand milestone income from disposals. Operating profit Total operating profit from continuing operations was \u00a36,433 millioncompared with \u00a34,357 million in 2021. This included the \u00a3922 million upfront income received from the settlement with Gilead, increased profits on turnover growth of 19% atAER, 13% at CER and fair value gains on investments including \u00a3229 million on the retained stake in Haleon, partly offset by higher remeasurement charges for contingent consideration liabilities.Adjusted operating profit was \u00a38,151 million, 26% higher at AER and14% at CER than 2021 on a turnover increase of 13% at CER. TheAdjusted operating margin of 27.8% was 1.5 percentage points higherat AER and 0.3 percentage points higher at CER compared to 2021.This primarily reflected the impact from low margin COVID-19 solutionssales ( Xevudy ), which reduced Adjusted Operating profit growth by 3% AER and CER and reduced the Adjusted operating margin by approximately 1.4 percentage points at AER and approximately 1.3percentage points at CER. This was offset by operating leverage fromstrong sales growth, mix benefit, lower inventory adjustments and writeoffs and higher royalty income. Contingent consideration cash payments made to Shionogi and other companies reduce the balance sheet liability and hence are notrecorded in the income statement. Total contingent consideration cashpayments in 2022 amounted to \u00a31,137 million (2021: \u00a3856 of \u00a31,100 million(2021: \u00a3826 million).Adjusted operating profit by business Commercial Operations operating profit was \u00a313,590 million, up 19% atAER and 10% at CER on a turnover increase of 13% at CER. Theoperating margin of 46.3% was 0.1 percentage points lower at AER, 1.2percentage points lower at CER than in 2021. This primarily reflectedstrong sales of lower margin Xevudy , increased investment behind launches in Specialty Medicines including HIV and Vaccines plus highercommodity, freight and distribution costs as well as an adversecomparison to a favourable legal settlement in 2021. This was partly offset by leverage from strong sales growth, mix and lower inventory adjustments and write-offs, continued tight control of ongoing costs,benefits from continued restructuring and increased royalty income fromBiktarvy and Gardasil sales. R&D segment operating expenses were \u00a35,060 million, up 11% at AER, 5% at CER, primarily reflecting increased investment in Vaccines including priority investments for mRNA, late stage portfolio andexpenditure from the acquisition of Affinivax and in Specialty Medicinesin early stage HIV and depemokimab. This was partly offset bydecreases related to the completion of several late-stage clinicaldevelopment programmes and reduced R&D investment in COVID-19pandemic solutions versus 2021.

Total net finance costs were \u00a3803 million compared with \u00a3755 million in 2021. Adjusted net finance costs were \u00a3791 million compared with\u00a3752 million in 2021. The increase is mainly driven by costs associatedwith the Sterling Notes repurchase in Q4 2022 and higher interest ontax offset by increased interest income due to higher interest rates andlarger cash balances as a result of the Consumer Healthcaredemerger. Share of after tax profits of associates and joint ventures The share of after tax loss of associates and joint ventures was \u00a32 million (2021: \u00a333 million share of profit). Loss on disposal of interest in associates In 2021, the Group also reported a net loss on disposal of interests inassociates of \u00a336 million, primarily driven by a loss on disposal of ourinterest in the associate Innoviva Inc. Profit before tax Taking account of net finance costs, the share of profits of associatesand loss on disposal of interest in associates, profit before taxationwas \u00a35,628 million compared with \u00a33,599 million in 2021.

Included in 2021 was a credit of \u00a3430 million resulting from the remeasurement of deferred tax assetsfollowing enactment of the proposed change of UK corporate income taxrates from 19% to 25%. Tax on Adjusted profit amounted to\u00a31,138 million and represented an effective Adjusted tax rate of 15.5%(2021: 15.9%). Issues related to taxation are described in Note 14 to the financial statements 'Taxation'. The Group continues to believe it has madeadequate provision for the liabilities likely to arise from periods which areopen and not yet agreed by tax authorities. The ultimate liability for suchmatters may vary from the amounts provided and is dependent upon theoutcome of agreements with relevant tax authorities. Non-controlling interests The allocation of Total profit from continuing operations to non-controlling interests amounted to \u00a3460 million (2021: \u00a3200 million). Theincrease was primarily due to an increased allocation of ViiV Healthcareprofits of \u00a3416 million (2021: \u00a3197 million), including the Gilead upfrontsettlement income, partly offset by increased credits for remeasurementof contingent consideration liabilities, as well as higher net profits in some of the Group's other entities with non-controlling interests. The allocation of Adjusted earnings from continuing operations to non- controlling interests amounted to \u00a3595 million (2021: \u00a3441 million). Theincrease in allocation primarily reflected an increased allocation of ViiVHealthcare profits of \u00a3551 million (2021: \u00a3438 million), as well as higher net profits in some of the Group's other entities with non-controlling interests. Earnings per share from continuing operations Total EPS from continuing operations was 110.8p compared with 82.9pin 2021. This primarily reflected the \u00a3922 million upfront income receivedfrom the settlement with Gilead, increased profits on turnover growth of13% at CER and fair value gains on investments including the retained stake in Haleon, partly offset by higher remeasurement charges for contingent consideration liabilities and an unfavourable comparison dueto a credit of \u00a3430 million to Taxation in 2021 resulting from theremeasurement of deferred tax assets. Adjusted EPS was 139.7p compared with 110.3p in 2021, up 27% at AER, 15% at CER on a 13% CER turnover increase. Operating leverage from growth in sales of Specialty Medicines including HIV and Vaccines,beneficial mix and lower inventory adjustments and write-offs, higherroyalty income and a lower effective tax rate was partly offset byincreased investment behind launches in Specialty Medicines includingHIV and Vaccines plus higher supply chain costs, freight and distributioncosts and higher non-controlling interests. Growth in lower marginCOVID-19 solutions sales reduced Adjusted EPS growth by 4% AER and 3% CER. GSK Annual Report 2022 Group financial review continued 80Financial performance continued Profit and earnings per share from discontinued operations Discontinued operations include the Consumer Healthcare business and certain Corporate costs directly attributable to the ConsumerHealthcare business. Profit after taxation from discontinued operationsamounted to \u00a310,700 million (2021: \u00a31,580 million). This includes\u00a310,084 million for the gain arising on the demerger of ConsumerHealthcare split between the amount distributed to shareholders ondemerger of \u00a37,651 million and profit after taxation on discontinued operations for the retained stake of \u00a32,433 million. In addition, the Profit after taxation from discontinued operations for the ConsumerHealthcare business was \u00a3616 million (2021: \u00a31,580 million). EPS from discontinued operations was 260.6p, compared with 26.7p in 2021. The increase primarily reflected the gain arising on the demerger of the Consumer Healthcare business. For further details see page 238. Total earnings per share Total EPS was 371.4p compared with 109.6p in 2021. The increaseprimarily reflected the profit after taxation for discontinued operationsrecognised on the Consumer Healthcare business demerger, upfront income received from the settlement with Gilead, increased profits and fair value gains on investments, partly offset by higher remeasurementcharges for contingent consideration liabilities and an unfavourablecomparison due to a credit of \u00a3397 million to Taxation in 2021. Dividends The Board has declared four interim dividends resulting in a totaldividend for the year of 61.25p per share retrospectively adjusted for the share consolidation. The 2021 dividend per share was 100p retrospectively adjusted for the share consolidation. See Note 16 to thefinancial statements, 'Dividends'. Dividend policy On 23 June 2021, at the new GSK Investor Update, GSK set out thatfrom 2022 a progressive dividend policy will be implemented guided by a 40 to 60 percent pay-out ratio through the investment cycle. The dividend policy, the total expected cash distribution, and the respectivedividend pay-out ratios for GSK remain unchanged. GSK has previously stated that it expected to declare a 27p per share dividend for the first half of 2022, a 22p per share dividend for the second half of 2022 and a 45p per share dividend for 2023 (before the Share Consolidation) but that these targeted dividends per sharewould increase in step with the Share Consolidation to maintain thesame aggregate dividend pay-out in absolute Sterling terms.Accordingly, using the consolidation ratio, GSK's expected dividend forthe fourth quarter of 2022 converts to 13.75p per new ordinary share.This results in an expected total dividend for the second half of 2022 of27.5p per new ordinary share. The expected dividend for 2023converts to 56.5p per new ordinary share in line with the original expectation converted for the Share Consolidation and rounded up.Guidance and Outlook GSK expects 2023 turnover to increase between 6 to 8 per cent, Adjusted operating profit to increase between 10 to 12 per cent andAdjusted earnings per share to increase between 12 to 15 per cent. Thisguidance is provided at CER and excludes any contributions fromCOVID-19 solutions. In outlining the guidance for 2023, the Group has made certain assumptions about the healthcare sector, the different markets in whichthe Group operates and the delivery of revenues and financial benefitsfrom its current portfolio, pipeline and restructuring programmes. Due tothe phasing of quarterly results in 2022 and the resulting comparators, GSK expects turnover and Adjusted operating profit growth to be slightly lower in the first half of 2023 including a challenging comparator in Q12022 and somewhat higher in the second half, relative to full-yearexpectations. Despite the ongoing recovery of healthcare systems fromthe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, uncertain economic conditionsprevail across many markets in which GSK operates and we continue toexpect to see variability in performance between quarters. We expect sales of Specialty Medicines to increase mid to high single- digit per cent, sales of Vaccines to increase mid-teens per cent andsales of General Medicines to decrease slightly. COVID-19 solutions Based on known binding agreements with governments, GSK does not anticipate any significant COVID-19 pandemic-related sales or operating profit in 2023.

GSK Annual Report 2022 Group financial review continued 84Adjusting items continued Profit from discontinued operations Discontinued operations include the Consumer Healthcare business and certain Corporate costs directly attributable to the ConsumerHealthcare business. Profit after taxation from discontinued operationsamounted to \u00a310,700 million (2021: \u00a31,580 million). This includes\u00a310,084 million for the gain arising on the demerger of Consumer Healthcare split between the amount distributed to shareholders on demerger of \u00a37,651 million and profit after taxation on discontinuedoperations for the retained stake of \u00a32,433 million. In addition, theProfit after taxation from discontinued operations for the ConsumerHealthcare business was \u00a3616 million (2021: \u00a31,580 million). Intangible asset amortisation See page 211 for description and information on Intangible asset amortisation. Intangible asset impairment See page 211 for description and information on Intangible asset impairment. No individual intangible asset accounted for a materialimpairment. Major restructuring and integration Within the Pharmaceuticals sector, the highly regulated manufacturingoperations and supply chains and long life cycle of the business meanthat restructuring programmes, particularly those that involve therationalisation or closure of manufacturing or R&D sites are likely totake several years to complete. Major restructuring costs are those related to specific Board-approved Major restructuring programmes and are excluded from Adjustedresults. Major restructuring programmes, including integration costsfollowing material acquisitions, are those that are structural and are ofa significant scale where the costs of individual or related projectsexceed \u00a325 million. Other ordinary course smaller-scale restructuringcosts are retained within Total and Adjusted results.

The non-cash charges of \u00a3110 million primarily reflected thewrite-down of assets in administrative and manufacturing locations andimpairment of IT assets. Total cash payments made in 2022 were \u00a3388 million (2021: \u00a3551 million), \u00a3332 million million) relating to restructuring \u00a317 to significantacquisitions \u00a339 million (2021: \u00a3123 million) relating toother legacy programmes including the settlement of certain chargesaccrued in previous quarters. The analysis of Major restructuring charges by income statement line was as follows: 2022 \u00a3m 2021(1) \u00a3m Cost of sales 102 102 Selling, general and administration 180 277 Research and development 39 45 Total Major restructuring costs from continuing operations 321 424 (1) The 2021 comparative results have been restated on a consistent basis from those previously published to reflect the demerger of the Consumer Healthcare business(see page 238). The benefit in 2022 from restructuring programmes was \u00a30.5 billion, primarily relating to the Separation Preparation restructuringprogramme. The Group initiated in Q1 2020 a Separation Preparation programme to prepare for the separation of GSK into two companies: The programmeaims were: - Drive a common approach to R&D with improved capital allocation - Align and improve the capabilities and efficiency of global support functions to support GSK - Further optimise the supply chain and product portfolio, including the divestment of non-core assets - Prepare Consumer Healthcare to operate as a standalone company The programme delivered \u00a30.9 billion of annual savings by 2022 and targets to deliver \u00a31.0 billion by 2023, with total costs estimated at \u00a32.4billion, of which \u00a31.6 billion is expected to be cash costs. The proceedsof divestments have largely covered the cash costs of the programme. GSK Annual Report 2022 Group financial review continued 85Adjusting items continued Transaction-related adjustments Transaction-related adjustments from continuing operations resulted in a net charge of \u00a31,750 million (2021: \u00a31,143 million). This included a net \u00a31,726 million accounting charge for the re-measurement of the contingent consideration liabilities and the liabilities for the Pfizer putoption and Pfizer and Shionogi preferential dividends in ViiVHealthcare. \u00a3m 2021(1) \u00a3m consideration on Venture (including Shionogi preferential dividends) 1,431 1,026 ViiV Healthcare put options and Pfizer preferential dividends 85 48 Contingent consideration on former Novartis Vaccines business 193 27 Contingent consideration on acquisition of Affinivax 17 - Other adjustments 24 42 Total transaction-related charges 1,750 1,143 (1) The 2021 comparative results have been restated on a consistent basis from those previously published to reflect the demerger of the Consumer Healthcarebusiness (see page 238). The \u00a31,431 million charge relating to the contingent consideration for the former Shionogi-ViiV Healthcare joint venture represented an increase in the valuation of the contingent consideration due to Shionogi, as a result of the unwind of the discount for \u00a3410 million anda charge of \u00a31,021 million primarily from adjustments to salesforecasts and the settlement with Gilead as well as updated exchangerate assumptions. The \u00a385 million charge relating to the ViiVHealthcare put option and Pfizer preferential dividends represented anincrease in the valuation of the put option as a result of the settlementwith Gilead, offset by lower cash and updated exchange rate assumptions.The ViiV Healthcare contingent consideration liability is fair valued under IFRS. An explanation of the accounting for the non-controlling interestsin ViiV Healthcare is set out on page 71. Divestments, significant legal charges and other items Divestments, significant legal charges and other items primarily included the \u00a3922 million upfront settlement income received from Gilead, a fair value gain on investments including \u00a3229 million on the retained stake in Haleon as well as milestone income and gains from a number of assetdisposals, partly offset by certain other Adjusting items. Discontinued operations From Q2 2020, the Group started to report additional costs to preparefor establishment of the Consumer Healthcare business as an independent entity (\"Separation costs\"). These are presented as part of discontinued operations. Total separation costs incurred in 2022 were\u00a3366 million (2021: \u00a3314 million). This includes \u00a3103 million relating totransaction costs incurred in connection with the demerger andpreparatory admission costs related to the listing of Haleon. Total separation costs to date are \u00a3748 million including \u00a3141 million relating to transaction costs.

Free cash flow Free cash flow is the amount of cash generated by the Group after meeting our obligations for contingent consideration, interest, tax and dividends paid to non-controlling interests, and after capital expenditureon property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. 2022 \u00a3m 2021(1) \u00a3m Free cash inflow 3,348 3,301 (1) The 2021 comparative results have been restated on a consistent basis from those previously published to reflect the demerger of the Consumer Healthcare business(see page 238). Total cash payments to Shionogi in relation to the ViiV Healthcare contingent consideration liability in the year were \u00a31,100 million (2021: \u00a3826 million), of which \u00a31,031 million was recognised in cash flows from operating activities and \u00a369 million was recognised in contingentconsideration paid within investing cash flows. These payments aredeductible for tax purposes. Future cash flow Over the long term, we expect that future cash generated fromoperations will be sufficient to fund our operating and debt servicing costs, normal levels of capital expenditure, obligations under existing licensing agreements, expenditure arising from restructuringprogrammes and other routine outflows including tax, pensioncontributions and dividends, subject to the 'Principal risks anduncertainties' discussed on pages 285 to 295. We may from time to timehave additional demands for finance, such as for acquisitions. We haveaccess to multiple sources of liquidity from short and long-term capitalmarkets and financial institutions for such needs, in addition to the cash flow from operations. Investment appraisal and capital allocation We have a strong framework for capital allocation, including a board to govern the allocation of capital between our businesses. We utilise aconsistent cash return on invested capital (CROIC) methodology toprioritise investment across the Group as a whole, so that we can moreeffectively compare the returns from each of the businesses as we allocate capital between them. We also consider the impact on EPS and our credit profile where relevant.

We allocate significant financial resources to the renewal and maintenance of our property, plant,equipment and vehicles to minimise risks of interruption to productionand to ensure compliance with regulatory standards. A number of ourprocesses use hazardous materials. The total cost of our property, plant and equipment at 31 December 2022 was \u00a319,451 million, with a net book value of \u00a38,933 million. Ofthis, land and buildings represented \u00a33,113 million, plant, equipment andvehicles \u00a34,012 million and assets in construction \u00a31,808 million. In2022, we invested \u00a31,245 million in new property, plant and equipment.This was mainly related to a large number of projects for the renewal,improvement and expansion of facilities at various worldwide sites tosupport new product development and launches as well as to improve the efficiency of existing supply chains. Property is mainly held freehold. New investment is financed from our liquid resources. At 31 December2022, we had contractual commitments for future capital expenditure of\u00a3743 million. We believe that our property and plant facilities areadequate for our current requirements. Right of use assets Right of use assets amounted to \u00a3687 million at 31 December 2022 compared with \u00a3740 million at 31 December 2021. The decrease in the year reflected the impact of depreciation and transfer to assets held forsale/distribution of \u00a3192 million and \u00a3127 million respectively, disposalsand impairments amounting to \u00a375 million, partly offset by additionsthrough business combinations of \u00a353 million and other additions of\u00a3233 million. Goodwill Goodwill decreased to \u00a37,046 million at 31 December 2022, from\u00a310,552 million primarily as a result of transfer of assets held forsale/distribution of \u00a35,183 million for the Consumer Healthcaredemerger partially offset by an increase of \u00a31,127 million for theacquisitions of Sierra Oncology and Affinivax. Other intangible assets Other intangible assets include the cost of intangibles acquired fromthird parties and computer software. The net book value of otherintangible assets as at 31 December 2022 was \u00a314,318 million (2021:\u00a330,079 million). The decrease primarily reflected transfer to assets heldfor sale/distribution of \u00a319,957 million, impairment losses, net ofreversals and amortisation of \u00a31,519 million, offset by additions, net ofdisposals, write-offs of \u00a34,047 million and exchange rate gains of \u00a31,628million. GSK Annual Report 2022 Group financial review continued 88Financial position and resources continued Investments in associates and joint ventures We held investments in associates and joint ventures with a carrying value at 31 December 2022 of \u00a374 million (2021: \u00a388 million). SeeNote 21 to the financial statements, 'Investments in associates andjoint ventures' for more details. Current equity investments Current equity investments amounted to \u00a34,087 million at31 December 2022 (2021: \u00a3nil). Current equity investments compriseequity investments which the Group holds with the intention to sell andwhich it may sell in the short term. Where acquired with this intention,they are measured at fair value through the profit and loss (FVTPL).They are initially recorded at fair value plus transaction costs and thenremeasured at subsequent reporting dates to fair value. Unrealisedgains and losses are recognised in the income statement. Theinvestment of \u00a34,087 million (2021: \u00a3nil) represents the shares held in Haleon after the demerger. Other investments We held other investments with a carrying value at 31 December 2022 of \u00a31,467 million (2021: \u00a32,126 million). The most significant of theseinvestments held at 31 December 2022 were in Vir Biotechnology andNimbus Discovery. These investments had a fair value at 31 December 2022 of \u00a3180 million (2021: \u00a3266 million) and \u00a3139 million (2021: \u00a332 million) respectively. The other investments included equity stakes incompanies with which we have research collaborations, and whichprovide access to biotechnology developments of potential interest andinterests in companies that arise from business divestments. Derivative financial instruments: assets We held current derivative financial assets at fair value of \u00a3190 million (2021: \u00a3188 million) and non-current derivative financial assets held at fair value of \u00a3nil (2021: \u00a318 million). The majority of these financialinstruments related to foreign exchange contracts both designated andnot designated as accounting hedges. Inventories Inventories amounted to \u00a35,146 million (2021: \u00a35,783) at 31 December 2022. The decrease was mainly driven by the Consumer Healthcare demerger partially offset by vaccines stock build. Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables amounted to \u00a37,053 million (2021: \u00a37,860million) at 31 December 2022. The decrease was mainly driven by theConsumer Healthcare demerger and lower pandemic adjuvant salescompared to last year. Deferred tax assets Deferred tax assets amounted to \u00a35,658 million (2021: \u00a35,218 million)at 31 December 2022. Derivative financial instruments: liabilities We held current and non-current derivative financial liabilities at fairvalue of \u00a3183 million (2021: \u00a3228 million). This primarily related toforeign exchange contracts both designated and not designated asaccounting hedges.Trade and other payables At 31 December 2022, trade and other payables were \u00a316,263 millioncompared with \u00a317,554 million at 31 December 2021. See Note 29 tothe financial statements, 'Trade and other payables'. The decrease wasmainly driven by the Consumer Healthcare demerger and profit sharecollaborations offset by an increase in promotional activity in the regions. Provisions We carried deferred tax provisions and other short-term and non-currentprovisions of \u00a31,473 million at 31 December 2022 (2021: \u00a35,027million).

Provision hasbeen made for legal and other disputes, indemnified disposal liabilities,employee related liabilities and the costs of the restructuring programmeto the extent that at the balance sheet date a legal or constructive obligation existed and could be reliably estimated. Pensions and other post-employment benefits We account for pension and other post-employment arrangements in accordance with IAS 19. The net deficits were \u00a31,356 million (2021:\u00a31,129 million) on pension arrangements and \u00a3994 million (2021:\u00a31,243 million) on unfunded post-employment liabilities. See Note 31 to the financial statements, 'Pensions and other post-employment benefits'. Other non-current liabilities Other non-current amounted to \u00a3899 million at 31 December2022 (2021: \u00a3921 million). Contingent consideration liabilities Contingent consideration amounted to \u00a37,068 million at 31 December2022 (2021: \u00a36,076 million), of which \u00a35,890 million (2021: \u00a35,559million) represented the estimated present value of amounts payable toShionogi relating to ViiV Healthcare, \u00a3501 million (2021: \u00a3nil)represented the estimated present value of contingent considerationpayable to the former shareholders of Affinivax and \u00a3673 million (2021:\u00a3479 million) represented the estimated present value of contingent consideration payable to Novartis related to the Vaccines acquisition. The liability due to Shionogi was \u00a3263 million in respect of preferential dividends. An explanation of the accounting for the non-controllinginterests in ViiV Healthcare is set out on page 71. Of the total contingent consideration payable (on a post-tax basis) at 31 December 2022, \u00a3940 million (2021: \u00a3937 million) is expected to bepaid within one year. The consideration payable is expected to be paidover a number of years. As a result, the total estimated liabilities arediscounted to their present values, on a post-tax basis using post-taxdiscount rates. The Shionogi-ViiV Healthcare contingent consideration liability is discounted at 8% and the Novartis Vaccines contingent considerationliability is discounted partly at 7.5% and partly at 8.5%.

Net debt reduced by\u00a32.6 billion primarily due to \u00a33.3 billion free cash flow from continuingoperations, \u00a30.2 billion disposals of equity investments and \u00a37.2 billiondecrease from discontinued operations as result of demerger primarily reflecting \u00a37.1 billion of pre-separation dividends attributable to GSK funded by Consumer Healthcare debt. This was partly offset bypurchases of businesses of \u00a33.1 billion, net of cash acquired, reflectingthe acquisitions of Sierra Oncology and Affinivax, dividends paid toshareholders of \u00a33.5 billion, net adverse exchange impacts of \u00a31.4billion from the translation of non-Sterling denominated debt andexchange on other financing items and \u00a30.1 billion purchases of equityinvestments. At 31 December 2022, GSK had short-term borrowings (including overdrafts and lease liabilities) repayable within 12 months of \u00a34.0billion and \u00a31.9 billion repayable in the subsequent year.At 31 December 2022, GSK's cash and liquid investments were held as follows: \u00a3m 2021 \u00a3m Bank balances and deposits 1,324 2,825 US Treasury and Treasury repo only money market funds 146 54 Liquidity funds 2,253 1,395 Cash and cash equivalents 3,723 4,274 Liquid investments - government securities 67 61 3,790 4,335 Cash and liquid investments of \u00a33.1 billion (2021: \u00a32.9 billion) were held centrally at 31 December 2022.

A summary of the movements in equity is set out below: 2022 \u00a3m 2021 \u00a3m Total equity at beginning of year 21,342 20,808 Total comprehensive income for the year 14,790 4,759 Non-cash distribution to non-controlling interests (2,960) - Deconsolidation of former subsidiaries (3,045) - Dividends to shareholders (3,467) (3,999) Ordinary shares issued 25 21 Changes in non-controlling interests (20) - Non-cash dividends to shareholders (15,526) - Hedging gain/loss transferred to non-financial assets 9 - Transaction with non-controlling interest - 10 Share-based incentive plans 357 367 Tax on share-based incentive plans (8) 11 Contributions from non-controlling interests 8 7 Distributions to non-controlling interests (1,409) (642) Total equity at end of year 10,096 21,342 Share purchases At 31 December 2022, GSK held 217.1 million shares as Treasury shares (2021: 284.2 million shares), at a cost of \u00a33,798 million (2021:\u00a34,969 million), which has been deducted from retained earnings. No ordinary shares were repurchased in the period 1 January 2023 to 9 March 2023 and the company does not expect to make any ordinaryshare repurchases in the remainder of 2023. In 2022, 77.1 million Treasury shares were transferred to the Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) Trusts, of which 50.3 million shares were transferred prior to share consolidation. Shares are held by the Trusts to satisfy future exercises of options and awards underthe Group share option and award schemes. A proportion of the shares held by the Trusts are in respect of awards where the rules of the scheme require GSK to satisfy exercises through market purchases rather than the issue of new shares. The shares held by the Trusts are matched to options and awards granted. At 31 December 2022, the ESOP Trusts held 59.9 million (2021: 23.3 million) GSK shares against the future exercise of share options andshare awards. The carrying value of \u00a3353 million (2021: \u00a327 million) has been deducted from other reserves. The market value of these shares was \u00a3861 million (2021: \u00a3371 million).Contractual obligations and commitments Financial commitments are summarised in Note 36 to the financialstatements, 'Commitments'. The following table sets out our contractual obligations and commitments at 31 December 2022 as they fall due for payment.

We have entered into a number of research collaborations to develop new compounds with other pharmaceutical companies. The terms ofthese arrangements can include upfront fees, equity investments, loansand commitments to fund specified levels of research. In addition, wewill often agree to make further payments if future 'milestones' areachieved. As some of these agreements relate to compounds in the early stages of development, the potential obligation to make milestone payments willcontinue for a number of years if the compounds move successfullythrough the development process. Generally, the closer the product is tomarketing approval, the greater the probability of success. The amounts shown above within intangible assets represent the maximum that would be paid if all milestones were achieved. There was a decrease in thecommitments in 2022 as a result of a reduction in outstanding loancommitments. GSK Annual Report 2022 Group financial review continued 91Financial position and resources continued In connection with the demerger of Consumer Healthcare, the 31 December 2020 pension scheme valuations identified cash fundingor technical provisions deficits in three GSK UK Pension Schemes.Scottish limited partnerships (\"SLPs\") were established to provide a funding mechanism for each of GSK's UK defined benefit pension schemes. The SLPs together hold shares representing 7.5% of thetotal issued share capital of Haleon. Each pension scheme, through its SLP interest, is entitled to receive a distribution from that SLP in an amount equal to the net proceeds of sales of Haleon shares, and to receive dividend income on Haleonshares, until it has received an aggregate amount equal to an agreedthreshold (\"Proceeds Threshold\"). The Proceeds Thresholds total\u00a31,080 million (as increased by notional interest on the remainingbalance from time to time), and payment of this amount would fullyfund the cash funding or technical provisions deficits in the threeschemes shown by the 31 December 2020 valuations. Once theProceeds Threshold has been reached the GSK-controlled General Partner of each SLP is entitled to sell the remaining Haleon shares held by the SLP and distribute the proceeds to GSK. As at31 December 2022, \u00a3345 million remains outstanding to the UKPension Trustees. Contingent liabilities Other contingent liabilities are set out in Note 35 to the financial statements, 'Contingent liabilities'. The following table sets out contingent liabilities, comprising performance guarantees, letters of credit and other items arising in thenormal course of business, and when they are expected to expire. Total \u00a3m Under 1 yr \u00a3m 1-3 yrs \u00a3m 3-5 yrs \u00a3m 5 yrs+ \u00a3m Guarantees 12 8 3 - 1 Other contingent liabilities 46 10 - 11 25 Total 58 18 3 11 26 In the normal course of business, we have provided various indemnification guarantees in respect of business disposals in whichlegal and other disputes have subsequently arisen. A provision is madewhere an outflow of resources is considered probable and a reliable estimate can be made of the likely outcome of the dispute and this is included in Note 32 to the financial statements, 'Other provisions'. We provide for the outcome of tax, legal and other disputes when an outflow of resources is considered probable and a reliable estimate of the outflow may be made. At 31 December 2022, other than for those disputes where provision has been made, it was not possible to make areliable estimate of the potential outflow of funds that might be requiredto settle disputes where the possibility of there being an outflow wasmore than remote. The ultimate liability for such matters may vary significantly from the amounts provided and is dependent upon negotiations with the relevanttax authorities and the outcome of litigation proceedings, whererelevant. This is discussed further in 'Principal risks and uncertainties' onpages 285 to 295 and Note 47 to the financial statements, 'Legalproceedings'. GSK Annual Report 2022 Group financial review continued 92 Approach to tax Business makes a major contribution to the public purse through its tax contribution. This includes direct taxes (such as corporate income tax)and indirect taxes (such as VAT and customs duties) as well as othertaxes (such as employment taxes and property taxes). It is thereforeimportant that companies explain their approach to tax. This helps inform dialogue about tax and tax policy. We are supportive of efforts to ensure companies are appropriately transparent about how their tax affairs are managed. As part of that,our Tax Strategy is set out in detail within the Public policies section ofour website. We support the exchange of country-by-country reporting (CBCR) data between tax authorities as, validated against existing information heldon taxpayers, it will support their ability to ensure multinational groupspay the right amount of tax in the right places. As a global biopharmaceutical company, we have a substantial business and employment presence in many countries around theworld and pay a significant amount of tax. This includes corporateincome tax and other business taxes, and tax associated with ouremployees. We also collect a significant amount of tax on behalf ofgovernments along our supply chain, including from our employees. We are subject to taxation throughout our supply chain. The worldwide nature of our operations means that our cross-border supply routes,necessary to ensure supplies of medicines into numerous countries,can result in conflicting claims from tax authorities as to the profits tobe taxed in individual countries. This can lead to double taxation (with profits taxed in more than one country). Profits are recognised in territories by reference to the activities performed there and the value they generate. To ensure the profitsrecognised in jurisdictions are aligned to the activity undertaken there,and in line with current OECD guidelines, we base our transfer pricing policy on the arm's length principle and support our transfer prices with economic analysis and reports. We do not engage in artificial tax arrangements - those without business or commercial substance. We do not seek to avoid tax by theuse of 'tax havens' or transactions we would not fully disclose to a tax authority. We have a zero-tolerance approach to tax evasion and the facilitation of tax evasion. Tax risk in all countries in which we operate is managed through robust internal policies, processes, training and compliance programmes. OurBoard of Directors and the Audit & Risk Committee are responsible for approving our tax policies and risk management arrangements as part of our wider internal control framework.We seek to maintain open and constructive relationships with tax authorities worldwide, meeting regularly to discuss our tax affairs andreal time business updates wherever possible. We also monitor government debate on tax policy in our key jurisdictions so that we can understand and share an informed point of viewregarding any potential future changes in tax law. Where relevant, weprovide pragmatic and constructive business input to tax policy makerseither directly or through industry trade bodies, advocating reform tosupport economic growth and job creation as well as the needs of ourpatients and other key stakeholders. In 2022, the Group corporate tax charge was \u00a3707 million (2021 (1): \u00a383 million) on profits before tax of \u00a35,628 million (2021 (1): \u00a33,599 million) representing an effective tax rate of 12.6% (2021 (1): 2.3%). We made cash tax payments of \u00a31,310 million in the year (2021 (1): \u00a3972 million). In addition to the taxes we pay on our profits, we pay duties, levies, transactional and employment taxes. Our Adjusted tax rate for 2022 was 15.5% (2021 (1): 15.9%). The rate has benefited from the closure of open issues with tax authorities invarious jurisdictions. Subject to any material changes in our product mix,or other material changes in tax regulations or laws in the countries in which we operate, the Group's average effective Adjusted tax rate for 2023 is expected to be around 15%. The Group's Total tax rate for 2022 of 12.6% (2021 (1): 2.3%) was lower than the Adjusted tax rate reflecting the different tax effects of variousAdjusting items. The UK Government has confirmed that the Spring Finance Bill 2023 will include legislation introducing a 15% global minimum corporateincome tax rate, to have effect from 2024. The detail of the measuresand how they are to be accounted for is still being finalised and so it isnot possible to accurately quantify the impact for GSK at this stage. Further details about our corporate tax charges for the year are set out in Note 14. (1) The 2021 comparative results have been restated on a consistent basis from those previously published to reflect the demerger of the Consumer Healthcare business(see page 238). GSK Annual Report 2022 Group financial review continued 93 Treasury policies We report in Sterling and pay dividends out of Sterling cash flows. The role of Treasury is to monitor and manage the Group's external andinternal funding requirements and financial risks in support of ourstrategic objectives. GSK operates on a global basis, primarily throughsubsidiary companies, and we manage our capital to ensure that our subsidiaries are able to operate as going concerns and to optimise returns to shareholders through an appropriate balance of debt andequity. Treasury activities are governed by policies approved annuallyby the Board of Directors, and most recently on 12 October 2022. ATreasury Management Group (TMG) meeting, chaired by our ChiefFinancial Officer, takes place on a regular basis to review Treasuryactivities. Its members receive management information relating tothese activities. Treasury operations The objective of GSK's Treasury activities is to minimise the post-taxnet cost of financial operations and reduce its volatility in order tobenefit earnings and cash flows. GSK uses a variety of financialinstruments to finance its operations and derivative financialinstruments to manage market risks from these operations. Derivativesprincipally comprise foreign exchange forward contracts and swaps which are used to swap borrowings and liquid assets into currencies required for Group purposes, as well as interest rate swaps which areused to manage exposure to financial risks from changes in interestrates. Derivatives are used exclusively for hedging purposes in relation to underlying business activities and not as trading or speculative instruments. Capital management GSK's financial strategy, implemented through the Group's financialarchitecture, supports GSK's strategic priorities and is regularlyreviewed by the Board. We manage the capital structure of the Groupthrough an appropriate mix of debt and equity. We continue to manage our financial policies to a credit profile that particularly targets short- term credit ratings of A-1 and P-1 while maintaining single A long-termratings consistent with those targets. GSK's long-term credit rating with Standard and Poor's is A (stable outlook) and with Moody's Investor Services ('Moody's') is A2 (stable outlook). Our short-term credit ratings are A-1 and P-1 with Standard and Poor's and Moody's respectively. Liquidity risk management GSK's policy is to borrow centrally in order to meet anticipated fundingrequirements. Our cash flow forecasts and funding requirements aremonitored by the TMG on a regular basis. Our strategy is to diversify liquidity sources using a range of facilities and to maintain broad access to financial markets. Each day, we sweep cash to or from number of global subsidiaries to central Treasury accounts for liquidity management purposes.Interest rate risk management GSK's objective is to minimise the effective net interest cost and to balance the mix of debt at fixed and floating interest rates over time. The policy on interest rate risk management limits the net amount of floatingrate debt to a specific cap, reviewed and agreed no less than annuallyby the Board. Foreign exchange risk management Our objective is to minimise the exposure of overseas operating subsidiaries to transaction risk by matching local currency income with local currency costs where possible. Foreign currency transactionexposures arising on external and internal trade flows are selectivelyhedged. GSK's internal trading transactions are matched centrally andwe manage inter-company payment terms to reduce foreign currencyrisk. Where possible, we manage the cash surpluses or borrowingrequirements of subsidiary companies centrally using forward contractsto hedge future repayments back into the originating currency. In order to reduce foreign currency translation exposure, we seek to denominate borrowings in the currencies of our principal assets andcash flows. These are primarily denominated in US Dollars, Euros andSterling. Borrowings can be swapped into other currencies as required. Borrowings denominated in, or swapped into, foreign currencies thatmatch investments in overseas Group assets may be treated as ahedge against the relevant assets. Forward contracts in majorcurrencies are also used to reduce exposure to the Group's investmentin overseas Group assets. The TMG reviews the ratio of borrowings toassets for major currencies regularly. Commodity risk management Our objective is to minimise income statement volatility arising fromfluctuations in commodity prices, where practical and cost effective to doso. The TMG is authorised to approve the execution of certain financialderivatives to hedge commodity price exposures. Counterparty risk management We set global counterparty limits for each of our banking and investmentcounterparties based on long-term credit ratings from Moody's andStandard and Poor's. Usage of these limits is actively monitored andany breach of these limits would be reported to the Chief FinancialOfficer immediately. In addition, relationship banks and their credit ratings are reviewed regularly so that, when changes in ratings occur, changes can be madeto investment levels or to authority limits as appropriate. All bankingcounterparty limits are reviewed at least annually. GSK Annual Report 2022 Group financial review continued 94 Critical accounting policies The Group consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and the InternationalFinancial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the InternationalAccounting Standard Board (IASB). We are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses reported in the financial statements. Actual amounts and results could differ fromthose estimates. The critical accounting policies relate to the following areas: - Turnover - Taxation (Note 14) - Legal and other disputes (Notes 47) - Contingent liabilities (Note 35) - Pensions and other post-employment benefits (Note 31)Information on the judgements and estimates made in these areas is given in Note 3 to the financial statements, 'Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty'. Turnover In respect of the Turnover accounting policy, our largest business is US Commercial Operations, and the US market has the most complexarrangements for rebates, discounts and allowances. The followingbriefly describes the nature of the arrangements in existence in our USCommercial Operations: - We have arrangements with certain indirect customers whereby the customer is able to buy products from wholesalers at reducedprices. A chargeback represents the difference between the invoice price to the wholesaler and the indirect customer's contractual discounted price. Accruals for estimating chargebacks are calculatedbased on the terms of each agreement, historical experience andproduct growth rates - Customer rebates are offered to key managed care and Group Purchasing Organisations and other direct and indirect customers.These arrangements require the customer to achieve certainperformance targets relating to the value of product purchased, formulary status or pre-determined market shares relative to competitors. The accrual for customer rebates is estimated based onthe specific terms in each agreement, historical experience andproduct growth rates- The US Medicaid programme is a state-administered programme providing assistance to certain poor and vulnerable patients. In 1990, the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program was established to reduce stateand federal expenditure on prescription drugs. In 2010, the PatientProtection and Affordable Care Act became law. We participate byproviding rebates to states. Accruals for Medicaid rebates arecalculated based on the specific terms of the relevant regulations orthe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act - Cash discounts are offered to customers to encourage prompt payment. These are accrued for at the time of invoicing and adjusted subsequently to reflect actual experience - We record an accrual for estimated sales returns by applying historical experience of customer returns to the amounts invoiced,together with market-related information such as stock levels atwholesalers, anticipated price increases and competitor activity A reconciliation of gross turnover to net turnover for US Commercial Operations is as follows: 2022 2021 2020 \u00a3m Margin % \u00a3m Margin % Margin % Gross turnover 29,814 100 24,432 100 24,570 100 Market-driven segments (8,275) mandated and stateprogrammes (6,218) (21) (5,134) (21) (5,710) (23) Cash discounts (536) (2) (438) (2) (453) (2) Customer returns (255) (1) (253) (1) (235) (1) Prior year adjustments 780 3 855 4 540 2 Other items (768) (2) (673) (3) (560) (2) Total deductions (15,272) (51) (12,518) (51) (13,422) (55) Net turnover 14,542 49 11,914 49 11,148 45 The reconciliation has been revised to include Vaccines as part of US Commercial Operations in all years. Market-driven segments consist primarily of managed care and Medicare plans with which we negotiate contract pricing that is honoured via rebates and chargebacks. Mandated segments consistprimarily of Medicaid and federal government programmes whichreceive government-mandated pricing via rebates and chargebacks. GSK Annual Report 2022 Group financial review continued 95Critical accounting policies continued Strategic report The Strategic report was approved by the Board of Directors on 9 March 2023 Iain Mackay Chief Financial Officer 9 March 2023 Overall sales deduction as a percentage of sales is consistent yearover year with sales growth coming primarily from Trelegy and Specialty Products including ViiV. Deductions within the year were splitapproximately as follows: General Medicines 70%, Specialty Medicines20% and Vaccines 10%. At 31 December 2022, the total accrual for rebates, discounts, allowances and returns for US Commercial Operations amounted to\u00a35,855 million (2021: \u00a35,044 million). A monthly process is operated to monitor inventory levels at wholesalers for any abnormal movements. This process uses grosssales volumes, prescription volumes based on third party data sourcesand information received from key wholesalers. The aim of this is tomaintain inventories at a consistent level from year to year based onthe pattern of consumption. On this basis, US Commercial Operations inventory levels at wholesalers and in other distribution channels at 31 December 2022were estimated to amount to approximately four weeks of turnover.This calculation uses third party information, the accuracy of whichcannot be totally verified, but is believed to be sufficiently reliable forthis purpose. Legal and other disputes In respect of the accounting policy for Legal and other disputes, thefollowing briefly describes the process by which we determine the levelof provision that is necessary. In accordance with the requirements of IAS 37, 'Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets', we provide for anticipated settlementcosts where an outflow of resources is considered probable and areliable estimate may be made of the likely outcome of the dispute andlegal and other expenses arising from claims against the Group.We may become involved in significant legal proceedings, in respect of which it is not possible to meaningfully assess whether the outcome willresult in a probable outflow, or to quantify or reliably estimate the liability,if any, that could result from ultimate resolution of the proceedings. Inthese cases, appropriate disclosure about such cases would be includedin the Annual Report, but no provision would be made. This position could change over time and, therefore, there can be no assurance that any losses that result from the outcome of any legalproceedings will not exceed by a material amount the amount of theprovisions reported in the Group's financial statements. Like many pharmaceutical companies, we are faced with various complex product liability, anti-trust and patent litigation, as well asinvestigations of our operations conducted by various governmentalregulatory agencies. Throughout the year, the General Counsel of theGroup, as head of the Group's legal function, and the Senior VicePresident and Head of Global Litigation for the Group, who is responsible for all litigation and government investigations, routinely brief the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and theBoard of Directors on the significant litigation pending against the Groupand governmental investigations of the Group. These meetings, as appropriate, detail the status of significant litigation and government investigations and review matters such as the number of claims notified to us, information on potential claims not yet notified,assessment of the validity of claims, progress made in settling claims,recent settlement levels and potential reimbursement by insurers. The meetings also include an assessment of whether or not there is sufficient information available for us to be able to make a reliable estimate of the potential outcomes of the disputes. Often, externalcounsel assisting us with various litigation matters and investigations willalso assist in the briefing of the Board and senior management.Following these discussions, for those matters where it is possible tomake a reliable estimate of the amount of a provision, if any, that may berequired, the level of provision for legal and other disputes is reviewedand adjusted as appropriate. These matters are discussed further inNote 47 to the financial statements, 'Legal proceedings'.

GSK Annual Report 2022 103Chair's governance statement 2022 was one of the most important years in GSK's recent history which saw the delivery of strong operational and financial performance, the successful demerger of Consumer Healthcare and the establishment of new GSK as a fully focused global biopharm a company. There was an intensity to the Board's work in supporting and overseeing this, which required a number of additional meetings to be scheduled, as illustrated below. 2022 separation process -Disciplined Board approach to deliver demerger -Creation of world-leading consumer healthcare business with competitive long-term growthprospects and compelling financial proposition -Newly focused GSK with strengthened balance sheet for investment in pipeline/R&D -Both companies with clear targets for upper- quartile growth, set out at Investor Updates 2022 Board activity Pre-demerger (1 January to 17 July) Routine Additional* Board 3 3 Nominations & Corporate Governance 3 1 Science 1 2 Corporate Responsibility 1 1 Audit & Risk 3 2 Remuneration 3 2 Chairs' 0 5 *Additional activity: - Development and approval of demerger documentation and forecast - Haleon plc (Haleon): Chair appointment and Board development - GSK Remuneration policy development and investor approval - GSK Board development and CSO succession - Business development Post-demerger (18 July to 31 December) Routine Additional* Board 3 2 Nominations & Corporate Governance 2 0 Science 2 1 Corporate Responsibility 3 0 Audit & Risk 3 2 Remuneration 3 1 Chairs' 0 1 *Additional activity: - CFO succession -Zantac litigation - Business development Executing the demerger and creating new GSK The Board's work in the first half of the year was primarily occupied in overseeing the smooth execution of the demerger of Consumer Healthcare from GSK, resulting in the creation of two strong businesses. This culminated in the approval of the GSK Circular andthe Haleon Prospectus which were overwhelmingly approved byshareholders at the General Meeting in July, with over 99% of votescast in favour. This workincluded, at its heart, a robust focus on shareholder value creation embodied in the ambitions for both companies. These werecommunicated in the investor updates in February 2022 for Haleon andpreviously in June 2021 for GSK. GSK Annual Report 2022 Chair's governance statement continued 104 At our investor updates, we set out what we believed to be competitive financial aspirations for new GSK. Namely: cumulative top-line growthof 5% and operating profit growth of 10% (excluding COVID-19solutions), together with an aspiration of \u00a331 billion to \u00a333 billion ofsales by 2031. This was not an ambition that the Board entered intolightly. It was a very important demonstration of the confidence theBoard has in the business and our determination to be held accountable for a step-change in improved performance. 2022's strong operational and financial performance is a good platform to progressfrom. Similarly, for Haleon, the focus was on a top-line growth aspiration to signal that the business had upper quartile growth potential. This view was robustly tested when an unsolicited conditional and non-binding proposal to acquire the Consumer Healthcare business was received.In exercising its fiduciary duties all proposals were evaluated butrejected by the Board as they were not in the best interests ofshareholders. This is because the proposals fundamentallyundervalued the Haleon business and its future prospects. The Boardwas confident that Haleon could deliver sustained organic sales growthin the range of 4-6% CER over the medium term. It has been very pleasing to see that since separation, Haleon has subsequently announced strong performance. A key part of our aspiration for GSK was the restructuring of the GSK balance sheet with an appropriate level of debt for Haleon. This soughtto ensure the competitiveness of both companies on separation and GSK's ability to continue to invest in external as well as internal science was improved. The refinancing of approximately \u00a310 billion ofindebtedness was successfully completed in the first quarter of 2022.This timing was opportune given the current environment. GSKreceived \u00a37.1 billion of pre-separation dividends attributable to GSKfunded by Consumer Healthcare debt and we continue to hold 13.5%of Haleon shares, which will be divested in due course. R&D and business development I have also previously described the succession process we followedfor the CSO transition from Dr Hal Barron to Dr Tony Wood. We arevery pleased with how smooth this process has been and that we aremaking good progress in R&D. The Board receives regular reports onR&D from Dr Wood as well as from the Science Committee, followingits reviews. Progress is achieved by organic and inorganic businessdevelopment (BD). We now have an efficient Board cadence for BD to support R&D. The scientific screening of a target is undertaken first by the ScienceCommittee, well in advance of the Board's consideration. This is toensure that we are confident with the scientific rationale underpinninga deal before progressing to the Board. If the proposal is for a late or later stage target or asset, we then also undertake a commercial review of the forecasts and the commercial assumptions underpinningit.We consider deals in respect of their contribution to our ambitions for the periods: to 2026, 2026 to 2031, and beyond. The Board can then reviewthe proposal knowing that these important aspects have beenestablished. We then focus on the value associated with the transactionand how it contributes to furthering our strategy and plan. During 2022, this process included the appraisal and approval of the acquisitions of: -Sierra Oncology , a biopharmaceutical company focused on targeted therapies for rare forms of cancer. The acquisition includedmomelotinib, a new medicine with a unique dual mechanism of actionintended to address the critical unmet medical needs of myelofibrosispatients with anaemia -Affinivax , a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company providing GSK with access to a next generation pneumococcal vaccine candidateand a highly innovative Multiple Antigen Presenting System, known asMAPS Other transactions reviewed by the Board included: - a licensing agreement with Spero Therapeutics for tebipenem HBr, a late-stage antibiotic targeted to treat complicated urinary tract infections; a significant unmet medical need - a collaboration with Wave Life Sciences, bringing together Wave's oligonucleotide platform and GSK's expertise in genetics and genomics - a collaboration with Tempus to provide GSK with access to Tempus' AI-enabled platform, including its library of de-identified patient data -one of the world's largest sources of clinical and molecular data Shareholder perspectives and engagement The Board believes in the importance of maintaining a high andcontinuous level of engagement with shareholders. During 2022 and upto the date of publication of this Report, I held 27 individual meetingswith a range of investors, who make up approximately 35% of thecompany's share register. Charles Bancroft, who was appointed our new SID after the demerger, has held 14 introductory meetings with shareholders making up over 25% of our register. We were also pleasedto be able to hold our Annual Governance Meeting in London inDecember 2022 as an 'in person' meeting once again. We extended aninvitation to shareholders representing holdings totalling approximately50% of our share register to this event and were pleased thatrepresentatives of over 25% participated virtually or in person. It is ofprime importance for us to maintain a clear understanding of investors'views on the company's performance. These meetings help achieve that and provide a key input to our Board planning. GSK Annual Report 2022 Chair's governance statement continued 105 2023 Board priorities Externally facilitated Board review to agree priorities and ways of working Focus on value creation, governance and oversight of Ahead Together strategy: - Delivery of performance targets - Execution of R&D pipeline and business development - Long-term R&D strategy and approach - People/Talent/Culture - ESG Leadership - Zantac litigation - defence and mitigation - Focus on shareholder value creation New GSK Board priorities When I joined the Board in September 2019, GSK was entering a period of significant transition in the run up to the separation of theGroup. The Board engaged in a structured, externally facilitatedappraisal of our governance and the architecture of the Board and itscommittees. The output of this was a Board agenda that was focusedand linked directly to the business needs of innovation, pipeline, performance, culture and separation, and a refined committee architecture that reinforced these priorities. Following separation, it was time to set new Board priorities. Ms Hall of No 4, a business advisory company, was engaged to facilitate thiswork following the success of her previous review. This work comprised two key aspects: - a review of our current ways of working, with recommendations for further improvement and establishing priorities for the Board agenda for the next three to five years - an evaluation of the Board and its committees during 2022 The Board is now aligned with management to deliver our new Ahead Together purpose, strategy and culture, with a strong emphasis onvalue creation over three time periods: near-term (2023-26) basedaround delivering our public commitments; medium- to long-term(2026-31); and beyond. Our Board programme for 2023 has been setaccordingly. The report of the formal independent external 2022 Board and committee performance review is set out on page 111. Board culture and decision-making The Board fully supported our new purpose, strategy and the performance culture for new GSK. We are now well-positioned to deliver on our public commitments for growth and to create sustainablelong-term value. All Board discussions focus on the powerfulcombination of Science, Technology and Talent and realising GSK'sdesired culture. These support our aim to be: - ambitious for patients - accountable for impact - doing the right thingThey also frame Board discussions when considering strategic decisions and actions to be taken. Connecting with the business and our people Following the COVID-19 restrictions, the Board is now able to meettogether in person. Time is set aside to enable our Non-ExecutiveDirectors to have more informal time, together with the GLT memberspresenting to them and to meet with other colleagues at each meetinglocation. The Board and Board committees The Board's agenda seeks to be focused and not to duplicate work.Each committee remit defines its agenda to support our priorities. OurCommittee Chairs continue to be responsible for sharing with the Boardthe work their committees undertake and the main issues they areoverseeing. They also highlight specific committee papers which theybelieve would benefit the Board's wider understanding. Non-Executive Directors may attend any committee meeting and have full access to agendas and papers. From time to time the Chairs' Committee, or amore specific Board committee, may be convened for a specific topic.This creates flexibility and enables the Board to be more agile, ifrequired. Given the increased biopharma expertise of the new Board,management has also been sharing proposals and opportunities at anearlier stage to facilitate more efficient decision-making. The following is a snapshot of aspects of our Board committees, work in 2022. Audit & Risk Committee: assisted in the establishment of a robust internal control and risk management control framework for Haleon as an independent listed company. It also confirmed that GSK's frameworkremained fit for our new future. The Committee took a lead role incompleting the scrutiny of and then subsequently recommending to theBoard the demerger and listing documents for shareholder approval atthe General Meeting in July 2022. GSK Annual Report 2022 Chair's governance statement continued 106 Since the demerger, the Group's share price performance in the second half of the year was impacted by the uncertainties associatedwith the Zantac product liability litigation in the US. The Committee continues to have primary Board accountability for the Zantac litigation, including accounting, disclosure and communication assessments onbehalf of the Board. The Committee has a clear remit andrecommends decisions on the navigation of the litigation to the Board, as appropriate. I would reiterate at this point that the company remains very confident in its position on these matters and will defend itselfvigorously against any claims brought. Nominations & Corporate Governance Committee: supported the demerger of the Consumer Healthcare business by assisting the Haleon Chair designate in completing the composition of the Haleon Board. This included the transfer, on demerger, of two ofour serving Directors, Vindi Banga and Dame Vivienne Cox. TheCommittee felt strongly that their particular skills and experience wouldbe valuable to Haleon and that they would also importantly providecontinuity for the new Haleon Board. The Committee's other focus was on continuing to complete the composition of the new GSK Board and changes to the GLT. The keyfocus was in deepening the Board's scientific and biopharma skills.The Committee selected new Directors with a strong emphasis on lifesciences and technology to help deepen our biopharma expertise andexperience: -Dr Vishal Sikka is a world-leading technologist in the field of advanced enterprise technologies with extraordinary credentials in AIand machine learning -Liz McKee Anderson has deep commercial expertise across both large and specialty biopharma and has specific experience of globalcommercialisation and market access in specialisms such asrespiratory, immunology, vaccines and HIV -Julie Brown , will join GSK in April as our incoming CFO. She has considerable listed pharmaceuticals and commercial experience The Board now has scientific credentials ideally suited to its new purpose and which are among the strongest in the industry. We havemoved away from the broader experience on the Board I originallyjoined in 2019. I am pleased at how the debate and discussion inBoard and committee meetings has evolved to our new purpose and isdeeper and more enriched as a result. The Committee will continue torecruit diverse Directors with scientific and biopharma expertise tomeet the evolving needs of the Board to oversee the company's strategy as a global biopharma business.Science Committee: Good progress has been made in R&D. The Committee continues to support the ambitious and agile development ofour pipeline, both organically and through smart business development,by overseeing and reviewing our application of science. The Committeesupported the seamless transition of leadership of R&D to Dr TonyWood from Dr Hal Barron. Tony's role as a key architect in rebuilding ourpipeline was key to this. Corporate Responsibility Committee: The new culture at GSK is something that we all own. It powers our purpose, drives delivery of ourstrategy and helps make GSK a place where people can thrive. TheCommittee continues to focus its oversight on evolving the company'sESG performance. I am pleased that we are able to report that we are on track against our new ESG rating and reassured by the further enhancements to our ESG reporting and data oversight. Remuneration Committee: Our focused new Remuneration policy is a fundamental part of the architecture of new GSK post-separation. It iscritical we now build a strong performance culture to generate sustained delivery of shareholder value. Our new policy seeks to achieve this key linkage between executive remuneration rewarding outperformance. We engaged extensively with shareholders and shareholder representative bodies as we developed the new policy to recognise theimportance of the new reward system to support new GSK's success. The final policy was modified to reflect the feedback we received, whilst recognising the sizeable minority of shareholders who voted against it.We will continue to engage with shareholders to demonstrate theimportance we place on rewarding over-performance in the policy at thiscrucial next stage of new GSK's development. The strong operationaland financial performance of the company in 2022 is an encouragingstart. However, GSK has underperformed in terms of TSR and shareprice performance for many years. The new policy is firmly focused on addressing and reversing this trend and the outturns of awards in 2022 recognise the significant improvement in performance. Overall good progress was made in 2022. However, your Board is clear that there is more to do to increase investor confidence in the ability ofthe Group to sustain growth over the next decade. Thank you for your continued support and I look forward to connecting with you during the year, whether at our Annual General Meeting in May,or otherwise, to share our continued progress.

See Board and committee changes during 2022 on page 123. Details of committee members' skills and experience are included in their biographies under 'The Board' on pages 97 t o 100. All our Non-Executive Directors are expected to devote such time as is necessary for the performance of their duties. Each Dire ctor is required to attend a minimum of 75% of scheduled Board and committees meetings. However, it is recognised that there may be rare occasions when this is not possible. Special allowance is given during the first year of Board membership while calendars are aligned. There was a hig h attendance record at scheduled Board and committee meetings for all our Directors who served during 2022, as set out above. Our Board Directors' external appointments are governed by a Board approved policy. External appointments can help Board and GL T members widen their expertise and knowledge and hence perform their roles more effectively. When proposing new Non-Executive Director a ppointments to the Board for approval, the Board takes into account other demands on the individuals' time. Prior to appointment to the Board, an individual is required to disclose significant commitments they may have with an indication of the time involved. All additional prospective external appointments for serving Board Directors are considered and approved by the Board, noting t he nature of the role and type of organisation, time commitment and any potential conflicts that are envisaged. The Company Secretary maintains a register of commitments and potential conflicts. The Board is satisfied that given Directors' other interests, each has sufficient time to carry out their role. Our Executive or Non-Executive Directors may undertake a maximum of one, or u p to four listed company directorships, respectively. FRC UK Corporate Governance Code Financial experience In accordance with the FRC's Code, the Board has determined that Charles Bancroft has recent and relevant financial experience. It hasalso agreed that he has the appropriate qualifications andbackground to be an audit committee financial expert as defined bythe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and has determined that he isindependent within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of1934, as amended. Compliance The Board is pleased to report that in 2022 it was in full compliancewith the provisions of the FRC's Code, with the exception of Codeprovision 38. Provision 38 requires alignment of pension rates for executive directorswith those available to the local workforce. Since 1 January 2023,current Executive Directors' pension rates have been aligned to thewider workforce local to them. This replicates the requirement for pension arrangements for any new Executive Directors appointed to GSK. In addition, provision 38 requires that only base salary should be pensionable. US pension arrangements for employees allow basicsalary and bonus to be pensionable. Following Dr Hal Barron's transition to a Non-Executive Director with effect from 1 August 2022, this FRC Code requirement has also been met. The Board is also pleased to report that it has consistently applied the principles of the FRC's Code, as set out in the pages of this and theRemuneration report. A copy of the Code is available on the FRC's website, www.frc.org.uk.

The evaluation is normally carried out externally every third year, with the last one being facilitated in 2020 by Jan Hall of No 4, abusiness advisory company which does not have any other connectionwith GSK. The Board felt it would be helpful for No 4 to conduct the2022 evaluation following the completion of the demerger of Haleonand the formation of GSK as a new biopharma company. Preparation No 4 met with the Chair and CEO in advance of the evaluation, for an update on how the Board is operating to understand GSK's futurepriorities, and to agree the review's objectives, scope and timetable.The Company Secretary also provided No 4 with access to Board andcommittee materials, and other information. Interviews During November and December 2022, No 4 conducted confidentialand detailed interviews with the Board, selected GLT members, theCompany Secretary, GSK's external auditor and our incoming andoutgoing independent remuneration adviser, to seek their views on theBoard's effectiveness. These meetings reflected an agreed discussionguideline that was sent to each participant beforehand. This includedkey topics from the Financial Reporting Council's 2018 Guidance onBoard Effectiveness and the relevant requirements of its 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code. However, this did not limit the feedback each participant could give. Review The Review sought to determine the Board's priorities over the nextthree to five years and how they should be built into the Board'sagenda. The evaluation results and suggested next steps wereincluded in a summary report, compiled by No 4 and discussed initially with the Chair, CEO and the Senior Independent Director (SID). The Review was presented to the Board in January 2023 which coveredthe following main areas of the effectiveness review: - Overall review of the Board - Board organisation, agenda and information - Board dynamics, challenge and input - Future strategy development - Performance deliveryAction points After due consideration and discussion the following action points tofurther improve performance in 2023 were agreed: - The key area of focus for the Board should continue to be R&D (organic and inorganic). Meeting the pipeline goals, and thereforedelivering shareholder value, is seen by all as the top priority - The importance of the Science Committee in working with the CSO to help optimise the pipeline - Supporting the onboarding of the new CFO, Julie Brown - Board succession planning would be progressed to ensure a broad range of diverse candidates for consideration as successor for theRemuneration Committee Chair Board committees The review of the Board committees focused on their progress. Itinvolved virtual interviews with committee members conducted by No 4 on behalf of the respective Committee Chairs. Each committee was considered to operate effectively and the following furtherenhancements were agreed: - The importance of optimising concise feedback by Committee Chairs to the full Board following each committee meeting - Following agreement of the overall Board priorities and the Board agenda, Committee Chairs agreed to review the main areas of responsibility for their committees in line with the Board priorities and incorporate them into their committee programmes for 2023 - In particular, the importance of the Science Committee in supporting organic and inorganic R&D and evolving the ways in which the committee works with the CSO and his team Chair The SID and No 4 sought feedback on the Chair's performance from the Directors individually and collectively. This concluded that the Chair wasoperating effectively in leading the Board. The results of the review werethen noted by No 4 and discussed by the Chair and the SID. GSK Annual Report 2022 112Key decisions and engagements (a) Long-term results The likely consequences of any decision in the long term At the end of May 2022, the Board assessed the company's readiness to proceed with the Demerger and approved the GSK Circular and agreed the Haleon Prospectus to be sent to shareholders as the final stage of the Demerger. The Board exercised its Section 172 duties by reviewing the work of management and the Audit & Risk, Corporate Responsibility, Remuneration and Transformation & Separation committees in progressing the separation since mid-2020. This included; -extensive consultations held with the key stakeholders, and sharing the long-term growth ambitions at the investor events for GSK in June 2021 and Haleon in February 2022 -considering and rejecting the unsolicited, conditional and non-binding proposals received to acquire the Consumer Healthcare business In recommending these proposals to create two independent companies to most effectively serve their patients and customers respectively, the Board firmly believed that its decision would establish: -a newly independent global leader in consumer health with a focused strategy to drive penetration growth across its portfolio, capitalising on new and emerging growth opportunities, underpinned by strong execution and financial discipline.Haleon, as an independent company, would be able to deliver sustainable above-market growth, moderate sustainable adjusted operating margin expansion in the medium term with attractive returns to shareholders -new GSK, a pure biopharmaceuticals company with a portfolio focused on Vaccines, Specialty Medicines and General Medicines with clearly defined financial ambitions, a clear ambition to deliver large-scale and long-term positive human health impact and a strong balance sheet enabling a growth- oriented capital allocation policy and attractive shareholder returns The Board believed that the Demerger would unlock the potential of both businesses, strengthen the balance sheet of new GSK and its ability to invest in growth and maximise long-term return for shareholders. Shareholders duly approved the two resolutions proposed at the General Meeting held on 6 July 2022 and the Demerger was theneffected on 18 July 2022. Section 172 statement Board members are required by law to promote the success of theirorganisation for the benefit of both shareholders and their wider stakeholders, including employees, suppliers and the community. This statement meets this requirement, as set out in Section 172 andSection 414CZA of the Companies Act 2006 (the Act). It states how,during the year, our Directors addressed the matters set out inSection 172(1) (a) to (f) of the Act when performing their duties. The Board considers that the statement focuses on those risks and opportunities that are strategically important to GSK, and consistentwith the Group's size and complexity. This allows it to properlyunderstand the potential impacts of the decisions it makes on allstakeholders. Engagement with our main stakeholder groups, including our patients, shareholders, consumers, customers and employees at all levels andacross the organisation, are summarised throughout the pages of ourstrategic report.In particular, the Board's continuous engagement with our investors and people is set out in this section on pages 114 to 116, and the company's corporate governance architecture and processes are summarised onpages 107 to 109. This summary sets out how the Board considered all relevant matters in making the principal decisions that contributed to the formation of two attractive and viable businesses with compelling investment propositions, through: - delivering the separation of Haleon from GSK with a strong focus on shareholder value (the Demerger) and - building GSK as a pure biopharma company that is ambitious for patients, accountable for impact and does the right thing (new GSK) The Demerger represented a key step in a multi-year transformation of GSK to improve focus, performance and competitiveness, and to maximise value for shareholders. The Demerger also provided the right opportunity to implement the legal change of name of the company from GlaxoSmithKline plc to GSK plc. This was designed to mark the new GSK brand and culture and protect and build it for the future. The change was made in May 2022. GSK Annual Report 2022 Key decisions and engagements continued 113 (b) Our workforce The interests of the Group's employees The Board had continual regard to the interests of our people who were either remaining with new GSK or departing to form Haleon. It achieved this by using various employee voice mechanisms described on pages 10, 11 and 115 to help explain the future shape of thesecompanies, understand and assess the impact of these changes onthe organisation and how they were being experienced by our people. Significant focus was dedicated in bringing to life new GSK's AheadTogether purpose, strategy and culture for our people across theGroup. A strong emphasis has been given to individual ownership ofour new culture. This was formally launched in June 2022 with eventsheld around the company's locations globally. These were attended by GLT members and Non-Executive Board members including the Chair. In 2022, in addition to our annual bonus and long-term incentive structure, the Board also gave a special thank you to all our people (excluding GLT), allowing us to recognise what we hadachieved together in preparation for the Demerger and thetransformation of the company into a pure biopharma company.As a result, everyone received a one-off payment equivalent to aweek's salary in March, separate to our 2021 bonus pay-out. We also ensured that the treatment of awards or options held byGSK employees, and for departing Haleon employees, delivereda fair outcome in accordance with the rules of those shareschemes as part of the Demerger and the GSK shareconsolidation. (c) Our business relationships The importance of developing the Group's business relationships with suppliers, customers and others A key imperative for the Board of GSK as a responsible business is to ensure the company develops and monitors these partnerships toultimately serve patients. The benefits of these relationships and how they can support the achievement of our ambitions are described in the pages of our strategic report, for example: -achieving our Ahead Together ambition to positively impact the health of 2.5 billion people by the end of 2030, requires the development of vaccines and medicines and making them availablethrough responsible pricing, strategic access programmes andpartnerships -ethical behaviour is promoted across our business by supporting our people to do the right thing and working with suppliers that share our standards and operate in a responsibleway. Our new Code of Conduct seeks to set out expectations inthis regard -our third parties are expected to meet our ABAC and labour rights standards and to comply with our standards on quality,health and safety, and the environment. Approximately 29% ofour total emissions footprint comes from the goods and servicesthat we buy. In September 2022, in support of our net zerocarbon impact on climate ambition, we launched ourSustainable Procurement Programme. This will require oursuppliers to, among other things, disclose emissions, set carbon reduction targets, and switch to renewable power and heat (d) The community and the environment The impact of the Group's operations on the community and our environment Our approach to making a positive impact has been guided by extensive stakeholder engagement on the key issues relevant to new GSK and, prior to the demerger, Haleon's respective industries and thenature of the companies themselves. The Board has sought to achievethis by: -in preparation for the Demerger, working with Haleon's management team in developing its own distinctive responsible businessapproach and ESG framework bespoke to the needs of itscustomers and the communities it serves. This also involvedscrutinising this framework and the proposed targets, includingenvironmental sustainability targets. These were presented atHaleon's investor update in February 2022 -establishing the six areas of ESG focus for new GSK as a global biopharma company that are fundamental to our DNA andsuccess. These six areas, detailed on pages 42 to 50, directlycontribute to long-term shareholder value by contributing to ourhealth impact, supporting thriving people and reducing risk. Theenvironment is one of our principal ESG focus areas. In 2022,an environmental scorecard measure was introduced into ourlong-term incentive plans to incentivise and reward progress on delivering against our net zero impact on climate and net positive impact on nature public ambitions by 2030 The Board has also been focused on new GSK's Ahead Togetherambition to impact the lives of 2.5 billion patients over the next ten years. Human capital is key to GSK and as such we are seeking to strengthen early STEM education investments to furthersupport a long-term diverse talent pool and increase the positiveimpact of volunteering activities within the communities in whichwe serve. GSK Annual Report 2022 Key decisions and engagements continued 114 (e) Our reputation Our desire to maintain our reputation for high standards of business conduct This duty guided the Board's approach to the Demerger and the creation of new GSK. This was achieved by: -the transformation of the company, initially launched in early 2020. This included fundamentally reviewing our structure, cost base, ways of working and the effectiveness of both our biopharma and consumer healthcare businesses and implementing targetedenhancements in advance of the Demerger -choosing the optimal form of separation through a Demerger with the same listing location and structure for Haleon as GSK. As a result, Haleon should operate to the same premium listed, legal andcorporate governance standards, in an environment with commonbusiness and ethical values to GSK -extensive legal and financial due diligence and engagement with key regulators, investors and other key stakeholders, which wasundertaken in preparing the GSK Circular, the Haleon Prospectusand the Haleon 20-F -reaching an agreement with the trustees of the GSK UK Pension Schemes on a package of measures (including funding andprotections) in relation to the Demerger and the GSK UK PensionSchemes' triennial actuarial valuations -ensuring that GSK remained as one company in how we operated until the point of Demerger, with the overriding emphasis on drivingtop-line growth and improving margin -implementing plans for the six areas of ESG focus for new GSK, outlined to investors in June 2021 to help retain and develop furtherGSK's reputation for ESG leadership and responsible businessconduct -developing a distinctive and holistic responsible business case and ESG framework for Haleon which was outlined to investors inFebruary 2022. This supported Haleon's purpose, strategy andculture as a premium UK listed company, with a focus on the keyresponsible business issues -ensuring that the Board and our people in new GSK commit annually to our new Code of Conduct introduced in June 2022. ThisCode sets out our Board endorsed Ahead Together purpose andculture, as well as the performance commitments our people makeso we can all deliver on the company's ambitions in the right way (f) Fairness between our shareholders Our aim to act fairly as between members of the Group -each shareholder receiving a pro-rated shareholding in Haleon after the Demerger, with the receipt of one Haleon share for each GSKshare held. Additionally, all Haleon shares from the inception of theDemerger had equal rights to participate in capital, dividend andprofit distributions by Haleon -the GSK Share Consolidation achieved consistency in the GSK share price pre- and post-Demerger to enable comparabilitybetween the new GSK earnings per share and share price withprevious periods. It also preserved, as far as reasonably possible,the value of share options and awards granted to our people after the Demerger It was of fundamental importance that the Board was able to ensure that shareholders were treated fairly up to, on and after the Demerger. This was demonstrated by: -deciding on the most appropriate capital structures required for the two companies to be competitive, on which stock exchanges Haleon should list, and whether, and to what extent, to distributeshares in Haleon to GSK's shareholders and retain any stake inHaleon -each shareholder having a right to vote on a one vote for one share basis at the General Meeting for the Demerger and the new GSKshare consolidation, and related party transactions resolutions. Toensure that as many shareholders as possible could participate inthe meeting, shareholders were able to ask questions and voteeither electronically or in person. Voting majorities in excess of 99%were recorded for each resolution Approach to continuous engagement Our stakeholders rightly have high expectations of us. The dynamic operating environment presents many challenges and opportunities. The Board aims to make sure that being commercially successful is balanced and aligned with meeting our stakeholders' expectations, upholding our reputation, maintaining our licence to operate and building trust. The Board engages with or is briefed on the views of our stakeholders, to ensure it identifies and responds to their expectations effectively and appropriately. How we engage with our main stakeholder groups - including patients, shareholders, consumers, customers and employees - across thecompany is covered in the pages of our strategic report.The Board placed two of our main stakeholders at the heart of our renewed culture, with our people all being ambitious for patients, accountable for impact, and doing the right thing. Our culture is described on pages 10 and 11 of the strategic report. The influence and importance of different stakeholder groups can vary, depending on the matter being considered. Certain stakeholders'interests can be in conflict, meaning the Board needs to make balanced judgements. Continuous stakeholder engagement and feedback helps us identify emerging issues. It also enables the Board to make decisions in thecontext of what is relevant and important to each of them. GSK Annual Report 2022 Key decisions and engagements continued 115 Our principal Board committees, and the GLT, undertake engagement on the Board's behalf in accordance with their remit. This means thatthey can build a detailed understanding of how our actions or plansare/or may impact stakeholders. These insights are then shared withthe Board. In particular, the Board receives briefings on stakeholders' perspectives from the work of the Corporate Responsibility Committee,which is discussed on pages 117 and 118. Board members regularly receive: - the CEO's Board Report - a specific External Stakeholders' Report. This provides strategic insights based on an analysis of key developments, achievementsand risks impacting our reputation and the perceptions of all ourexternal stakeholders - a regular Investor Relations Report which summarises investor perceptions - regular corporate governance, litigation and regulatory updates The Board also learns of stakeholder views through: Engagement and feedback events such as: the quarterly investor results calls, the Annual General Meeting, employee survey reports,through the Board's workforce engagement activities, and from expertspresenting at Board or committee meetings. In addition to the Chair'sinvestor check-in meetings which he holds on an ongoing basis, ournew SID, Charles Bancroft, joined him for some meetings. Charlesalso met individually with investors to introduced himself and gain a personal understanding of issues and any views they may have. Other opportunities: Board members also gain wider stakeholder views during the annual strategy meeting with the GLT, as part of theannual review of strategy, budget and planning process. This includesa review of specific aspects of the company's policies or strategy. In addition, Board members are encouraged to meet individually with employees, shareholders and other key stakeholders during theirinduction, and then on an ongoing basis. They are encouraged toreport to the Board on such experiences where relevant and material. Our people We have well-established and strong engagement mechanisms withour colleagues, which are described on pages 10 and 11 and are monitored regularly by the Board. Three key governance channels help communicate what our people are thinking to the Board: - regular Board updates from our Chief People Officer and the CEO on culture and talent - feedback from a range of pulse surveys of varying sizes of employee groups to help check sentiment and culture more quickly andfrequently and provide valuable insights on the impact of major initiatives, events or communications - direct engagement by the Board. Prior to the demerger, our designated Workforce Engagement Director, Dame Vivienne Cox, had a specific mandate to connect with our peopleWorkforce engagement: Dame Vivienne concluded her workforce engagement activities in the first half of the year. This was prior to hertransfer to the Haleon Board in July 2022 on the separation of theConsumer Healthcare business. Her programme of visits was conductedon the same basis as she described in previous Annual Reports. Dame Vivienne provided a focus for employee engagement as our designated Workforce Engagement Director from December 2018. Hertenure coincided in its entirety with the programme to transform GSKinto a focused biopharma company and the demerger of ConsumerHealthcare to form Haleon. She continued to take questions and gatherfeedback for the Board from employees on the future strategy, shapeand culture of the two new independent companies in the build up to separation. In doing so, during 2022 she held listening events with a cross-section of: - Consumer Healthcare employees in April 2022 prior to their transfer to Haleon and - Digital and Tech employees in June 2022 that were helping to ensure a strong and secure technology platform for both companies Prior to separation, the Board reviewed its formal workforce engagement arrangements. It was decided to move from a specificWorkforce Engagement Director model and apply an 'alternativearrangement' to the three methods set out in the FRC's Code. Giventhat the new GSK Board was recently refreshed in terms of tenure, withover half of the independent Non-Executive Directors (NEDs) having served for less than three years, and with GSK's renewed purpose and focus as a global biopharma company, it was considered important toadopt a collective Board engagement model. This was agreed to be themost effective approach to ensure newer Board members meet ourpeople and hear their views. This has been implemented by: - a return to direct in-person receptions with local employees, following COVID-19 restrictions during Board site visits. During the second halfof 2022 these included: Stevenage, UK (as one of our two global R&Dhubs), Boston, US, and our Global HQ in Brentford - the Chair undertaking a range of site visits, including: Raleigh Durham, US, to meet with our ViiV employees, King's Cross, Londonwhere he met with our Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learningteam, as well as our Respiratory supply chain employees based inWare, UK and Aranda, Spain - the Chair and Corporate Responsibility Committee Chair meeting with leaders of our employee resource groups (ERGs) to discuss how theyexperience GSK as well as hearing their views on progress with ourdiversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) agenda and ambitions - utilising a variety of bespoke engagements that have enabled a broad and open dialogue and facilitated first hand engagement discussionsbetween the NEDs and our people individually and as part of smallgroups, encompassing perspectives on our strategy, purpose and Ahead Together culture, and DEI GSK Annual Report 2022 Key decisions and engagements continued 116 Our shareholders The Board seeks to directly engage with and be directly accountable to institutional investors and private retail shareholders. It seeks todischarge this direct and continuous accountability in several ways. These include regular communications, the Annual General Meeting, General Meeting and our Annual Governance Meeting, and throughthe work of our Investor Relations team, the Chair, Sir JonathanSymonds, and our Company Secretary, Victoria Whyte. During the year, our CEO, Emma Walmsley, and CFO, Iain Mackay, gave quarterly results presentations to institutional investors, analystsand the media by webcast. They are also regularly joined by the CSO,the Chief Commercial Officer, and CEO, ViiV Healthcare and GSKGlobal Health. They are able to provide investors with more detailedinsights into their specific areas of responsibility. Through regular meetings, Emma and Iain have an ongoing and active dialogue with institutional shareholders about our performance, plansand objectives. In 2022 the CEO held a total of 92 engagements withmajor shareholders, representing approximately 40% of the company'sshare register. The CFO held a total of 113 such engagements withinvestors making up nearly 40% of the company's share register. The Chair has always maintained a constant dialogue with shareholders too - including fund and portfolio managers - as well asengaging with governance and ESG professionals. During 2022 andup to the date of publication of this Report, the Chair held 27 meetingswith a range of investors, who make up approximately 35% of thecompany's share register. This enables him to gain a currentunderstanding of investor views, insights and perspectives of the company. He discusses the many aspects of Board governance, oversight and succession. Charles Bancroft was appointed our new SID in July 2022, after the demerger of the Consumer Healthcare business. He has beenintroducing himself to our shareholders to seek their views on GSK and discuss any key matters of importance. From his appointment as SID to the date of publication of this Report he had 14 meetings withinvestors making up over 25% of our share register. The Chair, CEO and the rest of the Board had a particular focus in 2022 on communicating the final process for demerging Haleon, the ambitions for GSK as a global biopharma business beyond the demerger and progression of our pipeline over three key focus periods:to 2026, 2026 to 2031 and 2031 and beyond. They also soughtinvestors feedback on our new Remuneration policy.Annual Governance Meeting This year's event was a hybrid meeting in central London. Institutionalshareholders, key investment industry bodies and proxy advisory firmswere invited. Over 14 institutional shareholders attended the event,representing approximately 25% of the company's issued share capital.The Chair was joined by our new SID, Committee Chairs and GSK'sexternal audit partner and his successor. We shared with investors the priorities and focus of the Board and its committees in 2022 and the progress made against them. This included: - the execution of a clear plan for separation of Haleon from GSK with strong focus on shareholder value creation - the creation of two attractive and viable businesses with compelling investment propositions - building two highly-qualified Boards to complement the world class management teams - re-architecting the GSK Board - supporting the Haleon Board build - the approval of a new binding Remuneration policy aligned to delivery of GSK's public growth and ESG commitments announced at theInvestor Update in June 2021 and - continuous engagement with shareholders and other stakeholders The meeting was well-received and shareholder feedback was shared subsequently with the full Board. Annual General Meeting We were pleased to be able to hold a hybrid meeting at the Sofitel Heathrow in May 2022. This was the first meeting we were able to holdfor in person attendance since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Wewere pleased to see an increase in attendance by our shareholderscompared to the 2021 AGM that had been held virtually at our registeredoffice in Brentford. 94 shareholders joined the meeting in person and 68shareholders joined virtually to watch or listen to updates from our Chair and the CEO, to ask questions, and vote. With the exception of our proposed Remuneration policy resolution which received shareholderapproval of 62%, all our proposed resolutions were approved byshareholders, with majorities ranging from 91% to 99%. Our AGM this year will be held once again in a hybrid format at the Sofitel Heathrow. Shareholders will also have the flexibility to be able to watch and listen, vote and ask questions at the meeting virtually via theLumi platform and to ask questions via a video connection. See furtherdetails on page 299. General Meeting In addition, the Board convened a General Meeting at Sofitel Heathrowon 6 July 2022 to seek shareholder approvals to authorise the demergerof Haleon and the related share consolidation for GSK. The Chair, CEOand CFO were present in person with the Company Secretary while therest of the Board joined the meeting virtually. 46 shareholders joined themeeting in person and 99 shareholders joined virtually. Both resolutionswere approved by shareholders with majorities in excess of 99%. GSK Annual Report 2022 117Board committee reports Corporate Responsibility Committee report Dr Anne Beal Corporate Responsibility Committee I am pleased to present this report, which is my first as Chair of the Corporate Responsibility Committee (the Committee). I joined the Committee in May 2021 and succeeded Lynn Elsenhans as Chair in July 2022 after a comprehensive transition and handover.During her time as Chair, Lynn made an outstanding contribution inoverseeing, shaping and embedding our Trust priority and our approach as a responsible business, and, more recently, establishing the six areas of ESG focus for GSK as a pure biopharma company.These six areas - detailed on pages 42 to 50 - directly contribute tolong-term shareholder value by contributing to our health impact,supporting thriving people and reducing risk. I have been drawing on my extensive healthcare experience as a physician and public health expert - including my time as Chief PatientOfficer of Sanofi combined with my passion for patient advocacy, tocontinue building on the Committee's work. I have framed the work andscrutiny of the Committee on the following questions: - how do we as a company and Committee know how we are performing across our ESG focus areas? - can we challenge ourselves to further improve our performance? - how we can best report to our key stakeholders on what we have done and the level of impact we have made? Driving the Board's oversight for enhanced ESG performance A central element of the Committee's work over the last 12 months has been devoted to accelerating improvements in how ESG performanceis understood and managed. The Committee agreed the introduction and disclosure of a new ESG Performance Rating - one of our company KPIs as a key management tool to drive delivery of ESG across our six ESG focus areas. Thisrating has been derived from assessing the performance of a numberof stretching, independently assured metrics across the focus areas toarrive at a single composite measure. The Committee has regularlymonitored the company's progress against these metrics during thecourse of the year. We recommended to the Board the publication of afinal on track ESG Rating for 2022 alongside the other ESG disclosures in this Annual Report and our ESG Performance Report. Further details can be found on page 42 of the strategic report andwithin the ESG performance report, available on gsk.com.ESG performance deep dives Throughout the year the Committee has discussed with managementthe following areas of our ESG focus. Access and pricing principles: The Committee reviewed and recommended to the Board the adoption and publication of GSK'sPricing and Access Principles (Principles). The principles are a high-level articulation of management's current approach to pricing and access. They have been prepared with extensive internal and external consultation and had been validated withkey audiences including patient advocacy groups drawn from the USand UK. The Committee, as part of its detailed input on these Principles, made sure that they captured: - the impact value of GSK's innovation in terms of economic benefit - health equity within and between countries - the importance of the supply network for access and - that the Principles are sufficiently flexible to evolve over time and are subject to regular review Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI): The Committee continues to regularly assess the progress of GSK's DEI approach and the keymetrics identified to drive performance. Metrics to support some of theseareas form part of the new ESG Performance Rating, which can beexplored further on page 47. This work includes efforts to further increase our leadership diversity, build a diverse talent pipeline and foster an inclusive culture. TheCommittee was pleased to note the strong overall progress that wasbeing made towards the gender and ethnicity aspirations for 2025. Inparticular, it was pleased that the US ethnic diversity aspiration of at least 30% had already been exceeded this year, while further work was being undertaken to increase Black VP representation in the UK. I firmlybelieve that GSK is doing some outstanding work in this area and havebeen pleased with how the Committee's feedback is being utilised bymanagement to further improve performance for maximum impact. The Committee also reviewed progress on efforts to broaden diversity of our clinical trial participants, grow our supplier diversity, improve healthequity within countries and expand equitable access to STEMeducation. Environment: The Committee has recently reviewed progress on the company's ambition for net zero impact on climate and net positive impact on nature. The Committee is satisfied that good progress is beingmade to date, with a dual focus on maximising the success of thein-flight initiatives and developing targeted actions to maintainmomentum against stretching ambitions. Human rights: The Committee has reviewed management's approach and progress on Human Rights including supply chain and third partyinteractions. We have also considered the complex and rapidly evolvinglegal and regulatory landscape for Human Rights. GSK Annual Report 2022 Board committee reports continued 118 ESG disclosures and reporting: GSK's capability in respect of ESG reporting is continually evolving as we challenge ourselves on howbest to report clearly and concisely on our performance. This is takingplace against greater scrutiny on ESG from all stakeholders, with ESGreporting increasingly moving from voluntary to mandatory. The Committee considers that GSK has a strong and mature ESG reporting approach, but there is an opportunity to bring the level ofcontrol of ESG data up to the same level as controls for financial data.With this in mind, the Committee has approved establishing an ESGdata assurance hub to further strengthen ESG data oversight. Collaborating with other Board committees There has been a careful division of responsibilities and allocation ofthe workload between this Committee and the RemunerationCommittee, in respect of the introduction of specific ESG targets intoour short- and long-term incentive plans from the beginning of 2022.We have been monitoring and helping the Remuneration Committeedetermine vesting outcomes. The Audit & Risk Committee (ARC) supported the Committee in its discussions over the introduction, measurement and disclosure of theESG Performance Rating. The Committee will also work closely withthe ARC from this year onwards over the implementation andoperation of enhanced ESG data assurance oversight anddeterminations, which the ARC Chair sets out further in his report on page 125. Dr Anne Beal Corporate Responsibility Committee Chair 9 March 2023 Science Committee report Dr Jesse Goodman Science Committee I am pleased to present this report as Chair of the Science Committee (the Committee) on our activities during 2022. It is the first since the demerger of Consumer Healthcare as Haleon in July 2022. Key activities in 2022 As a result of the demerger, GSK is now a pure biopharma businesswith a goal of uniting Science, Technology and Talent to better preventand treat disease. In R&D, we are combining the power of genetic and genomic insights into what causes disease, with the speed and scale of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to make better predictionsabout who a treatment might work for, and why. This renewed focus has been evident in the Committee's discussions for some time and I am excited for the future opportunities it brings for GSK and its patients. The Committee's key activities in 2022 can be split into the following key areas, which are covered in more detail below: -Pipeline reviews: monitoring of GSK's pipeline -Scientific deep-dives: discussion and analysis of the key scientific themes which drive the company's R&D strategy -Business development: undertaking technical reviews and assurance of the underlying science of potential businessdevelopment transactions Pipeline progress Fundamental to GSK's achievement of its growth ambitions is thedelivery of a successful pipeline, which the Committee has continued tomonitor throughout the year. During 2021, the Committee participated in the Chief Scientific Officer (CSO) succession planning process. This led to the appointment of Dr Tony Wood in August 2022. Dr Wood has since continued to build on the outstanding progress made by Dr Hal Barron. Prior to his appointmentas CSO, Dr Wood was integrally involved in delivering R&D productivityimprovement and helped develop GSK's current R&D approach focusedon the science of the immune system, human genetics and advancedtechnologies. Consequently, he was well-placed to implement a pipelineto deliver on GSK's bold ambitions for patients. An exceptional milestone during this year was the very positive results from our late-stage respiratory syncytial virus vaccine candidate. Thevaccine demonstrated unprecedented efficacy in older adults and hasthe potential to help reduce disease and death from a major respiratoryinfection which has not, until now, been vaccine preventable. Ourregulatory submission for the vaccine has been accepted for review in Japan, accepted by the European Medicines Agency under accelerated assessment and was submitted to and granted Priority Review status bythe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). GSK Annual Report 2022 Board committee reports continued 119 The Committee was also delighted with the positive phase III results for gepotidacin, a novel oral antibiotic, in the treatment ofuncomplicated urinary tract infections. This is an important step inGSK's continued scientific commitment and investment to addressantimicrobial resistance (AMR). Our licensing agreement with Spero Therapeutics (see below) provides further evidence of our continued leadership and focus in tacklinginfectious diseases and AMR. A number of key approvals were also obtained during the year: -FDA approval of Boostrix for immunisation during pregnancy for the prevention of whooping cough in newborn infants -FDA approval of Menveo in a new single-vial presentation to help prevent disease caused by meningococcal bacteria serogroups A, C,Y and W -FDA approval of Priorix for the prevention of measles, mumps and rubella in individuals 12 months of age and older As well as having an exciting late-stage pipeline, we also now have a robust early-stage portfolio with a number of innovative programmescapable of transforming the lives of patients. Business development transactions GSK is viewing research and development holistically and placinggreat importance on external as well as internal innovation to source promising new medicines and vaccines. During the year, the Committee continued to assess business development transactionsfrom a scientific perspective. The acceleration of businessdevelopment will be key to support GSK's organic pipeline growth.Transactions reviewed by the Committee during the year include: Sierra Oncology: The acquisition of Sierra Oncology, a biopharmaceutical company focused on targeted therapies for rareforms of cancer. The acquisition included momelotinib, a new medicinewith a unique dual mechanism of action intended to address the criticalunmet medical needs of myelofibrosis patients with anaemia. A newdrug application for momelotinib for the treatment of myelofibrosis wasaccepted in August 2022 by the FDA and in December 2022 by theEMA. Affinivax: The acquisition of Affinivax, a clinical-stage company, providing GSK with access to a nextgeneration pneumococcal vaccine candidate and highly innovativeMultiple Antigen Presenting System ( MAPS ) technology. Mersana Therapeutics: The collaboration with co-development commercialisation of XMT-2056, afirst-in-class HER2 STING antibody drug conjugate, initially for thetreatment of advanced breast cancer.Spero Therapeutics: The agreement with Spero Therapeutics for tebipenem HBr, a late-stage antibiotic that may treat complicatedurinary tract infections. There is a significant unmet medical need for anovel oral antibiotic that can potentially provide an alternative tointravenous therapy, particularly for patients with multi-drug resistantorganisms. Wave Life Sciences: This collaboration brings together Wave's PRISM TM oligonucleotide platform and GSK's expertise in genetics and genomics to drive the discovery and development of oligonucleotidetherapeutics focusing on novel genetic targets. Tempus: The collaboration with Tempus provides GSK with access to Tempus' AI-enabled platform including its library of de-identified patientdata - one of the world's largest sources of clinical and molecular data.Through its own leading AI/ML capability, GSK will work with Tempusboth to identify new drug targets and improve clinical trial design,speeding up enrolment and completion, and accelerating thedevelopment of personalised treatments for patients. GSK's dedicated AI/ML team is the largest in-house strategic function in the biopharma industry. Collaborations between R&D and Technologywithin GSK have become increasingly important in drug discovery,enabling GSK to more rapidly and effectively design new vaccines andmedicines. Scientific deep-dives The Committee also dedicated a significant proportion of its time todiscussing some of the most exciting and innovative areas of sciencewhich have been driving the company's R&D strategy. Deep-divesundertaken during the year include: - Phase 1 Pipeline review - RNA based therapeutics and vaccines - Oncology In particular, the Committee's discussion of RNA, including oligonucleotide therapeutics, provided important insights into emergingscience with the potential to transform the lives of patients. In November2022, the company published positive results from a phase IIb trialevaluating the safety and efficacy of bepirovirsen - a potentially transformative treatment for people living with chronic hepatitis B. The results offer an early indication that bepirovirsen might be a potential treatment, either as monotherapy or in combination with otherdrugs, that could result in a functional cure. GSK's expertise in humangenetics, functional genomics and AI/ML to identify novel, genetically validated targets, as well as our recent collaboration with Wave Life Sciences referred to above, demonstrate that we are well-positioned tobecome a leader in oligo-based therapeutics. GSK Annual Report 2022 Board committee reports continued 120 Committee changes As previously mentioned, in August 2022 Dr Tony Wood succeeded Dr Hal Barron as CSO. Tony is an outstanding and highly respectedscientist and the Committee had engaged with him regularly in advance of his appointment. Dr Barron transitioned to a Non-Executive Director and member of the Committee. The Committee, and GSK, willtherefore continue to benefit from his expert advice and support onscientific matters. Dr Laurie Glimcher retired from the Board in October 2022. I would like to thank Laurie for her valuable expertise and scientific insightscontributed to the Committee during her tenure. Finally, having chaired the Committee since its inception over six years ago, my rotation as Chair concluded effective 1 January 2023. Dr Hal Dietz, who joined the Committee on 1 January 2022, has succeeded me as Committee Chair. His experience in human genetics, which iscentral to GSK's approach in R&D, has already proven invaluable inthe Committee's discussions. He is an excellent successor in the roleof Chair. It has been a privilege to work with GSK's outstanding scientists and leaders, as well as my fellow Committee members, and to chair theCommittee during what has been a transformational period, both forthe company and the scientific fields in which we operate. I remain amember of the Committee and look forward to continuing the progressoutlined today. Dr Jesse Goodman Science Committee Chair (2017-2022)9 March 2023 Nominations & Corporate Governance Committee report Jonathan Symonds Nominations & Corporate Governance Committee I am pleased to present my fourth report as Chair of the Nominations & Corporate Governance Committee (the Committee). Key activities in 2022 During the year, the Committee continued its important role in theprocess of: - delivering the demerger of Haleon from the Group as a key Board governance workstream and - creating two attractive and viable businesses with compelling investment propositions, directed and overseen by highly capableboards This was achieved in an orderly and targeted manner by building two highly-qualified boards to complement their world class leadershipteams through: - supporting the shaping and creation of the Haleon Board; and - restructuring the GSK Board with a new focus and expertise for a pure biopharma business Haleon Board appointments In my report last year, I described the work of the Committee in appointing the CEO, CFO and Chair designates of Haleon. I alsodisclosed that two Non-Executive members of the GSK Board wereexpected to transfer to the Haleon Board on completion of the demerger. The Committee subsequently supported the Haleon Chair, Sir Dave Lewis, in finalising the search for and the appointment of high calibrenon-executive directors to complete the Haleon Board and itscommittees. The Board subsequently endorsed the Committee'srecommendation to transition Vindi Banga and Dame Vivienne Cox tothe Haleon Board on completion of the demerger. The Committee considered that the Haleon Board would benefit from both their knowledge and experience. They would also provide importantcontinuity for Haleon post-demerger. Separately, the company's Consumer Healthcare joint venture partner (Pfizer) exercised its right to appoint two non-executive directors to the Haleon Board. Shaping our new biopharma Board I previously described the process to transition the GSK Board as a pure focused global biopharma company and the work undertaken by theCommittee in designing and planning the optimal structure andcomposition of the new biopharma Board. New Non-Executive Directors The Committee wanted to ensure that new Non-Executive Directorappointments would further deepen the biopharma skills, expertise andexperience on the Board. A global search process was activated toappoint directors with deep life sciences commercial expertise and Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) expertise. A diverse list of such candidates was identified, shortlisted and then interviewedby Committee members, the CEO, CSO and our Chief People Officer. GSK Annual Report 2022 Board committee reports continued 121 Following careful review, the Committee was pleased to recommend the appointment of two high calibre individuals, Dr Vishal Sikka andElizabeth McKee Anderson, as independent Non-Executive Directorswith effect from 18 July and 1 September 2022, respectively. Vishal has a very distinguished background as a world-leading technologist and most particularly in the field of AI/ML, which is notonly central to GSK's approach to R&D, but is also embraced acrossthe Group. Meanwhile, Liz brings significant commercial understandingand experience in commercial biopharmaceuticals and is a seasonedbiotech board member. Their contributions are already provinginvaluable to the Board as a fully focused biopharma company. Further details of Vishal and Liz's experience and biographies can be found on pages 100 and 97. The rationale for their appointments wasincluded in the company's announcements on 4 May and 24 August2022 respectively. They are available on gsk.com. Dr Hal Dietz was appointed to the Board at the end of 2021, he joined the Board as a designated Scientific and Medical Expert on 1 January2022. He has extensive experience in the field of human genetics,which is also central to GSK's approach to R&D. The recruitmentprocess for his appointment by the Committee was described in myreport last year. After a year on the Board, Dr Dietz began his rotationas Science Committee Chair from 1 January 2023 in succession to Dr Jesse Goodman. Senior Independent Director (SID) succession Vindi Banga performed the role of SID for over six years. Vindi's transition to the Haleon Board on completion of the demerger created the opportunity to appoint a successor. The Committee determined that Charles Bancroft, having served two years on the Board, withexperience of working with investors from his role as CFO at BristolMyers Squibb, a deep understanding of the pharma industry, hisexperience as a non-executive director of listed companies and havingsufficient time to dedicate to the role, made him the ideal successor.He succeeded Vindi with effect from 18 July 2022. The Board fullyendorsed his appointment. Continuing to shape the GSK Board for the future Management succession planning I previously described the work of the Committee in the appointment of Dr Tony Wood as successor to Dr Hal Barron as CSO and a member of GLT. The transition of Drs Wood and Barron into the roles of CSO and Non-Independent Non-Executive Director took effect as plannedon 1 August 2022. CFO succession When our CFO, Iain Mackay, advised the Board of his intention to stepdown from the Board and leave the company, the Committee activatedits CFO succession plan. A targeted search of high-quality executivesfor CFO succession had already been undertaken against a role profilefor the next CFO for GSK as a pure biotech.The Committee proposed, and the Board approved, the appointment of Ms Julie Brown as successor to Iain Mackay as CFO. Julie, currentlyChief Operating and Financial Officer at Burberry Group plc, will joinGSK in April 2023 and will work with Iain to transition his responsibilities.She will take on responsibilities as CFO and as an Executive Director on1 May 2023. Our CFO succession process is described in more detailbelow. In the Committee's view, the ideal successor to Iain was a proven CFO of a global public company with deep biopharmaceutical experience. Heor she would need to be an effective business partner to the CEO in thesuccessful delivery of GSK's growth ambitions. It was also important tothe Committee that the successor be a good fit with our new culture and have a high energy and a positive mindset. A thorough global search was initiated against this agreed profile. A shortlist of viable candidates was identified for the role. The CEO, othermembers of the Committee, the Chief People Officer and I met with Julieand there was unanimous support that she be recommended as Iain's successor. The Board is looking forward to welcoming Julie to GSK. She is a highly respected CFO with extensive experience in the biopharma andmedtech sectors. Further details of Julie's experience and the rationalefor her appointment are included in the company's announcement on 24 September 2022, which is available on gsk.com. GLT changes In addition to the new CSO and CFO, the Committee has also reviewed the following internal senior executive changes to the GLT to help bring further simplification and alignment of the GLT in these areas: - Luke Miels, Chief Commercial Officer, assumed full accountability for strategic commercial product development of vaccines, alongside hiscurrent accountabilities for strategic product development in Specialty and General Medicines and the commercial performance of the GSK portfolio in markets - Regis Simard, President Global Supply Chain, assumed accountability for both Vaccines and Medicines supply - Deborah Waterhouse, Chief Executive Officer ViiV Healthcare, assumed overall accountability for GSK Global Health - Roger Connor, President of Vaccines and Global Health, left GSK to progress a new role in healthcare, outside biopharma The Committee continues to review our talent and succession pipelines and development plans for key management roles and their successors. Non-Executive Director succession planning The Committee regularly reviews the Board's composition and skills. Itwill be working with the Science Committee for the potential to add afurther Scientific and Medical Expert, as the Board seeks to furthercontribute to our biopharma skills and expertise to support our growthambitions. The Committee is also looking to identify a successor to UrsRohner, our Remuneration Committee Chair, who is due to retire fromthe Board in 2024. I look forward to providing further updates on these roles next year. GSK Annual Report 2022 Board committee reports continued 122Composition and tenure Diversity, equity and inclusion 1 Target female representation on Board is 40%. Data from GSK Annual Report published in the first quarter of each year. Current female representation is 27.2% at the date of publication. This is expected to rise to 36% in May 2023 post-CFO succession Board and GLT gender diversity Diversity objective Status Performance At least 40% of Board positions held by women Below objective 27.2% At least one woman either in the Chair, SID role on the Board and/or one Met objective One Director (CEO) woman in the Chief Executive Officer or Finance Director role by the end of 2025 At least 40% of GLT positions held by women Met objective 41.7% At least one Board Director is ethnically diverse Exceed objective Two Directors The Board seeks to balance its composition and tenure, and that of its committees, and to refresh them over time. This enables the Board tobenefit from the experience of longer-serving Directors as well as the fresh perspectives and insights from newer appointees. Our Non- Executive Directors are now drawn from industries and backgroundsmost relevant to apure biopharma company, including life sciences, the pharmaceuticals industry, R&D and Tech, vaccines and healthcare, medical research andacademia and financial services. Collectively they have a wealth of experience of complex businesses with global reach. We are committed to the diversity of our Board, just as GSK is committed to equal opportunities for all employees at all levels of ourorganisation. The Board and management seek to encourage adiverse and inclusive culture throughout the company. An effective Board needs a range and balance of skills, experience, knowledge, ethnicity, gender, social-economic backgrounds andindependence, with individuals who are prepared to challenge eachother collaboratively. This mix needs to be complemented by adiversity of personal Boardattributes, including character, intellect, judgement, honesty and courage. The Committee is responsible for developing measurable objectives and monitoring progress towards their achievement to assist the implementation of the Board's diversity policy (Policy), including gender and ethnic diversity. As a minimum, we seek to align our Policyobjectives with the Financial Conduct Authority, FTSE Women LeadersReview and Parker Review diversity targets and ensure that they areconsistent with our public diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI)aspirations.

GSK will then have one of the veryfew all-female Executive Boards running a FTSE 100 company. Wealso expect to fully restore our Board gender diversity to meet orexceed 40% by 2024. The Board has been pleased that for many years its gender representation objective has been in excess of the target of over 40%of Board positions being held by women. This is illustrated on theprevious page of my Committee report. The composition and diversityof the Board is currently in a transitional period following the demergerand the reshaping of the Board for the new biopharma company, thetransfer of Board members to Haleon and the retirement of two female Board Directors. We also continue to oversee the developing pipeline of direct reports to the GLT by gender and from ethnically diverse backgrounds. Details of GSK's representation of women and ethnically diverse leaders is covered on page 47, as part of the diversity of our global workforce. Progress against our DEI commitments, including gender and ethnicity, is illustrated in our ESG Performance Report on gsk.com. This goodprogress has also been incentivised by the introduction of an ESG: DEImeasure in the annual bonus arrangements for our Executive Directorsand other GLT members. GSK Annual Report 2022 Board committee reports continued 124 Ways of working The Committee seeks to follow best practice in all the appointments it recommends, agreeing the criteria for each role, the most appropriate interview panel, before then considering a comprehensive and diverse long list of candidates. Shortlistedcandidates are interviewed and assessed against the chosencriteria. Due diligence is then undertaken before the Committeemakes its final recommendation. Executive search firms areappointed in accordance with the company's procurement policybased on their expertise relative to each role. The Committee has agreed that only search firms who are signatories to the Voluntary Code of Conduct of Executive SearchFirms on gender diversity and best practice will be engaged. The Committee worked with a number of executive search firms in 2022, who provided additional consultancy services to the companyas outlined below: - Korn Ferry: general recruitment, executive search and assessment services, coaching and other HR-related services - Egon Zehnder: executive search, assessment and coaching services to specific senior executives - Heidrick & Struggles: executive search services The Committee reviewed the potential for conflicts of interest and judged that there were appropriate safeguards against suchconflicts. I look forward to reporting further progress in next year's report. Sir Jonathan Symonds Nominations & Corporate Governance Committee Chair9 March 2023 Audit & Risk Committee report Charles Bancroft Audit & Risk Committee I am pleased to present this report, which is my second as Chair of the Audit & Risk Committee (the Committee). In my report last year, I spoke about my initial, very favourable, impressions of the people, processes, systems and culture at GSK thatunderpin the successful management of financial reporting, audit,litigation and compliance risks. I am pleased to report that GSKcontinues to exhibit a strong compliance culture with a consistent toneand engagement from the top that runs throughout the organisation, andthe financial reporting and controls framework remains robust and did not require any fundamental changes during the year. Key activities in 2022 Key decisions: As usual, it has been a busy year for the Committee. Not only working through its regular programme of activities, but makingimportant decisions in support of the Board's progression of its keypriorities, in summary: - recommended to the Board approval of the planned separation of our Consumer Healthcare business in July 2022, based on theCommittee's awareness and review of the transaction and Haleon'soperational readiness, and the approval of final issuance of public documents and entry into associated legal agreements - exercised oversight for the Zantac product liability litigation by which I provided regular reports to the Board on progress - conducted a robust review process, together with the CFO, to select and appoint a replacement to the current lead audit partner, whounder the five-year audit partner rotation rules, rotates off after thepublication of this Annual Report. Further details are set out on page 128 Completion of the demerger I highlighted, in my report last year, details of the technical work of the Committee as a key demerger governance workstream. This includedoverseeing the evolution of financial reporting matters, risk and controlsand the public documents associated with delivering the demerger and listing to form Haleon. This work continued and intensified through the first half of 2022 to the point at which the Committee was able tocomplete its review processes and recommend the approval of the GSKCircular, Haleon Prospectus and Form 20-F and associated documentsand matters to the Board. Separately, the Committee reviewed theprocesses to establish financial reporting systems and development of arobust internal control and risk management framework for Haleon. Thiswas a significant and critical demerger workstream that was successfullydelivered months prior to the demerger on a business-as-usual basis. GSK Annual Report 2022 Board committee reports continued 125 Information and cyber security This is one of our principal risks which is regularly on the Committee's agenda. During 2022 the Committee oversaw the merging ofprogramme deliverables into an updated Cyber Maturity Plan (CMP) with additional capabilities to continue to get ahead of a dynamic threat environment. The Committee has also reviewed the benchmarking ofour target cyber maturity against an industry best-practice framework,known as the National Institute of Standards and Technology CyberSecurity Framework (NIST-CSF) and these learnings have beenincorporated into the CMP. The Committee will continue to performregular assessments of delivery against the Plan to further enhancethe capabilities and maturity of our cyber security framework. I am pleased that the Committee's oversight in this area has been further strengthened this year with the expertise of my fellow Board Directorcolleague, Dr Vishal Sikka, who advises the Committee on thisenterprise risk. Vishal has a distinguished career in the Tech industryand served as CEO of Infosys Limited and provides the Committeeand management with valuable insights. Key risk indicators For several years now, our Compliance function has worked with riskowners and management to develop and report to the Committee onkey risk indicators (KRIs) at an enterprise level and across ourmarkets. As a core part of this process, we have been usingenhancements in our technology and data analytics capabilities toemploy a more data-driven approach to risk management across aconstantly evolving risk landscape to further strengthen ourcompliance oversight and culture. Earlier this year, the Committee examined a review of our principal risks resulting in a simplified process with fewer KRIs, new KRIs, somerevised definitions, and prioritisation of the most meaningful indicatorsfor the company. The Committee was pleased to note that this simplerapproach would result in more focus on fewer KRIs reported to Risk Oversight & Compliance Council (ROCC) which then reports to the Committee, with a greater focus being brought to bear on escalation ofissues or concerns that are material to GSK. Meanwhile, operationaldata, monitoring findings and other established risks would continue tobe analysed by risk owners to ensure appropriate risk mitigationcontinues and escalation, if necessary. Zantac litigation oversight During the year, primary oversight for Zantac litigation, the related accounting, disclosure and communication assessments hascontinued to be undertaken by the Committee. I then report theCommittee's conclusions on these matters to the Board. TheCommittee continues to receive regular legally privileged updates. InDecember 2022, we welcomed the ruling by the United States DistrictCourt (Southern District of Florida) which dismissed all federal casesalleging the five remaining cancers in the Multi-District Litigation. We will continue to defend all claims brought at State level vigorously based on the science.Audit quality indicators Audit Quality Indicators (AQIs) are quantitative and qualitative measuresof external audit quality at an audit firm-level, an engagement level andfrom a management or company perspective. Together with our lead audit partner, I was pleased to participate in a project carried out by the FRC to identify the most useful engagement level AQIs relevant for theaudit to help improve transparency and drive audit qualityimprovements. Our engagement with the FRC focused on our mostrecent Annual Report and considered the interactions between theauditor and the Committee during the audit process. We had aconstructive dialogue and one which I hope was helpful to the FRC inprogressing its work in promoting key drivers of audit quality. Committee aims in 2023 The Committee's remit has expanded from 2023 onwards as the Boardhas requested that it exercise oversight and review of GSK's ESG dataassurance work. In doing so, the Committee is currently overseeing thebuild and implementation of a new dedicated ESG data assurance hubin our Finance organisation to support this. The hub will ensure minimum standards of controls, governance and data quality to assure the accuracy of ESG data in support of thecompany's performance against ESG metrics and compliance with newESG reporting requirements. Meanwhile, our Corporate ResponsibilityCommittee, on behalf of the Board, continues to exercise oversight of ESG strategy, performance assessment and reporting. Internal control framework The Board recognises its obligation to present a fair, balanced and understandable assessment of GSK's current position and prospects.Reflecting this responsibility, it is accountable for evaluating andapproving the effectiveness of GSK's internal controls, includingfinancial, operational and compliance controls, and risk management processes. We ensure the reliability of our financial reporting, and compliance with laws and regulations, through our internal control framework. This is acomprehensive enterprise-wide risk management model which supportsthe Board's continuous identification, evaluation and management of the Group's principal and emerging risks, as required by the FRC's Code. The framework is designed to manage the risk of GSK not achieving itsbusiness objectives. A fit-for-purpose framework - complemented by our corporate culture and Speak Up processes - ensures that the risks associated with our business activities are actively and effectively controlled in line with our agreed risk appetite. We believe GSK's framework provides reasonable,but not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. GSK Annual Report 2022 Board committee reports continued 126 The Board mandates the Group's ROCC of senior leaders to assist the Committee in overseeing risk management and internal controlactivities. It also provides the business with a framework for riskmanagement and upward escalation of significant risks. RiskManagement and Compliance Boards (RMCBs) across the Grouppromote the 'tone from the top' and establish our risk culture, as well as ensuring effective oversight of internal controls and risk management processes. Each principal risk has an assigned risk owner, drawn from senior management, who is accountable for managing the principal risk with oversight from a GLT member, which includes setting and implementing risk mitigation plans. Risk owners report quarterly ontheir respective risk management approach and progress at the ROCCand the appropriate Board Committee. Our Compliance functionassists the ROCC and RMCBs. Compliance is responsible foradvancing enterprise-wide risk management and for developing risk-based and ethically sound working practices. It also actively promotesethical behaviours by enabling all employees to operate in line with ourculture and comply with applicable laws and regulations. Our Audit & Assurance (A&A) function provides independent assurance to senior management and the Board on the effectivenessof risk management Group-wide, in line with an agreed assuranceplan. This helps senior management and the Board to meet theiroversight and advisory responsibilities in fulfilling GSK's strategic objectives and building trust with patients and other stakeholders. A&A has a dual reporting line to the CFO and the Committee. The Committee receives regular reports from principal risk owners, Compliance and A&A on areas of significant risk to the Group and onrelated internal controls. These reports assess the internal control environment within each principal risk area, including enhancements to strengthen controls. Following consideration of these reports, theCommittee reports annually to the Board on the effectiveness of GSK'sinternal controls.In 2022, through the authority delegated to the Committee, the Board conducted a robust assessment of the Group's principal risks. Thisassessment, which was in line with the FRC's Code, includedconsideration of the nature and extent of risk the Board is willing to takein achieving GSK's strategic objectives. The Board, via the Committee, also oversaw the effectiveness of our internal control environment and risk management processes across theGroup for the whole year, up to the approval date of this Annual Report. A review of the Group's risk management approach is further discussed in the 'Risk management' section of the strategic report onpages 51 to 64. The management of each principal risk is explained in 'Principal risks and uncertainties' on pages 285 to 295. The Group's viability is discussed in the Group risk management section of the strategic reporton page 64. Significant issues relating to the financial statements In considering GSK's quarterly financial results announcements and the financial results in the 2022 Annual Report, the Committee reviewed thesignificant issues and management judgements in determining thoseresults. It reviewed management papers setting out the key areas of risk, actions taken to quantify the effects of the relevant issues, and judgements made by management on the appropriate accountingrequired to address those issues in the financial statements. The significant issues considered in relation to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022 are set out in the following table, with a summary of the financial outcomes where appropriate. The Committee and the external auditor have discussed the significantissues addressed by the Committee during the year and the areas ofparticular audit focus, as described in the Independent Auditor's Reporton pages 168 to 181. GSK Annual Report 2022 Board committee reports continued 127Significant issues considered by the Committee in relation to the financial statements How the issue was addressed by the Committee Going concern basis for the preparation of the financial statements The Committee considered the outcome of management's half-yearly and year-end reviews of current and forecast net debt positions and the various financing facilities and options available tothe Group. The Committee also considered management's review of the impacts of the currenteconomic environment and climate change impacts. Following consideration of these assessments,which included stress testing and viability scenarios, sources of liquidity and funding, forecasts andestimates, the Committee confirmed that the application of the going concern basis for thepreparation of the financial statements continued to be appropriate. Revenue recognition, including returns and rebates (RAR) accruals The Committee reviewed management's approach to the timing of recognition of revenue and accruals for customer returns and rebates. The RAR accrual for US Commercial Operations was\u00a35.9 billion at 31 December 2022 and the Committee reviewed the basis on which the accrual hadbeen made and concurred with management's judgements on the amounts involved. A fullerdescription of the process operated in US Commercial Operations in determining the level of accrualnecessary is set out in 'Critical accounting policies' on pages 94 and 95. Provisions for legal matters, including investigations into the Group'scommercial practices The Committee received detailed reports on actual and potential litigation from both internal and external legal counsel including the Zantac litigation, together with a number of detailed updates on investigations into the Group's commercial practices. Management outlined the levels of provision and corresponding disclosure considered necessary in respect of potential adverse litigation outcomes and also those areas where it was not yet possible to determine if a provision wasnecessary, or its amount. At 31 December 2022, the provision for legal matters was \u00a30.2 billion, seeNote 32 to the financial statements, 'Other provisions' for more details. Provisions for uncertain tax positions The Committee considered current tax disputes and areas of potential risk and concurred with management's judgement on the levels of tax contingencies required. At 31 December 2022, a taxpayable liability of \u00a30.6 billion, including provisions for uncertain tax positions, was recognised on theGroup's balance sheet. Impairments of intangible assets The Committee reviewed management's process for reviewing and testing goodwill and other intangible assets for potential impairment. The Committee accepted management's judgements onthe intangible assets that required writing down and the resulting impairment charge of \u00a3402 millionin 2022. See Note 20 to the financial statements, 'Other intangible assets' for more details. Valuation of contingent consideration in relation to ViiV Healthcare The Committee considered management's judgement that it was necessary to increase the liability to pay contingent consideration primarily as a result of updated exchange rate assumptions as wellas increases in sales forecasts and the unwind of the discount. After cash payments of nearly\u00a31.1 billion in the year, at 31 December 2022, the Groups' balance sheet included a contingentconsideration liability of \u00a35.9 billion in relation to ViiV Healthcare. See Note 33 to the financial statements, 'Contingent consideration liabilities' for more details. ViiV Healthcare put option The Committee reviewed and agreed the accounting for the Pfizer put option and concurred with management's judgement on the valuation of the put option of \u00a31.1 billion at 31 December 2022. Consumer Healthcare demerger The Committee reviewed management's process for presenting Consumer Healthcare as a discontinued operation and the subsequent demerger accounting. The gain on the demerger of\u00a310.1 billion included significant values relating to the fair value of assets distributed and ownershipin Haleon retained, the net assets and non-controlling interest distributed/de-recognised and thecumulative foreign exchange recycled. See Note 41 'Acquisitions and Disposals' to the financial statements for more details. GSK Annual Report 2022 Board committee reports continued 128 Effectiveness and quality of external audit process The Committee is committed to ensuring that GSK receives a high- quality and effective external audit. In evaluating Deloitte'sperformance during 2021, prior to making a recommendation on its reappointment in early 2022, the Committee reviewed the effectiveness of its performance against the criteria which it agreedwith management at the beginning of 2021. The detailed criteria usedfor judging the effectiveness of Deloitte as external auditor areavailable on gsk.com. These are based on the audit approach andstrategy, ensuring a high-quality independent audit, effectivepartnership and value for money. The Committee monitors engagements with external stakeholders relevant to the Committee's areas of oversight, including the FRC andSecurities and Exchange Commission. During the year the FRC's AuditQuality Review (AQR) team reviewed Deloitte's audit of the Group's2021 financial statements as part of its annual inspection of audit firms.The Committee received and reviewed the final report from the AQR team which identified no key findings, assessed the audit as requiring limited improvement and noted several areas of good practice. The Committee sought to ensure that Deloitte would deliver a smooth, thorough and efficiently-executed audit for 2022. In undertaking itsreview, the Committee considered: - the overall quality of the audit - the independence of Deloitte - whether Deloitte exhibited an appropriate level of challenge and scepticism in its work Deloitte's length of tenure was not taken into account when assessing its independence and objectivity, given it only commenced its role asauditor in 2018. However, the Committee did consider how effectively it had assumed its role as auditor. The Committee also considered feedback on the 2022 external audit, through a survey of Committeemembers and the financial management team at corporate andbusiness unit level. The survey covered the: - effectiveness of the auditor's challenge - integrity of Deloitte - transparency of its reporting to management and the Committee - clarity of the auditor's communications and ways of working - alignment of the 2021 audit to the Group's investment in Systems, Applications and Products (SAP) - quality of the audit team's leadership and - skills and experience of the audit team The Committee Chair regularly meets independently with the audit partners. The Committee also meets with the auditor privately at theend of each meeting to discuss progress, as appropriate. Havingreviewed the above feedback, and noted any areas of improvement tobe implemented by the audit team for 2023, the Committee wassatisfied with the: - effectiveness of the auditor and the external audit process and- auditor's independence, qualifications, objectivity, expertise and resources The Committee therefore agreed to recommend the reappointment of Deloitte to the Board at the forthcoming AGM. In making its recommendation, the Committee was free from the influence of any third party. Auditor's reappointment External auditor External auditor appointment Last tender May - December 2016 Transition year 2017 First shareholder approval of current auditor May 2018 First audited Annual Report and 20-F Year ending 31 December 2018 New lead audit engagement partner 2023 Next audit tender required by regulations 2026 (to take effect from 2028) There were no contractual or similar obligations restricting the Group's choice of external auditor. Audit partner rotation The external auditor is required to rotate the audit engagement partnerfor GSK every five years. Our current audit partner is due to step down from their position after the audit of GSK's financial statements for 2022 has been concluded. After a robust review process by the Committee, together with the involvement of the CFO, to select their replacement, the Committeeapproved the appointment of the next audit engagement partner witheffect from the financial year commencing on 1 January 2023. The Committee is satisfied that Deloitte has been managing an orderly handover to the new audit engagement partner to ensure there is aseamless transition and maintenance of high levels of audit quality andeffectiveness. Audit tender The Committee considers that during 2022 the company complied withthe mandatory audit processes and audit committee responsibilityprovisions of the Competition and Markets Authority Statutory AuditServices Order 2014. As Deloitte continues to maintain its independence and objectivity, and the Committee remains satisfied with its performance, GSK does notintend to tender the external auditor contract before the end of thecurrent required period of 10 years identified above and considers thatthis is in the best interests of shareholders. The Committee is mindful that the 2023 financial year will see a new CFO for GSK and audit partner for Deloitte, which will help further mitigate the risks of any over-familiarity between the company and the auditor. GSK Annual Report 2022 Board committee reports continued 129 Non-audit services Management operates on the presumption that other accountancy firms will provide non-audit services to GSK. However, where theexternal auditor's skills and experience make it the only suitable supplier of non-audit support - such as for audit-related matters, tax and other services - it may be used, in the best interests of thecompany. In line with GSK's non-audit services policy, the Committeeensures that auditor objectivity and independence are safeguarded byreviewing and pre-approving the external auditor's provision of suchservices. The company policy complies with the FRC's 2019 RevisedEthical Standard and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. It observes thefollowing core policy features on engaging the external auditor for non-audit services: GSK non-audit services policy, key features: Process: All non-audit services over \u00a350,000 are put to competitive tender with other financial services providers, in line with the Group's procurement process, unless the skills and experienceof the external auditor make it the only suitable supplier. Safeguards: Adequate safeguards are established so that the objectivity and independence of the Group audit are not threatened orcompromised. Fee cap: The total fee payable for non-audit services should not exceed 50% of the annual audit fee, except in special circumstanceswhere there would be a clear advantage in the auditorundertaking the additional work. Prohibitions: GSK's policy includes a 'whitelist' of permitted non-audit services in line with the relevant regulations. Any service not on this list is prohibited. Pre-approval: All non-audit services require pre-approval as set out in the table below to ensure services approved are consistent withGSK's non-audit policy for permissible services. This processensures all services fall within the scope of services permittedand pre-approved by the Committee and does not represent adelegation of authority for pre-approval. Value More than \u00a350,000 Between \u00a325,000 and\u00a350,000 Under \u00a325,000 Pre-approver Committee Chair and CFO Group Financial Controller Designate of the GroupFinancial Controller Audit and other services comparison (\u00a3m) Note 8 to the financial statements provides further details of fees payable to the company's auditor.The fees paid to the company's auditor and its associates are set out overleaf. Further details are given in Note 8 to the financial statements,'Operating profit' on page 199. During the year, fees for audit-related and other assurance services of \u00a36.3 million included \u00a34.4 million related to the continued work in the year associated with Deloitte's reporting accountant role in preparing forthe demerger of the Consumer Healthcare business. Including auditfees in respect of the GSK pension schemes of \u00a30.2 million, fees foraudit-related and other assurance services represent 31.6% of theannual audit service fee (2021: 15.2%). Excluding the demerger workand quarterly review work, fees for audit-related and other assuranceservices would have represented 4.4% of the annual audit fee. The Committee's rationale for originally hiring Deloitte to undertake the reporting accountant role is set out on page 115 of GSK's 2021 AnnualReport. The Committee considered the level of non-audit services incurred as part of its annual review of Deloitte's independence set out on theprevious page and was satisfied that the auditor continued to beindependent and exercised objectivity throughout 2022. Fair, balanced and understandable assessment The need for an annual report to be fair, balanced and understandable isone of the key compliance requirements for a company's financialstatements. To ensure that GSK's Annual Report meets thisrequirement, we have a well-established and documented processgoverning the coordination and review of Group-wide contributions tothe publication. This runs in parallel with the process followed by theexternal auditor. The Committee received a summary of management'sapproach to GSK's 2022 Annual Report to ensure it met the requirements of the FRC's Code. This enabled the Committee, and the Board, to confirm that GSK's 2022 Annual Report as a whole is fair,balanced and understandable and provides the necessary informationfor shareholders to assess the company's position and performance,business model and strategy. Code of Conduct and reporting lines We have a number of well-established policies (including a new Code of Conduct), which are available on gsk.com, together with details of our confidential Speak Up lines for reporting and investigating unlawfulconduct.

Our Articles provide ageneral power for the Board to authorise such conflicts. The Board reviews any new potential or actual conflict, which is recorded by the Company Secretary. Directors are not counted in the quorum for the authorisation of their own actual or potential conflicts. The Nominations & Corporate Governance Committee reviews theRegister of Conflicts on an annual basis which the Board subsequentlyapproves. On a continuing basis, the Directors are responsible for informing the Company Secretary of any such new actual or potential conflicts that may arise or if there are any changes in circumstances that may affectan authorisation previously given. Even when provided withauthorisation, a Director is not absolved from his or her statutory duty topromote the success of the company. If an actual conflict arises post-authorisation, the Board may choose to exclude the Director fromreceipt of the relevant information and participation in the debate, orsuspend the Director from the Board, or, as a last resort, require theDirector to resign.The Nominations & Corporate Governance Committee reviewed the register of potential conflict authorisations (the Register of Conflicts) inJanuary 2022. The Committee reported to the Board that the conflicts had been appropriately authorised and that the process for authorisation continued to operate effectively. The Committee then recommended theapproval of the Register of Conflicts to the Board which it subsequentlyapproved. Except as described in Note 40 to the financial statements,'Related party transactions', during or at the end of the financial year noDirector or Person Closely Associated had any material interest in anycontract of significance with a Group company. Our Articles prohibit a Director from voting on any resolution concerning his or her appointment or the terms or termination of his or herappointment.

Dear Shareholder, On behalf of the Remuneration Committee, I am pleased to present our Remuneration report for 2022. This includes my annual statement,explaining the Committee's work this year, our annual report onremuneration for 2022, a summary of our Remuneration policy whichwas approved by shareholders at the 2022 AGM, and details of how we propose to operate the Policy this year. GSK's Remuneration policy 2022 As detailed last year, we introduced a new Remuneration policy in 2022 to better link executive remuneration to delivery ofoutperformance. The new arrangements were designed to reward the delivery of the bold new performance ambitions set out at our Investor Update in 2021 - to deliver sales growth of more than 5% CAGR and adjusted operating profit growth of more than 10% CAGR from 2021 to 2026.These ambitions represent a step-change in performance for theGroup and achievement of them should deliver top quartileperformance for our sector. The Committee concluded that the design of its existing Remuneration policy framework remained fit for purpose. However, given that drivinglong-term performance through consistent year-on-year improvementwas the main aim behind these targets, changing the short-termAnnual Bonus plan was determined to be the key imperative. The main change to the plan was to significantly reduce the Annual Bonus opportunity for below-target performance while increasing theAnnual Bonus opportunity for 'exceptional performance' to 300% ofsalary. The increase in overall Annual Bonus opportunity does notincrease the cash reward opportunity, as any incremental reward isdelivered in the form of shares deferred for three years. The Committee is very aware of the sensitivity amongst stakeholders to levels of executive pay.We engaged extensively with shareholders to gain their views and feedback on these changes. Please see the table below which sets out the full details of this process. As a result, we made adjustments to quantum, clarity on disclosure of outcomes, and transparency in relation to the targets set, that all featurein the final policy. At the 2022 AGM, the new policy was approved with 62% of shareholders voting in favour, but the Committee recognises that asignificant minority of shareholders voted against. Following the AGM,the Committee ensured continued consultation with shareholders to understand the full range of views, including those who voted against the proposals. The Committee thanks shareholders for their feedbackand remains committed to engaging on remuneration. It continues tobelieve that incentivising outperformance against stretching targets willcreate long-term value for shareholders. Noting that no new issues wereraised, the Committee is comfortable that no further change is requiredto the Annual Bonus plan. The Committee will review with shareholdersthe evolving needs of the business in advance of the renewal of ourRemuneration policy in 2025. Two administrative amendments to the 2022 Remuneration policy are being proposed for shareholder approval at the 2023 AGM. Furtherdetails are set out on page 163. 2022 remuneration outcomes The very strong operating performance for GSK in the first year of thenew remuneration arrangements has highlighted the importance ofincentivising exceptional performance. As set out earlier in the Annual Report, in 2022 the Group delivered strong sales growth of Vaccines and Specialty Medicines and double-digit growth in operating profit and earnings per share. GSK Annual Report 2022 134Committee Chair's annual statement continued Remuneration awards for the year reflect this excellent operating performance, alongside successful delivery of the demerger ofConsumer Healthcare to form Haleon, the largest demerger in Europefor over 20 years. 2022 Annual Bonus The Bonus outcomes for the CEO and CFO were each determined byreference to performance against stretching total sales, adjustedoperating profit and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) targets as well as the Committee's assessment of their individual performance against specific strategic and operational measures. The total sales growth rate was 3.4% above the target growth rate of 6.5% and the adjusted operating profit growth rate was 3.9% abovethe target growth rate of 12.8%. This led to an overall payout under the financial elements of 149.5% of salary. The targets were set with consideration given to analyst consensus, hence the Committee iscomfortable that the payout represents exceptional performance. Thefull target range is set out on page 139. When combined with theassessment of the non-financial elements, the overall payout was249.5% of salary for the CEO (149.5% of salary delivered in deferredshares) and 227.5% of salary for the CFO (127.5% of salary deliveredin deferred shares). The Committee believes the Bonus outcomes appropriately reflect the overall performance achieved in 2022. Full details are provided onpage 139. Long-term incentive (LTI) awards 52% of the 2020 Performance Share Plan (PSP) award vested. Targets were set against pipeline progress (20%), innovation sales (20%), adjusted free cash flow (30%) and relative TSR (30%). Disappointingly there was nil-vesting under relative TSR. However, strong performance against other metrics was evidenced with fullvesting under the cash flow element and partial vesting under pipelineprogress and innovation sales. This reflects progress in R&D, includingpositive data for the company's potential new RSV vaccine, and strongsales from products launched over the last five years, includingshingles vaccine Shingrix which generated sales of \u00a33 billion during the year. Following a review of contextual factors including previous payouts, the Committee believes that the formulaic outcomes appropriatelyreflect performance in the round having considered the experience ofall stakeholders including shareholders and our employees. TheCommittee did not deem it necessary to exercise discretion. Incentive awards in relation to 2022 were made in accordance with the 2022 Remuneration policy. Remuneration policy implementation for 2023 Annual Bonus and LTI performance measures Following changes to the bonus in 2022, for 2023 we are maintainingthe performance measures in our incentive plans as they continue toalign with our strategic goals. Annual Bonus measures will be: annual total sales growth (30%); annual adjusted operating profit growth (30%); personal performanceagainst strategic and operational measures (30%); ESG: diversity,equity (10%). LTI measures will be: relative TSR (30%), total sales growth over three years (20%); adjusted operating profit growth over three years (20%); pipeline progress (20%); and ESG: environment compositescorecard (10%). The nature of the strategic and operational objectives for each Executive Director will be in line with those agreed for the 2022 Annual Bonus.These focus particularly on individual areas of accountability to deliverthe company's strategy. For example, the CEO has clear pipeline delivery objectives. Each Executive's objectives also require demonstration of their contribution to leading and living our culture ofperformance with integrity which the Board believes is a critical lever oflong-term value creation for GSK. The Committee has reflected at length on investor input regarding the most appropriate ESG measures to focus on. One theme which arose during consultation was the possibility of introducing a metric on accessto medicines. However, as GSK is already an industry leader in thisarea, and as it is deeply engrained in the company's culture and values,the Committee felt that it was not necessary to include this as a specificmetric in incentives. Instead, the Committee has selected measuresaimed at specific GSK challenges and opportunities in environmentalsustainability and DEI. Performance targets have been calibrated to consider a number of internal and external reference points, in particular analyst consensushas been considered for financial metrics where available. TheCommittee is therefore satisfied that the targets set for 2023 aresufficiently stretching. Salary The Committee agreed that the CEO should receive a 4% salaryincrease for 2023 which is lower than the average increase to the wider workforce in the UK of 5%. In addition to the 5% average salary increase, the company has implemented a number of monetary andnon-monetary initiatives for our colleagues in reaction to the cost ofliving crisis as explained in my statement. Workforce fairness In setting executive pay it is important that the Committee does so with agood understanding of the Group's wider workforce pay approach, withan emphasis on fairness and equity. To that end, on an annual basis, I meet with senior Human Resources Leaders from across the company to understand perspectives on payand GSK's remuneration arrangements for the wider workforce. Thisyear was the fourth such annual meeting held. GSK Annual Report 2022 Committee Chair's annual statement continued 135 At the meeting, we discussed how GSK continues to support its diversity aspiration through fair pay processes and proactive reviews and enhancements to its employee benefits. These included: - new global minimum standards for parental leave and for care of a family member - review of medical and insured benefits with a focus on equity for same sex couples wherever legally possible and - new financial education support Given the very challenging economic environment and cost of living pressures in many countries, management has taken action to support current employees and to attract talent, through competitive salaryincreases, one-off support payments to staff at lower grades, andenhancements to workforce wellbeing programmes. At the start of 2022, changes were also made to the Annual Bonus plan below the GLT level to reflect a greater focus on performance. The new plan has been generally well received and first payments willbe made in Q1 2023. Director changes In August 2022, Dr Hal Barron transitioned, as planned, from his roleas CSO to a non-independent Non-Executive Director. Dr Barron wascontractually entitled to receive a pro-rated target bonus in respect of2022. He did not receive an LTI grant in 2022. We also announced the appointment of Julie Brown as CFO from May 2023, when Iain Mackay will step down from the Board. As previouslycommunicated, Mr Mackay will continue to receive his base salary untilhe leaves GSK at the end of the year and will be eligible to receive anAnnual Bonus in respect of 2023. He will not be eligible to receive anyfurther LTI awards and will receive no salary increase in 2023. Fulldetails of his retirement arrangements including the treatment ofin-flight LTI awards can be found on page 149.Our new CFO, Julie Brown's salary of \u00a3915,335 was preliminarily set inline with that of her predecessor in September 2022. Her salary upon joining has been increased by 4% to \u00a3951,948. This is in line with the increase agreed for the CEO and is below that which has been awardedto the UK wider workforce. AGM Finally, I would like to again thank shareholders for their valued inputand engagement. I welcome all further feedback and look forward toreceiving your support for this report at our Annual General Meeting on3 May 2023. Urs Rohner Remuneration Committee Chair 9 March 2023 Consideration of potential windfall gains The Committee is aware of the guidance from investor bodies aroundconsidering a potential executive benefit arising from share awardgrants around the time of the stock market fall at the onset of theCOVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Our Remuneration Policy contains sufficient flexibility to reduce thevesting of awards if required. However, the Committee determined that no reduction is required inrespect of the awards granted in March 2020. In making thisdetermination, the Committee considered the share price at thefollowing points: -The share price at the time of the February 2020 award of \u00a316.81 -The share price over the final quarter of 2022 of \u00a313.99 -The share price at the time of the March 2019 award (grant previous to the 2020 award) of \u00a315.09 Whilst there have been upward and downward movements in GSK'sshare price over the period, taking these above points intoconsideration the Committee was satisfied that there was no risk ofwindfall gains.

The payment shown fo r Dr Barron represents a pro-rated on-target payment in respect of 1 January 2022 to 31 July 2022, in lieu of an Annual Bonus opportunity. (2) Dr Barron transitioned from his role as CSO to Non-Executive Director on 1 August 2022. Salary above includes the basic salary earned for his time as CSO from 1 January to 31 July 2022 plus payment in lieu of accrued holiday not taken, in accordance with GSK's standard all employee US holiday pay policy. His No n-Executive Director fees earned from 1 August to 31 December 2022 were $177,107. Please see page 153 for further details. (3) The PSP vesting figure for the CEO is inclusive of a top-up award (25% of salary) made in May 2020 following the vote in favour of the Remuneration policy at the company's 2020 AGM. This award will not vest until May 2023 and the final actual value received for the 2020-22 PSP will be restated in the 2023 An nual Report. (4) The 2020 PSP was valued based on the vesting prices on 10 February 2023 of \u00a314.78 and the ADS price of $35.727. The share and A DS prices on 14 February 2020, the main date of grant were \u00a316.686 and $43.74. In respect of the top-up award for the CEO, the share price was \u00a316.814. Of the vested amounts f or the Executive Directors, nothing was attributable to share price appreciation over the performance period. The Committee did not exercise any discretion in relation to the vesting of the awards or share price changes. The value for Dr Hal Barron is illustrative as the award will not vest until August 2023 in accordance with the terms of the Executive and Senior Ma nagement Recoupment Policy. The actual value received will be restated in the 2023 Annual Report. (5) The Committee may in specific circumstances, and in line with stated principles, apply malus/clawback, as it determines appropr iate. Following due consideration by the Committee, there has been no recovery of sums paid (clawback) or reduction of outstanding awards or vesting levels (malus) applied during 2022 i n respect of any of the CEO, CFO or the former CSO.

Benefits The UK remuneration reporting regulations require the company to add into each Executive Director's total benefits all items which are deemed by tax authorities to be a taxable benefit for them. These comprise: -Employee benefits in line with the policy for other employees, which may vary by location and role -Business-related services provided to employees to assist or enable them to carry out their role, which a tax authority has deemedto be a taxable \"benefit\" to the individual. Because these arebusiness expenses, the company meets the tax which arises onthem and therefore the items are shown grossed up for tax. Theseinclude business travel and other related business costsThe table below provides an analysis of Total benefits (grossed up for tax) received by the Executive Directors in 2022 and 2021. 2022 Benefits 2021 Benefits \u00a3000 \u00a3000 Emma Walmsley Benefits available to employees 66 71 Business-related services 65 63 Total benefits 131 134 Iain Mackay Benefits available to employees 156 131 Business-related services 135 111 Total benefits 291 242 Dr Hal Barron $000 $000 Benefits available to employees 71 83 Business-related services 36 64 Accommodation whilst on business travel (1) \u2014 (2) Total benefits 107 145 Notes: (1) 2021 represents one-off refund of accommodation costs relating to 2020.

Dr Barron received a pro-rated 'on-target' payment for 2022 of $1,177,064 in lieu of a bonus opportunity. This is because he tr ansitioned to a Non-Executive Director role on 1 August 2022. This contractual payment, in accordance with the company's Remuneration policy, i s included in his remuneration for 2022 under Annual Bonus in the table on page 136. 2022 financial performance measures 2022 Performance Target Target Outcome Positioning weighting growth rate growth rate achieved Total sales growth 30% 6.5% 9.9% +3.4% Adjusted operating profit growth 30% 12.8% 16.8% +3.9% These targets were set following consideration of analyst consensus as well as internal budgets. The annual targets for 2022 ex ceeded the long- term sales and profit targets stated in our Investor Update of 5% and 10% respectively. The Committee is therefore comfortable that over achievement of these represents exceptional performance. Threshold and maximum performance targets were set at 1% below and 5% above target growth respectively. The total sales and adjusted operating profit targets and outcomes for the purposes of the Annual B onus calculation are based on CER and exclude the commercial benefit from COVID-19 solutions. Overview of performance against financial performance measures - 2022 saw a step-change in commercial execution; earnings guidance was updated during the year as momentum grew. This was drive n by strong sales growth across Specialty Medicines and Vaccines, exceeding guidance for sales and operating profit - Delivered full-year reported Group sales of \u00a329.3 billion (+19% AER, +13% CER) with Specialty growth of 37% AER, 29% CER with double-digit growth across all Specialty therapy areas and Vaccines growth of 17% AER, 11% with a record year for Shingrix . The outcome was adjusted to exclude the benefit from COVID-19 solutions - Adjusted Group operating profit of \u00a38,151 million above target, driven by higher sales supported by prioritised investment and effective cost control. The outcome was adjusted to exclude the commercial benefit from COVID-19 solutions - Adjusted EPS of 139.7p (+27% AER, +15% CER) was ahead of guidance excluding COVID-19 solutions GSK Annual Report 2022 140Annual report on remuneration continued Pay for performance (audited) continued 2022 strategic and operational measures performance The Committee received and considered a performance assessment report for each Executive Director showing the extent of their a chievement against the individual personal strategic and operational measures agreed by the Committee for them to support the delivery of our strategic commitments during 2022. The Committee also reviewed Dr Hal Barron's performance in July 2022 before the release of his contrac tual 'on-target' bonus payment. As with the financial elements of the Annual Bonus, the Committee was satisfied that the scale of Executive Directors' achievem ents this year was of an exceptional nature. In particular, these achievements relate to the pipeline, commercial execution and Haleon demerger. Strategic and operational measures Performance achieved Emma Walmsley The Committee determined that the CEO clearly exceeded or met her individual objectives Strengthen pipeline and build GSK's reputation for Innovation - 47 potential new medicines and 22 vaccine candidates in development, with 18 now in phase 3/registration. Two-thirds of pipeline now focused on infectious diseases - Significant progress to strengthen pipeline and advance key assets (including RSV OA vaccine, bepirovirsen, gepotidican, daprodustat and depemokimab) more than offset termination decisions on otilimab and RSV maternal - Continued progress in development of long-acting HIV treatments including launch of Apretude , for HIV prevention and positive data for new broadly neutralising antibody N6LS - Successful business development to support future growth and focus in Vaccines and Specialty Medicines including Affinivax, Sierra Oncology and Spero Therapeutics Demonstrate continuedcommercial executionexcellence - Step-change in commercial execution, with double-digit sales growth across Specialty Medicines and Vaccines - 10 products now exceeding \u00a31 billion in annual sales, including Trelegy , Nucala , and Shingrix (sales +60% to \u00a33 billion), reflecting post pandemic rebound, new geographic launches and excellent commercial execution Complete separation andunlocked value - Haleon successfully demerged on schedule from GSK on 18 July 2022. Largest demerger in Europe for 20 years - Meaningful progress in value recognition prior to impact of market uncertainty following Zantac litigation Demonstrate strong Environmental, Social andGovernance (ESG) credentialsand build trust in future delivery - Sustained leading ESG performance, with delivery against Global Health, Environment and Inclusion and Diversity commitments - Maintained sector-leading rankings in key ESG indices.

Largest demerger in Europe for 20 years - Meaningful progress in value recognition prior to impact of market uncertainty following Zantac litigation Demonstrate strong culture and leadership - Finance and Tech engagement, confidence, culture and inclusivity employee survey scores all increased versus 2021 2022 ESG: diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) performance Our first Annual Bonus ESG measure reinforces achievement of our DEI ambitions, as set out on page 47. DEI is an important busi ness imperative and aspirational targets could be set to warrant additional reward. To stay on track for the 2025 Aspirational Targets for dive rsity of senior leadership, the Committee agreed interim, annual aspirational targets including global gender representation and US and UK race and ethnici ty representation. These interim, annual aspirations were agreed by the Committee for the CEO. An internal governance team comprising members of R eward and Legal audited their performance against these interim aspirations for consideration by the Committee. These interim aspirations were achieved in 2022 and at year end we had 42% gender representation and 31.3% US ethnicity and 14.3% UK ethnicity in our VP and above employe e population which are above or on track to meet the 2025 Aspirations. In addition, most directorates also performed strongly against their respective contributions to our Aspirations. However, not all directorates achieved their expected contributions to the aspirational targets including Finance. GSK Annual Report 2022 Annual report on remuneration continued 141Pay for performance (audited) continued Vesting of PSP LTI awards The following sets out the performance achieved for the company's PSP and includes an update on performance of outstanding awar ds. In line with the Committee's agreed principles, actual performance against each measure is carefully reviewed and adjustments are made, as a ppropriate, to ensure that the vesting outcome reflects genuine underlying business performance and has been delivered in line with our cultur e and responsible business priorities. Overall, 52% of the 2020 PSP award vested. Targets were set against pipeline progress (20%), innovation sales (20%), adjusted f ree cash flow (30%) and relative TSR (30%). Disappointingly there was nil-vesting under relative TSR. However, strong performance against oth er metrics was evidenced with full vesting under the cash flow element and partial vesting under pipeline progress and innovation sales. During the 2020-22 period, significant progress was achieved in accelerating the delivery of our pipeline, notably the company' s RSV vaccine, depemokimab and niraparib. Robust oversight resulted in a number of assets being discontinued as resources were reprioritised t o focus on those with the greatest potential. Major approvals in the period included: niraparib, for ovarian cancer; sotrovimab (emergency use a uthorization) for COVID-19; Cabenuva for HIV treatment and Apretude for HIV pre-exposure prevention. Innovation sales, in the period, reflected particularly strong performance of HIV medicines and our shingles vaccine, Shingrix . Outcome and vesting level Performance measures % of % of and relative weighting Performance targets Outcome maximum award Pipeline progress (20%) The pipeline progress measure targets rewarding strengthening of our pipeline through progression of high quality assets into pivotal trials and the achievement ofregulatory approvals in major markets.

It has been further restated to take account of the demerger by removing the share of target cash flows related to Consumer Healthcare following th e demerger in 2022, revised phasing of the Future Ready programme restructuring cash payments based on detailed programme planning undertaken in 2022, and revised timing of divestments. As a result, the target was decreased by \u00a30.99 billion to \u00a39.10 billion. The Committee did not exercise any discretion in relation to the vesting of the awards or share price changes. 2020 PSP vesting Granted Vested(1) Value of 122,634 $4,381,400 (1) The vested number of shares and the value it represented at vesting includes dividend reinvestments during the performance p eriod. These are based on the vesting price of \u00a314.78 and the closing ADS price of $35.727 on 10 February 2023. (2) The shares granted for Emma Walmsley include the additional 'top-up' award made in May 2020 which will not vest until May 20 23. The final actual value received and any amount attributable to share price appreciation over the performance period will be restated in the 2023 Annual Report. (3) The PSP award for Dr Hal Barron will not vest until August 2023 under the terms of the Executive & Senior Manager Financial Recoupment Policy. Performance of ongoing LTI awards The Committee also reviewed the performance of the PSP awards granted to Executive Directors in 2021 and 2022. The following charts provide an estimate of the vesting levels of the 2021 and 2022 awards, taking into account performance to 31 December 2022. - Actual vesting levels will only be determined based on performance over the full three-year performance periods. The indicatio ns below should therefore not be regarded as predictions of the final vesting levels - The AFCF measure target, threshold and associated vesting scales for the 2021 awards have been adjusted. The net overall impac t is a decrease in the target of \u00a33.02 billion to \u00a35.64 billion for the 2021 award - The adjustments took into account of the following items: the removal of the share of target cash flows relating to Consumer H ealthcare in 2022 and 2023 following the demerger in 2022, revised phasing of the Future Ready programme restructuring cash payments, and revised timing of divestments - There were no changes to other measures For threshold performance 25% of each award will vest in respect of each performance measure.

These limits are 10% in any rolling ten-year period for all plans and5% in any rolling ten-year period for executive share plans (granted tosenior executives). Estimated dilution from existing awards made overthe last ten years up to 31 December 2022 is as follows: GSK Annual Report 2022 Annual report on remuneration continued 145Directors' pay in a wider setting continued CEO pay ratios - Option A methodology The table below shows the salary, and total pay and benefits for each of the percentiles. 2022 2021 2020 2019 believes that the median pay ratio is consistent with the company's pay, reward and progression policies. The bas e salaries of all employees, including the Executive Directors, are set with reference to a range of factors including market practice, experienc e and performance in role. Financial year Lower continues to use the Option A methodology because it is the most robust and statistically accurate way to calculate the three ratios from the options available in the Remuneration regulations. The pay ratio is broadly similar to 2021 with the reduction at P25 influenced by thechange in workforce composition following the Consumer Healthcaredemerger.The pay ratios above are calculated using actual earnings for the CEO and UK employees. The CEO's total single figure remuneration of\u00a38,453,253 for 2022 and \u00a38,203,422 for 2021 are detailed on page 136. Total remuneration for all UK full-time equivalent employees on 31 December 2022 has been calculated in line with the single figuremethodology. This reflects their actual earnings received in 2022(excluding business expenses), which were used to produce thepercentile calculation under Option A of the Remuneration regulations. Business expenses have been excluded as they are reimbursed to employees and are not sufficiently substantial in value to significantlyimpact the ratios. Supplemental and additional ratios The CEO pay ratio is likely to vary, potentially significantly, over timesince it will be driven largely by CEO variable pay outcomes. In linewith our reward principles, the CEO has a larger portion of her paybased on performance than the individuals at P25, P50 and P75. Thismeans that depending on GSK's performance the ratio could increase or decrease significantly. The Committee believes that our senior executives should have a significant proportion of their pay linked directly to performance. In light of this we have also provided supplemental ratios, where LTI compensation has been excluded. We believe this provides an additional view as LTIs formed a substantial percentage of the CEO's total remuneration, which is highly variable and dependent on business performance. The CEO's 2022 total remuneration excluding LTI compensation is \u00a34,787,090.

GSK Annual Report 2022 Annual report on remuneration continued 147 Implementation of Remuneration policy for 2023 Fixed Pay Salary The Committee is very aware of the sensitivity amongst stakeholders to levels of Executive pay. Before reviewing Executive Directors' salary,it considered the average increases being awarded to employeesbelow the level of Executive Directors and was mindful of the multiplier effect of increases in base pay. After due consideration of the wider economic context, individual performance and market positioning itwas agreed that it was appropriate to award increases below that ofthe wider workforce to the CEO. During the year, in addition to the 5% average salary increase, the company has implemented a number of monetary initiatives for our colleagues in the wider workforce, in reaction to the cost of living crisis,which can be found on pages 134 and 135.

Points are allocated for successful assets in each sub-measure based upon their forecast commercial value (peak year sales) at theend of the performance period. The sub-measures for the 2023 award will vest as follows: Pivotal trial starts Focuses mainly on phase III registrational trial starts, but may also include phase II starts.

At the end of the performance period we will provide disclosure ofwhat has been achieved.Performance Relative TSR will continue to be measured against GSK's Global pharmaceutical comparator group (see page 146). The total salesgrowth and adjusted operating profit growth measures recognise theimportance of our commercial ambitions and the Committee has settargets that align with those ambitions. The targets for total salesgrowth and adjusted operating profit growth are commerciallysensitive at the time of grant. ESG: environment The ESG: environment measure is based on the goal of having aNature Net Positive and Climate Net Zero impact by 2030 (see pages45 and 46). The targets for the ESG: environment measure for the2023 grant are based on a series of Nature goals relating to Water, Waste & Materials reduction, Biodiversity impact and Climate goals that incorporate Scope 1 & 2 emission reduction targets, carbonoffsetting and our industrialisation of green Ventolin . The ESG: environment measure includes six key performance measures: - 3x Climate ambitions - 3x Nature ambitions To achieve: - 75% vesting, all six measures must have met their 2025 targets - 100% vesting, two of the six measures, at least one in Climate and one in Nature, must have exceeded their 2025 targets Shareholdings versus Share Ownership Requirement (SOR) (audited) To align the interests of Executive Directors with those of shareholders, they are required to build and maintain significant holdings of shares in GSK over time. Executive Directors are required to continue to satisfythese Share Ownership Requirements (SOR) by holding 100% of theirSOR for the first 12 months after leaving GSK and not less than 50%of their SOR for months 13-24 after leaving GSK.

Emma Walmsley and Iain Mackay, at the date of publication of this Report, exceed their SOR. Dr Hal Barron exceeded his SOR prior to histransition to a Non-Executive Director role on 1 August 2022. The company has processes in place to ensure that each Executive Director maintains their SOR after leaving GSK. Each Executive Directoragrees to the terms of the SOR as part of their service contract.

DABP deferred bonus awards Awards in respect of bonuses deferred in 2022 and prior years will vest at their normal vesting dates. In addition to the above, Iain Mackay will be required to maintain his SOR in accordance with the company's Remuneration policy . Remuneration arrangements for Julie Brown The Committee considered the remuneration arrangements that would be appropriate to enable the company to recruit and retain anexperienced CFO within the criteria for the role in the company's 2022Remuneration policy. Given Julie Brown's wealth of experience as a CFO and of the industry, it was agreed that her remuneration should be set in line withIain Mackay's remuneration, as follows: Remuneration element Notes Salary \u00a3951,948 Ms Brown's salary was preliminarily set in line with that of her predecessor in September 2022 (\u00a3915,335) and hersalary upon joining will be 4% higherthan this figure, in line with theincrease agreed for the CEO. Thecomparator group for pay for the CFOremains the European cross-industrycomparator group as set out onpage 146. Annual Bonus \u00a3951,948 The on-target bonus would be 100%, with a maximum of 300% for incremental exceptional performanceas for Mr Mackay. Award of Long Term Incentives (LTIs) \u00a31,903,896 This assumes an expected value of 50% of an award of performanceshares under the PSP at a 4x multipleof base salary as for Mr Mackay. Share Ownership Requirement (SOR) 300% of salary This is in line with the 2022 Remuneration policy. Pension Pension arrangements will be in line with those of the wider UK workforce inaccordance with GSK's commitmentfrom 1 January 2023. Benefits Benefits will be in line with GSK's policy and arrangements for otherexecutives to support them inundertaking their role.The Committee sought to ensure Ms Brown was compensated on a like- for-like basis as far as possible when concluding her buyout payments,which are set out below: - a sum (the Bonus Buyout) equivalent to Ms Brown's on-target Burberry bonus for the period from 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023,which she will forego on leaving Burberry - a sum (the LTI Buyout) equivalent to the aggregate value of (i) her outstanding Burberry LTIs and SIP shares, which will be lost onleaving Burberry, at a price equivalent to the average price of such shares for the one-month period ended on 7 September 2022, and (ii) the value of any dividend equivalents accruing on those sharesbetween their date of award and her departure from Burberry. Giventhat the Burberry LTIs are not subject to a performance measure, andonly to a performance underpin, no discount will be applied to thevalue of the shares so calculated The Committee agreed that these payments would be made in stages over a two year period as follows, as cash amounts equivalent to: - the Bonus Buyout and one-third of 85% of the LTI Buyout will be paid to her in the first payroll following the commencement of her employment with GSK - one-third of 85% of the LTI Buyout will be paid to her in the first payroll following the first anniversary of the commencement of heremployment and - one-third of 85% of the LTI Buyout will be paid to her in the first payroll following the second anniversary of the commencement of her employment In addition, she will be paid an amount equivalent to 15% of the LTI Buyout in the first payroll following the commencement of heremployment. Ms Brown has agreed that she will invest the net of taxproceeds of this 15% tranche in GSK shares at the first reasonably available opportunity, subject to dealing clearance, and that she will then hold those shares for a period of at least two years. Ms Brown's SOR asCFO will be three times her base salary which she will be required tobuild over time.

Chair's fees The Chair's fee was set at \u00a3700,000 per annum, nearly four years ago in September 2019 when he was first appointed to the Board . It has remained unchanged since that time. After a review of independently sourced data by the Committee in January 2023 it was agreed that it was appropriate to increase his fees by \u00a335,000 to \u00a3735,000 from 1 January 2023 - a 5% increase from the rate originally set in 201 9. During 2022 the Chair invested approximately 25% of his pre-tax fees in notional shares under the GSK NED share allocation plan (NED plan). Since September 2022 he invests approximately 25% of his net fees in the purchase of GSK shares. 2022 Non-Executive Directors' fees The Non-Executive Directors' fees that applied during 2022 are set out in the table below: Per annum Standard annual fee \u00a395,000 Supplemental fees Chair of the Audit & Risk Committee \u00a380,000 Senior Independent Director \u00a350,000 Scientific & Medical Experts \u00a330,000 Chairs of the Remuneration, Corporate Responsibility and Science committees and Workforce Engagement Director \u00a340,000 Science Committee members undertaking significant additional responsibilities on behalf of GSK to support R&D Up to \u00a3200,000 Non-Executive Director undertaking intercontinental travel to meetings \u00a37,500 per meeting Standard annual fee for Non-Executive Directors The standard Non-Executive Director annual fee was last increased in 2020. Following a review of independently sourced data and recognising the ever-increasing workload for Non-Executive Directors it was agreed that it was appropriate to increase the standard annual fee by \u00a33,800 (4%) from \u00a395,000 to \u00a398,800 per annum from 1 January 2023. With a view to further simplicity, creating greater transparency of the overall standard Non-Executive Director fee and based o n review of independent data, going forward the intercontinental travel allowance of \u00a37,500 per meeting will be added to the standard fee. Ordinarily, Non-Executive Directors are expected to travel overseas to attend two meetings per year and so can expect to receive two travel allowance payments totalling \u00a315,000. The Chair does not receive this allowance. This amount will now be added to the Non-Executive Direc tor standard fee from 1 January 2023 bringing the total standard fee to \u00a3113,800. Non-Executive Director Share Ownership Requirement Following approval of the new Remuneration policy at the last AGM, in July 2022 it was agreed to implement a minimum Non-Execut ive Director share ownership requirement (SOR) of at least one times the annual standard fee (or the Chair's fee) to be maintained until aft er retirement from the Board. The Chair, non-US based Non-Executive Directors and newly appointed Non-Executive Directors commenced purchasing shares or ADS in the market towards their new Non-Executive Director SOR from September 2022. US Non-Executive Directors began purchasing ADS to wards their SOR from 1 January 2023. Shareholder approval will be sought at the AGM for an administrative amendment to the Non-Executive Director section of the Rem uneration policy to allow the notional shares or ADS previously allocated under the Non-Executive Director plan to be delivered to the Chair and Non-Executive Directors at such time as the Committee and Board considers appropriate after any applicable tax withholding. This would be sub ject to the Chair and Non-Executive Directors undertaking to hold these shares or ADS until they retire from the Board. This change will not only give the company greater operational flexibility, it will also reduce the administrative burden of operating the Non-Executive Director plan, an d will ensure that the Chair and Non-Executive Directors directly maintain a meaningful and prudent level of investment which closer aligns their interests with shareholders. The company does not expect to make any significant changes to the fee structure for Non-Executive Directors during the remaind er of the 2022 Remuneration policy period.

Dr Barron's beneficial interests include ADS and notional ADS held by way of his investments in the GSK 401(k) plan and the Executive Supplemental Savings Plan (ESSP). Further details on Dr Barron's membership of these plans ca n be found on page 138. 3)Unvested shares/ADS not subject to performance represent PSP shares/ADS which have vested but are subject to an additional two-year holding period. Unvested ADS not subject to performance for Dr Barron also represent bonus deferrals (as described in note 7 below). 4)Unvested options not subject to performance represent bonus deferrals under the DABP which are awarded as nil-cost options (as described in note 7 below). This figure excludes 790 options held by Emma Walmsley under the GSK Share Save plan. 5)Unvested shares/ADS subject performance represent unvested PSP awards. 6)Vested but unexercised options: None of the Directors hold vested but unexercised options. 7)DABP: The table below shows bonus deferrals and subsequent reinvestment of dividends under the DABP.

DABP (Bonus deferrals) 3 March 2023 8)Options exercised in 2022: The following table sets out details of options (including nil-cost options under the DABP) exercised during 2022 by Executive Directors. Iain Mackay did not exercise any options during the year. Number of shares Date of Market price Type of award Date of grant under option exercise Grant price at exercise Gain on exercise Emma Walmsley In respect of the nil-cost options awarded in 2019 under the DABP, the bonus which is deferred by the Executive Director was re corded as remuneration (under Annual Bonus) in the Total remuneration table in respect of 2018. The number of shares under option includes the initial award amount together with reinvested dividends accrued to the date of exercise. In respect of options under the GSK Share Save plan, the remuneration receivable by an Executive Director is calculated on the date that the options first vest. The remuneration is the difference between the amount the Executive Director is required to pay to buy the shares and the total val ue of the shares on the vesting date. If the Executive Director chooses not to exercise the options on the vesting date, any subsequent increase or decrease in the a mount realised will be due to movements in the share price between the vesting date and the date of exercise. This increase or decrease in value is the resul t of an investment decision by the Executive Director and, as such, is not recorded as remuneration.

How our Remuneration policy continues to reflect Provision 40 of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the Code) Clarity and simplicity The remuneration arrangements for the Executive Directors are set out in a clear and simple way in the Remuneration policy. Whi lst compiling and before finalising the Remuneration policy, the Committee consulted extensively with 40 shareholders representing 45% of our issued share capital, to ensure its full understanding of their views on the policy and transparency and clarity of the proposals and how they would be implemented. The fixed remuneration elements (salary, benefits and pension) are closely aligned with wider workforce arrangemen ts and our pay for performance plans (Annual Bonus and Long-term incentive) reward delivery of financial, strategic and ESG objectives in the short and long term. Risk In line with the Code, we operate both deferral and post-vesting holding arrangements, in addition to operating malus and clawb ack provisions. The Committee retains discretion to adjust award outcomes (to zero if appropriate) should it consider the payout de termined does not appropriately reflect the overall position and performance of the company. Predictability and proportionality Our Remuneration policy defines maximum limits on the total Annual Bonus and Long-term incentive opportunities, and payouts und er these elements are linked to fulfilment of performance conditions that support the company's publicly stated ambitions. Through its i mplementation, maximum reward under our short- and long-term plans are only achievable for material outperformance against our stated ambition s. Alignment to culture GSK's purpose, strategy and culture continue to be directly reflected in the performance conditions set under the Annual Bonus and Long- term incentive. In particular, we have introduced an ESG measure in both our short- and long-term plans. These currently reinfo rce our diversity, equity and inclusion aspirations for 2025, and our Nature Net Positive and Climate Net Zero ambition by 2030. Our Sh are Ownership Requirements strengthen the focus on our strategic aims, and ensure alignment with the interests and experiences of shareholder s, both during and after employment. The Committee believes the Remuneration policy has been operated as intended in terms of company performance and quantum during 2022. GSK Annual Report 2022 1582022 Remuneration policy summary The company's Remuneration policy was approved on 4 May 2022 at GSK's Annual General Meeting and has operated as intended since its approval. The full policy is available at gsk.com in the Investors section. Two administrative amendments to the company's Remu neration policy are being proposed for binding shareholder approval at GSK's 2023 Annual General Meeting, as described on page 163. Executive Director Remuneration policy Salary To provide a core reward for the role. Set at a level appropriate to secure and retain high calibre individuals needed to deliver the Group's strategic priorities. Operation Opportunity Individual's role, experience, performance and independently sourced data for relevant comparator groups considered when determining salary levels. Salary increases typically take effect in the first quarter of each year. Salaries are normally paid in the currency of the Executive Director's home country. There is no formal maximum limit and, ordinarily, salary increases will be broadly in line with the average increases for the wider GSK workforce. However, increases may be higher to reflect a change in the scope of the individual's role, responsibilities or experience. Salary adjustments may also reflect wider market conditions in the geography in which theindividual operates. Details of current salary levels are set out in the Annual report on remuneration. Performance measures The overall performance of the individual is a key consideration when determining salary increases. Benefits Levels are set to recruit and retain high calibre individuals to execute the business strategy. Operation Executive Directors are eligible to receive benefits in line with the policy for other employees which may vary by location. These include, but are not limited to, car allowances, healthcare, life assurance/deathin service (where not provided as part of the individual's pensionarrangements), personal financial advice and contractual post-retirement benefits. In line with the policy for other employees,Executive Directors may be eligible to receive overseas relocationallowances and international transfer-related benefits when required.Executive Directors in the UK are also eligible to participate inall-employee share schemes (e.g. Share Save and Share Reward plans), under which they are subject to the same terms as all other employees. In order to recognise the high business travel requirements of the role, Executive Directors are also entitled to car travel and exceptionallymay be accompanied by their spouse/partner on business trips. Other benefits include expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business, which are deemed to be taxable benefits on the individual.Where an Executive Director is based outside the UK, but is required to travel to the UK to fulfil the responsibilities of their role and to attendBoard Meetings, they may be subject to tax on their business travelexpenses to and from the UK and on the provision of anyaccommodation in the UK. Although in reality it represents a businessexpense, the tax treatment requires that their travel and accommodation expenses are then included as benefits. Because of the business context, the tax liabilities will be covered by the company on agrossed-up basis. Benefit provision is tailored to reflect market practice in the geography in which the Executive Director is based and different policies may apply if current or future Executive Directors are based in a different country. Opportunity There is no formal maximum limit as benefits costs can fluctuate depending on changes in provider cost and individual circumstances. Details of current benefits and costs are set out in the Annual report on remuneration.

Strategic and operational measures are set at the start of the year by the Committee and performance against those measures is assessed by the Committee. Executive Directors are required to defer part of any bonus earned into shares, or ADS as appropriate, for three years. 50% of the equivalentof the first 200% of salary is deferred, and any portion in excess of 200% is deferred in full. Deferred bonus shares are eligible for dividend equivalents up to the date of vesting.The Committee may adjust the formulaic vesting outcome (either up or down) to ensure that the overall outcome reflects underlying businessperformance over the vesting period. Clawback and/or malus provisionsapply as described on page 147 of the 2021 Annual Report. Opportunity The maximum bonus opportunity for Executive Directors is 300% of salary. Below 99% of target performance, the bonus payout on the financial measures will be nil. For target performance, the bonus payout will be 100%of salary.

Further details, including the measures to be used in thefinancial year, are provided in the Annual report on remuneration. Selection of Annual Bonus measures The Annual Bonus is designed to drive the achievement of GSK'sannual financial, strategic and operational measures. For this reason the majority of the Annual Bonus opportunity is based ona formal review of performance against stretching financial targets, withthe remainder of the bonus subject to assessment of individualperformance against the key strategic and operational measures whichare aligned to the company's key objectives for that financial year and/orassessment of performance against ESG targets. The Annual Bonus financial targets are set by reference to internal budget and external consensus targets.

For all measures, 25% of awards will vest at threshold performance. Further details, including the performance targets attachedto the PSP in respect of each year, and the weightings of the targets forthe 2022 PSP awards are provided in the Annual report onremuneration. Selection of Long-term incentive measures The Committee selects performance measures which focus ExecutiveDirectors' long-term remuneration on the delivery of GSK's keystrategic priorities over the longer term. In addition to setting robusttargets, the Committee has implemented a number of safeguards toensure the targets are met in a sustainable way and performancereflects genuine achievement against targets and therefore representsthe delivery of value for shareholders. For each performance measure, the impact of any acquisition or divestment will be quantified and adjusted for after the event.Any major adjustment in the calculation of performance measures will be disclosed to shareholders on vesting. The Audit & Risk Committee chair and other members, who are also members of the Remuneration Committee, provide input on the Audit &Risk Committee's review of the Group's performance and oversight ofany risk factors relevant to remuneration decisions.

In particular, the Committee considers the range of base salary rises for the workforces of those parts of GSK where the Executive Directorsare employed. This is considered to be the most relevant comparisonas these populations reflect most closely the economic environmentsencountered by the individuals. The same principles apply to the Remuneration policy for Executive Directors and other employees although the remuneration offered toExecutive Directors under this policy has a stronger emphasis onperformance-related pay than that offered to other employees of theGroup. - Salary and benefits (including pension) are tailored to the local market - The Annual Bonus plan applies to the wider employee population and is based on business performance - A combination of performance-related and restricted share plans apply to the wider employee population - All-employee share plans are available to employees in the UK, including the HM Revenue & Customs approved UK Share Saveand Share Reward plansWhile employees are not directly consulted in respect of the Remuneration policy, Urs Rohner, the Committee Chair, meets withsenior HR representatives from across the business to review employeefeedback. Dame Vivienne Cox, an Independent Non-Executive Director,engages with employees on various topics, including remuneration, inher role as Workforce Engagement Director. Board members engagewith employees around during Board meetings where they are encouraged to share their views on the company, management and remuneration. Since approval of the Policy in May 2022, the Board has evolved its approach to workforce engagement. Further details are provided onpage 115. In the wider organisation, we have aligned our performance and reward systems with our Innovation, Performance and responsible businesspriorities and with a culture anchored in purpose and performance. Ourperformance system evaluates employees on both 'what' they need todo and 'how' they do it. Also, for our most senior people we disincentivise unethical working practices using a clawback mechanism that allows us to recover performance-related pay.

The Committee is responsible for evaluating and making recommendations to the Board on the fees payable tothe Chair. The Chair does not participate in discussions in respect of their fees. Basic fees As above There is no formal maximum. As with the Chair, fees are reviewed annually and set by reference to independently sourced data. The Chair and CEO are responsible for evaluating and making recommendations to the Board on the feespayable to the company's Non-Executive Directors. Fee payment Alignment with shareholders Fees are paid in cash. Non-Executive Directors (including the Chair) were required to invest at least 25% of their total net fees in shares or ADS of the company. The company has since replaced the 25% minimum investmentrequirement with a minimum share or ADS ownership requirement of at least one times the Non-ExecutiveDirector's (or Chair's) gross annual standard fees to be retained until their retirement from the Board. Anadministrative amendment to this section of the Remuneration policy is proposed for binding shareholder approval at the 2023 AGM as described on page 163. Supplemental fees To compensate Non-Executive Directors (other than the Chair)for taking on additional Boardresponsibilities or undertakingintercontinental travel. Additional fees for the Senior Independent Director, Committee Chairs, Scientific and Medical Experts, the Workforce Engagement Director role and intercontinental travel. The company has the authority to pay an additional fee, up to the equivalent of the Committee Chair supplementto a Non-Executive Director, should the company require significant additional time commitment in exceptional orunforeseen circumstances. The company has the authority to pay an additional fee of up to \u00a3200,000 to Non-Executive Directors (excludingthe Chair) who are members of the Science Committee for undertaking additional responsibilities on behalf ofGSK and to support R&D. Benefits To facilitate execution of responsibilities and dutiesrequired by the role. Travel and subsistence costs for Non-Executive Directors are incurred in the normal course of business in relation to meetings on Board and Committee matters and other GSK-hosted events. For overseas-based Non-ExecutiveDirectors, this includes travel to meetings in the UK. In the event it is necessary for business purposes, whilst notnormal practice, Non-Executive Directors may be accompanied by their spouse or partner to these meetings orevents. The costs associated with the above are all met by the company and, in some instances, they aredeemed to be taxable and therefore treated as benefits for the Non-Executive Director. Approach to recruitment remuneration Loss of office The Chair and other Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to receive any payments in respect of fees for loss of office when they retire or step down from the Board. The following policy and principles apply to the roles of Chair andNon-Executive Director. It seeks to ensure alignment with shareholdersthrough the requirement to invest in company shares and ADS. Chair Fees will be set at a level that is competitive with those paid by othercompanies of equivalent size and complexity. Fees will be paid partlyin shares. Non-Executive Directors Fee levels for new Non-Executive Directors will be set on the samebasis as for existing Non-Executive Directors of the company, subject tolocal laws and regulations. In the event of a Non-Executive Director with a different role and responsibilities being appointed, fee levels will be benchmarked and setby reference to comparable roles in companies of equivalent size andcomplexity. GSK Annual Report 2022 163 Administrative amendments to the 2022 Remuneration policy Proposed amendments Two administrative amendments to the company's 2022 Remuneration policy (Policy), which was approved at last year's AGM, are being proposed as ordinary resolutions for binding shareholder approval atthe AGM on 3 May 2023. The Policy is subject to renewal in respect ofremuneration for 2025. Given that these changes are purelyadministrative, a full consultation with employees was not undertakenon these amendments. Non-Executive Directors' minimum share ownership requirement The Non-Executive Directors section of the 2022 Policy includes a requirement for Non-Executive Directors (including the Chair) to investa minimum of 25% of their net basic fees in shares or ADS of thecompany. The Policy also states that, should the company replace this requirement, any shares or ADS previously acquired in accordance with this 25% minimum investment requirement would: (i) continue tobe held under those previous arrangements, (ii) count towards anyexpected minimum ownership requirement; and (iii) be delivered orreleased following the Non-Executive Director's (or Chair's) retirementfrom the Board. The company has since replaced the 25% minimum investment requirement, as set out in the 2021 Annual Report, with a minimumshare or ADS ownership requirement of at least one times theNon-Executive Director's (or Chair's) gross Annual Standard Fees tobe retained until their retirement from the Board. Shareholder approval will be sought to amend the Non-Executive Directors section of the Policy to allow the shares or ADS acquiredunder the previous 25% minimum investment requirement to bedelivered or released to the Non-Executive Director (or Chair) at suchtime as the Board (excluding that Non-Executive Director or the Chair)considers appropriate (subject to any applicable tax withholding),rather than continue to be held under the previous arrangements. This is subject to the Non-Executive Directors (or the Chair) undertaking to the company to hold such shares or ADS in thecompany until they retire from the Board. This will give the companygreater operational flexibility, and reduce the administrative burden, inthe implementation of the new minimum share ownership requirement whilst ensuring that the Non-Executive Directors (and the Chair) continue to maintain a meaningful and prudent level of investmentwhich aligns their interests with shareholders.Clawback and malus Shareholder approval will be sought to amend the Clawback and malus section of the Policy to expressly refer to the company's ability to update its clawback policies, and to make disclosures in relation to clawback, ineach case as required by applicable regulatory requirements, includingthe recently adopted Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules(and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) listing standardsimplementing those rules) on clawback in the event of an accountingrestatement. The SEC adopted new rules, in late 2022, which require the NYSE (amongst others) to adopt new listing standards that require a listedcompany to clawback erroneously awarded incentive-basedcompensation whenever it is required to prepare an accountingrestatement that corrects an error in a previously issued financialstatement, or that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period. These new listing standards are expected to become effective inlate 2023. GSK shares are listed and traded on the NYSE in the form ofADS and GSK will, as a result, be subject to the new listing standardswhich are expected to require clawback in circumstances that are widerthan those currently provided for by the company's policies. The relatedSEC rules will also require GSK to make certain disclosures inconnection with its clawback policy in its annual report on Form 20-F(including filing a copy of the clawback policy with the SEC). The proposed changes to the `Clawback and malus' element of the Policy are intended to ensure clarity by expressly referring to thecompany's ability to update its clawback policies, and to makedisclosures in relation to clawback, in each case as required byapplicable regulatory requirements (including the SEC and NYSE requirements). The Committee will update its current recoupment policies as required to meet the new NYSE listing standards and therelated SEC disclosure requirements once they become effective. GSK Annual Report 2022 164 Operation and scope of Remuneration policy Basis of preparation The Remuneration policy (Policy) is set out on pages 144 to 152 of the 2021 Annual Report and it is intended that the Policy for GSK'sExecutive and Non-Executive Directors will operate for a period ofthree years from the date of approval at the company's Annual GeneralMeeting on 4 May 2022. The Committee wrote the Policy principally in relation to the remuneration arrangements for the Executive Directors, whilst takinginto account the possible recruitment of a replacement or an additionalExecutive Director during the operation of the Policy. The Committeeintends the Policy to operate for the period set out above in its entirety.However, it may after due consideration seek to change the Policyduring this period, but only if it believes it is appropriate to do so for thelong-term success of the company, after consultation with shareholders and having sought shareholder approval at a general meeting. The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments and/or payments for loss of office (including exercising any discretionsavailable to it in connection with such payments) notwithstanding thatthey are not in line with the Policy where the terms of the payment were agreed: (i) before the AGM on 7 May 2014 (the date the company's first shareholder-approved Directors' Remuneration policy came intoeffect);(ii) before the Policy came into effect, provided that the terms of the payment were consistent with the shareholder-approved Remunerationpolicy in force at the time they were agreed; or (iii) at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the company. For these purposes 'payments' includes the Committee satisfying awards ofvariable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares or ADS,the terms of the payment are 'agreed' at the time the award is granted. Performance Share Plan (PSP) awards are subject to the terms of the PSP plan rules under which the award has been granted. The Committee may adjust or amend awards only in accordance with theprovisions of the plan rules. This includes making adjustments to reflectone-off corporate events, such as a change in the company's capitalstructure. The Committee may also make minor amendments to the Policy (for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes or to takeaccount of a change in legislation) without obtaining shareholderapproval for such amendments. The Annual report on remuneration has been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and The Large and Medium-sizedCompanies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 (the Regulations). In accordance with the Regulations, the following parts of the Annual report on remunerationare subject to audit: total remuneration figures for Executive Directorsincluding further details for each element of remuneration (salary,benefits, pension, Annual Bonus and Long-term incentive awards);Non-Executive Directors' fees and emoluments received in the year;Directors' interests in shares, including interests in GSK share plans;payments to past Directors; payments for loss of office; and shareownership requirements and holdings, for which the opinion thereon is expressed on page 181. The remaining sections of the Annual report on remuneration are not subject to audit nor are the pages referred tofrom within the audited sections.The Annual report on remuneration has been approved by the Board of Directors and signed on its behalf by: Urs Rohner Remuneration Committee Chair 9 March 2023 GSK Annual Report 2022 Financial statements In this section Directors' statement of responsibilities 166 Financial statements 182 Notes to the financial statements 186 Financial statements of GSK plc prepared under UK GAAP 268 165 GSK Annual Report 2022 166Directors' statement of responsibilities The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the Remuneration report and the Group and parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.

GSK Annual Report 2022 186Notes to the financial statements 1. Presentation of the financial statements 2. Accounting principles and policies Description of business GSK is a global biopharma group which makes innovative vaccines and specialty medicines to prevent and treat disease. GSK's R&Dfocuses on the science of the immune system, human genetics and advanced technologies primarily in the following four therapeutic areas: infectious diseases, HIV, oncology and immunology/respiratory. Compliance with applicable law and IFRS The financial statements have been prepared in accordance withinternational accounting standards in conformity with the requirementsof the Companies Act 2006 and the International Financial ReportingStandards as issued by the IASB. Composition of financial statements The consolidated financial statements are drawn up in Sterling, thefunctional currency of GSK plc, and in accordance with IFRSaccounting presentation. The financial statements comprise: - Consolidated income statement - Consolidated statement of comprehensive income - Consolidated balance sheet - Consolidated statement of changes in equity - Consolidated cash flow statement - Notes to the financial statements. Composition of the Group A list of the subsidiaries and associates which, in the opinion of theDirectors, principally affected the amount of profit or net assets of the Group is given in Note 46, 'Principal Group companies'.Financial period These financial statements cover the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2022, with comparative figures for thefinancial years from 1 January to 31 December 2021 and, where appropriate, from 1 January to 31 December 2020. Income statement and cash flow comparatives have been restated on a consistent basisfrom those previously published to reflect the classification of theConsumer Healthcare business as a discontinued operation (seeNote 41). Accounting principles and policies The financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost convention modified by the revaluation of certain items, as stated in the accounting policies, and on a going concern basis. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Group's accounting policies approved by the Board and described inNote 2, 'Accounting principles and policies'. Information on the application of these accounting policies, including areas of estimation and judgement is given in Note 3, 'Critical accounting judgements andkey sources of estimation uncertainty'. The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date ofthe financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues andexpenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ fromthose estimates. Parent company financial statements The financial statements of the parent company, GSK plc, have beenprepared in accordance with UK GAAP and with UK accountingpresentation. The company balance sheet is presented on page 268and the accounting policies are given on pages 269 to 272. Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include: - the assets and liabilities, and the results and cash flows, of the company and its subsidiaries, including ESOP Trusts - the Group's share of the results and net assets of associates and joint ventures - the Group's share of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses of joint operations. The financial statements of entities consolidated are made up to 31 December each year. Entities over which the Group has the power to direct the relevant activities so as to affect the returns to the Group, generally throughcontrol over the financial and operating policies, are accounted for assubsidiaries. Where the Group has the ability to exercise joint control over, and rightsto, the net assets of entities, the entities are accounted for as jointventures. Where the Group has the ability to exercise joint control overan arrangement, but has rights to specified assets and obligations forspecified liabilities of the arrangement, the arrangement is accounted foras a joint operation. Where the Group has the ability to exercisesignificant influence over entities, they are accounted for as associates.The results and assets and liabilities of associates and joint ventures are incorporated into the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting. The assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses ofjoint operations are included in the consolidated financial statements inaccordance with the Group's rights and obligations. Interests acquired in entities are consolidated from the date the Group acquires control and interests sold are de-consolidated from the date control ceases. GSK Annual Report 2022 Notes to the financial statements continued 1872. Accounting principles and policies continued Transactions and balances between subsidiaries are eliminated and no profit before tax is taken on sales between subsidiaries until the products are sold to customers outside the Group. The relevantproportion of profits on transactions with joint ventures, joint operationsand associates is also deferred until the products are sold to thirdparties. Transactions with non-controlling interests are recordeddirectly in equity. Deferred tax relief on unrealised intra-Group profit isaccounted for only to the extent that it is considered recoverable. Business combinations Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisitionaccounting method. Identifiable assets, liabilities and contingentliabilities acquired are measured at fair value at acquisition date. Theconsideration transferred is measured at fair value and includes thefair value of any contingent consideration. The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is reassessed at each balance sheet date with changes recognised in the incomestatement. Payments of contingent consideration reduce the balancesheet liability and as a result are not recorded in the income statement. The part of each payment relating to the original estimate of the fair value of the contingent consideration on acquisition is reported within investing activities in the cash flow statement and the part of eachpayment relating to the increase in the liability since the acquisitiondate is reported within operating cash flows. Where the consideration transferred, together with the non-controlling interest, exceeds the fair value of the net assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, the excess is recorded as goodwill. Thecosts of effecting an acquisition are charged to the income statementin the period in which they are incurred. Goodwill is capitalised as a separate item in the case of subsidiaries and as part of the cost of investment in the case of joint ventures and associates. Goodwill is denominated in the currency of the operationacquired. Where the cost of acquisition is below the Group's interest in the net assets acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement. Where not all of the equity of a subsidiary is acquired the non-controlling interest is recognised either at fair value or at thenon-controlling interest's share of the net assets of the subsidiary, on acase-by-case basis. Changes in the Group's ownership percentage of subsidiaries are accounted for within equity. Foreign currency translation Foreign currency transactions are booked in the functional currency of the Group company at the exchange rate ruling on the date oftransaction. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities areretranslated into the functional currency at rates of exchange ruling atthe balance sheet date. Exchange differences are included in theincome statement. On consolidation, assets and liabilities, including related goodwill, of overseas subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, are translatedinto Sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Theresults and cash flows of overseas subsidiaries, associates and jointventures are translated into Sterling using average rates of exchange. Exchange adjustments arising when the opening net assets and the profits for the year retained by overseas subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are translated into Sterling, less exchange differencesarising on related foreign currency borrowings which hedge the Group'snet investment in these operations, are taken to a separate componentof equity within Retained Earnings. When translating into Sterling the assets, liabilities, results and cash flows of overseas subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures which arereported in currencies of hyper-inflationary economies, adjustments aremade where material to reflect current price levels. Any loss on netmonetary assets is charged to the consolidated income statement. Revenue Turnover The Group receives revenue for supply of goods to external customersagainst orders received. The majority of contracts that GSK enters intorelate to sales orders containing single performance obligations for the delivery of pharmaceutical, vaccine and (prior to the demerger of the Consumer Healthcare business) consumer healthcare products. Theaverage duration of a sales order is less than 12 months. Product revenue is recognised when control of the goods is passed to the customer. The point at which control passes is determined by each customer arrangement, but generally occurs on delivery to the customer. Product revenue represents net invoice value including fixed and variable consideration. Variable consideration arises on the sale ofgoods as a result of discounts and allowances given and accruals forestimated future returns and rebates. Revenue is not recognised in full until it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur. The methodology andassumptions used to estimate rebates and returns are monitored andadjusted regularly in the light of contractual and legal obligations,historical trends, past experience and projected market conditions.Estimates associated with returns and rebates are revisited at eachreporting date or when they are resolved and revenue is adjustedaccordingly. Please refer to Note 3 for the details on rebates, discounts and allowances. The Group has entered into collaborative agreements, typically with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies to develop, produceand market drug candidates and vaccines that do not qualify as jointarrangements. When GSK has control over the commercialisation activities, the Group recognises turnover and cost of sales on a gross basis. Profit sharing amounts and royalties due to the counterparty arerecorded within cost of sales. Cost of sales includes profit sharing costsand royalties due to the counterparty of \u00a31,635 million 2020: \u00a34 million). When the counterparty controls thecommercialisation activities and records the sale, the Group is notdeemed principal in the customer contract and instead records its shareof gross profit as co-promotion income, on a net basis, within turnover.The nature of co-promotion activities is such that the Group records no costs of sales. Commercial Operations turnover includes co-promotion revenue of \u00a33 million (2021: 'selling, general and administration' and 'research anddevelopment' costs are recorded net in the respective lines in theConsolidated income statement. GSK Annual Report 2022 Notes to the financial statements continued 1882. Accounting principles and policies continued Other operating income and royalty income GSK enters into development and marketing collaborations and out-licences of the Group's compounds or products to other parties. These contracts give rise to fixed and variable consideration fromupfront payments, development milestones, sales-based milestonesand royalties. Income dependent on the achievement of a development milestone is recognised when it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur, which isusually when the related event occurs. Sales-based milestone incomeis recognised when it is highly probable that the sales threshold will bereached. Sales-based royalties on a licence of intellectual property are not recognised until the relevant product sale occurs. For all revenue, if the time between the recognition of revenue and payment from the customer is expected to be more than one year andthe impact is material, the amount of consideration is discounted using appropriate discount rates. Value added tax and other sales taxes are excluded from revenue. Expenditure Expenditure is recognised in respect of goods and services received when supplied in accordance with contractual terms. Provision is madewhen an obligation exists for a future liability in respect of a past event and where the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated. Manufacturing start-up costs between validation and the achievementof normal production are expensed as incurred. Advertising and promotion expenditure is charged to the income statement as incurred. Shipment costs on inter-company transfers are charged to cost of sales; distribution costs on sales to customers are included in selling,general and administration expenditure. Restructuring costs are recognised and provided for, where appropriate, in respect of the direct expenditure of a businessreorganisation where the plans are sufficiently detailed and welladvanced, and where appropriate communication to those affected hasbeen undertaken. Software as a service (SaaS) configuration costs are expensed as they are incurred where the software being configured is controlled by theSaaS provider. Research and development Research and development expenditure is charged to the incomestatement in the period in which it is incurred. Development expenditure is capitalised when the criteria for recognising an asset are met, usually when a regulatory filing has been made in a majormarket and approval is considered highly probable. Property, plant andequipment used for research and development is capitalised anddepreciated in accordance with the Group's policy. Environmental expenditure Environmental expenditure related to existing conditions resulting frompast or current operations and from which no current or future benefit is discernible is charged to the income statement. The Group recognises its liability on a site-by-site basis when it can be reliablyestimated.This liability includes the Group's portion of the total costs and also a portion of other potentially responsible parties' costs when it is probable that they will not be able to satisfy their respective shares of theclean-up obligation. Recoveries of reimbursements are recorded asassets when virtually certain. Legal and other disputes Provision is made for the anticipated settlement costs of legal or otherdisputes against the Group where an outflow of resources is consideredprobable and a reliable estimate can be made of the likely outcome. In respect of product liability claims related to certain products, provision is made when there is sufficient history of claims made and settlements toenable management to make a reliable estimate of the provisionrequired to cover asserted and unasserted claims. In certain cases, an incurred but not reported (IBNR) actuarial technique is used to determine this estimate. In addition, provision is made for legal or other expenses arising from claims received or other disputes. The Group may become involved in legal proceedings, in respect of which it is not possible to meaningfully assess whether the outcome willresult in a probable outflow, or to quantify or reliably estimate the liability. In these cases, appropriate disclosure about such cases is included but no provision is made. Costs associated with claims made by the Group against third parties are charged to the income statement as they are incurred. Pensions and other post-employment benefits The costs of providing pensions under defined benefit schemes are calculated using the projected unit credit method and spread over the period during which benefit is expected to be derived from theemployees' services, consistent with the advice of qualified actuaries. Pension obligations are measured as the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at rates reflecting the yields of high-quality corporate bonds. Pension scheme assets are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date. The costs of other post-employment liabilities are calculated in a similar way to defined benefit pension schemes and spread over the periodduring which benefit is expected to be derived from the employees' services, in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries. The service cost of providing retirement benefits to employees during the year, together with the cost of any curtailment, is charged tooperating profit in the year. Actuarial gains and losses and the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the statement of comprehensive incomein the year in which they arise. The Group's contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the income statement as incurred. GSK Annual Report 2022 Notes to the financial statements continued 1892. Accounting principles and policies continued Employee share plans Incentives in the form of shares are provided to employees under share option and share award schemes. The fair values of these options and awards are calculated at their grant dates using a Black-Scholes option pricing model and charged to the income statement over the relevant vesting periods. The Group provides finance to ESOP Trusts to purchase company shares to meet the obligation to provide shares when employeesexercise their options or awards. Costs of running the ESOP Trusts are charged to the income statement. Shares held by the ESOP Trusts are deducted from other reserves. A transfer is made between other reserves and retained earnings overthe vesting periods of the related share options or awards to reflect theultimate proceeds receivable from employees on exercise. Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment (PP&E) is stated at the cost of purchaseor construction, less provisions for depreciation and impairment.Financing costs are capitalised within the cost of qualifying assets inconstruction. Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost less residual value of PP&E, excluding freehold land, using the straight-line basis over the expected useful life. Residual values and lives are reviewed, andwhere appropriate adjusted annually. The normal expected useful livesof the major categories of PP&E are: Freehold buildings 20 to 50 years Leasehold land and buildings Lease term or 20 to 50 years Plant and machinery 10 to 20 years Equipment and vehicles 3 to 10 years On disposal of PP&E, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and impairments are removed from the financial statements and thenet amount, less any proceeds, is taken to the income statement. Leases The Group recognises right of use assets under lease arrangements inwhich it is the lessee, except for short-term leases (defined as leaseswith a lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low value assets. Rights to use assets owned by third parties under lease agreements are capitalised at the inception of the lease and recognised on theconsolidated balance sheet. The corresponding liability to the lessor is recognised as a lease obligation within short and long-term borrowings. The carrying amount is subsequently increased to reflect interest on the lease liability and reduced by lease payments made. For calculating the discounted lease liability on leases with annual payments of \u00a32 million or more, the implicit rate in the lease is used. Ifthis is not available, the incremental borrowing rate with a lease specific adjustment is used. If neither of these is available, and for leases with annual payments of less than \u00a32 million, the incrementalborrowing rate is used. The incremental borrowing rate is calculated atthe rate of interest at which GSK would have been able to borrow for asimilar term and with a similar security the funds necessary to obtain asimilar asset in a similar market.Finance costs are charged to the income statement so as to produce a constant periodic rate of charge on the remaining balance of the obligations for each accounting period. Variable rents are not part of the lease liability and the right of use asset. These payments are charged to the income statement as incurred.Lease rental costs for short-term and low-value leases which are not capitalised are also charged to the income statement as incurred. Non-lease components are accounted for separately from the lease components in plant and equipment leases but are not separatelyaccounted for in land and buildings or vehicle leases. If modifications or reassessments of lease obligations occur, the lease liability and right of use asset are remeasured. Right of use assets where title is expected to pass to GSK at a point in the future are depreciated on a basis consistent with similar ownedassets. In other cases, right of use assets are depreciated over theshorter of the useful life of the asset or the lease term. Goodwill Goodwill is stated at cost less impairments. Goodwill is deemed to havean indefinite useful life and is tested for impairment at least annually. Where the fair value of the interest acquired in an entity's assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the consideration paid, thisexcess is recognised immediately as a gain in the income statement. Other intangible assets Intangible assets are stated at cost less provisions for amortisation andimpairments. Licences, patents, know-how and marketing rights separately acquired or acquired as part of a business combination are amortised over theirestimated useful lives, generally not exceeding 30 years, using thestraight-line basis, from the time they are available for use. Theestimated useful lives for determining the amortisation charge take intoaccount patent lives (exclusivity period), where applicable, as well as the value obtained from periods of non-exclusivity. For Pharmaceutical intangible assets, depending on the characteristics, competitiveenvironment and estimated long-term profits of the asset, between 80%to 90% of the book value is amortised over the exclusivity period on astraight-line basis and the remaining book value is amortised over anon-exclusivity period of 5-15 years on a straight-line basis. ForVaccines intangible assets, cost is usually amortised over the exclusivityperiod plus 10 years, or 30 years if no exclusivity period is granted, on astraight-line basis. Asset lives are reviewed, and where appropriate adjusted, annually. Contingent milestone payments are recognised at the point that the contingent event becomes probable. Any development costs incurred bythe Group and associated with acquired licences, patents, know-how ormarketing rights are written off to the income statement when incurred, unless the criteria for recognition of an internally generated intangible asset are met, usually when a regulatory filing has been made in amajor market and approval is considered highly probable. GSK Annual Report 2022 Notes to the financial statements continued 1902. Accounting principles and policies continued Acquired in process R&D and marketed products are valued independently as part of the fair value of businesses acquired from third parties where they have a value which is substantial and longterm and where the brands either are contractual or legal in nature orcan be sold separately from the rest of the businesses acquired. The costs of acquiring and developing computer software for internal use and internet sites for external use are capitalised as intangible fixed assets where the software or site supports a significant businesssystem and the expenditure leads to the creation of a durable assetcontrolled by the Group. ERP systems software is amortised overseven to ten years and other computer software over three to fiveyears using the straight-line basis. Impairment of non-current assets The carrying values of all non-current assets are reviewed forimpairment, either on a stand-alone basis or as part of a larger cashgenerating unit, when there is an indication that the assets might beimpaired. Additionally, goodwill and intangible assets which are not yetavailable for use are tested for impairment annually. Any provision for impairment is charged to the income statement in the year concerned. Impairments of goodwill are not reversed. Impairment losses on other non-current assets are only reversed if there has been a change inestimates used to determine recoverable amounts and only to theextent that the revised recoverable amounts do not exceed the carrying values that would have existed, net of depreciation or amortisation, had no impairments been recognised. Investments in associates, joint ventures and joint operations Investments in associates and joint ventures are carried in the consolidated balance sheet at the Group's share of their net assets atdate of acquisition and of their post-acquisition retained profits or losses and other comprehensive income together with any goodwill arising on the acquisition. The Group recognises the assets, liabilities,revenue and expenses of joint operations in accordance with its rightsand obligations. Inventories Inventories are included in the financial statements at the lower of cost(including raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and relatedproduction overheads) and net realisable value. Cost is generallydetermined on a first in, first out basis. Pre-launch inventory is held asan asset when there is a high probability of regulatory approval for theproduct. Before that point a provision is made against the carryingvalue to reduce it to its recoverable amount; the provision is then reversed at the point when a high probability of regulatory approval is determined.Financial instruments Financial assets Financial assets are measured at amortised cost, fair value throughother comprehensive income (FVTOCI) or fair value through profit orloss (FVTPL). The measurement basis is determined by reference toboth the business model for managing the financial asset and thecontractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. For financialassets other than trade receivables a 12-month expected credit loss(ECL) allowance is recorded on initial recognition. If there is subsequent evidence of a significant increase in the credit risk of an asset, the allowance is increased to reflect the full lifetime ECL. If there is norealistic prospect of recovery, the asset is written off. Expected credit losses are recognised in the income statement on financial assets measured at amortised cost and at fair value through other comprehensive income apart from equity investments. Current equity investments Current equity investments comprise equity investments which the Group holds with the intention to sell and which it may sell in the shortterm. Where acquired with this intention, they are measured at FVTPL.They are initially recorded at fair value and then remeasured atsubsequent reporting dates to fair value. Unrealised gains and losses are recognised in the income statement. Dividend income is recognised in the income statement when the Group's right to receive payment isestablished. Purchases and sales of Current equity investments areaccounted for on the trade date. Other investments Other investments comprise equity investments and investments inlimited life funds. The Group has elected to designate the majority of its equity investments as measured at FVTOCI. They are initially recorded at fair value plus transaction costs and then remeasured at subsequentreporting dates to fair value. Unrealised gains and losses are recognisedin other comprehensive income. On disposal of the equity investment,gains and losses that have been deferred in other comprehensiveincome are transferred directly to retained earnings. Investments in limited life funds are measured at FVTPL. They are initially recorded at fair value and then remeasured at subsequentreporting dates to fair value. Unrealised gains and losses are recognisedin the income statement. Dividends on equity investments and distributions from funds are recognised in the income statement when the Group's right to receivepayment is established. Purchases and sales of Other investments are accounted for on the trade date. GSK Annual Report 2022 Notes to the financial statements continued 1912. Accounting principles and policies continued Trade receivables Trade receivables are measured in accordance with the business model under which each portfolio of trade receivables is held. The Group has portfolios in each of the three business models under IFRS9: to collect the contractual cash flows where there is no factoringagreement in place (measured at amortised cost), to sell thecontractual cash flows where the trade receivables will be sold under afactoring agreement (measured at FVTPL), and both to collect and tosell the contractual cash flows where the trade receivables may besold under a factoring arrangement (measured at FVTOCI). Trade receivables measured at amortised cost are carried at the original invoice amount less allowances for expected credit losses. Expected credit losses are calculated in accordance with the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9, using a provision matrix applyinglifetime historical credit loss experience to the trade receivables. The expected credit loss rate varies depending on whether, and the extent to which, settlement of the trade receivables is overdue and it is alsoadjusted as appropriate to reflect current economic conditions andestimates of future conditions. For the purpose of determining creditloss rates, customers are classified into groupings that have similarloss patterns. The key drivers of the loss rate are the nature of thebusiness unit and the location and type of customer. When a trade receivable is determined to have no reasonable expectation of recovery it is written off, firstly against any expectedcredit loss allowance available and then to the income statement. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously provided for or written off are credited to the income statement. Long-term receivables arediscounted where the effect is material. Cash and cash equivalents Cash held in deposit accounts is measured at amortised cost.Investments in money market funds are held at fair value through profitor loss because the funds fail the solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) test. Borrowings All borrowings are initially recorded at the amount of proceeds received, net of transaction costs. Borrowings are subsequently carriedat amortised cost, with the difference between the proceeds, net oftransaction costs, and the amount due on redemption beingrecognised as a charge to the income statement over the period of the relevant borrowing. Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to market risks. The principal derivative instruments used by GSK areforeign currency swaps, interest rate swaps, foreign exchange forwardcontracts and options. The Group does not hold or issue derivativefinancial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Derivative financial assets and liabilities, including derivatives embedded in host contracts which have been separated from the hostcontract, are classified as held-for-trading and are measured at fairvalue. Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that donot qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the income statement.Hedge accounting Derivatives designated as hedging instruments are classified atinception of hedge relationship as cash flow hedges, net investment hedges or fair value hedges. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that thehedges are effective and accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve. Ineffective portions are recognised in profit or loss immediately. Amounts deferred in the cash flow hedge reserve are reclassified to the incomestatement when the hedged item affects profit or loss, or if the hedgedforecast transaction is to purchase a non-financial asset, the amountdeferred in the cash flow hedge reserve is transferred directly fromequity and included in the carrying value of the recognised non-financialasset. Net investment hedges are accounted for in a similar way to cash flow hedges which are reclassified to the income statement when the hedgeditem affects profit or loss. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with the changes in thefair value of the hedged asset or liability. Taxation Current tax is provided at the amounts expected to be paid, applying taxrates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balancesheet date. The tax charge for the period is recognised in the incomestatement, the statement of comprehensive income or directly in equity,according to the accounting treatment of the related transaction. Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in thefinancial statements. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extentthat it is probable that future taxable profits will be available againstwhich the temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax is providedon temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries,associates and joint ventures, except where the timing of the reversal ofthe temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax is provided using rates of tax that have been enacted orsubstantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assetsand liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offsetcurrent tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate toincome taxes levied by the same tax authority and the Company and itssubsidiaries intend to settle their current tax assets and liabilities on anet basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initialrecognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction (other than abusiness combination) that affects neither the accounting nor the taxableprofit or loss. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at eachreporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. GSK Annual Report 2022 Notes to the financial statements continued 1922. Accounting principles and policies continued 3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty Where an uncertain tax position is identified, management will make a judgement as to what the probable outcome will be, assuming the relevant tax authority has full knowledge of the situation. Where it isassessed that an economic outflow is probable to arise, a provision ismade for the best estimate of the liability. In estimating any suchliability GSK applies a risk-based approach which takes into account,as appropriate, the probability that the Group would be able to obtaincompensatory adjustments under international tax treaties. Theseestimates take into account the specific circumstances of each dispute and relevant external advice. Discounting Where the time value of money is material, balances are discounted to current values using appropriate discount rates. The unwinding of the discounts is recorded in finance income and finance expense.Assets and liabilities held for sale or distribution and discontinued operations Disposal groups are classified as held for sale or distribution if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through sale or adistribution to shareholders rather than through continuing use, they areavailable for sale or distribution in their present condition and the sale ordistribution is considered highly probable. Assets held in Assets held forsale or distribution are measured at the lower of their carrying amountand fair value less costs to sell or distribute. Non-current assets includedin Assets held for sale or distribution are not depreciated or amortised. Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale or distribution are presented in current assets and current liabilities separately from theother assets and liabilities in the balance sheet. A discontinued operation is a component of the Group that has been disposed of, distributed or is classified as held for sale or distribution and that represents a separate major line of business. The results of discontinued operations are presented separately in the Consolidatedincome statement, the Consolidated statement of other comprehensiveincome and the Consolidated statement of cash flows and comparativesare restated on a consistent basis. In preparing the financial statements, management is required to make judgements about when or how items should be recognised in thefinancial statements and estimates and assumptions that affect theamounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses reported in the financial statements. Actual amounts and results could differ from those estimates. The following are considered to be the criticalaccounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty. Turnover Reported Group turnover for 2022 was \u00a329,324 million (2021 (1): \u00a324,696 million). Estimates Gross turnover is reduced by rebates, discounts, allowances andproduct returns given or expected to be given, which vary by productarrangements and buying groups. These arrangements withpurchasing organisations are dependent upon the submission of claims some time after the initial recognition of the sale. Accruals are made at the time of sale for the estimated rebates, discounts orallowances payable or returns to be made, based on available marketinformation and historical experience. (1) The 2021 comparative results have been restated on a consistent basis from those previously published to reflect the demerger of the Consumer Healthcare business (see page 238).Sales of pharmaceutical and vaccine products in the US have complex arrangements for rebates, discounts and allowances. Turnover ofCommercial Operations products in the US for 2022 of \u00a314,542 million(2021: \u00a311,914 million) was after recording deductions of \u00a315,272 million (2021: \u00a312,518 million) for rebates, allowances, returns and other discounts. At 31 December 2022, the total accrual amounted to\u00a35,855 million (2021: \u00a35,044 million). Due to the nature of theseaccruals it is not practicable to give meaningful sensitivity estimates dueto the large volume of variables that contribute to the overall rebates,chargebacks, returns and other revenue accruals. As there can be significant variability in final outcomes, the Group applies a constraint when measuring the variable element withinrevenue, so that revenue is recognised at a suitably cautious amount.The objective of the constraint is to ensure that it is highly probable thata significant reversal of revenue will not occur when the uncertaintiesare resolved. The constraint is applied by making suitably cautiousestimates of the inputs and assumptions used in estimating the variable consideration. Because the amounts are estimated they may not fully reflect the final outcome, and the amounts are subject to changedependent upon, amongst other things, the types of buying group andproduct sales mix. The constraints applied in recognising revenue meanthat the risk of a material downward adjustment to revenue in the nextfinancial year is low. GSK Annual Report 2022 Notes to the financial statements continued 1933. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued The level of accrual for rebates and returns is reviewed and adjusted regularly in the light of contractual and legal obligations, historical trends, past experience and projected market conditions. Marketconditions are evaluated using wholesaler and other third-partyanalyses, market research data and internally generated information. Itis reasonably possible that there could be a significant adjustmentwithin the next 12 months to recognise additional revenue, if actualoutcomes are better than the cautious constrained estimates. Revenue is not recognised in full until it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognisedwill not occur. The amount of turnover recognised in the year fromperformance obligations satisfied in previous periods is set out inNote 6, 'Turnover and segment information', and is an indication of thelevel of sensitivity in the estimate. Future events could cause the assumptions on which the accruals are based to change, which could materially affect the future results of theGroup. Taxation The tax charge for the year was \u00a3707 million (2021 (1): \u00a383 million). At December payable was \u00a3471 million (2021: \u00a3489million), non-current corporation tax payable was \u00a3127 million (2021:\u00a3180 million) and current tax recoverable was \u00a3405 million (2021:\u00a3486 million). Estimates The Group has open tax issues with a number of revenue authorities.Management makes a judgement of whether there is sufficientinformation to be able to make a reliable estimate of the outcome ofthe dispute. If insufficient information is available, no provision is made. If sufficient information is available, in estimating a potential tax liability GSK applies a risk-based approach which takes into account, asappropriate, the probability that the Group would be able to obtaincompensatory adjustments under international tax treaties. Theseestimates take into account the specific circumstances of each disputeand relevant external advice, are inherently judgemental and couldchange substantially over time as each dispute progresses and new facts emerge. At 31 December 2022, the Group had recognised provisions of \u00a3551 million in respect of uncertain tax positions (2021: \u00a3858 million).Due to the number of uncertain tax positions held and the number ofjurisdictions to which these relate, it is not practicable to give meaningful sensitivity estimates. No uncertain tax position is individually significant to the Group. Factors affecting the tax charge in future years are set out in Note 14, 'Taxation'. GSK continues to believe that it has made adequateprovision for the liabilities likely to arise from open assessments. Where open issues exist, the ultimate liability for such matters may vary from the amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome ofnegotiations with the relevant tax authorities or, if necessary, litigationproceedings. (1) The 2021 comparative results have been restated on a consistent basis from those previously published to reflect the demerger of the Consumer Healthcare business(see page 238).Legal and other disputes Legal costs for the year were \u00a3144 million (2021 (1): \u00a350 million). At 31 December 2022 provisions for legal and other disputes amounted to\u00a3218 million (2021: \u00a3196 million). Estimates Management makes a judgement of whether there is sufficient information to be able to make a reliable estimate of the likely outcome of the dispute and the legal and other expenses arising from claimsagainst the Group. If insufficient information is available, no provision ismade and disclosure of the claim is given. The estimated provisions take into account the specific circumstances of each dispute and relevant external advice, are inherently judgemental and could change substantially over time as each dispute progressesand new facts emerge. Details of the status and various uncertaintiesinvolved in the significant unresolved disputes are set out in Note 47,'Legal proceedings'. The company's Directors, having taken legal advice, have established provisions after taking into account the relevant facts and circumstancesof each matter and in accordance with accounting requirements. Inrespect of product liability claims related to certain products, there issufficient history of claims made and settlements to enable managementto make a reliable estimate of the provision required to cover unassertedclaims. The Group may become involved in legal proceedings, in respect of which it is not possible to meaningfully assess whether the outcome willresult in a probable outflow, or to quantify or reliably estimate the liability.In these cases, appropriate disclosure about such cases would beprovided, but no provision would be made and no contingent liability canbe quantified. The ultimate liability for legal claims may vary from the amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome of litigation proceedings,investigations and possible settlement negotiations. The position couldchange over time and, therefore, there can be no assurance that anylosses that result from the outcome of any legal proceedings will not exceed the amount of the provisions reported in the Group's financial statements by a material amount. Contingent consideration The 2022 income statement charge for contingent consideration was \u00a31,645 million (2021: \u00a31,063 million). At 31 December 2022, the liability for contingent consideration amounted to \u00a37,068 million (2021: \u00a36,076 million). Of this amount,\u00a35,890 million (2021: \u00a35,559 million) related to the acquisition of theformer Shionogi-ViiV Healthcare joint venture in 2012. Estimates Any contingent consideration included in the consideration payable for abusiness combination is recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition.These fair values are generally based on risk-adjusted future cash flowsdiscounted using appropriate post-tax discount rates. The fair values arereviewed on a regular basis, at least annually, and any changes arereflected in the income statement. See Note 33, 'Contingent consideration liabilities'. GSK Annual Report 2022 Notes to the financial statements continued 1943. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued 4. New accounting requirements 5. Exchange rates The Group uses the average of exchange rates prevailing during the period to translate the results and cash flows of overseas s ubsidiaries, joint ventures and associates into Sterling and period end rates to translate the net assets of those entities. The currencies which most influence these translations and the relevant exchange rates were: Pensions and other post-employment benefits Judgement Where a surplus on a defined benefit scheme arises, or there ispotential for a surplus to arise from committed future contributions, therights of the Trustees to prevent the Group obtaining a refund of thatsurplus in the future are considered in determining whether it is necessary to restrict the amount of the surplus that is recognised. Two UK schemes are in surplus (2021: three UK schemes), with acombined surplus of \u00a3109 million at 31 December 2022 (2021: \u00a3606million). There are further recognised pension surpluses totalling\u00a3120 million spread across five countries (2021: \u00a3135 million acrosssix countries). GSK has made the judgement that these amounts meetthe requirements of recoverability. Estimates The costs of providing pensions and other post-employment benefitsare assessed on the basis of assumptions selected by management.These assumptions include future earnings and pension increases,discount rates, expected long-term rates of return on assets andmortality rates, and are disclosed in Note 31, 'Pensions and other post- employment benefits'.Discount rates are derived from AA rated corporate bond yields except in countries where there is no deep market in corporate bonds wheregovernment bond yields are used. A sensitivity analysis is provided inNote 31, 'Pensions and other post-employment benefits', a 0.25%reduction in the discount rate would lead to an increase in the netpension deficit of approximately \u00a3424 million and an increase in theannual pension cost of approximately \u00a319 million. Similarly, a 0.25% increase in the discount rate would lead to a decrease in the net pension deficit of approximately \u00a3400 million and a decrease in the annualpension cost of approximately \u00a319 million. A 0.75% reduction in thediscount rate would lead to an increase in the net pension deficit ofapproximately \u00a31,341 million and an increase in the annual pension costof approximately \u00a352 million. Similarly, a 0.75% increase in the discountrate would lead to a decrease in the net pension deficit of approximately\u00a31,147 million and a decrease in the annual pension cost of approximately \u00a360 million. The selection of different assumptions could affect the future results of the Group. Amendments to accounting standards issued by the IASB and adopted in the year ended 31 December 2022 did not have a material impact on the results or financial position of the Group. Certain new accounting standards, amendments to accounting standards and interpretations have been published that are not mandatory for 31 December 2022 reporting periods and have not beenadopted early by the Group. These standards, amendments andinterpretations are not expected to have a material impact on the resultsor financial position of the Group in future reporting periods. 2022 2021 2020 Average rates: US$/\u00a3 1.24 1.38 1.29 Euro/\u00a3 1.17 1.16 1.13 Yen/\u00a3 161 151 137 2022 2021 2020 Period end rates: US$/\u00a3 1.20 1.35 1.36 Euro/\u00a3 1.13 1.19 1.11 Yen/\u00a3 159 155 141 GSK Annual Report 2022 Notes to the financial statements continued 195 6. Turnover and segment information Operating segments are reported based on the financial information provided to the Chief Executive Officer and the responsibili ties of the GSK Leadership Team (GLT). GSK has revised its operating segments from Q1 2022 and from Q2 2022. Previously GSK reported results un der four segments: Pharmaceuticals, Pharmaceuticals R&D, Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare. For the first quarter 2022, GSK reported resu lts under three segments: Commercial Operations, Total R&D and Consumer Healthcare. From Q2 2022, GSK reports under two segments from con tinuing operations as the demerger of the Consumer Healthcare segment was completed on 18 July 2022. Members of the GLT are responsible for each segment. Comparative information has been retrospectively revised on a consistent basis. R&D investment is essential for the sustainability of the business. However for segment reporting the Commercial Operating prof its exclude allocations of globally funded R&D. The Total R&D segment is the responsibility of the Chief Scientific Officer and is reported as a separate segment. The operatin g costs of this segment includes R&D activities across Specialty Medicines, including HIV and Vaccines. It includes R&D and some SG&A costs rel ating to regulatory and other functions. The Group's management reporting process allocates intra-Group profit on a product sale to the segment in which that sale is re corded, and the profit analyses below have been presented on that basis.

(2) On 1 February 2022, ViiV Healthcare reached agreement with Gilead Sciences, Inc (Gilead) to settle the global patent infring ement litigation relating to the commercialisation of Gilead's ViiV Healthcare's patents relating to dolutegravir, an anti-retroviral medication used, togethe r with other medicines, to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Under the terms of the global settlement and licensing agreement, Gilead made an upfront payment of $1.25 billion (\u00a3922 million) to ViiV Healthcare on 15 February 2022. In addition, Gilead will also pay a 3% royalty on all future US sales of Biktarvy and in respec t of the bictegravir component of any other future bictegravir-containing products sold in the US. These royalties will be payable by Gilead to ViiV Healthcare from 1 February 20 22 until the expiry of ViiV Healthcare's US Patent No. 8,129,385 on 5 October 2027 and will be recorded as Royalty income in the Income Statement. Fair value remeasurement on equity investments in 2022 included a gain/loss of \u00a3229 million from the remeasurement of the Group 's retained investment in Haleon plc to fair value at 31 December 2022 from the initial recognition fair value (five-day average share pric e after the demerger). See details in Note 22. Disposal of businesses and assets in 2022 includes milestone income and the reversal of provisions no longer required. Disposal of businesses and assets in 2021 included a net gain on disposal of the rights to the royalty stream for cabozantinib and a net gain on disposal of the cephalosporin antibiotic brands to Sandoz. Disposal of businesses and assets in 2020 included a net profit on disposal of the Horlicks and other Consumer Healthcare nutri tional brands and two subsidiaries in India and Bangladesh of \u00a32,815 million, which reflected reversal of \u00a3240 million of embedded derivative gai ns on the value of the shares taken in prior years. This was partly offset by the related \u00a3476 million loss on the shares in Hindustan Unilever Limite d, including fair value remeasurement losses between their acquisition as consideration for the divestment of GSK Consumer Healthcare Limited in India and their subsequent disposal. Other operating income also included an increase in profit and milestone income from a number of asset dis posals. Fair value remeasurements on contingent consideration recognised as business combinations included \u00a31,431 million related to th e acquisition of the former Shionogi-ViiV Healthcare joint venture and \u00a3193 million payable to Novartis related to the Vaccines acquisition, tog ether with fair value movements on related hedging contracts.

Net foreign exchange (gains)/losses include a net loss of \u00a32 million (2021: \u00a335 million gain; 2020: \u00a336 million loss) arising f rom the recycling of exchange on liquidation or disposal of overseas subsidiaries. The recycling of exchange on disposal of overseas associates of a loss of \u00a3nil (2021: \u00a310 million) is reported through loss on disposal of interest in associates. The recycling of exchange on disposal of overseas subsidiaries does not include recycling of exchange on disposal of Consumer Healthcare subsidiaries as this is reported as Profit after taxation on d emerger of discontinued operations.

Major restructuring costs Within the Pharmaceuticals sector, the highly regulated manufacturing operations and supply chains and long lifecycle of the bu siness mean that restructuring programmes, particularly those that involve the rationalisation or closure of manufacturing or R&D sites, are lik ely to take several years to complete. Major restructuring costs are those related to specific Board-approved Major restructuring programmes, including integration co sts following material acquisitions, which are structural and are of a significant scale where the costs of individual or related projects exceed \u00a325 million. In January 2020, the Board approved a Separation Preparation programme to prepare for the separation of GSK into two companies. Materially all of the Separation Preparation restructuring programme has been included as part of continuing operations. The legacy Consumer H ealthcare Joint Venture integration programme is now included as part of discontinued operations. After the acquisition of Sierra Oncology (July 2022) and Affinivax (August 2022), the Board approved a Major restructuring prog ramme for the Integration of significant acquisitions designed to integrate and achieve synergies. The total restructuring costs of \u00a3321 million in 2022 were incurred in the following areas: - Restructuring costs to prepare for separation of GSK into two companies - Continued transformation of central functions, including GSK technology platforms and interfaces, to deliver greater digital s ynergies, simplification of applications and staff reductions - The integration of acquisitions. The analysis of the costs charged to operating profit from continuing operations under these programmes was as follows: 2022 \u00a3m 2021(1) \u00a3m 2020(1) \u00a3m Increase in provision for Major restructuring programmes (see Note 32) 138 321 606 Amount of provision reversed unused (see Note 32) (111) (140) (71) Impairment losses recognised 122 14 347 Other non-cash charges/(credit) (7) 25 62 Other cash costs 179 204 234 321 424 1,178 Provision reversals of \u00a3111 million (2021 (1): \u00a3140 million; 2020 (1): \u00a371 million) reflected provision releases mainly related to the Separation Preparation programme. Asset impairments of \u00a3122 million and other non-cash credit of \u00a37 million principally comprised fixed as set write-downs of manufacturing facilities and accelerated depreciation where asset lives have been shortened in the supply chain manufacturing n etwork as a result of the Major restructuring programmes, offset by profit on disposals. All other charges have been or will be settled in cash an d include site closure costs, consultancy and project management costs.

Taxation The Group's tax charge is the sum of the total current and deferred tax expense. Taxation charge based on profits for the year 2022 \u00a3m 2021(1) \u00a3m 2020(1) \u00a3m UK current year charge 200 119 (45) Rest of World current year charge 1,351 593 745 Charge/(credit) in respect of prior periods (60) 219 11 Current taxation 1,491 931 711 Deferred taxation (784) (848) (644) 707 83 67 In 2022, GSK made corporate income tax payments globally of \u00a31.5 billion for continuing and discontinued operations, of which \u00a3 48 million was UK corporation tax paid to HMRC. These amounts are for corporate income tax only, and do not include the various other business ta xes borne by GSK each year. The deferred tax credits in each period reflect current year losses where offset against taxable profits in future periods is p robable and the release of deferred tax liabilities. The latter relates primarily to the unwind of deferred tax liabilities on intangible assets. The defe rred tax credit in 2021 also reflected the impact of the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities following enactment of the increase in the hea dline rate of UK corporation tax from 19% to 25%. The following table reconciles the tax charge calculated at the UK statutory rate on the Group profit before tax with the actua l tax charge for the year. Reconciliation of taxation on Group profits 2022 \u00a3m 2022 % 2021(1) \u00a3m before 3,599 5,170 UK statutory rate of taxation 1,069 19.0 685 19.0 984 19.0 Differences in overseas taxation rates 318 5.6 302 8.4 363 7.0 Benefit of intellectual property incentives (600) (10.7) (382) (10.6) (516) (9.9) R&D credits (119) (2.1) (100) (2.8) (103) (2.0) Permanent differences on disposals, acquisitions and transfers 275 4.9 (3) (0.1) (316) (6.1) Other permanent differences 82 1.5 (4) (0.1) 90 1.7 Re-assessments of prior year current tax estimates (60) (1.1) 219 6.1 11 0.2 Re-assessments of prior year deferred tax estimates (233) (4.1) (281) (7.8) (283) (5.5) Changes in Tax Rates (25) (0.4) (353) (9.8) (163) (3.1) Tax charge/tax rate 707 12.6 83 2.3 67 12.9 As a global biopharmaceutical company, we have a substantial business and employment presence in many countries around the worl d. The impact of differences in overseas taxation rates arose from profits being earned in countries with tax rates higher than the UK statut ory rate, the most significant of which in 2022 were the US, Belgium, Germany and Japan. This adverse impact was offset by the benefit of intellec tual property incentives such as the UK Patent Box and Belgian Innovation Income Deduction regimes, which provide a reduced rate of corporati on tax on profits earned from qualifying patents. We claim these incentives in the manner intended by the relevant statutory or regulatory framew ork. In 2021, 'Changes in tax rates' included credits in relation to the enactment of the increase in the headline rate of UK corpor ate income tax from 19% to 25% (effective 2023). In 2020, 'Changes in tax rates' included credits in relation to the UK, where a reduction in the c orporate income tax rate from 19% to 17% was cancelled, and India, where the tax treatment of dividends changed with effect from 1 April 2020. Permanent differences on disposals, acquisitions and transfers in 2022 includes tax on internal restructuring to simplify the g roup structure. The tax credit in 2020 reflected the tax impact of the disposal of Horlicks and other Consumer Healthcare brands to, and subsequent dis posal of shares received in, Hindustan Unilever. The Group's 2022 tax rate has also been influenced by updates to estimates of prior period tax liabilities following closure of open issues with tax authorities in various jurisdictions. (1) The 2021 and 2020 comparatives have been restated on a consistent basis from those previously published to reflect the demer ger of the Consumer Healthcare business (see Note 41). GSK Annual Report 2022 Notes to the financial statements continued 20514. Taxation continued Future tax charges, and therefore our effective tax rate, may be affected by factors such as acquisitions, disposals, restructu rings, the location of research and development activity, tax regime reforms and resolution of open matters as we continue to bring our tax affairs up to date around the world. The UK Government has confirmed that the Spring Finance Bill 2023 will include legislation introducing a 15% global minimum cor porate income tax rate, to have effect from 2024 in line with the OECD's Pillar Two model framework. The detail of the measures and how they are to be accounted for is still being finalised and so it is not possible to accurately quantify the impact for GSK at this stage. Tax on items charged to equity and statement of comprehensive income 2022 \u00a3m 2021(1) \u00a3m 2020(1) \u00a3m Current taxation Share-based payments (3) - (14) Defined benefit plans - - (4) Fair value movements on cash flow hedges - 5 12 Fair value movements on equity investments 12 36 89 9 41 83 Deferred taxation Share-based payments 11 (11) 18 Defined benefit plans (211) 223 (51) Fair value movements on cash flow hedges (9) 3 6 Fair value movements on equity investments (68) (167) 131 (277) 48 104 Total credit to equity and statement of comprehensive income (268) 89 187 (1) The 2021 and 2020 comparatives have been restated on a consistent basis from those previously published to reflect the demer ger of the Consumer Healthcare business (see Note 41). All of the above items have been charged to the statement of comprehensive income except for tax on share-based payments. Issues relating to taxation The integrated nature of the Group's worldwide operations involves significant investment in research and strategic manufacture at a limited number of locations, with consequential cross-border supply routes into numerous end-markets. In line with current OECD guidelines, we base our transfer pricing policy on the arm's length principle and support our transfer prices with economic analysis and reports. However, diffe rent tax authorities may seek to attribute further profit to activities being undertaken in their jurisdiction potentially resulting in double taxat ion. The Group also has open items in several jurisdictions concerning such matters as the deductibility of particular expenses and the tax treatment of cer tain business transactions. GSK applies a risk based approach to determine the transactions most likely to be subject to challenge and the pr obability that the Group would be able to obtain compensatory adjustments under international tax treaties. The calculation of the Group's total tax charge therefore necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement in respect of certain items whose tax treatment cannot be finally determined until resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authority or, as appro priate, through a formal legal process. At 31 December 2022 the Group had recognised provisions of \u00a3551 million in respect of such uncertain tax positions (2021: \u00a3858 million). The net decrease in recognised provisions during 2022 was driven by the reassessment of estimates, the agreement of a number of open issues with tax authorities in various jurisdictions and amounts related to discontinued operations. Whilst the ultimate l iability for such matters may vary from the amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome of agreements with the relevant tax authorities, or litiga tion where appropriate, the Group continues to consider that it has made appropriate provision for periods which are open and not yet agre ed by the tax authorities. A provision for deferred tax liabilities of \u00a3157 million as at 31 December 2022 (2021: \u00a3204 million) has been made in respect o f taxation that would be payable on the remittance of profits by certain overseas subsidiaries. Whilst the aggregate amount of unremitted profits at the balance sheet date was approximately \u00a316 billion (2021: \u00a315 billion), the majority of these unremitted profits would not be subject to tax (includ ing withholding tax) on repatriation, as UK legislation relating to company distributions provides for exemption from tax for most overseas profits, su bject to certain exceptions. Deferred tax is not provided on temporary differences of \u00a3660 million (2021: \u00a3831 million) arising on unremitted pr ofits as management has the ability to control any future reversal and does not consider such a reversal to be probable.

The Group continues to recognise deferred tax assets on future obligations in respect of contingent consideration amounts payab le to minority shareholders. These payments are tax deductible at the point in time at which payment is made. A deferred tax asset is recognised on intra-Group profits arising on inter-company inventory which are eliminated within the co nsolidated accounts. As intra-Group profits are not eliminated from the individual entities' tax returns a temporary difference arises that will rev erse at the point in time inventory is sold externally. The deferred tax asset recognised on tax losses of \u00a31,661 million (2021: \u00a31,450 million) relates to trading losses. Such deferr ed tax assets are recognised where it is probable that future taxable profit will be available to utilise losses, as supported by long-range prod uct level forecasts. Current forecasts indicate the assets will be utilised by around 2030. Other net temporary differences included accrued expense s for which a tax deduction is only available on a paid basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised on the balance sheet as follows: 2022 \u00a3m 2021 tax asset \u00a3m Tax losses \u00a3m Unrecognised deferred tax asset \u00a3m Trading losses expiring: Within 10 years 967 175 1,068 198 More than 10 years 44 13 390 62 Available indefinitely 192 41 200 43 At 31 December 1,203 229 1,658 303 Capital losses expiring: Available Deferred tax assets are only recognised where it is probable that future taxable profit will be available to utilise losses.

Basic earnings per share has been calculated by dividing the profit attributable to shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the period after deducting shares held by the ESOP Trusts and Treasury shares. The trustees have waived their rights to cash dividends on the GSK shares held by the ESOP Trusts. Diluted earnings per share has been calculated after adjusting the weighted average number of shares used in the basic calculat ion to assume the conversion of all potentially dilutive shares. A potentially dilutive share forms part of the employee share schemes where its exercise price is below the average market price of GSK shares during the period and any performance conditions attaching to the scheme have been met a t the balance sheet date.

(3) Dividends per share were retrospectively adjusted to reflect the Share Consolidation in all the periods presented. See deta ils in Note 37. Under IFRS, interim dividends are only recognised in the financial statements when paid and not when declared. GSK normally pay s a dividend two quarters after the quarter to which it relates and one quarter after it is declared. The 2022 financial statements recognise th ose dividends paid in 2022, namely the third and fourth interim dividends for 2021, and the first and second interim dividends for 2022. The demerger of the Consumer Healthcare business was effected by GSK declaring an interim dividend in specie of Haleon plc shar es. The fair value of the distribution was \u00a315,526 million.

Property, plant and equipment continued The weighted average interest rate for capitalised borrowing costs in the year was 4% (2021: 3%). Disposals and write-offs in t he year included a number of assets with nil net book value that are no longer in use in the business. The impairment losses principally arose from decisions to rationalise facilities and were calculated based on fair value less c osts of disposal. The fair value less costs of disposal valuation methodology uses significant inputs which are not based on observable market data, and therefore this valuation technique is classified as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. These calculations determine the net present value of the projected risk- adjusted, post-tax cash flows of the relevant asset or cash generating unit, applying a discount rate of the Group post-tax wei ghted average cost of capital (WACC) of 7%, adjusted where appropriate for specific segment, country and currency risk. Assets that continue to be used by the Group are generally assessed as part of their associated cash generating unit on a value in use basis. For value in use calculations, the post-tax cash flows do not include the impact of future uncommitted restructuring plans or impro vements. Where an impairment is indicated and a pre-tax cash flow calculation is expected to give a materially different result, the test would b e reperformed using pre-tax cash flows and a pre-tax discount rate. The Group WACC is equivalent to a pre-tax discount rate of approximately 9%. The net impairment losses have been charged to cost of sales: \u00a311 included \u00a334 million (2021: \u00a320 million) arising from the Major restructuring programmes. Reversals of impairment arose from subsequent reviews of the impaired assets where the conditions which gave rise to the origin al impairments were deemed no longer to apply. All of the reversals have been credited to cost of sales. During 2022, \u00a339 million (2021: \u00a374 million) of computer software was reclassified from assets in construction to intangible as sets on becoming ready for use. GSK has assessed the qualitative and quantitative impact of climate related risks on asset recoverable amounts and concluded th at there are no material impairments. 18.

The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units are assessed using a fair value less costs of disposal model. Fair value l ess costs of disposal is calculated using a discounted cash flow approach, with a post-tax discount rate applied to the projected risk-adjusted post- tax cash flows and terminal value. The discount rate used is based on the Group WACC of 7% (2021: 6.5%), as most cash generating units have integrated operations across large parts of the Group. The discount rate is adjusted where appropriate for specific segment, country and currency risks. The valua tion methodology uses significant inputs which are not based on observable market data, therefore this valuation technique is classified as leve l 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The R&D segment is evaluated on an arms length pricing model, see assumptions below. Details relating to the discounted cash flow models used in the impairment tests are as follows: Valuation basis Fair value less costs of disposal Key assumptions Sales growth rates Profit margins Terminal growth rate Discount rate Taxation rate Determination of assumptions Growth rates are internal forecasts based on both internal and external market information. Margins reflect past experience, adjusted for expected changes. Terminal growth rates based on management's estimate of future long-term average growth rates. Discount rates based on Group WACC, adjusted where appropriate. Taxation rates based on appropriate rates for each jurisdiction. Period of specific projected cash flows Five years Terminal growth rate and discount rate Terminal growth rate Discount rate 2022 Commercial p.a The terminal growth rate does not exceed the long-term projected growth rates for relevant markets, reflects the impact of futu re generic competition and take account of new product launches. Goodwill is monitored for impairment at the segmental level and the valuations indica ted sufficient headroom such that a reasonably possible change to key assumptions is unlikely to result in an impairment of the related goodwi ll. GSK has assessed the qualitative and quantitative impact of climate related risks on asset recoverable amounts and concluded th at there are no material impairments.

Revenue recognised in the year that was included in deferred income at 1 January 2022 was \u00a385 million (2021: \u00a329 million). Customer return and rebate accruals are provided for by the Group at the point of sale in respect of estimated rebates, discoun ts or allowances payable to customers as more fully described in the Group financial review on page 94. At 31 December 2022, Customer return and rebate accruals included \u00a35,717 million (2021: \u00a35,044 million) in respect of US Commercial Operations. Accruals are made at the time of sale bu t the actual amounts paid are based on claims made some time after the initial recognition of the sale. As the amounts are estimated, they m ay not fully reflect the final outcome and are subject to change dependent upon, amongst other things, the types of buying group and product sales m ix. The level of accrual is reviewed and adjusted quarterly in light of historical experience of actual amounts paid and any changes in arrangem ents. Future events could cause the assumptions on which the accruals are based to change, which could affect the future results of the Group. Pfizer's put option over its shareholding in ViiV Healthcare is currently exercisable. Pfizer may request an IPO of ViiV Health care at any time and if either GSK does not consent to such IPO or an offering is not completed within nine months, Pfizer could require GSK to acquire its shareholding. The amount of the liability for this put option, which is held on the gross redemption basis, is derived from an internal valua tion of the ViiV Healthcare business, utilising both discounted forecast future cash flow and multiples-based methodologies.

GSK Annual Report 2022 Notes to the financial statements continued 21930. Net debt continued Current assets Liquid investments are classified as financial assets at amortised cost. At 31 December 2022, they included US Treasury Notes a nd other government bonds. The effective interest rate on liquid investments at 31 December 2022 was approximately 0.1% (2021: approxima tely 0.1%). Liquid investment balances at 31 December 2022 earning interest at floating rates amount to \u00a367 million (2021: \u00a32 million). Liq uid investment balances at 31 December 2022 earning interest at fixed rates amount to \u00a3nil (2021: \u00a359 million). Balances reported within cash and cash equivalents have an original maturity of three months or less. The effective interest ra te on cash and cash equivalents at 31 December 2022 was approximately 3.1% (2021: approximately 0.6%). Cash and cash equivalents at 31 December 202 2 earning interest at floating and fixed rates amounted to \u00a33,441 million and \u00a310 million respectively (2021: \u00a33,906 million and \u00a339 mill ion) and non-interest bearing holdings amounted to \u00a3272 million (2021: \u00a3329 million). GSK's policy regarding the credit quality of cash and cash equivalents is set out in Note 44, 'Financial instruments and relate d disclosures'. Short-term borrowings GSK has a $10 billion (\u00a38.3 billion) US commercial paper programme, of which $900 million (\u00a3748 million) was in issue at 31 Dec ember 2022 (2021: $nil). GSK has a \u00a35 billion Euro commercial paper programme, of which \u20ac500 million (\u00a3443 million) was in issue at 31 December 2022 (2021: \u20ac300 million (\u00a3252 million)). In February 2022 GSK the \u00a31.9 billion three year and $2.5 billion (\u00a32.1 billion) 364 day committed facilit ies and replaced them with new revolving credit facilities of equivalent size with maturities in September 2025 and September 2023 respectively. Post separati on of the Consumer Healthcare business these facilities were reduced to \u00a31.6 billion and $2.2 billion (\u00a31.8 billion) respectively. The weighted average interest rate on commercial paper borrowings at 31 December 2022 was 3.5% (2021: -0.5%). The weighted average interest rate on current bank loans and overdrafts at 31 December 2022 was 7.8% (2021: 7.9%). The average effective pre-swap interest rate of notes classified as short-term at 31 December 2022 was 0.4% (2021: 3.0%). Long-term borrowings At the had long-term borrowings of \u00a317.0 billion of which \u00a311.1 billion (2021: \u00a311.7 billi on) fell due in more than five years. During 2022, three bonds were repaid earlier than original maturity, those being the 2.800% US$ US Medium Term Note 2023, the 3 .375% US$ US Medium Term Note 2023 and the 0.000% US$ US Medium Term Note 2023. Also, during 2022 GSK undertook a tender on outstanding Ster ling Notes, repaying face values of \u00a3292 million on the 3.375% \u00a3 Euro Medium Term Note 2027, \u00a3350 million on the 5.250% \u00a3 Euro Mediu m Term Note 2033, \u00a3522 million on the 5.250% \u00a3 Euro Medium Term Note 2042 and \u00a3429 million on the 4.250% \u00a3 Euro Medium Term Note 2045. The average effective pre-swap interest rate of all notes in issue at 31 December 2022 was approximately 3.5% (2021: approximat ely 3.3%). Long-term borrowings repayable after five years carry interest at effective rates between 1.4% and 6.4%, with repayment dates r anging from 2027 to 2045. Both effective rates exclude the impact of one-off premiums associated with the early repayment of the Sterling Notes. Pledged assets The Group held pledged investments in US Treasury Notes with a par value of $56 million (\u00a347 million), (2021: $56 million (\u00a342 million)) as security against irrevocable letters of credit issued on the Group's behalf in respect of the Group's self-insurance activity. Provision s in respect of self- insurance are included within the provisions for legal and other disputes discussed in Note 32, 'Other provisions'.

GSK entities operate pension arrangements which cover the Group's material obligations to provide pensions to retired employees . These arrangements have been developed in accordance with local practices in the countries concerned. Pension benefits can be provide d by state schemes; by defined contribution schemes, whereby retirement benefits are determined by the value of funds arising from contrib utions paid in respect of each employee; or by defined benefit schemes, whereby retirement benefits are based on employee pensionable remunera tion and length of service. Pension costs of defined benefit schemes for accounting purposes have been calculated using the projected unit credit method. I n certain countries pension benefits are provided on an unfunded basis, some administered by trustee companies. Formal, independent, actuarial valu ations of the Group's main plans are undertaken regularly, normally at least every three years. Remeasurement movements in the year are recognised through the statement of comprehensive income. Discount rates are derived fr om AA rated corporate bond yields except in countries where there is no deep market in corporate bonds where government bond yields are use d. Discount rates are selected to reflect the term of the expected benefit payments. Projected inflation rates and pension increases are long-ter m predictions based on the yield gap between long-term index-linked and fixed interest Gilts. In the UK, mortality rates are determined by adjusting t he SAPS S3 standard mortality tables to reflect recent scheme experience. These rates are then projected to reflect improvements in life expectancy in line with the CMI 2021 projections with a long-term rate of improvement of 1.0% per year for both males and females. In the US, mortality rates a re calculated using the PRI-2012 white collar table adjusted to reflect recent experience. These rates are projected using MP-2020 to allow for fut ure improvements in life expectancy. GSK Annual Report 2022 Notes to the financial statements continued 22131. Pensions and other post-employment benefits continued The average life expectancy assumed now for an individual at the age of 60 and projected to apply in 2042 for an individual the n at the age of 60 is as follows: UK US Male Years Female Years Male Years Female Years Current 27.3 28.2 27.3 28.6 Projected for 2042 28.5 29.5 28.8 30.1 The assets of funded schemes are generally held in separately administered trusts, either as specific assets or as a proportion of a general fund, or are insurance contracts. Assets are invested in different classes in order to maintain a balance between risk and return. Inves tments are diversified to limit the financial effect of the failure of any individual investment. The physical asset allocation strategy for three of the four UK plans is 36% in return-seeking assets and 64% in liability-matching assets. During 2019, a buy-in insurance contract was purchased to cover sub stantially all of the obligations of the other UK plan. At 31 December 2022, the value of the insurance contract was \u00a3402 million (2021: \u00a3570 million ). The asset allocation of the US plans is currently set at 25% return-seeking assets and 75% liability-matching assets. The pension plans are exposed to risk that arises because the estimated market value of the plans' assets might decline, the in vestment returns might reduce, or the estimated value of the plans' liabilities might increase. In line with the agreed mix of return-seeking assets to generate future returns and liability-matching assets to better match f uture pension obligations, the Group has defined an overall long-term investment strategy for the plans, with investments across a broad rang e of assets. The main market risks within the asset and hedging portfolio are against credit risk, interest rates, long-term inflation, equities , property, currency and bank counterparty risk. The plan liabilities are a series of future cash flows with relatively long duration. On an IAS 19 basis, these cash flows are sensitive to changes in the expected long-term inflation rate and the discount rate (AA corporate bond yield curve) where an increase in long-term infl ation corresponds with an increase in the liabilities, and an increase in the discount rate corresponds with a decrease in the liabilities. The interest rate risk and credit rate risk in the US are partially hedged. The targets are based on an accounting measure of t he plan liabilities. For the UK plans, there is an interest rate and inflation hedging strategy in place. The targets are based on an economic measu re of the plan liabilities. In the UK, the defined benefit pension schemes operated for the benefit of former Glaxo Wellcome employees and former SmithKlin e Beecham employees remain separate. These schemes were closed to new entrants in 2001 and subsequent UK employees are entitled to join a defined contribution scheme. In addition, the Group operates a number of post-retirement healthcare schemes, the principal one of which is in the US. Following a period of consultation with impacted employees, it was announced on 17 December 2020 that the UK defined benefit pl ans would be closed to future accrual effective from 31 March 2022. As a result, post closure the accrued benefits of active participants wi ll be revalued in line with inflation (RPI for the legacy Glaxo Wellcome plans and CPI for the legacy SmithKline Beecham plans subject to the relevant caps for each arrangement) rather than capped pay increases. In addition, all defined benefit plan participants who were still active at 1 Ap ril 2022 received a defined pension contribution of \u00a310,000 each. The effect of closure and the defined contribution enhancement together resulted in a one-off cost of \u00a374 million in 2020. As announced, the plan was closed to new entrants at 31 March 2022. From 1 April 2022, former defined bene fits plans employees were transferred to the defined contribution plans. It was announced on 9 September 2020 that the US cash balance pension plans would be closed to future accrual from 1 January 20 21. This change resulted in a credit of \u00a356 million. On 1 June 2020 and 9 September 2020, two amendments were made to the retiree health care plans in the US resulting in a credit of \u00a355 million. The Group has applied the following financial assumptions in assessing the defined benefit liabilities: UK US Rest of World 2022 % pa 2021 % pa 2020 % pa 2022 % pa 2021 % pa 2020 % pa 2022 % pa 2021 % pa 2020 % pa Rate of increase of future earnings n/a 2.00 2.00 n/a n/a 2.00 1.40 5.30 2.70 2.30 3.40 1.10 0.60 Expected pension 3.10 3.20 2.80 n/a n/a n/a 3.90 2.00 1.90 0.80 0.20 0.10 Inflation rate 3.10 3.20 2.80 2.50 2.25 2.00 2.30 1.90 1.30 Sensitivity analysis detailing the effect of changes in assumptions is provided on page 228.

Amendments to the retiree healthcare plan in the US in 2020 (2) resulted in a credit of \u00a353 million to past service costs in post-retirement benefits in 2020.

(in aggregate) of GSK's interest in GSKCHH to three Scottish Limited Partnerships (\"SLPs\"), each providing a funding mechanism for a separate GSK UK defined benefit pension scheme. As part of the steps relating to the demerger and separation, the SLPs transferred their app licable portion of GSKCHH C Ordinary Shares to Haleon plc (\"Haleon\") in consideration for shares in Haleon. The SLPs together hold shares represen ting 7.5% of the total issued share capital of Haleon. Each pension scheme, through its SLP interest, is entitled to receive a distribution from that SLP in an amount equal to the ne t proceeds of sales of Haleon shares, and to receive dividend income on the Haleon shares until it has received an aggregate amount equal to an agreed threshold (\"Proceeds Threshold\"). The Proceeds Thresholds total \u00a31,080 million (as increased by notional interest on the remaining balanc e from time to time), and payment of this amount would fully fund the cash funding or \"technical provisions\" deficits in the three pension sch emes shown by the 31 December 2020 valuations. Once the applicable Proceeds Threshold has been reached the GSK-controlled General Partner of each SLP is entitled to sell the remaining Haleon shares held by the SLP and distribute the proceeds to GSK. If a pension scheme does not r eceive aggregate cash equal to the applicable Proceeds Threshold within 18 months after separation, then the trustee of that pension scheme will have the ability to require the SLP to instruct a broker to liquidate any remaining Haleon shares on behalf of the SLP in accordance with an agreed mandate. During 2022, the Group made additional funding contributions to the UK pension schemes of \u00a3691 million (2021: \u00a344 million; 2020 : additional funding (2021: \u00a3nil; 2020: \u00a3nil) to the US schemes. As at 31 December 2022, total cash contributions totalling \u00a3735 million were made towards the Proceeds Thresholds leaving a pri ncipal amount of \u00a3345 million outstanding to the UK pension schemes. The cash contributions of \u00a3735 million include voluntary cash contributions made by GSK in Q4 2022 to two of the UK defined benefit pension schemes totalling \u00a3334 million in response to the market volatility in the UK gilt markets. GSK Annual Report 2022 Notes to the financial statements continued 22631. Pensions and other post-employment benefits continued The outstanding accelerated contributions were collateralised by the creation of three Scottish Limited Partnerships (SLPs), in to which GSK inserted a total of 692,593,037 Haleon ordinary shares across the three SLPs. Each of the three principal UK defined benefit pension sch emes (two benefiting current and former Glaxo Welcome employees, with the third benefiting current and former SmithKline Beecham employee s) has an interest in one of the SLPs as shown below: Scottish Limited Partnership General Partner Limited Partners GSK (No. 1) Scottish Limited Partnership GSK GP1 Ltd GSK LP Ltd Berkeley Square Pension Trustee Company Ltd acting on behalf of the GSK Pension Scheme GSK (No. 2) Scottish Limited Partnership GSK GP1 Ltd GSK LP Ltd Berkeley Square Pension Trustee Company Ltd acting on behalf of the GSK Pension Fund GSK (No. 3) Scottish Limited Partnership GSK GP2 Ltd GSK LP Ltd SmithKline Beecham Pension Plan Trustee Ltd acting on behalf of the SmithKline Beecham Pension Plan Under each of the SLP partnership agreements, the limited partners have no involvement in the management of the business and sh all not take any part in the control of SLP. The general partner (in all cases, controlled by GSK plc) is responsible for the management and con trol of each SLP and, as such, each SLP is consolidated into the results of the Group. Each SLP therefore takes advantage of the exemption in Regulat ion 7 of The Partnership (Accounts) Regulations 2008 Act to not prepare and deliver audited accounts to the UK registrar. Under the SLP partnership agreement, distributions will be made from partnership income to the defined benefit pension schemes if equivalent payments have not already been made to the three defined benefit pension schemes by another GSK entity. To date, \u00a3735 million h as been paid to the defined benefit pension schemes by GSK under this structure and once contributions under this structure reach \u00a31,080 millio n, the defined benefit pension schemes interests' in the SLPs ends. The remaining economic interest in the SLPs will be held by GSK LP Ltd, a 100% owned subsidiary of GSK plc. At 31 December 2022, \u00a3345 million of these additional contributions remains to be paid. Employer contributions for 2023, excluding special funding contributions stated above, are estimated to be approximately \u00a3350 m illion in respect of defined benefit pension schemes and \u00a3100 million in respect of post-retirement benefits.

At 31 December 2022, the US post-retirement healthcare scheme obligation \u00a31,059 million; 2020: \u00a31,124 million). Post-retirement benefits are unfunded.

Provisions for legal and other disputes includeamounts relating to product liability, anti-trust, government investigations, contract terminations and self insurance. The Group may become involved in significant legal proceedings in respect of which it is not possible to meaningfully assess whether theoutcome will result in a probable outflow, or to quantify or reliablyestimate the liability, if any, that could result from ultimate resolution of the proceedings. In these cases, the Group would provide appropriate disclosures about such cases, but no provision would be made. The net charge for the year of \u00a3133 million (including reversals and estimated insurance recoveries) primarily related to provisions forproduct liability cases, commercial disputes and various other government investigations. The discount on the provision is \u00a33 million in 2022 (2021: \u00a3nil). The discount was calculated using risk-adjusted projected cash flows andrisk-free rates of return. In respect of product liability claims related to certain products, provision is made when there is sufficient history of claims made andsettlements to enable management to make a reliable estimate of theprovision required to cover unasserted claims. The ultimate liability forsuch matters may vary from the amounts provided and is dependentupon the outcome of litigation proceedings, investigations and possible settlement negotiations. The Group's position could change over time, and, therefore, there can be no assurance that any losses that result from the outcome of anylegal proceedings will not exceed by a material amount the amount ofthe provisions reported in the Group's financial accounts.It is in the nature of the Group's business that a number of these matters may be the subject of negotiation and litigation over many years.Litigation proceedings, including the various appeal procedures, oftentake many years to reach resolution, and out-of-court settlementdiscussions can also often be protracted. Indemnified disputes will resultin a provision charge and a corresponding receivable. The Group is in potential settlement discussions in a number of the disputes for which amounts have been provided and, based on itscurrent assessment of the progress of these disputes, estimates that\u00a3190 million of the amount provided at 31 December 2022 will be settledwithin one year. At 31 December 2022, it was expected that \u00a3nil (2021:\u00a34 million) of the provision made for legal and other disputes will be reimbursed by third parties. For a discussion of legal issues, See Note 47, 'Legal proceedings'. Major restructuring programmes During 2022, the Group had two major restructuring programmes inprogress: the Separation Preparation programme which focused onpreparing for the separation of GSK into two new companies and theSignificant Acquisitions programme which is focused on the integrationof recent acquisitions. Restructuring provisions primarily include severance costs when management has made a formal decision to eliminate certain positionsand this has been communicated to the groups of employees affectedand appropriate consultation procedures completed, where appropriate.No provision is made for staff severance payments that are paidimmediately. The discount on the provisions increased by \u00a31 million in 2022 (2021: increased by \u00a32 million). Pension augmentation includes \u00a36 million relating to the defined benefit plan arising from staff redundancies, as shown in Note 30, 'Pensions and other post-employment benefits'. GSK Annual Report 2022 Notes to the financial statements continued 230 Employee related provisions Employee related provisions include obligations for certain medical benefits to disabled employees and their spouses in the US. At 31 December 2022, the provision for these benefits amounted to \u00a366 million (2021: \u00a369 million). Other employee benefits reflect avariety of provisions for severance costs, jubilee awards and otherlong-service benefits.Given the nature of these provisions, the amounts are likely to be settled over many years. Other provisions Included in other provisions are provisions for onerous contracts,insurance provisions and a number of other provisions including vehicleinsurance and regulatory matters. GSK Annual Report 2022 Notes to the financial statements continued 231 33. Contingent consideration liabilities The consideration for certain acquisitions includes amounts contingent on future events such as development milestones or sales performance. The Group has provided for the fair value of this contingent consideration as follows: Shionogi- January 2020 5,103 - 339 37 5,479 Remeasurement through income statement 1,114 - 161 - 1,275 Cash payments: operating cash flows (751) - (14) - (765) Cash payments: investing activities (107) - (9) (4) (120) At 31 December 2021 5,359 - 477 33 5,869 Remeasurement through income statement 1,026 - 32 5 1,063 Cash payments: operating cash flows (721) - (21) - (742) Cash payments: investing activities (105) - (9) - (114) At 31 December 2021 5,559 - 479 38 6,076 Remeasurement through income statement 1,431 17 231 (34) 1,645 Exchange movement through reserves - 2 - - 2 Initial recognition from business combinations - 482 - - 482 Cash payments: operating cash flows (1,031) - (27) - (1,058) Cash payments: investing activities (69) - (10) - (79) At 31 December 2022 5,890 501 673 4 7,068 Of the contingent consideration payable at 31 December 2022, \u00a31,289 million (2021: \u00a3958 million) is expected to be paid within one year. The consideration payable for the acquisition of the Shionogi-ViiV Healthcare joint venture, Affinivax and the Novartis Vaccine s business are expected to be paid over a number of years. As a result, the total estimated liabilities are discounted to their present values , shown above. The Shionogi-ViiV Healthcare contingent consideration liability is discounted at 8% (2021: 8%), the Affinivax contingent considerat ion liability is discounted at 9.9% and the Novartis Vaccines contingent consideration liability is discounted at 7.5% (2021: for commerci alised products for pipeline assets. The Shionogi-ViiV Healthcare and Novartis Vaccines contingent consideration liabilities are calculated principally based on the forecast sales performance of specified products over the lives of those products. The Affinivax contingent consideration is based upon two potential milestone payments, each of $0.6 billion (\u00a30.5 billion) whic h will be paid if certain pediatric clinical development milestones are achieved. The table below shows on an indicative basis the income statement and balance sheet sensitivity to reasonably possible changes in key inputs to the valuations of the contingent consideration liabilities. 2022 2021 Increase/(decrease) in financial liability and forecasts* 556 506 15% increase in sales forecasts* 834 n/a 154 759 92 10% decrease in sales forecasts* (555) n/a (103) (506) (57) 15% decrease in sales forecasts* (833) n/a (153) (759) (79) 1% increase in discount rate (199) (7) (55) (198) (38) 1.5% increase in discount rate (292) (10) (80) (286) (55) 1% decrease in discount rate 214 7 65 213 45 1.5% decrease in discount rate 328 11 101 319 70 10 cent appreciation of US Dollar 411 45 22 343 4 15 cent appreciation of US Dollar 645 71 36 495 10 10 cent depreciation of US Dollar (347) (38) (19) (299) (2) 15 cent depreciation of US Dollar (501) (56) (27) (398) (3) 10 cent appreciation of Euro 109 n/a 23 102 19 15 cent appreciation of Euro 171 n/a 36 160 30 10 cent depreciation of Euro (91) n/a (19) (85) (16) 15 cent depreciation of Euro (130) n/a (28) (124) (23) 10% increase in probability of milestone success n/a 82 20 n/a 17 10% decrease in probability of milestone success n/a (82) (10) n/a (8) * The sales forecast is for ViiV Healthcare sales only in respect of the Shionogi-ViiV Healthcare contingent consideration.

Contingent liabilities At 31 December 2022, contingent liabilities where GSK has a present obligation as a result of a past event, comprising guarante es and other items arising in the normal course of business, amounted to \u00a358 million (2021: \u00a3126 million). At 31 December 2022, \u00a30.5 million (2021 : \u00a30.2 million) of financial assets were pledged as collateral for contingent liabilities. Provision is made for the outcome of tax, legal and oth er disputes where it is both probable that the Group will suffer an outflow of funds and it is possible to make a reliable estimate of that outflow. If it is not possible to meaningfully assess whether the outcomes will result in a probable outflow, or to quantify or reliably estimate the liability, if any, no provision is recorded. Descriptions of the significant legal and other disputes to which the Group is a party are set out in Note 47, 'Legal proceedings'. 36. Commitments Contractual obligations and commitments 2022 \u00a3m 2021 \u00a3m Contracted for but not provided in the financial statements: Intangible assets 10,659 12,082 Property, plant and equipment 743 616 Investments 138 146 Purchase commitments 161 484 Pensions and post-retirement benefits 345 44 Interest on loans 6,322 7,603 Future finance charges on leases 146 153 Lease contracts that have not yet commenced 395 60 18,909 21,188 The commitments related to intangible assets include milestone payments, which are dependent on successful clinical development or on meeting specified sales targets, and which represent the maximum that would be paid if all milestones, however unlikely, are achieved. The amounts are not risk-adjusted or discounted. The net decrease in intangible asset commitments in 2022 is mainly attributable to the termination of certain agreements, offset by a number of new R&D collaborations including collaborations with Spero Therapeutics, Wuxi Biologics Ireland Inc. and Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. In 2022, GSK reached an agreement with the trustees of the UK pension schemes to make additional contributions of \u00a31,080 millio n, to eliminate the pension deficit identified at the 31 December 2020 actuarial funding valuation. Prior to the Consumer Healthcare demerger, GSK agreed to collateralise this commitment and accelerate funding with additional contributions (see Note 31). At 31 December 2022, \u00a3345 mil lion of these additional contributions remained unpaid. The Group also has other commitments which principally relate to revenue payments to be made under licences and other alliances . Commitments in respect of future interest payable on loans are disclosed before taking into account the effect of interest rate swaps.

Acquisitions and disposals Details of the acquisition and disposal of significant subsidiaries, associates, joint ventures and other businesses are given below: 2022 Business acquisitions On 1 July 2022, GSK completed the acquisition of 100% of Sierra Oncology, Inc., a California-based, late-stage biopharmaceutica l company focused on targeted therapies for the treatment of rare forms of cancer, for $1.9 billion (\u00a31.6 billion). The main asset is mom elotinib which targets the medical needs of myelofibrosis patients with anaemia. Total transaction costs were \u00a352 million. On 15 August 2022, GSK completed the acquisition of 100% of Affinivax, Inc. a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company based in Cambridge, Boston, Massachusetts focused on pneumococcal vaccine candidates. The consideration for the acquisition comprised an upfront pa yment of $2.2 billion (\u00a31.8 billion) as adjusted for working capital acquired paid upon closing and two potential milestone payments eac h of $0.6 billion (\u00a30.5 billion) to be paid upon the achievement of certain paediatric clinical development milestones. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration payable was \u00a3482 million. The values are provisional and are subject to change. The total transaction costs were \u00a371 million. Since acquisition, no sales arising from the Sierra Oncology or Affinivax businesses have been included in Group turnover and n o revenue is expected until regulatory approval is received on the acquired assets. GSK continues to support the ongoing development of the acquired assets and consequently these assets will be loss making until regulatory approval on these assets is received. The development of these assets has been integrated into the Group's existing R&D activit ies, so it is impracticable to quantify these development costs or the impact on Total profit after taxation for the period. Goodwill of \u00a31,127 million (\u00a3162 million for Sierra Oncology and \u00a3965 million for Affinivax), which is not expected to be deduc tible for tax purposes, has been recognised. The goodwill represents workforce in place, and specific synergies available to GSK from the business comb inations. The goodwill has been allocated to the Group's Commercial Operations and R&D segments, (refer to Note 19 'Goodwill' for allocation methodology). Sierra Oncology \u00a3m Affinivax \u00a3m Net assets acquired Intangible assets 1,497 1,467 2,964 Property, plant and equipment - 30 30 Right of use assets 1 52 53 Inventory 60 - 60 Trade and other receivables 2 17 19 Cash and cash equivalents 175 109 284 Lease liabilities (1) (55) (56) Trade and other payables (40) (77) (117) Taxation (259) (236) (495) 1,435 Goodwill cash 1,597 1,790 3,387 Fair value of contingent consideration - 482 482 On 24 November 2022 GSK signed an agreement to buy out the 25% non-controlling interest in Glaxo Saudi Arabia Ltd for SAR94 mil lion (\u00a321 million), to be paid in 2023. GSK Annual Report 2022 Notes to the financial statements continued 23841. Acquisitions and disposals continued Demerger of Consumer Healthcare business On 18 July 2022, GSK plc separated its Consumer Healthcare business from the GSK Group to form Haleon, an independent listed co mpany. The separation was effected by way of a demerger of 80.1% of GSK's 68% holding in the Consumer Healthcare business to GSK sharehold ers. Following the demerger, 54.5% of Haleon was held in aggregate by GSK shareholders, 6.0% remains held by GSK (including shares r eceived by GSK's consolidated ESOP trusts) and 7.5% remains held by certain Scottish Limited Partnerships (SLPs) set up to provide collate ral for a funding mechanism pursuant to which GSK will provide additional funding for GSK's UK defined benefit pension schemes (Note 31). The agg regate ownership by GSK (including ownership by the ESOP trusts and SLPs) after the demerger of 13.5% was measured at fair value with changes through profit or loss. Pfizer continued to hold 32% of Haleon after the demerger. Under IFRIC 17 'Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners' a liability and an equity distribution are measured at the fair val ue of the assets to be distributed when the dividend is appropriately authorised and it is no longer at the entity's discretion. The liability and equ ity movement, and associated gain on distribution were recognised in Q3 2022 when the demerger distribution was authorised and occurred. The asset distributed was the 54.5% ownership of the Consumer Healthcare business. The net carrying value of the Consumer Healt hcare business in the consolidated financial statements, including the retained 13.5% and net of the amount attributable to the non-controllin g interest, was approximately \u00a311.0 billion at the end of June. GSK's \u00a36.3 billion share of the shareholder loans made in Q1 2022 in advance of the pre-separation dividends was eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. The assets distributed were reduced by Consumer Healthcare t ransactions up to 18 July that principally included pre-separation dividends declared and settled after the end of Q2 2022 and before 18 July 202 2. Those dividends included: \u00a310.4 billion (\u00a37.1 billion attributable to GSK) of dividends funded by Consumer Healthcare debt that was partially o n-lent during Q1 2022 and dividends of \u00a30.6 billion (\u00a30.4 billion attributable to GSK) from available cash balances. The fair value of the 54.5% ownership of the Consumer Healthcare business distributed was \u00a315.5 billion. This was measured by r eference to the quoted average Haleon share price over the first five days of trading, this being a fair value measured with observable inputs which was considered to be representative of the fair value at the distribution date. A gain on distribution of this fair value less book value of t he attributable net assets of the Consumer Healthcare business of \u00a37.7 billion was recorded in the Income Statement in 2022. There was an additional gain of \u00a32.4 billion to remeasure the retained 13.5% from its book value to fair value of \u00a33.9 billion using the same fair value methodology as used fo r the distributed shares. The gain on distribution and on remeasurement of the retained stake upon demerger was presented as part of discontinued operations. Any future gains or losses on the retained stake in Haleon will be recognised in continuing operations. In addition, there was a re classification of the Group's share of cumulative exchange differences arising on translation of the foreign currency net assets of the divested subs idiaries and offsetting net investment hedges from reserves into the Income Statement of \u00a30.6 billion. The total gain on demerger of Consumer Healthcar e was \u00a310.1 billion. These transactions were presented in profit from discontinued operations in 2022. 2022 \u00a3m Fair value of the Consumer Healthcare business distributed (54.5%) 15,526 Fair value of the retained ownership in Haleon plc (13.5%) 3,853 Total fair value 19,379 Carrying amount of the net assets and liabilities distributed/de-recognised (12,887) Carrying amount of the non-controlling interest de-recognised 3,038 Gain on demerger before exchange movements and transaction costs 9,530 Reclassification of exchange movements and net investment hedge movements on disposal of overseas subsidiaries 554 Total gain on the demerger of Consumer Healthcare 10,084 GSK Annual Report 2022 Notes to the financial statements continued 23941.

The Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated Cash Flow Statement distinguish discontinued operations from continuing operatio ns. Comparative figures have been restated on a consistent basis. Financial information relating to the operations of Consumer Heal thcare for the period is set out below and includes financial information until 18 July 2022. This financial information differs both in purpose and basis of preparation from the Historical Financial Information and the I nterim Financial Information included in the Haleon prospectus and from that which will be published by Haleon on 2 March 2023.

For further information on significant changes in net debt see Note 30, 'Net debt'. GSK Annual Report 2022 Notes to the financial statements continued 245 44. Financial instruments and related disclosures The objective of GSK's Treasury activities is to minimise the post-tax net cost of financial operations and reduce its volatility to benefitearnings and cash flows. GSK uses a variety of financial instrumentsto finance its operations and derivative financial instruments tomanage market risks from these operations. Derivatives principally comprise foreign exchange forward contracts and swaps which are used to swap borrowings and liquid assets into currencies required forGroup purposes as well as interest rate swaps which are used tomanage exposure to financial risks from changes in interest rates.These financial instruments reduce the uncertainty of foreign currencytransactions and interest payments. Derivatives are used exclusively for hedging purposes in relation to underlying business activities and not as trading or speculativeinstruments. Capital management GSK's financial strategy supports the Group's strategic priorities and isregularly reviewed by the Board. GSK manages the capital structure ofthe Group through an appropriate mix of debt and equity. The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt of \u00a317.2 billion (see Note 30, 'Net debt') and total equity, including items related tonon-controlling interests, of \u00a310.1 billion (see 'Consolidated statementof changes in equity' on page 184). Total capital, including thatprovided by non-controlling interests, is \u00a327.3 billion. The Group continues to manage its financial policies to a credit profile that particularly targets short-term credit ratings of A-1 and P-1 whilemaintaining single A long-term ratings consistent with those targets.The Group's long-term credit rating with Standard & Poor's is A (stableoutlook) and with Moody's Investor Services ('Moody's') it is A2 (stable outlook). The Group's short-term credit ratings are A-1 and P-1 with Standard & Poor's and Moody's respectively. Liquidity risk management GSK's policy is to borrow centrally in order to meet anticipated fundingrequirements. The strategy is to diversify liquidity sources using arange of facilities and to maintain broad access to financial markets.Each day, we sweep cash to or from a number of global subsidiariesand central Treasury accounts for liquidity management purposes. GSK utilises both physical and notional cash pool arrangements as appropriate by location and currency. For notional cash pools, liquidityis drawn against foreign currency balances to provide both localfunding and central liquidity as required and with balances activelymanaged and maintained to appropriate levels. As balances in notionalpooling arrangements are not settled across currencies, gross cashand overdraft balances are reported. At 31 December 2022, GSK had \u00a34 billion of borrowings repayable within one year and held \u00a33.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents andliquid investments of which \u00a33.1 billion was held centrally.GSK has access to short-term finance under a $10 billion (\u00a38.3 billion) US commercial paper programme; $900 million inissue at $nil). GSK has access to short-termfinance under a \u00a35 billion Euro commercial paper programme;\u20ac500 million (\u00a3443 million) was in issue at 31 December 2022 (2021: \u20ac300 million (\u00a3252 million)). In February 2022 GSK the \u00a31.9 billion three year and $2.5 billion (\u00a32.1 billion) 364 day committedfacilities and replaced them with new revolving credit facilities ofequivalent size with maturities of September 2025 and September 2023respectively. Post separation of the Consumer Healthcare businessthese facilities were reduced to \u00a31.6 billion and $2.2 billion (\u00a31.8 billion)respectively. These committed facilities were undrawn at 31 December 2022. GSK considers this level of committed facilities to be adequate, given currentliquidity requirements. GSK has a \u00a320.0 billion Euro Medium Term Note programme and at 31 December 2022, \u00a310.3 billion of notes were in issue under thisprogramme. The Group also had $9.7 billion (\u00a38.1 billion) of notes inissue at 31 December 2022 under a US shelf registration. GSK iscurrently in the process of renewing its US shelf registration statement inorder to maintain access to the US debt markets. GSK's borrowingsmature at dates between 2023 and 2045. The put option owned by Pfizer in ViiV Healthcare is exercisable. In reviewing liquidity requirements GSK considers that sufficient financingoptions are available should the put option be exercised. Market risk Interest rate risk management GSK's objective is to minimise the effective net interest cost and tobalance the mix of debt at fixed and floating rates over time. The Group's main interest rate risk arises from borrowings and investments with floating rates and refinancing of maturing fixed ratedebt where any changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows orthe fair values of financial instruments. The policy on interest rate riskmanagement limits the net amount of floating rate debt to a specific cap,reviewed and agreed no less than annually by the Board. The majority of debt is issued at fixed interest rates and changes in the floating rates of interest do not significantly affect the Group's netinterest charge. Short-term borrowings including bank facilities areexposed to the risk of future changes in market interest rates as are themajority of cash and liquid investments. GSK Annual Report 2022 Notes to the financial statements continued 24644. Financial instruments and related disclosures continued Foreign exchange risk management The Group's objective is to minimise the exposure of overseas operating subsidiaries to transaction risk by matching local currencyincome with local currency costs where possible. Foreign currencytransaction exposures arising on external and internal trade flows are selectively hedged. GSK's internal trading transactions are matched centrally and inter-company payment terms are managed to reduceforeign currency risk. Where possible, GSK manages the cashsurpluses or borrowing requirements of subsidiary companies centrallyusing forward contracts to hedge future repayments back into theoriginating currency. In order to reduce foreign currency translation exposure, the Group seeks to denominate borrowings in the currencies of our principalassets and cash flows. These are primarily denominated in US Dollars,Euros and Sterling. Borrowings can be swapped into other currenciesas required. Borrowings denominated in, or swapped into, foreign currencies that match investments in overseas Group assets may be treated as ahedge against the relevant assets. Forward contracts in majorcurrencies are also used to reduce exposure to the Group's investmentin overseas assets (see 'Net investment hedges' section of this notefor further details). Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group and arises on cash and cash equivalents and favourable derivative financial instrumentsheld with banks and financial institutions as well as credit exposures towholesale and retail customers, including outstanding receivables. The Group considers its maximum credit risk at 31 December 2022 to be \u00a310,180 million (31 December 2021: \u00a311,417 million) which is the total of the Group's financial assets with the exception of 'Otherinvestments' (comprising equity investments) which bear equity riskrather than credit risk. See page 249 for details on the Group's totalfinancial assets. At 31 December 2022, GSK's greatest concentrationof credit risk was \u00a31.1 billion with a wholesaler in the US (2021:\u00a30.9 billion with a wholesaler in the US). See page 247 for furtherinformation on the Group's credit risk exposure in respect of the threelargest US wholesaler customers. There has been no change in the estimation techniques or significant assumptions made during the current reporting period in assessing theloss allowance for financial assets at amortised cost or at FVTOCIsince the adoption of IFRS 9 at the start of the 2018 reporting period.Treasury-related credit risk GSK sets global counterparty limits for each of GSK's banking and investment counterparties based on long-term credit ratings from Moody's and Standard & Poor's. Usage of these limits is activelymonitored. GSK actively manages its exposure to credit risk, reducing surplus cash balances wherever possible. This is part of GSK's strategy to regionalise cash management and to concentrate cash centrally as much as possible. The table below sets out the credit exposure to counterpartiesby rating for liquid investments, cash and cash equivalents andderivatives. The gross asset position on each derivative contract is considered for the purpose of this table, although, under ISDA agreements, the amount at risk is the net position with each counterparty. Table (e) on page 257sets out the Group's financial assets and liabilities on an offset basis. GSK Annual Report 2022 Notes to the financial statements continued 247 44. Financial instruments and related disclosures continued At 31 December 2022, \u00a360 million (2021: \u00a354 million) of cash is categorised as held with unrated or sub-investment grade rated counterparties (lower than BBB-/Baa3) of which \u00a3nil (2021: \u00a37 million) is cash in transit. The remaining exposure is concentrated in overseas banks used for local cash management or investment purposes, including: \u00a323 million in Nigeria held with United Bank for Africa, Zenith Bank, Access Bank and Stanbic IBTC Bank; \u00a314 million with Halk million with Produbanco in Ecuador; \u00a32 million with J Trust Royal Bank in C ambodia; \u00a32 million with Banco Do Brasil in Brazil; \u00a31 million with Banco de Honduras in Honduras; and \u00a31 million with BAC San Jos\u00e9 in Costa Rica. Of the \u00a349 million of bank balances and deposits held with BBB/Baa rated counterparties, \u00a31.4 million was held with BBB-/Baa3 rated counterparties , including balances or deposits of \u00a31 million with State Bank of India in India. These banks are used for local investment purposes. GSK measures expected credit losses over cash and cash equivalents as a function of individual counterparty credit ratings and associated 12 month default rates. Expected credit losses over cash and cash equivalents and third-party financial derivatives are deemed to be immaterial and no such loss has been experienced during 2022. Credit ratings are assigned by Standard & Poor's and Moody's respectively. Where the opinions of the two rating agencies differ , GSK assigns the lower rating of the two to the counterparty. Where local rating agency or Fitch data is the only source available, the ratings are converted to global ratings equivalent to those of Standard & Poor's or Moody's using published conversion tables. These credit ratings form the ba sis of the assessment of the expected credit loss on Treasury-related balances held at amortised cost being bank balances and deposits and balances and deposits - - 1,215 49 60 1,324 US Treasury and Treasury repo only money market funds 146 - - - - 146 Liquidity funds 2,253 - - - - 2,253 Government securities - 67 - - - 67 Third party financial derivatives - - 188 - - 188 Total 2,399 67 balances and deposits - 7 2,687 77 54 2,825 US Treasury and Treasury repo only money market funds 54 - - - - 54 Liquidity funds 1,395 - - - - 1,395 Government securities - 60 - 1 - 61 Third party financial derivatives - - 200 - - 200 Total 1,449 67 2,887 78 54 4,535 GSK's centrally managed cash reserves amounted to \u00a33.1 billion at 31 December 2022, all available within three months. This includes \u00a32.2 billion of cash managed by the Group for ViiV Healthcare, a78.3% owned subsidiary. The Group has invested centrally managedliquid assets in bank deposits, Aaa/AAA rated US Treasury andTreasury repo only money market funds and Aaa/AAA rated liquidityfunds. Wholesale and retail credit risk Outside the US, no customer accounts for more than 5% of theGroup's trade receivables balance. In the US, in line with other pharmaceutical companies, the Group sells its products through a small number of wholesalers in addition to hospitals, pharmacies, physicians and other groups. Sales to the three largest wholesalers amounted to approximately 79% (2021: 75%) ofthe sales of the US Commercial Operations business in 2022. At 31 December 2022, the Group had trade receivables due from these three wholesalers totalling \u00a33,001 million or 55% of total trade receivables (2021: \u00a32,430 million or 39%). The Group is exposed to a concentration of credit risk in respect of these wholesalers such that, ifone or more of them encounters financial difficulty, it could materiallyand adversely affect the Group's financial results.This concentration of trade receivables is reflective of standard market practice in the US pharmaceuticals sector where a significant portion of sales are made to these three wholesalers, as disclosed in Note 6.GSK's assessment is that there is limited credit risk associated withthese customers. The Group's credit risk monitoring activities relating to these wholesalers include a review of their quarterly financial information and Standard & Poor's credit ratings, development of GSK internal risk ratings, andestablishment and periodic review of credit limits. All new customers are subject to a credit vetting process and existing customers will be subject to a review at least annually. The vetting process and subsequent reviews involve obtaining information including the customer's status as a government or private sector entity, auditedfinancial statements, credit bureau reports, debt rating agency (egMoody's, Standard & Poor's) reports, payment performance history(from trade references, industry credit groups) and bank references. GSK Annual Report 2022 Notes to the financial statements continued 24844. Financial instruments and related disclosures continued Trade receivables consist of amounts due from a large number of customers, spread across diverse industries and geographical areas. Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition ofaccounts receivable and, where appropriate, credit insurance ispurchased or factoring arrangements put in place. The amount of information obtained is proportional to the level of exposure being considered. The information is evaluated quantitatively (i.e. credit score) and qualitatively (i.e. judgement) in conjunction withthe customer's credit requirements to determine a credit limit. Trade receivables are grouped into customer segments that have similar loss patterns to assess credit risk while other receivables and other financial assets are assessed individually. Historical and forward- looking information is considered to determine the appropriateexpected credit loss allowance. The Group believes there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of the allowance for expected credit losses (see Note 26, 'Trade and other receivables'). Credit enhancements The Group uses credit enhancements including factoring and credit insurance to minimise the credit risk of the trade receivables in theGroup. At 31 December 2022, \u00a3332 million (2021: \u00a3315 million) oftrade receivables were insured in order to protect the receivables from loss due to credit risks such as default, insolvency and bankruptcy. Each Group entity assesses the credit risk of its private customers to determine if credit insurance is required. Factoring arrangements are managed locally by entities and are used to mitigate risk arising from large credit risk concentrations. Allfactoring arrangements are non-recourse.Fair value of financial assets and liabilities excluding lease liabilities The table on page 249 presents the carrying amounts and the fair values of the Group's financial assets and liabilities excluding leaseliabilities at 31 December 2022 and 31 December 2021. The fair values of the financial assets and liabilities are included at the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at themeasurement date. The following methods and assumptions are used to measure the fair values of significant financial instruments carried at fair value on the balance sheet: - Other investments - equity investments traded in an active market determined by reference to the relevant stock exchange quoted bidprice; other equity investments determined by reference to the current market value of similar instruments, recent financing rounds or the discounted cash flows of the underlying net assets - Trade receivables carried at fair value - based on invoiced amount - Interest rate swaps, foreign exchange forward contracts, swaps and options - based on the present value of contractual cash flows oroption valuation models using market sourced data (exchange ratesor interest rates) at the balance sheet date - Cash and cash equivalents carried at fair value - based on net asset value of the funds - Contingent consideration for business acquisitions and divestments - based on present values of expected future cash flows. The following methods and assumptions are used to estimate the fair values of significant financial instruments which are not measured at fairvalue on the balance sheet: - Receivables and payables, including put options, carried at amortised cost - approximates to the carrying amount - Liquid investments - approximates to the carrying amount - Cash and cash equivalents carried at amortised cost - approximates to the carrying amount - Long-term loans - based on quoted market prices (a level 1 fair value measurement) in the case of European and US Medium Term Notes;approximates to the carrying amount in the case of other fixed rateborrowings and floating rate bank loans - Short-term loans, overdrafts and commercial paper - approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of theseinstruments.

GSK Annual Report 2022 Notes to the financial statements continued 25044. Financial instruments and related disclosures continued Fair value of investments in GSK shares At 31 December 2022, the Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) Trusts held GSK shares with a carrying value of \u00a3354 million (202 1: \u00a328 million) and a market value of \u00a3861 million (2021: \u00a3373 million) based on quoted market price. The shares are held by the ESOP Trusts to satisfy future exercises of options and awards under employee incentive schemes. In 2022, the carrying value, which is the lower of cos t or expected proceeds, of these shares has been recognised as a deduction from other reserves. At 31 December 2022, GSK held Treasury shares at a cost of \u00a33,797 million (2021: \u00a34,969 million) which has been deducted from retained earnings. (a) Financial instruments held at fair value The following tables categorise the Group's financial assets and liabilities held at fair value by the valuation methodology ap plied in determining their fair value. Where possible, quoted prices in active markets are used (Level 1). Where such prices are not available, the asset or liability is classified as Level 2, provided all significant inputs to the valuation model used are based on observable market data. If one or more of the significant inputs to the valuation model is not based on observable market data, the instrument is classified as Level 3. Other investments class ified as Level 3 in the tables below comprise equity investments in unlisted entities with which the Group has entered into research collaborations and investments which provide access to biotechnology developments of potential interest.

Charges of \u00a31,431 million (2021: \u00a31,026 million) arose from remeasurement of the contingent con sideration payable for the acquisition of the former Shionogi-ViiV Healthcare joint venture and \u00a3231 million (2021: \u00a332 million) arose fro m remeasurement of the contingent consideration payable for the acquisition of the Novartis Vaccines business. The acquisition of Affinivax in 202 2 resulted in the addition of \u00a3482 million of contingent consideration to Level 3 financial liabilities, with a further \u00a317 million remeasurement charge arising for the period between acquisition and 31 December 2022. There were no transfers into or out of Level 3 financial instruments in the ye ar (2021 - transfers related to equity instruments which transferred to a Level 1 valuation methodology as a result of listing on a recognised stock exchange during the year). Movements arising on the translation of overseas net assets for consolidation into the Group accounts are recorded as Ex change adjustments. Net gains and losses include the impact of other exchange movements. Financial liabilities measured using Level 3 valuation methods at 31 December included \u00a35,890 million (2021: \u00a35,559 million) in respect of contingent consideration payable for the acquisition in 2012 of the former Shionogi-ViiV Healthcare joint venture. This conside ration is expected to be paid over a number of years and will vary in line with the future performance of specified products and movements in certain foreign currencies. A further \u00a3673 million (2021: \u00a3479 million) is in respect of contingent consideration for the acquisition in 2015 of the Novartis Vaccines business. This consideration is expected to be paid over a number of years and will vary in line with the future performance of specified prod ucts, the achievement of certain milestone targets and movements in certain foreign currencies. As a result of the Group's acquisition of Affinivax i n 2022, contingent consideration payable of \u00a3501 million is recognised at 31 December 2022. This consideration is expected to be paid over a numbe r of years and will vary in line with the achievement of certain development milestones and movements in the USD/GBP exchange rate.

Financial instruments and related disclosures continued Fair value hedges At 31 December 2022 and 31 December 2021, the Group had no designated fair value hedges. Net investment hedges At 31 December 2022, certain foreign exchange contracts were designated as net investment hedges in respect of the foreign curr ency translation risk arising on consolidation of the Group's net investment in its European (Euro), Singaporean (SGD), Canadian (CAD) and Japan ese (JPY) foreign operations as shown in the table above. The carrying value of bonds on page 249 included \u00a36,322 million (2021: \u00a34,982 million) that were designated as hedging instrume nts in net investment hedges. Cash flow hedges During 2021 and 2022, the Group entered into forward foreign exchange contracts which have been designated as cash flow hedges. These were entered into to hedge the foreign exchange exposure arising on cash flows from Euro denominated coupon payments relating to not es issued under the Group's European Medium Term Note programme, and to hedge foreign currency payments due on collaboration or licensing arran gements. The Group manages its cash flow interest rate risk by using floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps. In addition, the Group carri es a balance in reserves that arose from pre-hedging fluctuations in long-term interest rates when pricing bonds issued in prior years and in the curren t year. The balance is reclassified to finance costs over the life of these bonds. Foreign exchange risk In the current year, the Group has designated certain foreign exchange forward contracts and swaps as cash flow and net investm ent hedges. Foreign exchange derivative financial assets and liabilities are presented in the line 'Derivative financial instruments' (eith er as assets or liabilities) on the Consolidated balance sheet. The following tables detail the foreign exchange forward contracts and swaps outstanding at the end of the reporting period, as well as information on the related hedged items. Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness as sessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging instrument. The Group enters into hedge relationships where the critical terms of the hedging instrument match exactly with the terms of the hedged item, and so a qualitative assessment of effectivene ss is performed. If changes in circumstances affect the terms of the hedged item such that the critical terms no longer match exactly with the crit ical terms of the hedging instrument, the Group uses the hypothetical derivative method to assess effectiveness. The main source of hedge ineffectiveness in these hedging relationships is the effect of the counterparty and the Group's own c redit risk on the fair value of the foreign exchange forward contracts and swaps, which is not reflected in the fair value of the hedged item attribut able to changes in foreign exchange rates and ineffectiveness on rolling the cash flow hedges of the divestments mentioned above. No other sources of ineffectiveness emerged from these hedging relationships. No ineffectiveness was recorded from cash flow hedges in 2022 (2021: \u00a3nil). No ineffe ctiveness was recorded from net investment hedges (2021: \u00a3nil). 2022 Hedging instruments Average exchange rate Foreign currency Notional value \u00a3m Carrying value \u00a3m Periodic change in value for calculating hedge ineffectiveness \u00a3m Cash flow hedges Foreign exchange contracts Buy foreign currency: Less than 3 months 1.23 USD 100 2 2 3 to 6 months 1.16 EUR 50 2 2 Over 6 months 1.15 EUR 24 1 1 Sell foreign currency Less than 3 months 1.14 EUR (7) - - 167 5 5 GSK Annual Report 2022 Notes to the financial statements continued 25444.

Financial instruments and related disclosures continued Interest rate risk The Group manages its cash flow interest rate risk by using floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps, where at quarterly intervals the difference between fixed contract rates and floating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to the agreed notional principal amounts are ex changed. There are none of these swaps outstanding at 31 December 2022. At 31 December 2021, the interest rate risk on an element of fut ure debt issuance had been managed by entering into forward starting interest rate swaps, effectively to lock in the interest rates on t he debt in advance. These were closed out at the time of issuing the debt, and the resulting gain or loss held in the Cash flow hedge reserve and r eclassified to income statement as the interest payments on the debt impacted the income statement until the debt was derecognised on demerger of the Consumer Healthcare business in July 2022. Forward starting interest rate swaps The forward starting interest rate contracts, exchanging floating interest for fixed interest, were designated as cash flow hed ges to hedge the interest variability of the interest cash flows associated with the future fixed rate debt. Interest rate swaps The following tables provide information regarding interest rate swap and forward starting interest rate swap contracts outstan ding and the related hedged items at 31 December 2021.

There are also arrangements that do not meet the criteria for offsetting but still allow for the related amounts to be offset in certain circu mstances, such as bankruptcy or the termination of a contract. The following tables set out the financial assets and liabilities that are offset, or subject to enforceable master netting arr angements and other similar agreements but not offset, as at 31 December 2022 and 31 December 2021.

As there is presently not a legally enforceable right of offset, the se amounts have not been offset in the balance sheet, but have been presented separately in the table above. (f) Debt interest rate repricing table The following table sets out the exposure of the Group to interest rates on debt, including commercial paper. The maturity anal ysis of fixed rate debt is stated by contractual maturity and of floating rate debt by interest rate repricing dates.

Financial instruments and related disclosures continued (g) Sensitivity analysis The tables below illustrate the estimated impact on the income statement and equity as a result of hypothetical market movement s in foreign exchange and interest rates in relation to the Group's financial instruments. The range of variables chosen for the sensitivity analysis reflects management's view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one-year period. Foreign exchange sensitivity The Group operates internationally and is primarily exposed to foreign exchange risk in relation to Sterling against movements in US Dollar, Euro and Japanese Yen. Foreign exchange risk arises from the translation of financial assets and liabilities which are not in the fu nctional currency of the entity that holds them. Based on the Group's net financial assets and liabilities as at 31 December, a weakening and strengthen ing of Sterling against these currencies, with all other variables held constant, is illustrated in the tables below. The tables exclude financ ial instruments that expose the Group to foreign exchange risk where this risk is fully hedged with another financial instrument. 2022 2021 Income statement impact of non-functional currency foreign exchange exposures Increase/(decrease) in income \u00a3m Increase/(decrease) in income \u00a3m 10 cent appreciation of the US Dollar 99 5 15 cent appreciation of the US Dollar 155 8 10 cent appreciation of the Euro (7) (26) 15 cent appreciation of the Euro (12) (41) 10 yen appreciation of the Yen - - 15 yen appreciation of the Yen (1) - 2022 2021 Income statement impact of non-functional currency foreign exchange exposures Increase/(decrease) in income \u00a3m Increase/(decrease) in income \u00a3m 10 cent depreciation of the US Dollar (84) (4) 15 cent depreciation of the US Dollar (121) (6) 10 cent depreciation of the Euro 6 22 15 cent depreciation of the Euro 9 32 10 yen depreciation of the Yen - - 15 yen depreciation of the Yen - - The equity impact, shown below, for foreign exchange sensitivity relates to derivative and non-derivative financial instruments hedging the Group's net investments in its European (Euro) foreign operations and cash flow hedges of its foreign exchange exposure arising on Euro den ominated coupon payments relating to notes issued under the Group's European Medium Term Note programme. 2022 2021 Equity impact of non-functional currency foreign exchange exposures Increase/(decrease) in equity \u00a3m Increase/(decrease) in equity \u00a3m 10 cent appreciation of the Euro (1,290) (964) 15 cent appreciation in Euro (2,034) (1,515) 2022 2021 Equity impact of non-functional currency foreign exposures Increase/(decrease) in equity \u00a3m Increase/(decrease) in equity \u00a3m 10 cent depreciation of the Euro 1,080 814 15 cent depreciation of the Euro 1,557 1,176 GSK Annual Report 2022 Notes to the financial statements continued 26044. Financial instruments and related disclosures continued The tables below present the Group's sensitivity to a weakening and strengthening of Sterling against the relevant currency bas ed on the composition of net debt as shown in Note 30 adjusted for the effects of foreign exchange derivatives that are not part of net d ebt but affect future foreign currency cash flows. 2022 2021 Impact of foreign exchange movements on net debt (Increase)/decrease in net debt \u00a3m (Increase)/decrease in net debt \u00a3m 10 cent appreciation of the US Dollar (999) (767) 15 cent appreciation of the US Dollar (1,570) (1,199) 10 cent appreciation of the Euro 11 444 15 cent appreciation of the Euro 17 698 10 yen appreciation of the Yen 13 17 15 yen appreciation of the Yen 20 26 2022 2021 Impact of foreign exchange movements on net debt (Increase)/decrease in net debt \u00a3m (Increase)/decrease in net debt \u00a3m 10 cent depreciation of the US Dollar 846 661 15 cent depreciation of the US Dollar 1,222 959 10 cent depreciation of the Euro (9) (375) 15 cent depreciation of the Euro (13) (542) 10 yen depreciation of the Yen (12) (15) 15 yen depreciation of the Yen (17) (21) Interest rate sensitivity The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on its outstanding borrowings and investments where any changes in interest rates wi ll affect future cash flows or the fair values of financial instruments. The majority of debt is issued at fixed interest rates and changes in the floating rates of interest do not significantly affec t the Group's net interest charge, although the majority of cash and liquid investments earn floating rates of interest. The table below hypothetically shows the Group's sensitivity to changes in interest rates in relation to Sterling, US Dollar an d Euro floating rate financial assets and liabilities. A 1% (100 basis points) movement in USD interest rates would cause an increase of \u00a3nil to equ ity (2021: \u00a3197 million). A 1.5% (150 basis points) movement in USD interest rates would cause an increase of \u00a3nil to equity (2021: \u00a3297 millio n). A 1% (100 basis points) or 1.5% (150 basis points) movement in EUR or Sterling interest rates is not deemed to have a material effect on equity . 2022 2021 Income statement impact of interest rate movements Increase/(decrease) in income \u00a3m Increase/(decrease) in income \u00a3m 1% (100 basis points) increase in Sterling interest rates 36 (25) 1.5% (150 basis points) increase in Sterling interest rates 55 (38) 1% (100 basis points) increase in US Dollar interest rates (34) 11 1.5% (150 basis points) increase in US Dollar interest rates (51) 17 1% (100 basis points) increase in Euro interest rates (13) 3 1.5% (150 basis points) increase in Euro interest rates (19) 5 GSK Annual Report 2022 Notes to the financial statements continued 26144.

For the purpose of this table, debt is defined as all classes of borrowings except for le ase liabilities. Interest is calculated based on debt held at 31 December without taking account of future issuance. Floating rate interest is estimated usi ng the prevailing interest rate at the balance sheet date. Cash flows in foreign currencies are translated using spot rates at 31 December.

Employee share schemes GSK operates several employee share schemes, including the Share Value Plan, whereby awards are granted to employees to acquire shares or ADS in GSK plc at no cost after a three-year vesting period and the Performance Share Plan, whereby awards are granted to emplo yees to acquire shares or ADS in GSK plc at no cost, subject to the achievement by the Group of specified performance targets. The granting of these restricted share awards has replaced the granting of options to employees as the cost of the schemes more readily equates to the potential gain to be made by the employee. The Group also operates savings related share option schemes, whereby options are granted to employees to acqu ire shares in GSK plc at a discounted price. Grants of restricted share awards are normally exercisable at the end of the three-year vesting or performance period. Awards a re normally granted to employees to acquire shares or ADS in GSK plc but in some circumstances may be settled in cash. Grants under savings-related share option schemes are normally exercisable after three years' saving. In accordance with UK practice, the majority of options under the s avings-related share option schemes are granted at a price 20% below the market price ruling at the date of grant. Options under historical share op tion schemes were granted at the market price ruling at the date of grant. The value of the plans for participating employees has been maintained after the demerger of the Consumer Healthcare business t hrough the effect of the share consolidation (see Note 37). The total charge for share-based incentive plans in 2022 (1): \u00a3258million; 2020 (1): \u00a3266 million) arose from the Share Value Plan. See Note 9, 'Employee Costs' for further details. (1) The 2021 and 2020 comparatives have been restated to reflect on a consistent basis from those previously published to reflec t the demerger of the Consumer Healthcare business. See Note 41. GSK share award schemes Share Value Plan Under the Share Value Plan, share awards are granted to certain employees at no cost. The awards vest after two and a half to t hree years and there are no performance criteria attached. The fair value of these awards is determined based on the closing share price on th e day of grant, after deducting the expected future dividend yield of 3.2% (2021: 3.8%; 2020: 5.0%) over the duration of Number of shares and ADS issuable Shares(1) Number (000) Weighted fair value ADS(1) Number (000) Weighted fair value At 1 January 2020 29,459 15,850 Awards granted 11,115 15,429 (1) The 2021 and 2020 comparatives have been restated to reflect the demerger of the Consumer Healthcare business and aid year o n year volume comparability of awards granted to GSK employees. Performance Share Plan Under the Performance Share Plan, share awards are granted to Directors and senior executives at no cost. The percentage of eac h award that vests is based upon the performance of the Group over a defined measurement period with dividends reinvested during the same pe riod. For awards granted from 2016 to 2019, the performance conditions are based on three equally weighted measures over a three-year per formance period. These were adjusted free cash flow, TSR and R&D new product performance. For awards granted from 2020, the performance conditions are based on four measures over a three-year performance period. These are adjusted free cash flow (30%), TSR (30%), R&D new pr oduct performance (20%) and pipeline progress (20%). For awards granted from 2022, the performance conditions are based on five measu res over a three-year performance period. These are TSR (30%), pipeline progress (20%), profit measure (20%), sale measure (20%) and ESG e nvironment (10%). The fair value of the awards is determined based on the closing share price on the day of grant. For TSR performance elements, this is adjusted by the likelihood of that condition being met, as assessed at the time of grant. During 2022, awards for the continuing business were made of 4.0 million shares at a weighted fair value of \u00a313.36 and 1.0 mill ion ADS at a weighted fair value of $35.88. At 31 December 2022, there were outstanding awards over 12.6 million shares and 2.8 million ADS. GSK Annual Report 2022 Notes to the financial statements continued 26345. Employee share schemes continued Share options and savings-related options For the purposes of valuing savings-related options to arrive at the share-based payment charge, a Black-Scholes option pricing model has been used. The assumptions used in the model are as follows: 2022 Grant 2021 Grant 2020 Grant Expected life 3 years 3 years 3 years Savings-related options grant price (including 20% discount) \u00a311.39 \u00a312.07 \u00a310.34 Options outstanding for the Share Save Plan Savings-related share option schemes Number 000 Weighted exercise price At 31 December 2022 5,803 \u00a311.38 Range of exercise prices on options outstanding at year end \u00a310.34 - \u00a314.15 Weighted average market price on exercise during year \u00a316.15 Weighted average remaining contractual life 2.0 years Options over 1.2 million shares were granted during the year under the savings-related share option scheme at a weighted averag e fair value of \u00a34.34. At 31 December 2022, 5.3 million of the savings-related share options were not exercisable. There has been no change in the effective exercise price of any outstanding options during the year. Employee Share Ownership Plan Trusts The Group sponsors Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) Trusts to acquire and hold shares in GSK plc to satisfy awards made und er employee incentive plans and options granted under employee share option schemes. The trustees of the ESOP Trusts purchase shar es with finance provided by the Group by way of loans or contributions. The costs of running the ESOP Trusts are charged to the income statement. Shares held by the ESOP Trusts are deducted from other reserves and amortised down to the value of proceeds, if any, receivable from e mployees on exercise by a transfer to retained earnings. The trustees have waived their rights to dividends on the shares held by the ESOP Trusts.

Legal proceedings The Group is involved in significant legal and administrative proceedings, principally product liability, intellectual property, tax, anti-trust, consumer fraud and governmental investigations. The mostsignificant of these matters, other than tax matters, are describedbelow. The Group makes provision for these proceedings on a regular basis as summarised in Note 2, 'Accounting principles and policies' and Note 32, 'Other provisions'. Note 2 also describes when disclosureis made of proceedings for which there is no provision. Legal expensesincurred and provisions related to legal claims are charged to selling,general and administration costs. The Group does not believe thatinformation about the amount sought by plaintiffs, if that is known,would be meaningful with respect to those legal proceedings. This isdue to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the stage ofproceedings, the entitlement of parties to appeal a decision and clarity as to theories of liability, damages and governing law. At 31 December 2022, the Group's aggregate provision for legal and other disputes (not including tax matters described in Note 14,'Taxation') was \u00a3218 million. There can be no assurance that anylosses that result from the outcome of any legal proceedings will not exceed by a material amount the amount of the provisions reported in the Group's financial statements. If this were to happen, it could have amaterial adverse impact on the results of operations of the Group inthe reporting period in which the judgements are incurred or thesettlements entered into. Intellectual property Intellectual property claims include challenges to the validity andenforceability of the Group's patents on various products or processes as well as assertions of non-infringement of those patents. A loss in any of these cases could result in loss of patent protection for theproduct at issue. The consequences of any such loss could be asignificant decrease in sales of that product and could materially affectfuture results of operations for the Group. Coreg In 2014, GSK initiated suit against Teva for inducing infringement of itspatent relating to the use of carvedilol ( Coreg ) in decreasing mortality caused by congestive heart failure. In June 2017, the case proceededto a jury trial in the US District Court for the District of Delaware. Thejury returned a verdict in GSK's favour, awarding GSK lost profits andreasonable royalties for a total award of $235.51 million. On 29 March2018, the trial judge ruled on post-trial motions filed by Teva and foundthat substantial evidence at trial did not support the jury's finding of induced infringement, overturning the jury award. GSK appealed, and on 2 October 2020, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for theFederal Circuit reversed the district court's ruling and reinstated thejury award in GSK's favour.On 2 December 2020, Teva filed a petition for rehearing en banc. The court granted Teva's petition, but only for a rehearing by the three-member panel that issued the original decision. On 5 August 2021, theoriginal panel issued its rehearing opinion where the majority againreinstated the jury's damages award of $235.51 million in GSK's favour. Teva again filed a petition for rehearing en banc which was rejected by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on 11 February 2022. On11 July 2022, Teva filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the SupremeCourt of the United States seeking to overturn the Federal Courtdecision. On 3 October 2022, the Supreme Court invited the United States Solicitor General to file briefs expressing the views of the United States. Dolutegravir Proceedings - Tivicay/Triumeq In September 2021, ViiV Healthcare received a paragraph IV letter from Lupin relating to the Tivicay 5mg dosage for oral suspension, challenging only the crystal form patent. On 2 November 2021, ViiVHealthcare filed suit against Lupin in the US District Court for the Districtof Delaware. No trial date has yet been set. - Dovato In September 2019, ViiV Healthcare received a paragraph IV letter from Cipla relating to Dovato and challenging only the crystal form patent. On 4 November 2019, ViiV Healthcare filed suit against Cipla in the US District Court for the District of Delaware. A settlement has been reached in the case. - Juluca In January 2020, ViiV Healthcare received a paragraph IV letter from Lupin relating to Juluca and challenging the crystal form patent as well as a patent relating to the combination of dolutegravir and rilpivirine thatexpires on 24 January 2031. On 28 February 2020, ViiV Healthcare filedsuit against Lupin on both patents. A settlement has been reached withLupin. Additionally, on 12 June 2020, Cipla sent ViiV Healthcare a paragraph IV letter related to Juluca , and on 22 July 2020, ViiV Healthcare filed suit against Cipla in federal court in Delaware. The courthas not set a trial date. Product liability The Group is currently a defendant in a number of product liabilitylawsuits. Avandia There are two pending US class actions brought by third-party payerswhich assert claims under the Racketeer Influenced and CorruptOrganizations Act (RICO) and state consumer protection laws. InDecember 2019, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals reversed thesummary judgements granted in favour of the Group and remanded thethird-party payer cases back to district court. Discovery is underway inthe district court but no trial dates have yet been set. It is possible that a class certification hearing will be held in 2023. GSK Annual Report 2022 Notes to the financial statements continued 26647. Legal proceedings continued Zantac In 2019, the Group was contacted by several regulatory authorities regarding the detection of N-Nitroso-dimethylamine (NDMA) in Zantac (ranitidine) products. Based on information available at the time andcorrespondence with regulators, the Group made the decision tosuspend the release, distribution and supply of all dose forms ofZantac to all markets pending the outcome of the ongoing tests and investigations. Also, as a precautionary action, the Group made thedecision to initiate a voluntary pharmacy/retail level recall of Zantac products globally. On 30 April 2020, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended the suspension of ranitidine medicines. Following thepublication of the EMA's recommendation, the Companycommunicated a decision not to re-enter the market. In the US, FDArequested that all manufacturers withdraw ranitidine products from the market. The Group has been named as a defendant in approximately 4,500 personal injury cases in US state courts and the federal ZantacMultidistrict Litigation (MDL) court proceeding in the Southern Districtof Florida. There are approximately 84,000 plaintiffs named in these cases. A significant majority of these plaintiffs were named in a series of multi-plaintiff complaints filed in Delaware state court and most ofthese plaintiffs were previously in the MDL Census Registry. They wereremoved because they allege a cancer other than the 5 cancers beingpursued by the MDL plaintiffs. In the MDL, plaintiffs originally identified10 different types of cancers they wished to pursue. Plaintiffssubsequently dropped 5 of the 10 cancers, and proceeded only as tobladder, esophageal, gastric, liver, and pancreatic cancers, althoughplaintiffs in state courts continue to pursue claims beyond the 5 designated cancers. There are 46,697 unfiled claims relating to the Group and other co-defendants (32,970 mapped to the Group)concerning the 5 designated cancers in the MDL Census Registry.There are also over 2,000 California state court cases subject to anagreement between the Group and the plaintiffs which suspends thestatute of limitations to allow the plaintiffs to bring their claims at a laterdate. These filed and unfiled counts are subject to change. On 6 December 2022, the court presiding over the federal MDL proceeding granted Defendants' Daubert motions, finding thatPlaintiffs' experts' causation opinions regarding whether Zantac can cause the five cancers at issue in the MDL (liver, bladder, pancreatic,esophageal, and stomach) are unreliable and thus inadmissible.Without expert causation opinions, the MDL Court granted summary judgment to GSK and the other brand defendants. The MDL Court found that \"there is no scientist outside this litigation who concludedranitidine causes cancer, and the plaintiffs' scientists within thislitigation systemically utilized unreliable methodologies,\" and failed touse \"consistent, objective, science-based standards for the even-handed evaluation of data.\" This ruling effectively dismissedapproximately 2,200 filed cases in the MDL and is binding on all of theclaims in the Census Registry. Plaintiffs have indicated they will appealthe MDL decision.In the California Zantac litigation Cases JCCP 5150 the Court held a Sargon hearing regarding the admissibility of expert witness testimony, including the testimony of general and specific causationexpert witnesses, for the first bellwether trial. The hearing occurred overa four-day period in February and March 2023. The first bellwether trial,which is a bladder cancer case, was expected to start on 27 February2023 in the California JCCP, however the Court has moved the trial dateto 24 July 2023. Three other California bellwether trials have beenscheduled for May, August and October 2023, although these dates are likely to be extended as well. The Illinois Supreme Court recently consolidated all Illinois ranitidine cases in Cook County for pretrial proceedings with trial dates to be setat a later date, including the previously scheduled Madison County trial. Beyond the personal injury actions, class actions alleging economic injury and a third-party payer class action also have been filed in federalcourt. Plaintiffs have moved to stay the class actions pending appeal ofthe Daubert ruling. Defendants oppose the request for stay and areasking the Court to dismiss the class actions. Outside the US, there areseven class actions pending against the Group in Canada, along with a class action in Israel. Given the complex ownership and marketing of Zantac prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) medicine over many years, numerous claimsinvolve several defendants. As a result, some defendants have servedone another, including the Group, with notice of potential indemnification claims about possible liabilities connected particularly with Zantac OTC. Given the early stage of the proceedings, the Group cannotmeaningfully assess what liability, if any, it may have, nor can itmeaningfully assess the liability of other parties under relevantindemnification provisions. In addition, on 20 March 2020, the Department of Justice (DOJ) sent the Group notice of a civil investigation it had opened into allegations ofFalse Claims Act violations by the Group related to Zantac . On 18 June 2020, the DOJ served a Civil Investigative Demand on the Group,formalizing its request for documents. On the same day, the New MexicoAttorney General filed a lawsuit against multiple defendants, includingthe Group, alleging violations of state consumer protection and falseadvertising statutes, among other claims. Zofran The Group was a defendant in over 400 product liability cases involvingZofran pending in a Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) proceeding in the District of Massachusetts. The cases alleged that children suffered birthdefects due to their mothers' ingestion of Zofran and/or generic ondansetron for pregnancy- related nausea and vomiting. Plaintiffsasserted that the Group sold Zofran knowing it was unsafe for pregnant women, failed to warn of the risks and illegally marketed Zofran \"off-label\" for use by pregnant women. GSK Annual Report 2022 Notes to the financial statements continued 26747. Legal proceedings continued 48. Post balance sheet events There is no material post balance sheet event that requires an adjustment or a disclosure within the financial statements. On 1 June 2021, the MDL Court granted the Group's motion for summary judgment on federal pre-emption grounds. The Court found that the FDA was fully informed of all relevant safety informationregarding Zofran and had repeatedly rejected any attempt to add a birth defect warning to the label. At that time, the Court grantedjudgment for the Group in all cases pending in the MDL (approximately431 cases) and closed the MDL proceeding. Plaintiffs appealed thisdecision and, on 9 January 2023, the United States Court of Appealsfor the First Circuit affirmed the district court's decision in favour of the Group. There remains one state court case and four proposed class actions in Canada. Sales and marketing and regulation The Group's marketing and promotion of its Pharmaceutical andVaccine products are the subject of certain governmentalinvestigations and private lawsuits brought by litigants under varioustheories of law. GSK Korea - Proceedings under Fair Trade Laws In August 2020, GSK Korea was indicted under Korea's MonopolyRegulation and Fair Trade laws in relation to ( Cervarix ) and PCV ( Synflorix ) 2018 and 2019. The prosecutor alleged that GSK Korea, through the actions of at least oneof its employees, interfered with the tender process under the NationalImmunisation Programme by using \"straw bidders.\" A former GSK Korea employee was also charged in his individual capacity by the prosecutor in relation to the same matter. Further, anumber of wholesalers are co-defendants in the proceedings. On1 February 2023, the court rendered a guilty verdict in respect of alldefendants. GSK Korea was fined KRW 70 million which is approximately \u00a345,000. Appeal proceedings are ongoing. The Korea Fair Trade Commission also has commenced proceedings regarding the same matter. GSK Korea is cooperating with theauthorities on these matters. Anti-trust/competition Certain governmental actions and private lawsuits have been broughtagainst the Group alleging violation of competition or anti-trust laws.Lamictal Purported classes of direct purchasers filed suit in the US District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging that the Group and Teva Pharmaceuticals unlawfully conspired to delay generic competition forLamictal , resulting in overcharges to the purchasers, by entering into an allegedly anti-competitive reverse payment settlement to resolve patentinfringement litigation. A separate count accuses the Group ofmonopolising the market. On 13 December 2018, the trial judge granted plaintiffs' class certification motion, certifying a class of direct purchasers. The Groupfiled a Rule 23(f) motion in the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit,challenging the class certification decision. On 22 April 2020, the Courtof Appeals vacated the lower court's grant of class certification andremanded the issue back to the lower court for further analysis. On 9 October 2020, the district court heard argument on plaintiffs' renewed motion for class certification after remand. On 9 April 2021, thedistrict court denied Plaintiffs' motion for class certification of the putativedirect purchaser class, leaving a potential class of brand-onlypurchasers. Plaintiffs moved to supplement their expert report and seekadditional discovery to support the addition of certain generic purchasers. On 21 January 2022, the district court denied Plaintiffs' motion to supplement their expert report and seek additional discoveryand held that the issue of generic purchasers had already been decidedand denied in the court's ruling on decertification. The parties haveconducted briefing on class certification as to the remaining brand-onlypurchasers, with plaintiffs also seeking to add a smaller category ofpurchasers. On 1 February 2023, the district court denied Plaintiffs' renewed class certification motion. A follow-on complaint was filed in the US DistrictCourt for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on 2 February 2023 by agroup of alleged purchasers. Commercial and corporate The Group is involved in certain contractual and/or commercial disputes. Zejula Royalty Dispute In October 2012, Tesaro, Inc. (now a wholly owned subsidiary of GSK) entered into two worldwide patent license agreements with AstraZenecaUK Limited related to niraparib (later approved as Zejula ). In May 2021, AstraZeneca filed a lawsuit against Tesaro in the High Court, Englandand Wales alleging that Tesaro failed to pay some of the royalties dueunder the license agreements. Tesaro has counterclaimed based on acalculated overpayment. A trial is scheduled for March 2023.

Investments in subsidiary companies Investments in subsidiary companies are held at cost less any provisionfor impairment and also includes a capital contribution in relation tomovements in contingent consideration. Impairment of investments The carrying value of investments are reviewed for impairment when there is an indication that the investment might be impaired. One of the assessment methods used is to compare the carrying value of eachinvestment against its share of the net assets value of the investment oragainst its share of the valuation of the subsidiary based on expecteddiscounted cash flows. The total amount of investments is alsoevaluated against the Group's valuation on the basis of overall marketcapitalisation. Any impairment charge is recognised in the incomestatement in the year concerned. Assets held for sale/distribution Non-current assets are held for disposal/demerger only if available forimmediate disposal/demerger in their present condition, adisposal/demerger is highly probable and expected to be completedwithin one year from the date of classification. Such assets aremeasured at the lower of carrying value and fair value less the cost ofdisposal. Share-based payments The issuance by the company to its subsidiaries of a grant over thecompany's shares, represents additional capital contributions by thecompany in its subsidiaries. An additional investment in subsidiariesresults in a corresponding increase in shareholders' equity. Theadditional capital contribution is based on the fair value of the grantissued, allocated over the underlying grant's vesting period.

GSK Annual Report 2022 Principal risks and uncertainties 285 Patient safety We outline below the principal risks and uncertainties relevant to GSK's business, financial condition and operations that may affect our performance and ability to achieve our objectives. These are the risksthat we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially fromexpected and historical results. Operating in the biopharmaceutical sector carries various inherent risks and uncertainties that may affect our business. We must comply with a broad range of laws and regulations which apply to the research and development, manufacturing, testing,approval, distribution, sales, and marketing of pharmaceutical and vaccine products. These affect the cost of product development, the time required to reach the market and the likelihood of doing sosuccessfully on an uninterrupted basis. As rules and regulations change, government interpretation evolves, and our business activities develop, the nature of a particular risk may also alter. Changes to regulatory regimes may be substantial. Any alteration in, and failure to comply with, applicable laws andregulations could materially and adversely affect our financial results. Similarly, our global business exposes us to litigation and government investigations, including product liability litigation, patent and antitrust litigation and sales and marketing litigation. Litigation and government investigations, and the related provisions we may make forunfavourable outcomes and increases in related costs such asinsurance premiums, could also materially and adversely affect ourfinancial results.More detail on the status and various uncertainties in our significant unresolved disputes and potential litigation is set out in Note 47, 'Legal proceedings.' More details regarding our risk management framework and how we identify our principal risks can be found on pages 51 to 54 andincorporated herein. Other risks, not at the level of principal risk, and opportunities, related to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG), including environmental sustainability and climate change, are managedthrough our six focus areas, as described in our ESG PerformanceReport. Additional information on climate related risk management is inour climate related financial disclosure. See pages 55 to 62. UK regulations require a description of principal risks and uncertainties and explanation of how these are being managed or mitigated. Below isa description of each of our principal risks together with a summary ofhow we manage each risk across our businesses. They are not listed inorder of significance and are consistent with the principal risks detailedon pages 53 to 54. In July 2022, the Board agreed that Separation wasno longer a principal risk following the successful demerger and analysisof any residual risk. Risk definition The risk that GSK, including our third parties, potentially fails toappropriately collect, review, follow up, or report human safetyinformation, including adverse events, from all potential sources or thatGSK potentially fails to act on any relevant findings in a timely manner. Risk impact GSK will not tolerate an unfavourable benefit-to-risk profile for patients who use our products. As the most important consequence of ineffective pharmacovigilance is the potential for harm to patients, wemaintain robust processes for managing human safety information,conducting timely safety signal detection, and ensuring appropriatemeasures are in place to manage risks to patients. GSK also intendsto fully comply with pharmacovigilance and other relevant regulationsworldwide. Non-compliance could result in inspection findings,regulatory scrutiny, civil or criminal sanctions and either temporary or permanent loss of product marketing authorisation. We regularly review and respond to all patient safety risks to limit the potential forreputational damage, loss of trust by patients and healthcareproviders, product-related litigation, and loss of shareholderconfidence.Context We are fully accountable for safeguarding patients; our failure to do soeffectively could result most importantly in harm to patients, as well asreputational damage and/or product liability litigation. We conductinternal safety surveillance and rely on access to safety information fromexternal sources. Information on the safety and efficacy of our productsin humans is collected during clinical development, with morecomprehensive information incorporated from real-world use once ourproducts are marketed. There are examples of regulatory agencies using real-world evidence from sources which may not be accessible to the industry to supplement and validate the evidence we use to supportthe safety and efficacy of our products. There is a potential emergingrisk that technology companies or other data custodians may similarlydraw and communicate conclusions about the safety of our productsbased on digital health data collected through their platforms that isinaccessible by either the industry or regulatory agencies. GSK Annual Report 2022 Principal risks and uncertainties continued 286Patient safety continued Product quality Our licence to operate depends on our compliance with regulatory requirements worldwide, not only those directly related to patient safety but extending to privacy and information security regulations aswell. Regulatory compliance depends on appropriate identification andmanagement of human safety information by all employees and thirdparties acting on our behalf. We are pursuing innovative solutions toenhance our ability to perform pharmacovigilance, including ArtificialIntelligence and Machine Learning technology to augment our capacityto manage increasing volumes of adverse event reports from varied sources, and advancing technical solutions for delivering safety information and risk minimisation measures to patients and health careproviders. The COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on pharmacovigilance activities by increasing public focus on safety and efficacy of medicines and vaccines, highlighting the importance of robust business continuity planning for uninterrupted safety oversight and regulatory compliance(including the ability to accommodate remote regulatory inspections),and accelerating automation to manage increasing volumes of adverseevents. Mitigating activities Our Chief Medical Officer is accountable for the Patient Safety enterprise risk and human safety matters, in collaboration with the Head of Global Safety. A cross-enterprise safety governance boardoversees implementation of our control framework, including riskmanagement. Our Global Safety Board ensures that we addresshuman safety proactively throughout a product's lifecycle. Our globalpolicy on management of human safety information requires that allemployees immediately report issues relating to the safety of ourproducts. Our Third Party Oversight framework ensures that third parties who may encounter human safety information are identified and trained appropriately. We manage safety information for all products and fromall sources in compliance with global regulations. This information allowsus to detect safety signals for our products and take timely action oninformation that changes a product's risk/benefit profile. Any actions are discussed beforehand with regulatory authorities, and can include updating the prescribing information, communicating withhealthcare providers, restricting product prescribing/availability to helpassure safe use, and carrying out further clinical trials. In certain cases,it may be appropriate to stop clinical trials or to withdraw a product (or aspecific batch) from the market. In 2022, we completed the simplification and optimisation of our core patient safety processes, which we expect to improve cross-functionalstakeholder engagement in safety activities across GSK. We beganautomated end-to-end processing of individual case safety reports todeliver better case quality and consistency as well as enhancedefficiency. Our Pharmacovigilance Operations model expanded toensure connectivity between central and local safety teams. We have created resources for R&D leaders that enable them to advocate the need for industry access to safety data from all sources as the best wayto safeguard patients. In 2023, we will transition from a two-vendor to asingle-vendor model for key operational activities which will improveefficiency and reduce the risk of regulatory non-compliance. We will alsoexpand our Global Safety team to include additional expertise tooptimise our strategy and approach to product-related risk mitigation/minimisation. Risk definition The risk that GSK or our third parties potentially fail to ensureappropriate controls and governance of quality for development andcommercial products; compliance with industry practices andregulations in manufacturing and distribution activities; and terms ofGSK product licenses and supporting regulatory activities. Risk impact A failure to ensure product quality could have far-reaching implicationsfor patient safety, cause product launch delays, drug shortages orproduct recalls, and have regulatory, legal, and financialconsequences. These could materially and adversely affect GSK's reputation and financial results.Context The external environment for product quality remains challenging, with increased cyber-attacks and data breaches across the industry. Cyber-attacks remain a key risk to the integrity of product quality data and itsaudit trail. We met our commitments for the 2021 European MedicinesAgency (EMA) requirements for licensing of Medical Devices. Wecontinue to plan for the deployment of the New Annex 1 guidance for themanufacture of Sterile Medicinal products which was published inSeptember 2022 and sets an expectation for compliance by August 2023. We are actively managing this implementation in the context of global equipment and component supply chain constraints effecting theindustry. We are increasingly applying advanced digital technologies andinsights to drive scientific excellence to enhance the development,manufacture and testing of our products. For example, we use newelectronic documentation systems and advanced laboratory informationmanagement tools. Our quality organisations are aligned to make surequality procedures and governance can facilitate the new companystrategy. Pre-pandemic levels of on-site inspections have resumed, and we continue to take steps to ensure our inspection readiness. GSK Annual Report 2022 Principal risks and uncertainties continued 287Product quality continued Financial controls and reporting Mitigating activities We align an extensive global network of quality and compliance professionals, from site-level to senior management within each business unit to provide oversight and assist with the delivery of quality performance and operational compliance. We deliver this managementoversight through a hierarchy of quality councils, an independent chiefproduct quality officer and a global product quality office that overseesproduct quality risk across the company. We have developed andimplemented a single quality management system that defines thequality standards and systems for our businesses associated with thedevelopment and commercialisation of our vaccines, specialty, and general medicines. A consolidation of regulatory requirements from markets across the world augments this system, which means it meetsexternal expectations for product quality in the markets we supply. Oursystem is based on the internationally recognised principles from theICH Q10 pharmaceutical quality system framework. We routinely update our quality management system (QMS), so it keeps pace with the evolving external regulatory environment and newscientific understanding of our products and processes. We have alsomade our policies and procedures simpler to understand andimplement and adopted innovative tools to make them more user-friendly. We regularly train staff in regulatory expectations andlearnings from inspections and existing procedures so they canmaintain Current Good Manufacturing Practice standards.We have implemented a risk-based approach to assessing and managing third party suppliers that provide materials used in ourfinished products. We expect contract manufacturers that make ourproducts to comply with GSK standards and regularly conduct audits toprovide us with assurance that they do. We have product incidentcommittee processes in place to investigate product issues and makerecommendations on remediation activities including, where necessary, the recall of medicines and vaccines to protect our patients and the public. Our established complaint process ensures we respond appropriately to product quality issues raised by patients. Independent functions review and triage allegations of noncompliance or misconduct received through formal and informal 'Speak Up' channels. Global disciplinary andenforcement procedures apply to any breaches of our standards, andare initiated, as appropriate, following investigations. We use key riskindicators to support risk management activities and provide GSK'sLeadership Team and Risk Oversight and Compliance Council with anintegrated assessment of product quality performance. We havecompleted all product assessments for the presence of nitrosaminesand reported as necessary to all Health Authorities. We have also developed mitigation plans which will be executed throughout 2023 per the regulatory requirements. We are actively working with industrybodies and the European Regulatory Authorities to complete the safetyevaluation of Titanium Dioxide in Medicines as well as identifying anypotential substitutes. Risk definition The risk that GSK fails to comply with current tax laws, fails to reportaccurate financial information in compliance with accounting standardsand applicable legislation, or incurs significant losses due to treasuryactivities. Risk impact Non-compliance with existing or new financial or new ESG reportingand disclosure requirements, or changes to the recognition of incomeand expenses, could expose GSK to litigation and regulatory actionand could materially and adversely affect our financial results. Failureto comply with changes in the substance or application of the lawsgoverning transfer pricing, dividends, tax credits and intellectual property could also materially and adversely affect our financial results. Failure to comply with applicable sanctions laws and regulations couldresult in GSK being investigated by relevant government agencies andauthorities and/or in legal proceedings against us. Governmentinvestigations and litigation, can be unpredictable and regardless oftheir outcome, may be costly, require significant managementattention, and damage our reputation. Inconsistent application oftreasury policies, transactional or settlement errors, or counterpartydefaults could lead to significant losses.Context We are required by the laws of various jurisdictions to publicly discloseour financial results and events that could materially affect the Group'sfinancial results. Regulators routinely review the financial statements oflisted companies for compliance with new, revised, or existingaccounting and regulatory requirements. We believe that we comply with the appropriate regulatory requirements concerning our financial statements and the disclosure of material information, including anytransactions relating to business restructuring such as acquisitions anddivestitures. However, should we be subject to an investigation intopotential non-compliance with accounting and disclosure requirements,this could lead to restatements of previously reported results andsignificant penalties. Our Treasury group deals daily in high value transactions, mostly foreign exchange, and cash management transactions. These transactionsinvolve market volatility and counterparty risk. The Group's effective taxrate reflects the locations of our activities and the value they generate,which determine the jurisdictions in which profits arise and theapplicable tax rates. GSK Annual Report 2022 Principal risks and uncertainties continued 288Financial controls and reporting continued These may be higher or lower than the UK statutory rate and may reflect regimes that encourage innovation and investment in R&D byproviding tax incentives which, if changed, could affect GSK's tax rate.In addition, the worldwide nature of our operations means that ourcross-border supply routes, necessary to ensure supplies of medicinesand vaccines, can result in conflicting claims from tax authorities as tothe profits to be taxed in individual countries. This can lead to double taxation, with profits taxed in more than one country. The complexity of tax regulations also means that we may occasionally disagree with taxauthorities on the technical interpretation of a particular area of tax law.The tax charge included in our financial statements is our bestestimate of tax liability pending any audits by tax authorities. Weexpect there to be a continued focus on tax reform, driven by initiativesby the OECD and the EC to address the tax challenges arising fromdigitalisation of the economy. Together with domestic initiatives around the world, these may result in significant changes to established tax principles and an increase in tax authority disputes. Regardless of theirmerit or outcomes, these may be costly, divert management attentionand adversely impact our reputation and relationship with keystakeholders. Laws, regulations, orders and other measures restrictdealings with certain countries, governments, government officials,entities, individuals, use of financial institutions and movement offunds. Circumvention of sanctions and export controls can be a criminal offence and GSK seeks to comply with its sanctions obligations. While we believe the Group complies with all applicablesanctions in all material respects, such laws are complex and continueto evolve rapidly. Mitigating activities We keep up to date with the latest developments in financial reportingrequirements by reviewing updates from regulators, working with our external auditor and legal advisors and performing and responding to emerging risks. Financial results are reviewed and approved byregional management, before being reviewed by GSK's GroupFinancial Controller and Chief Financial Officer (CFO). This allows ourFinancial Controller and CFO to assess the evolution of the businessover time, and to evaluate its performance to plan. Significantjudgements are reviewed and confirmed by senior management. Weintegrate technical or organisational transformation, newly acquired activities and external risks into our risk assessments and apply appropriate controls and reviews. We maintain a control environmentdesigned to identify material errors in financial reporting anddisclosure. We have a standardised global financial reporting operatingmodel. The design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls are regularly reviewed by management and tested by externalthird parties. The few locations which are not on the standard modelapply a minimum standard set of controls which are reviewed bymanagement and monitored independently. This gives us assurancethat controls over key financial reporting and disclosure processes areoperating effectively. Our Global Finance Risk Management andControls (FRMC) group provides extra support during significanttransformations, such as system deployment or management/ structural reorganisations. We add operational resources and adapt programme timelines to ensure processes and controls are maintainedduring significant changes.The Disclosure Committee, reporting to the Board, reviews GSK's quarterly results and annual report. Throughout the year, in consultationwith its legal advisors, the Disclosure Committee also determineswhether it is necessary to disclose publicly information about the Groupthrough stock exchange announcements. The Treasury ManagementGroup meets regularly to ensure that liquidity, interest rate, counterparty,foreign currency transaction and foreign currency translation risks are all managed in line with the prudent approach detailed in the risk strategies and policies adopted by our Board. Counterparty exposure is subject to defined limits approved by the Board for both credit rating and individual counterparties. The Middle Office within Treasury monitor the management of counterparty risk in line with agreed policy with oversight from a corporate complianceofficer, operating independently of Treasury. Further details on mitigationof Treasury risks can be found on pages 246 to 248. We manage taxrisk through robust internal policies, processes, training, and complianceprogrammes. We maintain open and constructive relationships with tax authorities worldwide. We monitor government debate on tax policy in our keyjurisdictions, so that we can understand any potential future changes intax law and share an informed point of view. Where relevant, we providepragmatic and constructive business input to tax policy makers, eitherdirectly or through industry trade bodies. This includes advocatingreform to support economic growth and job creation, as well as theneeds of our patients and other key stakeholders. Our tax affairs are managed on a global basis by a team of tax professionals, led by the Global Head of Tax, who work closely with the business on a day-to-daybasis. The Global Tax team is suitably qualified for the roles theyperform, and we support their training needs so they can provide up todate technical advice in line with their responsibilities. We submit taxreturns according to statutory time limits and engage proactively with taxauthorities to ensure our tax affairs are current, entering into continuousaudit programmes and advance pricing agreements where appropriate. These arrangements provide long-term certainty for both tax authorities and GSK over the tax treatment of our business, based on fulldisclosure of all relevant facts. We seek to resolve any differences ofinterpretation in tax legislation with tax authorities in a cooperativemanner. In exceptional cases, we may have to resolve disputes throughformal proceedings. GSK is committed to complying with all applicablesanctions, laws and regulations, and has deployed a programme toenable management of sanctions risk. The programme, jointly led byGSK Finance and Legal & Compliance, is made up of various systems and controls including, but not limited to, policies and procedures, training and awareness, screening, monitoring and risk reporting. GSK Annual Report 2022 Principal risks and uncertainties continued 289 Anti-bribery and corruption (ABAC) Risk definition The risk that GSK or our third parties potentially fail to comply with applicable laws, regulations, or internal requirements and to ensureappropriate controls and governance over bribery and corruption inbusiness activities. Risk impact Failure to mitigate this risk could expose GSK and associated personsto governmental investigation, regulatory action, and civil and criminalliability. It may compromise GSK's ability to supply its products undercertain government contracts. In addition, failure to prevent bribery orcorruption could have substantial implications for GSK's reputation andthe credibility of senior leaders. It might erode investor confidence inour governance, risk management and future performance, and have aconsequential negative impact on share performance. It could also lead to the imposition of significant financial penalties and the imposition of additional reporting obligations. Context There continues to be a strong enforcement appetite for foreign briberyinvestigations and prosecutions, with a particular focus on the conductof multinational companies wherever they operate. Financial penaltieshanded down in proven corruption cases are often very significant. Disruption to global supply chains and the commercial pressures caused by higher than usual inflation rates are likely to increase therisks of bribery and corruption in certain contexts. However, greater transparency and collaboration among enforcement authorities, advances in technology and the use of data analytics areproviding better platforms to streamline processes and detect potentialissues. Mitigating activities We have an enterprise-wide ABAC programme designed to ensurecompliance with applicable laws and regulations prohibiting briberyand corruption and related offences. It builds on our businessstandards and culture to form a comprehensive and practical approachto compliance that responds to the evolving nature of our business.GSK's ABAC Governance Board oversees and provides programmegovernance and enterprise risk management which includesrepresentation from key functional areas. We continue to enhance our controls around third-party engagements to ensure that they are sufficient to meet evolving and emerging risks. We plan to continue with pre- and post-transaction ABAC due diligence, and to increase the capabilities in the organisation aroundthe onboarding, continual monitoring and management of third parties. We continue to assess and understand our money laundering riskexposure and mitigate any existing risk. Our Code of Conduct, culture, and commitment to zero tolerance towards bribery and corruption are integral to how we mitigate this risk.In light of the complexity and geographic breadth of the risk, weconstantly evolve our oversight of activities and data, reinforce to ourworkforce GSK's clear expectations regarding acceptable behaviours,and maintain regular communications with local markets. We built our ABAC programme based on best-in-class principles to help us manage risk from the top down and the bottom up. For example, theprogramme includes senior-level commitment from our Board andleadership, and a data analytics programme to create and embed localkey risk indicators to enable targeted intervention and risk management activities. We continue to actively consider improvements to the programme. The ABAC programme is underpinned by our global ABAC policy and other written standards and controls which address the businessactivities that give rise to bribery and corruption risks and establish due diligence requirements for the engagement of third parties. The programme also mandates enhanced controls over interactions withgovernment officials and during business development transactions. Wehave a dedicated team responsible for the programme's implementationand evolution. The ABAC team works with other groups across theorganisation to address and improve controls and monitoringrequirements. Audit & Assurance and independent business monitoringteams complement the ABAC team's work and provide added assurance. We use issues found during oversight and assurance exercises and investigations to identify areas for specific intervention in our marketsand to drive the continuous improvement of the programme. We provide mandatory ABAC training at least annually to employees and relevant third parties differentiated according to seniority, roles andresponsibilities, and geographic location. Formal and informal 'Speak Up' channels are available to report misconduct or non-compliance. The central investigations team reviewsand triages allegations of non-compliance and triggers investigation asappropriate. GSK Annual Report 2022 Principal risks and uncertainties continued 290 Commercial practices Risk definition The risk that GSK or our third parties potentially engage in commercial activities that fail to comply with laws, regulations, industry codes, andinternal controls and requirements. Risk impact Failure to engage in activities that are consistent with the letter and spirit of the law, industry regulations, or the Group's requirements relating to sales and promotion of medicines and vaccines; withappropriate interactions with healthcare professionals (HCPs),organisations and patients; with legitimate and transparent transfers ofvalue; and with pricing and competition (or antitrust) regulations incommercial practices, including trade channel activities and businesstendering, could materially and adversely affect our ability to deliverour strategy and long-term priorities. Additionally, it may result in incomplete awareness of the risk/benefit profile of our products and possibly suboptimal treatment of patients and consumers;governmental investigation, regulatory action and legal proceedingsbrought against the Group by governmental and private plaintiffs whichcould result in government sanctions, and criminal and/or financialpenalties. Any practices that are found to be misaligned with ourvalues and expectations could also result in reputational harm anddilute the trust established with external stakeholders. Context We operate in a highly regulated and extremely competitive biopharmaindustry, amongst peers who make significant product innovations andtechnical advances and intensify price competition. Additional externalfactors impacting our business operations include the ongoing effectsof the COVID-19 global pandemic, access limitations to our customers,macroeconomic inflationary dynamics, and pricing pressure across markets. To achieve our strategic objectives, we must continue to develop commercially viable new products and deliver additional usesfor existing products that address the needs of patients, consumers,HCPs and payers. Financially, new products/indications carry withthem an uncertainty with regards to future success. Productdevelopment is costly, lengthy, and uncertain, and carries with it thepotential for failure at any stage. Even after successful productdevelopment, we face challenges in how we launch, and ourcompetitors' products or pricing strategies could render our assets less competitive. We support product innovation through our continued focus on both in-person and virtual engagement, with a constant focuson our patient. Once we have an approved medicine or vaccine, it is our obligation to provide important information to the healthcare community in various ways, always in a responsible, legal, and ethical manner. Appropriate product promotion ensures HCPs have access to the information theyneed, that patients and consumers have the facts about the medicinesand vaccines they require, and that products are prescribed,recommended, or used in a manner that provides healthcare benefit.We are committed to the ethical and responsible commercialisation ofour products in support of our purpose to improve the quality of humanlife and get ahead of disease together.Mitigating activities To achieve our strategic objectives, we must meet price expectations ofpayers, HCPs, consumers, and the community. Our culture provides aguide for how we lead and make decisions. We constantly strive to dothe right thing and deliver quality medicines and vaccines and sustainreliable supply to meet customer needs. In doing so, we seek to ensureour actions reflect GSK's values, behaviours, and purpose. Weunderstand the impact of data on our industry and strive to become an organisation that makes data-driven decisions; this approach is aligned to our efforts to become more agile and work at pace. GSK has acted toenhance and improve our policies and standards, application of dataanalytics and our channel activities. We have evolved policies andstandards incrementally to ensure that commercial activities that weundertake or are conducted on our behalf are executed within ourestablished governance. We train employees on relevant informationwith a focus on interactive learning and elements of behavioural science. All our commercial activities worldwide must conform to high ethical, regulatory, and industry standards. Where local standards differfrom global ones, we apply those that are most stringent. Where thestandards of an acquired company or joint venture partner differ fromour global standards, we remediate legacy policies and implementrevisions, so they align. Our businesses continue to use our internal control framework to support the assessment and management of risks. Business unit riskmanagement and compliance boards, which manage risks across globaland in-country business activities, oversee commercial activities andtheir monitoring programmes. All promotional materials and activitiesmust be reviewed and approved according to our policies and standardsand conducted in accordance with local laws and regulations; theserequirements seek to ensure that such materials and activities fairly represent the Group's products or services. Where necessary, in the event of misconduct, we have disciplined employees, up to andincluding termination of contract, and clawed back remuneration fromsenior management. We have continued to evolve our incentiveprogramme for sales representatives to better recognise and rewardindividual effort. In nearly all markets, the capped variable pay elementof representatives' compensation is evaluated on the basis of individualsales targets. We allow fair-market value payments to be made by GSK to expert practitioners to speak about our innovative medicines and vaccinesduring a restricted period in a product's lifecycle, or when new andcompetitive data is published. To support this, we have rolled out aglobal end-to-end process across GSK in 2022 to drive consistent ways of working and efficiencies and strengthen controls through automation and use of data. Where permitted we report payments to individualHCPs as part of our commitment to transparency and responsibledisclosure. GSK Annual Report 2022 Principal risks and uncertainties continued 291 Scientific and patient engagement Data ethics and privacy Risk definition The risk that GSK or our third parties potentially fail to engage externally to gain insights, educate and communicate on the science ofour medicines and associated disease areas, and provide grants anddonations in a legitimate and transparent manner compliant with laws,regulations, industry codes and internal controls and requirements. Risk impact Without controls in place, the risk could result in real, perceived, ordisguised promotion including off-label and prior-authorisationpromotion, and real or perceived provision of medical advice. This inturn could lead to criminal investigations and penalties, civil litigation,or competitor complaints. At the same time, if we do not engage fullyand appropriately, this could result in patient harm, failure to advancescience and innovation, reputational damage, and financial loss. Such consequences may reduce the trust of the public, patients, healthcare professionals, payers, regulators, and governments. Context Scientific and patient engagements are diverse non-promotionalactivities directed at healthcare professionals, patients, payers, andexternal stakeholders. Such engagements aim to improve patient carethrough the exchange or provision of knowledge on the use of our products and related diseases. Scientific and patient engagement with external stakeholder groups is vital to GSK, as a research-basedbiopharma company that is ambitious for patients and is necessary toadvance science and medicine.We expect our activities to be scientifically sound and accurate, conducted ethically and transparently, and compliant with applicablecodes, laws, and regulations. There are many industry and local codes and laws and other regulations that apply (such as Privacy, Data integrity). That means measured risk-taking, rooted in sound ethicalconsiderations, and principles-based decision-making, training,communication, and monitoring of such activities are key to managingthe risk and enabling full and appropriate engagement. Mitigating activities Our Chief Medical Officer (CMO) oversees all non-promotional scientificand patient engagement as enterprise risk owner. The GSK Code ofPractice is the key internal policy for non-promotional engagementactivities. These activities include scientific interactions, support formedical education, advice seeking, gathering insights on unmet needsof patients, scientific communication of our research, and diseaseawareness. Since the COVID-19 pandemic we have seen a continued increase in virtual engagements (e.g. with external experts, advisory boards, patientadvocacy, patient engagements and scientific congresses). We furtherdeveloped and modernised our digital approach to HCPs, our patientengagement framework and insight-gathering, and applied our internalprinciples and policies to this rapidly changing and growing environment. We continuously improve our internal controls and networks to identify emerging risks early and to support staff to conduct activities incompliance with GSK's culture and policies, local laws, and regulations,while building effective risk management and management monitoringsystems. Risk definition The risk that GSK or our third parties potentially fail to ethically collect;use; re-use through artificial intelligence, data analytics or automation; secure; share and destroy personal information in accordance with laws, regulations, and internal controls and requirements. Risk impact Non-compliance with data privacy laws globally could lead to harm toindividuals and GSK. It could also damage trust between GSK andindividuals, communities, business partners and governmentauthorities. Many countries have increased the enforcement powers of their data protection authorities by allowing them to impose significant fines, impact cross-border data flows, or temporarily ban dataprocessing. Many new national laws also enable individuals to bringcollective legal actions against companies such as GSK for failure tofollow data privacy laws.Context Data protection and privacy legislation is diverse, with limited globalharmonisation or simplification. It is challenging for multinationals to standardise their approach to compliance with data privacy laws. Governments are enforcing compliance with data protection and privacylaws more rigorously. The approach and focus of data protection andprivacy regulators also differs between regions and countries, whichfurther creates challenges for global organisations seeking to implementa single harmonised global privacy programme. Increases in the volume of data processed and advances in technology have resulted in a greater focus on data governance and the ethical useof personal information, over and above compliance with data privacylaws. Companies seeking to foster innovation in artificial intelligence andother new technologies are faced with evolving decisions from globalpolicymakers on how best to promote trust in these systems and avoidunintended outcomes or harmful impacts. GSK Annual Report 2022 Principal risks and uncertainties continued 292Data ethics and privacy continued Research practices Additionally, there are a number of emerging laws concerning the localisation of data, restrictions on international transfers and datasecurity, which are changing existing frameworks that GSK haspreviously relied upon. This increasing trend for data sovereigntyaffects our ability to drive medical innovation and to effectively operateinternationally. Mitigating activities Our General Counsel is GSK's Enterprise Risk Owner (ERO), andchairs our Privacy Governance Board, which oversees GSK's overalldata privacy operating model. Each GSK business area has appointeda risk owner accountable for overseeing its privacy risks, supported byprivacy leaders within their business. In countries where local dataprivacy laws require appointment of a Data Protection Officer (DPO), GSK has made such appointments, including an EU DPO. As a result of GSK's focus on technology, data-driven science, use of artificial intelligence/machine learning and evolving global datastrategy, we have sought to address the key risks by creating a newteam with Group Legal and Compliance responsible for advising on global digital privacy and cybersecurity strategy. The ERO has appointed a Head of Digital, Privacy and Cybersecurity (Head of DPC),who has day-to-day accountability for designing and implementing thecontrol framework.The Head of DPC leads a global, cross-functional core team of digital- and privacy-qualified attorneys and privacy compliance professionals,supported by a network of privacy leaders within businessunits/functions, privacy contracts locally, and the wider Legal andCompliance team. GSK has a global privacy framework based on theEU General Data Protection Regulation, which is deployed in everymarket based on factors including the robustness of local privacy legislation, established data protection authorities, and GSK's footprint. Beyond those countries, we are deploying a proportionate controlframework to set up minimum privacy standards irrespective of anyapplicable legislation. Our core team is responsible for: - operating and improving the centralised global privacy control framework - continuously assessing and providing relevant and proportionate controls and aid to non-deployed markets - monitoring new, or changing, laws and adapting the privacy framework accordingly - deploying a comprehensive training programme to drive greater awareness and accountability for managing personal informationacross the entire organisation We certify key GSK privacy network roles have sufficient training and experience to carry out their roles effectively. We continuously improve our processes, such as issue identification, reporting and handling,through monitoring. Our core team works with the business to ensurewe build in privacy controls into all existing and new business initiatives,as well as ensuring we meet our accountability obligations inaccordance with global data protection and privacy laws. Risk definition The risk that GSK or our third parties potentially fail to adequatelyconduct ethical and credible pre-clinical and clinical research,collaborate in research activities compliant with laws, regulations, andinternal controls and requirements. Risk impact The potential impacts of the risk include harm to human subjects,reputational damage, failure to obtain the necessary regulatoryapprovals for our products, governmental investigation, legalproceedings brought against the GSK by governmental and privateplaintiffs (product liability suits and claims for damages), loss of revenue due to inadequate patent protection or inability to supply our products, and regulatory action such as fines, penalties, or loss ofproduct authorisation. Poor data integrity and governance couldcompromise GSK's R&D efforts and negatively impact our reputation.Any of these could materially and adversely affect our financial resultsand damage the trust of patients and customers.Context Research involving animals can raise ethical concerns. In many cases,however, research involving animals is the only way to investigate theeffects of a potential new medicine in a living body other than inhumans. Animal research provides critical information about the causes and mechanisms of diseases and therefore remains a vital part of our research. We continually seek ways in which we can minimise our useof animals in research, development, and testing, while complying withregulatory requirements and reducing the impact on the animals used.Human subject research is critical to assessing and demonstrating thesafety and efficacy of our investigational products or further evaluatingour products once they have been approved. This research includesclinical trials in healthy volunteers and patients and adheres to regulations and high ethical, medical, and scientific standards. We disclose the results of this research externally regardless of whetherthey reflect positively or negatively on our products, so that the scientificcommunity can learn from the outcomes of our research. We also workwith human biological samples which are fundamental to the discovery,development, and safety monitoring of our products. GSK Annual Report 2022 Principal risks and uncertainties continued 293Research practices continued Environment, health, and safety (EHS) We are committed to managing human biological samples in accordance with relevant laws, regulations, and ethical principles, and in a manner that respects the interests of sample donors. Data ispivotal to our R&D strategy, and we are maximising the use of data toserve patients. Governing our data in accordance with relevant laws,regulations, contractual obligations, expectations, and our cultureacross privacy, information security, and data integrity is essential. We use a wide variety of biological materials in the discovery, research, and development of our assets. Through the Convention onBiological Diversity (CBD) and the Nagoya Protocol, the internationalcommunity has established a global framework regulating access to,and use of, genetic resources of non-human origin in research anddevelopment. We support the principles of access to, andbenefit-sharing of, genetic resources as outlined in the CBD and the Nagoya Protocol. We also recognise the importance of appropriate, effective, and proportionate implementation measures at national andregional levels. Mitigating activities The Research Practices risk is overseen by an enterprise frameworkthat seeks to strengthen governance across R&D. Under theleadership of the Research Practices Enterprise Risk Owner, management of the risk takes a pragmatic approach to information sharing, streamlining risk identification and escalation while ensuringownership of risk mitigation stays with the business.We have an established Office of Animal Welfare, Ethics and Strategy and Risk (OAWESR), led by our Chief Veterinary Officer, which supports the humane and responsible care of animals, carries out ethical reviewsand independent scientific reviews of animal studies, and sharesknowledge and advocates for the application of non-animal alternatives.The OAWESR provides a framework of animal welfare governance;defines and provides oversight for training in animal care; promotes thereplacement, refinement and reduction of animal research; conductsquality assessments; manages a programme of external animal diligence; and develops and deploys strategies for reproducing experiments and translating them to human clinical end points. Ensuringwe implement and maintain proper data governance controls remains animportant priority, especially as our scientific strategy is evolving to takeadvantage of the breadth of our data (for example: genomics andartificial intelligence and machine learning). We focus on building dataintegrity, privacy and usage controls into our internal control framework.Quality assurance teams conduct audits to provide independentbusiness monitoring of our internal controls. Our R&D organisation maintains and controls pre-publication procedures to guard against public disclosure before patent applications are filed. In addition,because a lack of data integrity in preparing patent application data andinformation can lead to a loss of patent protection, legal expertscollaborate with R&D to support the review process for new patentapplications. Our R&D organisation also collaborates with legal expertsthroughout the development of our assets to take account of anyrelevant third-party patent rights. Risk definition The risk that GSK or our third parties potentially fail to ensureappropriate controls and governance of the organization's assets,facilities, infrastructure, and business activities, including execution ofhazardous activities, handling of hazardous materials, or release ofsubstances harmful to the environment that disrupts supply or harmsemployees, third parties or the environment. Risk impact Failure to manage EHS risks could lead to significant harm to people,the environment and the communities in which we operate, fines,inability to meet stakeholder expectations and regulatory requirements,litigation or regulatory action, and damage to the company's reputation,which could materially and adversely affect our financial results. Context GSK is subject to the health, safety and environmental laws of variousjurisdictions. These laws impose duties to protect people, theenvironment and the communities in which we operate.Mitigating activities The GSK Leadership Team is responsible for EHS governance and riskoversight. They ensure there is an effective control framework 'in-place'and 'in-use' to manage the EHS risks, impacts, and legal complianceissues in each of our businesses. This includes assigning responsibilityto senior managers for providing and maintaining our controls and forensuring that tiered monitoring and governance processes are in placewithin their business units. Function leaders ensure that the EHS control framework is implemented effectively in their respective business area, that it is compliant with applicable laws and regulations, and that it isadequately resourced, maintained, communicated, and monitored.Every employee and qualified contractor acting on behalf of GSK ispersonally responsible for ensuring that they follow all applicable localstandard operating procedures. Our risk-based, proactive approach isarticulated in our global EHS policy and detailed in our global EHSstandards, against which we audit all our operations to ensure compliance. We ensure hazards are appropriately controlled through the design of facilities, equipment and systems. These rigorous procedures,when applied correctly, put effective barriers in place to protectemployees' health and safety. In 2020 we created a safety improvementplan, focusing on Life Saving Rules, Safety Leadership and WarehouseSafety. All significant milestones for these programmes were delivered in2022 according to plan. Our Safety Leadership Experience andwarehouse improvements will continue implementation into 2023. GSK Annual Report 2022 Principal risks and uncertainties continued 294 Information security Risk definition The risk that GSK or our third parties potentially fail to ensure appropriate controls and governance over unauthorised access,disclosure, theft, unavailability or corruption of GSK's information, keysystems or technology infrastructure. Risk impact Failure to adequately protect our information and systems may causeharm to our patients, workforce and customers, disruption to ourbusiness and/or loss of commercial or strategic advantage, regulatorysanction or damage to our reputation. Context The external environment continues to be extremely challenging, making it hard to keep pace with increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. This is due to many factors including increased geopoliticalconflict and digital nationalism, rising frequency and severity of databreaches and growing capability and sophistication of bad actors andcyber criminals. GSK's business relies on operating a highly connectedinformation network of internal and external systems, which holdconfidential research and development, manufacturing, commercial,workforce and financial data. This means that our systems andinformation have been and will continue to be the target of cyberattacks. Acceleration in the use of digital, data and analytics and cloud computing capabilities to drive GSK's pipeline and performancerequires us to continuously adapt and strengthen our controls anddefensive capabilities. GSK also relies on third-party contractors,partners and suppliers who face similar cyber threats and thiscontinues to be a vector of risk to manage as well.Mitigating activities Cyber Security Office and Cyber Maturity Programme GSK has a Cyber Security Office and our Chief Information SecurityOfficer is responsible for identifying and putting in place measures tohelp GSK mitigate and manage cyber security risks. This includes activemonitoring and initiating remediation or other actions in response tocyber security intelligence and threats, while also enhancing ourcapabilities through an ongoing programme of investment in people,process and technology to improve our ability to prevent, detect,respond and recover from any cyber security incidents. A risk based Third-party security risk management program is also in place to aid in assessing cyber security risk during selection of third parties and alsoprovide ongoing monitoring of our external partner and supplierecosystem. Information Security Governance The Cyber Security Office periodically provides updates on keyinformation security risks and issues, as well as progress reports on theCyber Maturity Programme to both the Risk Oversight & ComplianceCouncil and the Audit & Risk Committee. The Information SecurityEnterprise Risk Plan and Cyber Maturity Programme are overseen bythe Chief Digital and Technology Officer as well as the Chief FinancialOfficer. Cyber Security Awareness, Training and Readiness Cyber Security Awareness and Training programs including phishingsimulation programs are in place to increase awareness of cyber relatedrisks and reinforce the message that security is everyone's responsibilityat GSK. Periodic crisis simulation tabletop exercises are planned at various levels of the organisation to test our ability to respond to cyber incidents. Compliance with various governmental cyber security regulations The Cyber Security Office, with the General Counsel's guidance, works to stay abreast of various emergent governmental regulations, emergenttrends and compliance expectations regarding cyber security orinformation security. As new regulatory guidance becomes available,remedial compliance related actions are put in place as appropriate. GSK Annual Report 2022 Principal risks and uncertainties continued 295 Supply continuity Risk definition The risk that GSK or our third parties potentially fail to deliver a continuous supply of compliant finished product or respond effectivelyto a crisis incident in a timely manner to recover and sustain criticalsupply operations. Risk impact We recognise how important the continuity of supply of our products isto the patients who rely on them. Supply disruption can lead to: - Product shortages and product recalls - Regulatory intervention - Reputational harm - Lost sales revenue Consequently, we need sophisticated end-to-end supply chain management with robust crisis management and business continuityplans in place to respond. Context We run our supply chains in a continually evolving, highly-regulatedenvironment. There is no single set of global regulations which governsthe manufacture and distribution of medicines, and we must adhere tothe requirements in all those markets in which we licence, sell ormanufacture our products. We rely upon our internal QualityManagement System and our Internal Control Framework to ensurewe continue to preserve our licence to operate. Our complex end-to-end supply chains often involve third-party suppliers, from Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) manufacturersand raw material suppliers through to Third-Party Logistics Providersand contract engineering firms. We embed integrated riskmanagement into our sourcing and day to day business processes, alongside our Third-Party Oversight programme. External factors continued to challenge supply continuity in 2022. In the early part of the year COVID-19 continued to disrupt our sourcingof biosciences materials across our Medicines and Vaccines supplychains (e.g. vials, syringes and single-use systems components). The Ukraine conflict has resulted in supply disruption to the region. To manage these disruptions, we deployed bespoke de-risking plansusing crisis and continuity plans to manage the detail and mitigate therisk of supply continuity problems, e.g. by dual sourcing of materials orre-routing of shipments to avoid conflict zones. Keeping our patientssupplied with their medicines is our priority. New technology and modality platforms within supply chains arechanging the requirements for the skillsets of people working in thisfield. We have implemented a new Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls Operating Model in 2022. This brings cross-fertilisation of talent focus on the skills needed for the future for innovative manufacturing. Industrial relations are also a current risk to supply continuity, with the threat of industrial action being averted in our UK manufacturing sitesthrough successful dialogue with unions. Continued business monitoring is in place to assess the risk of the spread of industrial relations challenges resulting from global cost of living pressures. Mitigating activities Risk Management Our Medicines and Vaccine supply chains are set up to ensuresustainable global supply. The GSK Internal Control Framework drivesour approach to risk management, and it has been designed to identifyemerging new risks and support clear decision making. Risk oversight is managed through a hierarchy of Risk Management and Compliance Boards to assure risk mitigation (including identifying new and emergingthreats). Inventory Management Supply chain governance committees in Medicines and Vaccines closelymonitor the inventory status and delivery of our products. Our core commercial cycle links supply chain forecasting with our commercial ambition. It is designed to reduce the risk of demand fluctuations andmanage temporary shortages in supply. We periodically review eachnode of our supply chains to ensure we hold adequate safety stocks,whilst balancing working capital. We put particular emphasis onmitigating supply risks associated with medically-critical, high-revenueproducts and new product launches, for example using dual sourcing forkey products or APIs. We use the monthly Performance Management Process across our supply chains to monitor business activity and highlight adverse trends in supply, operations, budget and workforcecapability. Business continuity Crisis management and business continuity plans are in place acrossour supply chains, which include authorised response and recoverystrategies, key areas of responsibility and clear communication routes.We regularly use business continuity plans to manage potential supplydisruptions. Our manufacturing sites have crisis management plans inplace. These plans are tested at least annually to ensure maintenanceof core skills in crisis management.

The company's ADS are listed on the NYSE. Ordinary Shares representing the company's ADR programme, which is managed by the Depositary, are registered in the n ame of Guaranty Nominees Limited. At 3 March 2023, Guaranty Nominees Limited held 852,687,041 Ordinary Shares representing 20.82% of t he issued share capital (excluding Treasury shares). At 3 March 2023, the number of holders of Ordinary Shares in the US was 852 with holdings of 716,804 Ordinary Shares, and the n umber of registered holders of ADS was 16,757 with holdings of 426,343,520 ADS. Certain of these Ordinary Shares and ADS were held by br okers or other nominees. As a result, the number of holders of record or registered holders in the US is not representative of the number of b eneficial holders or of the residence of beneficial holders. Dividends The company pays dividends quarterly and continues to return cash toshareholders through its dividend policy. Dividends remain an essentialcomponent of total shareholder return and GSK recognises theimportance of dividends to shareholders. On 23 June 2021, at the new GSK Investor Update, GSK set out that from 2022 a progressive dividend policy will be implemented guided bya 40 to 60 percent pay-out ratio through the investment cycle. Thedividend policy, the total expected cash distribution, and the respectivedividend pay-out ratios for GSK remain unchanged. Dividends per share The table below sets out the dividend per share and per ADS for thelast five years. The dividend per ADS is translated into US dollars atapplicable exchange rates. Year pence US$(1) 2022 61.25 (2) - (3) 2021 80 2.16 2020 80 2.12 2019 80 2.012018 80 2.08 (1) An annual fee of $0.03 per ADS (or $0.0075 per ADS per quarter) will be charged by the Depository. The amounts shown are the dividends paid per ADS before the annual feeis charged. (2) Adjusted for the Share Consolidation (2022 only; prior years have not been adjusted). Dividends declared and paid in respect of 2022 were 14p per share for Q1 2022, 16.25pper and for Q3 2022. A dividend of 13.75p per share has been declared for Q4 2022. (3) The Q4 2022 ordinary dividend receivable by ADS holders will be calculated based on the exchange rate on 13 April 2023. The cumulative dividend receivable by ADS holders for Q1, Q2 and Q3 2022 was $1.05.GSK has previously stated that it expected to declare a 27p per share dividend for the first half of 2022, a 22p per share dividend for thesecond half of 2022 and a 45p per share dividend for 2023 (before theShare Consolidation) but that these targeted dividends per share wouldincrease in step with the Share Consolidation to maintain the same aggregate dividend pay-out in absolute Pound Sterling terms. Accordingly, using the consolidation ratio, GSK's expected dividend forthe fourth quarter of 2022 converts to 13.75p per new Ordinary Share,this results in an expected total dividend for the second half of 2022 of27.5p per new Ordinary Share. The expected dividend for 2023 is now56.5p per new Ordinary Share, in line with the original expectationconverted for the Share Consolidation and rounded up. Details of the dividends declared, the amounts and the payment dates are given in Note 16 to the financial statements, 'Dividends'. 2023 Dividend calendar Quarter Ex-dividend date Record date Payment date Q4 2022 23 February 2023 24 February 2023 13 April 2023 Q1 2023 18 May 2023 19 May 2023 13 July 2023 Q2 2023 17 August 2023 18 August 2023 12 October 2023 Q3 2023 16 November 2023 17 November 2023 11 January 2024 Q4 2023 22 February 2024 23 February 2024 11 April 2024 GSK Annual Report 2022 Shareholder information continued 299 Financial calendar 2023 Annual General Meeting 2023 Tax information for shareholders Event Date Quarter 1 Results announcement 26 April 2023 Annual General Meeting 3 May 2023 Quarter 2 Results announcement 26 July 2023 Quarter 3 Results announcement 1 November 2023 Preliminary/Quarter 4 Results announcement 31 January 2024 Annual Report publication February/March 2024 Annual Report distribution March 2024 Information about the company, including the share and ADS price, is available on our website at gsk.com.

A summary of certain UK tax and US federal income tax consequences for holders of shares and ADS who are citizens of the UK or the US is set out below. It is not a complete analysis of all thepossible tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or sale of thesesecurities. It is intended only as a general guide. Holders are advisedto consult their advisers with respect to the tax consequences of thepurchase, ownership or sale of their shares or ADS and theconsequences under state and local tax laws in the US and theimplications of the current UK/US tax conventions.US holders of ADS generally will be treated as the owners of the underlying shares for the purposes of the current UK/US double taxation conventions relating to income and gains (Income Tax Convention),estate and gift taxes (Estate and Gift Tax Convention), and for thepurposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. GSK Annual Report 2022 Shareholder information continued 300Tax information for shareholders continued UK shareholders This summary only applies to a UK resident shareholder that holds shares as capital assets. Taxation of dividends For the 2022/23 UK tax year, UK resident individuals are entitled to adividend tax allowance of up to \u00a32,000, so that the first \u00a32,000 ofdividends received in a tax year will be free of tax. Dividends in excess of this allowance will be taxed at 8.75% for basic rate taxpayers, 33.75% for higher rate taxpayers and 39.35% for additional ratetaxpayers. Note that from 6 April 2023 the dividend allowance will bereduced to \u00a31,000, and that from 6 April 2024 the dividend allowancewill be reduced again to \u00a3500 UK resident shareholders that are corporation taxpayers should note that dividends payable on ordinary shares are generally entitled toexemption from corporation tax. Taxation of capital gains UK resident shareholders may be liable for UK tax on gains on thedisposal of shares or ADS. For disposals by individuals in the 2022/23 UK tax year, a taxable capital gain accruing on a disposal of shares or ADS will be taxed at10% for basic rate taxpayers, or 20% if, after all allowable deductions,the individual's taxable income for the year exceeds the basic rateincome tax banding. Note this is following the use of any exemptionsavailable to the individual taxpayer such as the annual exempt amount. Corporation taxpayers may be entitled to an indexation allowance which applies to reduce capital gains to the extent that such gainsarise due to inflation. Indexation allowance may reduce a chargeablegain but will not create an allowable loss. For assets acquired on orbefore 1 January 2018, legislation in the Finance Act 2018 freezes the level of indexation allowance that is given in calculating a company's chargeable gains at the value that would apply to the disposal of anasset in December 2017. For assets acquired from 1 January 2018onwards, legislation in the Finance Act 2018 removes any indexationallowance on disposal. Inheritance tax Individual (UK-domiciled or otherwise) shareholders may be liable toUK inheritance tax on the transfer of shares or ADS. Exposure to a UKInheritance tax charge typically occurs on death of the asset owner.However, transfers of shares (other than commercial sales) within 7years of death remain relevant to any inheritance tax exposure atdeath. Further, transfers to a trust arrangement during lifetime can giverise to an immediate inheritance tax charge. Tax may be charged on the amount by which the value of the shareholder's estate is reduced as a result of any transfer by way oflifetime gift or other disposal at less than full market value. In the caseof a bequest on death, tax may be charged on the value of the sharesat the date of the shareholder's death. Where an exposure to UKinheritance tax and US estate or gift tax exists careful planning mustbe undertaken to understand the opportunity to utilise the US/UK Estate and Gift Double Tax Convention to manage tax credits and avoid double taxation.The overall exposure will be dependent on the specific circumstances of each situation and it's also important to note that tax charges may arisein other jurisdictions. Bespoke advice tailored to an individual's personalcircumstances should therefore be obtained from a tax professional. Stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax UK stamp duty and/or stamp duty reserve tax (SDRT) will, subject tocertain exemptions, be payable on the transfer of shares at a rate of0.5% (rounded up to the nearest \u00a35 in the case of stamp duty) of theconsideration for the transfer. Notwithstanding this, provided that aninstrument is executed in pursuance of the agreement that gave rise tothe charge to SDRT and that instrument is stamped within six years of the agreement (including being stamped as exempt) any SDRT charge should be cancelled and any SDRT which has already been paid will berepaid. Where listed shares are transferred to a company connected tothe transferor the chargeable consideration will be deemed to be notless than the market value of the shares transferred. This market valueoverride also applies where non-listed shares are transferred to acompany connected to the transferor where the consideration includesan issue of shares. US shareholders This summary only applies to a shareholder (who is a citizen or residentof the US or a domestic corporation or a person that is otherwise subjectto US federal income tax on a net income basis in respect of the sharesor ADS) that holds shares or ADS as capital assets, is not resident in theUK for UK tax purposes and does not hold shares for the purposes of atrade, profession or vocation that is carried on in the UK through a branch or agency. The summary also does not address the tax treatment of holders that are subject to special tax rules, such as banks, tax-exempt entities,insurance companies, dealers in securities or currencies, persons thathold shares or ADS as part of an integrated investment (including a 'straddle') comprised of a share or ADS and one or more other positions, and persons that own (directly, indirectly or constructively) 10% or moreof the company's stock (by vote or value), nor does it address taxtreatment that may be applicable as a result of international income taxtreaties. Taxation of dividends The gross amount of dividends received is treated as foreign sourcedividend income for US tax purposes. It is not eligible for the dividendreceived deduction allowed to US corporations. Dividends on ADS arepayable in US dollars; dividends on Ordinary Shares are payable inSterling. Dividends paid in Sterling will be included in income in the USdollar amount calculated by reference to the exchange rate on the daythe dividends are received by the holder. Subject to certain exceptionsfor short-term or hedged positions, an individual eligible US holder willbe subject to US taxation at a maximum federal rate of 23.8% plus applicable state and local tax in respect of qualified dividends. A qualified dividend as defined by the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS)is a dividend that meets the following criteria: 1. Must be issued by a US corporation, a corporation incorporated in a US possession, or a corporation that is eligible for the benefits of acomprehensive income tax treaty deemed satisfactory, as publishedby the IRS. GSK Annual Report 2022 Shareholder information continued 301Tax information for shareholders continued 2. The dividends are not of a type listed by the IRS as dividends that do not qualify. 3. The required dividend holding period has been met. The shares must have been owned by you for more than 60 days of the 'holdingperiod' - which is defined as the 121-day period that begins 60 days before the ex-dividend date, or the day in which the stock trades without the dividend priced in. For example, if a stock's ex-dividenddate is 1 October, the shares must be held for more than 60 days inthe period between 2 August and 30 November of that year in orderto count as a qualified dividend. Dividends that are not qualified are subject to taxation at the US federal graduated tax rates, at a maximum rate of 40.8%. Some typesof dividends are automatically excluded from being qualified dividends,even if they meet the other requirements. These include (but are notlimited to): 1. Capital gains distributions 2. Dividends on bank deposits 3. Dividends held by a corporation in an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) 4. Dividends paid by tax-exempt corporations. US state and local tax rates on qualified and non-qualified dividends may vary and would be assessed in addition to the federal tax ratescommunicated above. Taxation of capital gains Generally, US holders will not be subject to UK capital gains tax, butwill be subject to US tax on capital gains realised on the sale or other disposal of shares or ADS. Such gains will be long-term capital gains (subject to reduced rates of taxation for individual holders) if the sharesor ADS were held for more than one year, from the date the shareswere vested/released. Short-term capital gains can be subject totaxation of rates of up to 40.8%, whereas long-term capital gains maybe subject to rates of up to 23.8%. State and local tax rates on capitalgains may also apply. Information reporting and backup withholding Dividends and payments of the proceeds on a sale of shares or ADS, paid within the US or through certain US-related financialintermediaries, are subject to information reporting and may be subjectto backup withholding unless the US holder is a corporation or otherexempt recipient or provides a taxpayer identification number andcertifies that no loss of exemption has occurred. Non-US holdersgenerally are not subject to information reporting or backup withholding, but may be required to provide a certification of their non-US status in connection with payments received. Any amountswithheld will be allowed as a refund or credit against a holder's USfederal income tax liability provided the required information isfurnished to the IRS.Estate and gift taxes Under the Estate and Gift Tax Convention, a US shareholder is notgenerally subject to UK inheritance tax. However, a US holder may besubject to US federal estate and gift tax. Stamp duty UK stamp duty and/or SDRT will, subject to certain exemptions, bepayable on any transfer of shares to the ADS custodian or depository ata rate of 1.5% of the amount of any consideration provided (iftransferred on sale), or their value (if transferred for no consideration). However, no stamp duty or SDRT should be payable on the transfer of, or agreement to transfer an ADS or on transfers within the clearanceservice. Notwithstanding the above, where the clearance serviceoperator has made an election under s97A Finance Act 1986, broadlythe 1.5% stamp duty/ SDRT charge should not arise on the transfer intothe clearance service, but transfers to, and within, the system (wherethere is a change in beneficial ownership) would attract a 0.5% charge.

GSK Annual Report 2022 Other statutory disclosures continued 304 US law and regulation A number of provisions of US law and regulation apply to the company because our shares are quoted on the NYSE in the form of ADS. NYSE rules In general, the NYSE rules permit the company to follow UK corporategovernance practices instead of those applied in the US, provided thatwe explain any significant variations. This explanation is contained inour Form 20-F, which can be accessed from the SEC's EDGARdatabase or via our website. NYSE rules require us to file annual and interim written affirmations concerning our Audit & Risk Committee (ARC) and our statement on significant differences in corporategovernance. Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 Following a number of corporate and accounting scandals in the US,Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Sarbanes-Oxley isa wide-ranging piece of legislation concerned largely with financialreporting and corporate governance. As recommended by the SEC, the company has an established Disclosure Committee. The Committee reports to the CEO, the CFOand to the ARC. It is chaired by the Company Secretary and itsmembers consist of senior managers from finance, legal, corporatecommunications and investor relations. Where appropriate, external legal counsel, the external auditors, our sponsor bank, and internal experts are invited to attend the DisclosureCommittee's meetings periodically. The Committee has responsibilityfor considering the materiality of information and, on a timely basis,determining the disclosure of that information. It has responsibility forthe timely filing of reports with the SEC and the formal review of theAnnual Report and Form 20-F. In 2022, the Committee met 28 times,including for the purpose of receiving relevant and appropriate training. Sarbanes-Oxley requires that the annual report on Form 20-F contains a statement as to whether a member of the ARC is an audit committeefinancial expert, as defined in rules under Sarbanes-Oxley. Such astatement for the relevant members of the ARC (Charles Bancroft) isincluded in the Board Committee information area of the Corporate Governance report on page 109 and in his biography on page 98. Additional disclosure requirements arise under section 302 and section404 of Sarbanes-Oxley in respect of disclosure controls andprocedures and internal control over financial reporting.Section 302: Corporate responsibility for financial reports Sarbanes-Oxley requires for the CEO and the CFO to complete formal certifications, confirming that: - they have each reviewed the annual report on Form 20-F; - based on their knowledge, the annual report on Form 20-F contains no material misstatements or omissions; - based on their knowledge, the financial statements and other financial information fairly present, in all material respects, the financialcondition, results of operations and cash flows as of the dates, and forthe periods, presented in the annual report on Form 20-F; - they are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures that ensure that material information is madeknown to them, and have evaluated the effectiveness of thesecontrols and procedures as at the year end, the results of suchevaluation being contained in the annual report on Form 20-F; - they are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting that provides reasonable assurance regardingthe reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financialstatements for external purposes in accordance with generallyaccepted accounting principles; and - they have disclosed in the annual report on Form 20-F any changes in internal controls over financial reporting during the period covered bythe annual report on Form 20-F that have materially affected, or arereasonably likely to affect materially, the company's internal control over financial reporting, and they have disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to theexternal auditor and the ARC, all significant deficiencies and materialweaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls overfinancial reporting which are reasonably likely to affect adversely thecompany's ability to record, process, summarise and report financialinformation, and any fraud (regardless of materiality) involvingpersons that have a significant role in the company's internal controlover financial reporting. The Group has carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including the CEO and CFO, of theeffectiveness of the design and operation of the Group's disclosurecontrols and procedures as at 31 December 2022. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of humanerror and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures.Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can onlyprovide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. GSK Annual Report 2022 Other statutory disclosures continued 305US law and regulation continued The CEO and CFO expect to complete these certifications and report their conclusions on the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures in March 2023, following which the certifications will befiled with the SEC as part of our Group's Form 20-F. Section 404: Management's annual report on internal control over financial reporting In accordance with the requirements of section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley, the following report is provided by management in respect of thecompany's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)): - management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Group. Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reportingand the preparation of financial statements for external purposes inaccordance with IFRS; - management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework, InternalControl - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee ofSponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission (COSO); - there have been no changes in the Group's internal control over financial reporting during 2022 that have materially affected, or arereasonably likely to materially affect, the Group's internal control overfinancial reporting; - management has assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as at 31 December 2022 and its conclusion will befiled as part of the Group's Form 20-F; and - Deloitte LLP, which has audited the consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2022, hasalso assessed the effectiveness of the Group's internal control overfinancial reporting under Auditing Standard 2201 of the PublicCompany Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Their auditreport will be filed with the Group's Form 20-F. Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act requires issuers to make specificdisclosure in their annual reports of certain types of dealings with Iran,including transactions or dealings with government-ownedor-controlled entities, as well as dealings with entities sanctioned foractivities related to terrorism or proliferation of weapons of massdestruction, even when those activities are not prohibited by US lawand do not involve US persons.The Group exports certain pharmaceutical, vaccine and consumer products to Iran, via sales by non-US entities that are not subsidiaries of a US entity, to two privately held Iranian distributors. The Group does not regularly receive information regarding the identity of its distributors' downstream customers and intermediaries in Iran, andit is possible that these parties include entities, such as government- owned hospitals and pharmacies, that are owned directly or indirectly by the Iranian government or by persons or entities sanctioned inconnection with terrorism or proliferation activities. Because the Group does not regularly receive information regarding the identity of its distributors' downstream customers it cannot establish the proportion of gross revenue or sales potentially attributable to entities affiliated with the Iranian government or parties sanctioned fordisclosable activities. As a result, the Group is reporting the entire grossrevenues (\u00a38.7 million) and net profits (\u00a33.7 million) from the Group'ssales to Iran in 2022. The Group is also aware that some hospitals or other medical facilities in Lebanon may be affiliated with or controlled by Hezbollah or othergroups that are designated by the United States pursuant to ExecutiveOrder 13224. Again, the Group does not deal directly with such hospitalsor facilities and instead sells through distributors. The Group is unable toestablish the proportion of gross revenue or sales potentially attributableto reportable activities. As a result, the Group is reporting the entiregross revenues (\u00a36.3 million) and net losses (\u00a30.2 million) from the Group's sales to Lebanon in 2022. Unless noted, the Group intends to continue the activities described above. In addition to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act, US law generally restricts dealings by US persons and dealings that otherwise are subjectto US jurisdiction with certain countries or territories that are subject tocomprehensive sanctions, currently Crimea, Cuba, the so-calledDonetsk People's Republic, Iran, the so-called Luhansk People'sRepublic, North Korea and Syria, as well as with the Government ofVenezuela (though not with the country of Venezuela as a whole). The Group does business, via non-US entities (which are not owned or controlled by US entities), in certain such jurisdictions. While we believethe Group complies with all applicable US sanctions in all materialrespects, such laws are complex and continue to evolve rapidly. GSK Annual Report 2022 Other statutory disclosures continued 306 Donations to political organisations and political expenditure To ensure a consistent approach to political contributions across the Group, in 2009 a global policy was introduced to voluntarily stop allcorporate political contributions. In the period from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2022, the Group did not make any political donations to EU or non-EU organisations. Notwithstanding the introduction of this policy, in accordance with the Federal Election Campaign Act in the US, we continue to support anemployee-operated Political Action Committee (PAC) that facilitatesvoluntary political donations by eligible GSK employees. The PAC is not controlled by GSK. Decisions on the amounts and recipients of contributions are governed by the PAC Board of Directors.Contributions to the PAC are made by participating eligible employeesexercising their legal right to pool their resources and make politicalcontributions, which are subject to strict limitations under US law. In2022, a total of US$360,950 (2021: US$298,000) was donated to political organisations by the GSK employee PAC. English law requires prior shareholder approval for political contributions to EU political parties and independent electioncandidates as well as for any EU political expenditure. The definitionsof political donations, political expenditure and political organisations used in the legislation are, however, quite broad. In particular, the definition of EU political organisations may extend to bodies such asthose concerned with policy review, law reform, the representation ofthe business community and special interest groups such as thoseconcerned with the environment, which the company and itssubsidiaries might wish to support.As a result, the definitions may cover legitimate business activities not in the ordinary sense considered to be political donations or politicalexpenditure, nor are they designed to support any political party orindependent election candidate. Therefore, notwithstanding our policy, and while we do not intend to make donations to any EU political parties or organisations, nor to incur any EU political expenditure, we annually seek shareholderauthorisation for any inadvertent expenditure. The authority is a precautionary measure to ensure that the company and its subsidiaries do not inadvertently breach the legislation. This authorisation process, for expenditure of up to \u00a3100,000 each year, dates back to the AGM held in May 2001, following the introduction ofthe Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. The authorityhas since been renewed annually.

Download PDFs: - Annual Report 2022 - Form 20-F - ESG Performance Report 2022 Cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements The Group's reports filed with or furnished to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including this document,and any other written information released, or oral statements made, to the public in the future by or on behalf of the Group, may contain forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements give the Group's current expectations or forecasts of future events. An investor can identify these statements bythe fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They use words such words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, theseinclude statements relating to future actions, prospective products or product approvals, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings, dividend payments and financial results. Other than in accordance with its legal or regulatory obligations (including under the Market Abuse Regulations, the UK Listing Rules and the Disclosureand Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority), the Group undertakes no obligation to update any forward- looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. The reader should, however, consult any additional disclosures that the Group may make inany documents which it publishes and/or files with the SEC. All readers, wherever located, should take note of these disclosures. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that any particular expectation will be met and investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to assumptions, inherent risks and uncertainties, many of which relate to factorsthat are beyond the Group's control or precise estimate. The Group cautions investors that a number of important factors, including those in this document, could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statement. Such factors include, but are not limited to, those discussed under 'Principal risks and uncertainties' on pages 285 to 295 ofthis Annual Report and anyimpacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Group speak only as of the date they are made and are based upon the knowledge andinformation available to the Directors on the date of this Annual Report. A number of non-IFRS measures are used to report the performance of our business. These measures are defined on pages 69 to 70 and a reconciliation of Adjusted results to Total results is set out on pages 81 to 85. The information in this document does not constitute an offer to sell or an invitation to buy shares in GSK plc or an invitation or inducement to engage in any other investment activities. Past performance cannot be relied upon as a guide to future performance. Nothing in this Annual Report should be construed as a profit forecast. Assumptions related to 2023 guidance In outlining the guidance for 2023, the Group has made certain assumptions about the healthcare sector, the different markets in which the Group operates and the delivery of revenues and financial benefits from its current portfolio, pipeline and restructuring programmes. Due to the phasing of quarterly results in 2022 and the resulting comparators, GSK expects turnover and Adjusted operating profit growth to be slightly lower in the first halfof 2023 including a challenging comparator in Q1 2022 and somewhat higher in the second half, relative to full-year expectations. Despite the recovery of healthcare systems, uncertain economic conditions prevail across many markets in which GSK operates and we continue to expect to see variability inperformance between quarters. We expect sales of Specialty Medicines to increase mid to high single-digit per cent, sales of Vaccines to increase mid-teens per cent and sales of General Medicines to decrease slightly.
