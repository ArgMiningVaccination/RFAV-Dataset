Description of the herbal substance(s), herbal preparation(s) or combinations thereof Herbal substance(s) According to the specific Eur. Ph. Monograph (01/2008:1876), m astic is the dried resinous exudate obtained stems and branches of Pistacia lentiscus (var latifolius Coss. under revision ) with a content of minimum 10 ml/kg of essential oil (anhydrous drug) . . Mastic is more correctly an oleoresin obtained from a cultivated va riety of cultivated clone of the mastic tree ( Pistacia lentiscus L.). The gum has also a monograph in The Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India (1999) which referrs as well to the resin of Pistacia lentiscus L.), from the Anacardiaceae family, is naturally distributed in areas that enclose the coastal regions of the Mediterranean, Portugal and tropical Africa (PDR 2007 ). Flower and fruit is compact and spike -like. The flowers are yellowish or purplish. The drupe approximately 4 mm, globose, apiculate and is red, but later turns black . The plant is a n evergreen dio-oecious tree or shrub 1 -8 m high. The leaves are bipinnate. The 8 to 12 leaflets measure 1 to 5 cm by 0.5 to 1.5 cm. They are lanceolate to ovate -lanceolate, mucronate and 1989 ) The ( Pistacia lentiscus L. var Coss.) described in Eur. Ph Monograph Mastic (01/2008:1876) has been referred in the Botanical Book of the Botanist K.H. Rechinger (1943) as an endemic variety of the Greek islands of Crete (Chania, Ierapetra, Sitia, Toplou, Mirambelou) and the island of Karpathos. To the knowledge of Greek botanists this variety has never been collected on the aforementioned islands and has also never been phytochemically studied since this report. In the same book of Flora Aegea (1943) , KH Rechinger has report ed that, on Chios Island, a woody form of pistachio - Pistacia chia Desf. is cultivated which supplies a special resinous gum, the pharmaceutically and commercially used resin, so -called mastic or mastix as it is well known all over Europe and the world (Gennadios 1914) . Mastix or mastic is a unique natural product from the Greek island of Chios (with a Protected Designation of Origin 317707/14 -01-1994 (gaz. 17/14 -01-94) and plays a substantial role in the isla nd's as well as Greece's economy. The botanical name Pistacia lentiscus var. Chia (Desf. Ex Poiret) DC has been also used in the great majority of the existing publications for this plant. In a more recent and well documented botanical study of Prof Kazim ierz Browicz ( Plant Systematics and evolution , 1987), it is proposed that, instead of the widely used botanical name of Pistacia lentiscus var. Chia, the name Pistacia lentiscus cv. on Pistacia lentiscus L., (mastix) EMA/HMPC/46756/2015 Page 5/43 should be used, as cv means cultivated clone. In the proposal for rev ision from Greece , it is documented that the best scientific way , could be the accept ance in the Eur Pharmacopoeia's monograph the species Pistacia lentiscus L. without Chia) from the Greek island Chios , commercially is the major source of Chios Mastiha (Chios Gum Mastic; CGM) all over the world. The P. lentiscus cv. Chia, is cultivated and grown only in Southern Chios Area of Mastihohori a, (Savvides, 2000). The resin of that plant is obtained as an exudate after \"hurting\" the trunk and branches (Paraschos et al., 2007). A fully grown tree of the Pistacia lentiscus (Pistacia lentiscus L. cv Chia) species produces 1 kg of resin yearly. As i t drips, this sap appears as a sticky and translucent liquid which, 15 -20 days later, is solidified into irregular shapes influenced by the area's weather conditions in summertime that is intense drought and sunlight. After being solidified, it has a cryst al form, while it is rather bitter taste quickly subsides to leave a distinctive aroma. After the resin is harvested, it is washed with water to remove impurities and then mastic gum is sorted, classified and graded according to the colour and size of the granule (Dabos et al., 2010). Chios island export s approx 250 000 kg annually (Perrikos 198 6; Belles 2005 ) mainly in France, USA, Emirates Saudi Arabia, UK, Australia etc. Since 1997, mastic from the island of Chios has been characterized a s a Product o f Protected Designation of Origin (PDO), on the basis of Regulation No. 123/1997 (L0224/24 -1-97) of the European Union and it has been registered on the relevant European Union List of PDO Products. The rapporteur of the AR does not have any further knwo lende about commercial production of resin of Pistacuia lentiscus from other coubntries, which may exists and used for medicinal purposes. Mastic occurs in yellow or greenish yellow rounded or pear -shaped tears of about 3 mm in diameters. The shape of the tears is sufficient to distinguish them from those of sandarac (resin of Tetraclinia articulata which is used for its adulteration) . The tears of mastic are brittle but become plastic when chewed. Odour slightly balsamic; taste, mildly terebinthinate (Evans 1989 ) while the ones of sandarac when chewed remain gritty, showing no tendency to form a plastic mass, with a faint terebinthinate odour and somewhat bitter taste (distinction from mastic) Chemical constituents Natural polymer (van den Berg et al. 1998) Triterpenes (tetracyclic euphane - and dammarane skeleton type and of the pentacyclic oleanane and lupane skeleton type such as mastic research on the chemical composition of mastic is reported back to 1930, however and despite the extended range of its compounds' identification, until today is not entirely determined y et. The resin a ppears to consist of a variety of organic ingredients including a natural polymer, volatile and aromatic ingredients that constitute the essential oil (Mastic oil), terpenic acids, phytosterols, polyphenolic molecules and a large number of other potentiall y active secondary metabolites , some of which have been isolated and determined in nature for the first time. This combination of more than 80 ingredients justifies the multiple uses of mastic not only in the food but also in the health & personal care area. Assessment report on Pistacia lentiscus L., resin (mastix) EMA/HMPC/46756/2015 Page 6/43 cis-1,4-poly--myrcene The polymer of mastic was identified as cis -1,4-poly--myrcene (van den Berg et al. 1998) , while mastic also contains a small fraction (approximately 2%) of essential oil, which was analyzed by several scientists mainly by Papageorgi ou et al. (1981, 1997, Magiatis et al. 1999 . The triterpenoids present in mastic resin are of the tetracyclic euphane - and dammarane skeleton type and of the pentacyclic oleanane and lupane skeleton type Triterpenoids present in mastic resin Overall, th e main non -volatile natural products reported in the literature that have been isolated from the gum are: a) masticadienonic acid, b) tirucallol, c) oleanolic acid, -poly--myrcene ; Assimopoulou & Papageorgiou 2005i and 2005ii; Paraschos et al. Polyphenols are also reported traces of the compounds of tyrosol, p -hydroxy -benzoic acid, p -hydroxy -phenyl acetic acid, acid acid (PDR 2007) Volatiles secondary metabolites from Pistacia lentiscus L. During the decades of the 90 's and 2000 's, the volatile components of mastic were the subject of several studies in the context of the analysis of the composition and activity of the essential oil of mastic (Papageorgiou et al. 1981; 1997) . In 1991, Boelens & Jimenez comparatively studied the chemical composition of essential oils of resin, leaves and unripe and ripe fruits of mastic, identifying a total of 90 components (50% monoterpene hydrocarbons, 20% oxygenated monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes 25%) with major of the essential oil of resin the -pinene (79%) and the myrcene (3%). A very considerable study of the three essential oils of mastic gum, leaves and branches of mastic was publis hed in 1999 by Magiatis et al. In this study the major components identified were -pinene (66.48%), myrcene (8.34%) and - the branches were myrcene (47.92%), germacrene D (15.46%) and E - caryophyllene et indicated the -pinene, -myrcene, -pinene, limonene and trans -caryophyllene as the major c omponents. The above results have been verified by a recent work (Kokolakis et al., 2010), in which the authors identified -pinene, myrcene and -pinene as the main ingredients an indicator of origin of mastic one or another collection, but also as an indicator of storage time.

Information about products on the market 2.1.1. Informatio n about products on the market in the EU/EEA Member States Information on medicinal products marketed in the EU/EEA In Greece and other Balkan countries the herbal drug \" mastic resin\" or \"mastic gum\" as synonym are widely distributed for use according to folk medicine and sold via pharmacies especially after '80s and international publications of the healing activities of mastic on gastrointestinal disorders (functional dyspepsia, as an adjuvant in Helicobacter pylori therapy), skin healing activities, pro ducts for mouth hygiene. The request for information exchange concerning preparations from Pistacia lentiscus L. resin, mastic , revealed that there are no medicinal products authorized or registered in the EU/EEA containing preparations from Pistacia lenti scus L. resin, mastic as a single active substance. Assessment report on Pistacia lentiscus L., resin (mastix) EMA/HMPC/46756/2015 Page 9/43 Information on relevant combination medicinal products marketed in the EU/EEA In Greece there is one combination medicinal (?) product (he aling cream ) containing Alkanna tinctoria and powder of Pistacia lentiscus L. resin, mastic which was registered first at 197 6, with -drown some years later and then re -registered in 90's under a different brand name and slight changes in its content . Moreover , there are certain galenic products used through pharmacies containing mastic powder and mastic essential oil widely used for cutane ous and oromucosal uses (gargling) marketed since '50s and '90s respectively . Information on other products marketed in the EU/EEA (where relevant) The request for information exchang e concerning preparations from Pistacia lentiscus L. resin, mastic revealed that the powder is widely distributed in the food sector as well in cosmetics sector all over Europe and in Arabi an countries , also in combination products. 2.1.2. Information on product s on the market outside the EU/EEA No data 2.2. Information on documented medicinal use and historical data from literature Powdered herbal substance for oral use Ancient Greek physicians (Hippocrates, Dioscorides, Galenos) reported for first time the propertie s of Chios Mastiha and recommended its use for its distinctive flavo ur and its therapeutic properties. Documents show that it was the first natural chewing gum of the ancient world, used to clean the teeth and to freshen the breath. It was even used in cos metology for cleansing the face and body. Then the resin was used as an active ingredient in a series of pharmaceutical formulas and nostrums, many of which have been recorded from time to time in international pharmacopeias (Gennadios 1914; Perikos Materia Medica referred the therapeutic properties of mastic from the island of Chios (Chios Mastiha ), mentioning that it helps in the cases of indigestion, in blood problems , in chronic coughing, while at the same time it act ed as tranquilizer. He proposed the healing properties of chewing mastic resin to support oral hygiene as well as to clean and fresh breath. He mentioned the use of Mastiha oil, the essential oil of mastic, to be applied in multiple way s for affections of the uterus, as well as for its styptic activities (Genandios 1914) . From the 1st until the 7th century AD mastic was used by medical practitioners and botanists mainly for the treatment of stomach disorders like gastralgia, dyspepsia an d peptic ulcer for more than 2500 years. Ancient Greek physicians, such as Hippocrates, Dioscorides, Theophrastos and Galenos mentioned its properties and recommended its use (Paraschos et al., 2007). In the view of the people at that time, the use of mastic contributed to the smooth operation of the gastric and intestinal system. More specifically and from the various sources results that the Mastiha was used for soothing the pain of the stomach as well as indigestion and stomach disorders (Oribasius, Aeti us, Galen, Pilen). The effect of mastic in atonic and inflammation of the stomach, intestine and liver, and the emollient properties, is reported by L., resin (mastix) EMA/HMPC/46756/2015 Page 10/43 The Jerusalem Balsam - In the pharmacy of the Franciscan Monastery of Saint Savior in Jerusalem , where the monk Antonio Menzani di Cuna worked , after twenty -four years of experimentation he succeeded in creating an effective balsam named \"The Jerusalem Balsa m\". It was presented in Milan, in 1712, as an unguent to heal wounds abdominal pain, dermatitis, intestinal worms, toothache, haemorrhoids etc. Menzani's formula contained four ingredients: aloe, frankincense, myrrh and mast ic dissolved in ethanol. It was referred by Gilbertus Anglicus , (13th century in England ) in his Compendium Medicinae nostrum for the spleen called \"diacerasus \", which contains cherry juice, cinnamon and mastic resin. Later, Giovanni de Vigo Franciscan monk -physician to Pope Julius II, prescribe d a Balsam for Itching, containing egg white, linseed, poplar buds, and mastic powder, in olive oil (Perikos 1986) . Paracelsus in his Der grossen Wundartzney (Great Surgery Book) proposes mastic resin to heal wounds.\" In 18th and 19th centuries ma stic resin was used for filling of dental cavities, dissolving 4 parts mastic and 1 part ether in a flask: the solution forming a yellowish colour and oily consistency would be used to moisten a cotton bud and applied to the cavity to fill and seal it. These uses of mastic, were rescued in traditional healing people of Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East, where the use of mastic is extremely widespread Moreover, Al-Razi, Abu Yusuf Ya'qub ibn Ishaq al -Kindi and Abu Marwan'Abd al -Malik have prescribed mixtur es in medical formulas to fill decayed teeth, to fortify stomach, aid the liver (Perikos 198 6, Belles 200 6) Many medical practitioners, pharmacist and botanists , referred to the therapeutic properties of mastic resin, that they used for preparing therapeu tic formulas and widely used preparations. The use of mastic continued to spread successfully during Byzantine times. In many European Pharmacopeias of 16th - 18th century P.C. Since last century, mastic is currently used as a seasoning in Mediterranean c uisine, in the production of chewing gum, in perfumery, in dentistry and by the local population of Chios island for the relief of epigastric pain and protection against peptic ulcer disease In our days, the potential therapeutic acti vities of mastic gum have been scientifically studied and showed that especially mastic from the island Chios (as the majority of the studies referred to that one) displays positive action against digestive disorders, contributes to oral hygiene, displays antimicrobial and anti -inflammatory action, is a natural antioxidant, and also potentially aids in trauma healing. Today, a series of reports in international medical journals corroborate the historically recorded properties of mastic, which are based on the results of laborat ory studies as well as on small clinical trials carried out by independent researchers in Greece and abroad, and have revealed that mastic resin possesses interesting bioactive properties. In particular, mastic gum ( in accordance of the existing studies, mainly from Chios island CGM) and its essential oil, according current research suggests that they possess mainly antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. The antibacterial activity (Magiatis et al., 1999; Lauk et al., 1996; Koutsoudaki et al., 2005), as well as and its in-vivo antiplaque action in the oral cavity has been attributed to its inhibitory action against overall bacterial growth (Takahashi et al ., 2003), especially against Streptococcus mutans and Helicobacter pylori (Aksoy et al., 2006). Due to these findings , it can be assumed that th e powdered herbal substance of Pistacia lentiscus L. resin, mastic , was used for oral and cutaneous use at least since 198 0 in considerable amounts in dyspep tic and gastrointestinal disorders, and for cutaneous u se for its healing properties , within the European Union. Thus the requirements for the period of medicinal use according to Directive 2001/83/EC as amended with respect to \"traditional use\" are regarded as fulfilled. Assessment report on Pistacia lentiscus L., resin (mas tix) EMA/HMPC/46756/2015 Page 11/43 The gum has also a monograph in The Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India (1999) which referrs as well to the resin of Pistacia lentiscus L. called as \"Rumimastangi\" and its medicinal uses have been propsoed for doses 1 -2 g daily Oral use The recommended posology is, according to Perikos (1986) and by Al -Habbal et al. (1984) , 0,35-05 g of powdered mastic divided in doses of 0.5 g up to 6 times daily . Daily dose up to 2 g which is in accordance with recent clinical studies .

Non-Clinical Data 3.1. Overview of available pharmacological data regarding the h erbal substance(s), herbal preparation(s) and relevant constituents thereof 3.1.1. Primary pharmacodynamics Antimicrobial activity Several studies have been conducted to investigate mastic's antimicrobial properties. Mastic gum has been proven to have a wide rang e of antimicrobial activity against Gram -positive (+) and Gram - negative ( -) bacteria, as well as in other pathogenic microorganisms. Daifas et al. (2004) investigated the effect of mastic gum and its essential oil, alone and in conjunction with ethanol, on the growth of proteolytic strains of Clostridium botulinum . They proved that mastic and its mastic oil can effectively be used as factors against the appearance of botulinum neurotoxin in nutrition goods. More specifically, the results of the laboratory t ests showed that the addition of only 0.3% mastic oil was required for the inhibition of proteolytic strains of Clostridium botulinum . The study concluded that mastic gum and mastic oil could potentially be used as natural preservative in bakery products. The antibacterial activity of mastic oil can be attributed to the combination of several components rather than to one particular compound. It is also interesting to note that different bacteria are susceptible or not to different compounds of the essentia l oil. ( Tassou & Nychas effect of mastic against H elicobacter pylori On 1983 Marshall and Warren isolated and cultured successfully a bacterium , initially called Campylobacter pylori and later Helicobacter pylori , that was demonstrated to be able coloniz ing the stomach and thereby cause gastric inf lammation . H. pylori is a Gram-negative bacterium and it is responsible for 75% of digestive ulcer cases, while the respective amount in the cas e of duodenal ulcer amounts to 90%. Assessment report on Pistacia lentiscus L., resin (mastix) EMA/HMPC/46756/2015 Page 14/43 A number of studies have shown that mastic gum and mastic oil exhibit actions on gastrointestinal lesions. After discovery of Helicobacter pylori and correlation with gastrointestinal disease, the interest for the determ ination of mechanism of action of mastic and mastic oil for these disorders focused on the exploration and eventual finding of anti -H. pylori properties. The first study that proves mastic's anti - H. pylori activity is published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1998 (Huwez et al., 1998). Mastic proved to kill the H. pylori NCTC 11637 strain and the six clinical isolates. In this study which made at the University Hospital of Nottingham in England, it was concluded that mastic (from Chios ) had a proven action against Helicobacter pylori. The study showed the findings that suggest that even 1 g of mastic per day, for a time period of two weeks could cure digestive ulcer. This beneficial action, was due to the fact that mastic exterminate d Helicobacte r pylori which is liable for the majority of the digestive ulcer cases. In the specific study fresh samples were used with the presence of Helicobacter pylori, which were isolated from patients and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of mastic was searched, which means the minimum concentration required in order to exterminate 99.9% of the bacterium within 24 hours. Mastic exterminated the bacterium in all the examined samples, regardless of the size of the population. The minimum bacterial concent ration (MBC) of mastic was 60 g/ml, but even in smaller concentrations, the antibacterial action was especially important. The anti - H. pylori activity shown in this study, may explain a very rapid positive therapeutic effect in patients with peptic ulcer s, even with low doses of mastic gum (1 g per day for two weeks). Marone et al. (2001) and Bona et al. (2001) assessed the antibacterial effect of mastic on the isolated clinical isolates of Helicobacter pylori at concentrations of 2000 to 1.9 \u00b5g/ml. The m inimum bactericidal concentrations, calculated by microdilution method showed that mastic exhibit ed remarkable bactericidal effect on 12 strains isolated from patients of H. pylori , killing 50% of the executives in concentration of 125 g/ml and 90% at concentration of 500 g/ml. Furthermore, the microscopic observation of the morphology of the bacteria by electron emission led to the conclusion that the resin induces the release of air bubbles, the challenge morphological anomalies and segmentation of cells of H. pylori . It was also attempted to place the bactericidal property of the mastic on H. pylori in-arabino - galactan proteins (AGP's) isolated from the resin (Kottakis et al., 2009). Specifically, the inhibition of growth of H. pylori in the presence of aqueous mastic extracts containing AGPs was studied. The results showed that the extracts of at least 1,4 g gum affect the viability of bacterium, preventing cell growth. There we re no indications if AGPs cause abnormal morphology in H. pylori , as mentioned for total mastic (Bona et al, 2001) Paraschos et al. (2007) utilized an established H. pylori infection model to evaluate the potential therapeutic effect of continuous total ma stic extract without polymer (TMEWP) administration on H. pylori colonization and development of associated gastritis. Initially, TMEWP was obtained from crude mastic gum in a 70% proportion and it was further divided into two fractions, an acidic and a ne utral one. The acidic fraction of TMEWP after chromatographic separations afforded the major triterpenic acids oleanonic acid (515 mg), moronic acid (338 mg), 24Z -masticadienonic acid (1.1 g), 24Z - isomasticadienonic acid (1.0 24Z -masticadienolic acid ( 95 mg), and 24Z -isomasticadienolic acid (102 mg). The neutral fraction, after similar treatment, afforded five neutral triterpenic compounds: tirucallol (110 mg), dammaradienone (128 mg), 28 -norolean (206 mg), oleanonic aldehyde (152 mg), and oleanolic aldehyde (98 mg). Then, the antimicrobial activities of all these fractions, as well as that of mastic total extract, against a panel of 10 clinical isolates of H. pylori and the CCUG 38771 reference strain were tested over a period of three mont hs. Mastic extracts exhibited concentration - and strain -dependent bactericidal activities. More specifically, in all strains tested, the acidic fraction exhibited the highest activity, with a mean MBC of 0.136 mg/ml, followed by the TMEWP (MBC, 0.256 mg/ml ). Reduced activity was observed for the neutral fraction of the TMEWP (0.638 Assessment report on Pistacia lentiscus L., resin (mastix) EMA/HMPC/46756/2015 Page 15/43 mg/ml). Up to twofold differences were observed in the MBC between individual strains tested, and only in the case of LAVHP -7 strain was a higher susceptibility against the TMEWP and its acidic fraction observed. Having obtained the highest activity with the acidic fraction of the TMEWP, they proceeded to test the isolated pure acidic compounds for anti -Helicobacte r activity. Highest overall activity was obtained consistently and for all 11 of the H. pylori strains tested with isomasticadienolic acid, with a mean MBC masticadienonic acids showed reduced activity compared to the corresponding 3 -hydroxyl derivatives . It was verified that the chemical consistency of TMEWP was virtually identical to that of crude mastic gum, except for the absence of the polymer, and it also presented better solubility properties and increased concentration of active constituents. The experiments showed that the mastic total extract could moderately reduce H. pylori colonization in the antrum and corpus of the stomach. The reduction in colonization levels calculated was approximately 30-fold. These results were in concurrence with the visible reduction in H. pylori colonization observed in the histopathology evaluations. Finally, the resu lts also suggest that habitual long term mastic consumption may be effective in moderating H. pylori colonization. Following the above study, (Kottakis et al., 2009) investigated the effect the AGPs mastic (arabino - galactan proteins) derived from CGM, both in vitro and in vivo , in the presence of neutrophil -activating protein H. pylori (HP-NAP), on intrinsic activators of cellular immunity (activators neutrophils), comparing patients carriers of H. pylori to healthy volunteers, receiving 1 g gum daily for t wo months. The H. pylori virulence factors are three conserved antigens, namely the The VacA interacts with the membrane of epithelial cells and enters therein, wherein for ms a low conductivity ions channel. HPNAP is known to attract and activate neutrophils, monocytes, and mast cells, resulting in the release of pro - inflammatory mediators. Pull-down experiments in this study showed, for the first time, a specific binding of AGPs to two membrane proteins of neutrophils, possibly resulting in inhibition of neutrophil activation. Although these two neut rophil proteins were not characterized in this study, the authors state that further studies are needed to elucidate their char acteristics and involvement in neutrophil activities. Neutrophil activation was reduced when incubated in vitro with HP -NAP (P=0.0027) and AGP plus HP -NAP (P=0.0004) in H. pylori -positive patients who consumed AGP for two months. Similar results were also obtained when neutrophils were incubated with AGP plus HP -NAP (P=0.0038) but not with HP -NAP (P>0.05) in controls. Sharifi et al. (2009) investigated the anti -H. pylori activity of mastic in another study that indicated that most of the active fractions o f mastic is a polymer, followed by the acid and the same resin, while the neutral fragment was inactive. Notabl y, the increase in reactivity was observed by both the oxidation of the polymer (doubling) and by mastication for 4 hours the resin (50% increase ). Choli-Papadopoulou et al. (2011) evidenced that the broad C -terminal region of HPNAP stimulates neutrophil adhesion and that from CGM disrupt the process of neutrophil -endothelial cell attachment caused by HPNAP, an effect that should be furthe r investigated and may be exploited in a future anti -inflammatory therapy for H. pylori patients. The HPNAP is one of a number of virulence factors produced by the bacterium H. pylori . Free radicals produced by neutrophils are a key component of the innate immune system and an effective antimicrobial agent against H. pylori as well as a factor that perpetuates mucosal damage and gastritis. A possible blocking of reactive species production may lead to improvement of H. pylori induced chronic gastritis and r eduction of signs of inflammation . Assessment report on Pistacia lentiscus L., resin (mastix) EMA/HMPC/46756/2015 Page 16/43 A very recent study (Miyamoto et al., 2014) examined which component of mastic gum is responsible for anti -H. pylori activity. GC -MS analysis of the essential oil of mastic gum led to the identification of 20 components a mong which -pinene (82.26 %) was the most abu ndant. Then, the authors examined which component inhibits the growth of H. pylori . Ten commercially available compounds were tested for antibacterial activities against H. pylori strains that were established from patients with gastritis, gastric ulcer and gastric cancer. Some of them showed antibacterial activity again st clarithromycin (CAM) - and/or metronidazole (MNZ) strains. -terpineol and (E) -methyl isoeugenol showed anti H-pylori activity not o nly against drug sensitive strains (#09 -292 from gastric cancer) but also against drug resistant strains (#09 -87 derived from atrophic 10 compounds also showed antibacterial act ivity against three different strains ( E. coli, S. aureus, B. subtilis ).The authors concluded that these components could be useful to overcome the drug -resistance H. pylori growth in stomach Oral care Mastic gum was a traditional remedy since antiquity for oral malodo ur, and oral hygiene and this knowledge has been assessed in more recent studies. Mastic gum showed selective antibacterial action against oral bacteria Porphyromonas gingivalis (Sakagami et al., 2009, Sterer 2006) and Prevotella a (Sakagami et al., 2009). In vivo activities Anti-inflammatory & Anti -oxidant properties Heo et al., 2006, studied in vivo the effect of mastic in reducing the damage induced by diclofenac bowel and bacterial translocation in rats, a phenomenon caused by non-steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in general. For this purpose rats were divided into four groups; a control group, diclofenac group, diclofenac with 0.3 ml/kg group and diclofenac with 1.0 ml/kg mastic group. Mastic oils (not further information has been given) were administered 3 hours before diclofenac administration (100 mg/kg orally for 2 days). The parameters they were measured were intestinal permeability, enteric aerobic bacterial counts in the distal adhesion, and bacterial translocation to mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, spleen, kidney and heart, respectively. All parameters which were increased by administration of diclofenac, was found that they were decreased after administration of mastic at a dose of 1 ml/kg weight. The anti -inflammatory properties of mastic to help reduce intestinal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease patients were investigated by Kim and Neophytou in 2009. The dextran -sulfate sodium (DSS) model of colitis was used to assay the anti -inflammatory properties of mastic in vivo . Two experiments were performed. In the first trial, the animals were fed on diets containing a combination of mastic resin (0.2%) and mastic oil (0.02%) for 14 days; treated with 3% DSS for 5 days then with normal drinking water. After 14 days on the special diet experimental colitis was induced in the mice by treatment with 3% DSS in drinking water for 7 -10 days while still receiving mastic or other treatment. In the second trial animals were fed on different diets as follows: Group 1 (control) mice received a normal diet, Group 2 mice received a diet containing 0.02% mastic oil, Group 3 mice received a diet containing 0.30% -tocopherol, Group 4 mice received a diet containing 0.02% mastic oil and 0.30% -tocopherol. The animal data indicated that supplementation with mastic oil delayed the onset and progression of the disease and it helped prevent weight loss caused by the disease. It was concluded that mastic oil Assessment report on Pistacia lentiscus L., resin (mastix) EMA/HMPC/46756/2015 Page 17/43 provides some protection against acute colitis. Using mastic oil in combination with -tocopherol gave similar results to using mastic or -tocopherol alone. Anti ulcer activity In 1986 Al-Said et al. conducted an in vivo study in guinea -pigs in order to ev aluate the effectiveness of mastic against gastric ulcer and duodenal ulcer. For this purpose, with the use of the appropriate chemicals ulcer (aspirin, cysteamin hydrochloride , etc) was formed in the stomach. Afterwards, through their food, mastic was adm inistered to them in the proportion of 500 mg per kg. The results of the study have shown that the administration of Chios mastic has produced an important decrease in the expansion and intensity of the formed ulcer in the gastric membrane of the guinea -pigs, suggesting that it can be used as a treatment of the locally formed ulcer.

Plasma Lipid and blood sugar reduction Georgiadis et al, 2014 have investigated in vivo the effect of crude CMG on metabolic parameters in diabetic mice. Streptozotocin -induced diabetic 12 - week-old mal e C57bl/6 mice assigned to three groups: NC (n=9) control; LdM (n=9) animals receiving low dose mastic for 8 weeks (20 mg/kg body weight [ bw]); and HdM (n=9) animals receiving high dose mastic (500 mg/kg bw) for the same period. Serum lipid and glucos e levels were determined at baseline, at 4 and 8 weeks. Serum total protein, adiponectin, and resistin levels were also measured at the end of the experiment. Histopathological examination for liver, kidney, aorta and heart lesions was performed. After 4 w eeks, CMG administration resulted in decreased serum glucose and triglyceride levels in both LdM and HdM, whereas bw levels were reduced in LdM group compared with controls. At the end of the experiment, LdM presented significantly lower serum glucose, cho lesterol, low -density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels and improved high -density lipoprotein cholesterol levels compared with control group. HdM group had ameliorated serum triglyceride levels. Hepatic steatosis observed in control group was partially reversed in LdM and HdM groups. CMG administered in low dosages improves glucose and lipid disturbances in diabetic mice while alleviating hepatic damage. The in vivo hypolipidemic properties of the essential oil of CGM were also evaluated (Vall ianou et al 2011). The hypolipidemic effect of CGM was investigated in naive as well as in rats susceptible to detergent -induced hyperlipidemia. CGM administration into naive rats resulted in a dose -dependent reduction in the constitutive synthesis of seru m cholesterol and triglycerides. In hyperlipidemic rats, CGM treatment had also a strong hypolipidemic effect. By testing various components of mastic essential oil , it was shown for the first time that the hypolipidemic action is associated with camphene. Administration of camphene at a dose of 30 \u00cag/g of body weight in hyperlipidemic rats resulted in a 54.5% reduction of total cholesterol (p<0.001), 54% of Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL) -cholesterol (p<0.001) and of triglycerides (p<0.001). Treatment of HepG2 cells with camphene led to a decrease in cellular cholesterol content to the same extend as mevinolin, a known HMG -CoA reductase inhibitor. reductase activity, suggesting that its hyp ocholesterolemic and hypotriglyceridemic effects are associated with a mechanism of action different than that of statins. Given the critical role that the control of hyperlipidemia plays in cardiovascular disease, the results of that study provided insigh ts into the use of mastic essential as an alternative lipid lowering agent and merits further evaluation. Protection against atherosclerosis The potential of antiatherogenic effect of mastic gum has been also investigated. The biological action of the sal iva coming from the chewing of natural CMG, but also the chewing of commercial gums (with synthetic perfumes and artificial antioxidant ) was examined in the suspension of oxidation procedure of low -density lipoprotein (oxLDL). The biological activity o f the saliva from five different chewing gums, on the inhibition of low density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation, produced in vitro by copper ions, was demonstrated and quantitatively expressed as % protection (% Pr) (Andrikopoulos et al., 2002). Crude C MG was found to be the most effective (74.6% Pr) followed by commercial C MG (64.3% Assessment report on Pistacia lentiscus L., resin (mastix) EMA/HMPC/46756/2015 Page 23/43 Pr). The biologically active substances present in C MG(3 g) extracts and in the respective saliva (1 h chewing) were characterized as (poly)phenolic compounds in quantities of 0.3 and 0.2 mg, respectively. Its protective action was slightly higher even than the respective action of vitamin that was used as a basis for comparative reasons. Andrikopoulos et al., (2003) also showed that triterpenes present in mastic gum exhibit ed remarkable antioxidant effect on low -density lipoprotein (LDL). The results of the tests have led to the conclusion that C MG (Pistacia lentiscus var. Chia) was the most effective natural product of all those that have been examined ( P. terebinthus resin, dam mar resin, acacia gum, tragacanth gum, storax gum) in the protection against the oxidation of human LDL. The minimum and maximum doses for the saturation phenomena of inhibition of LDL oxidation were 2.5 mg and 50 mg CMG (75.3% and 99.9%, respectively). Dedoussis et al. 2004 examined the effect of the total polar extract in the survival of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), under oxidant stress conditions, which is created by the oxidized low - density lipoprotein (oxLDL). During the experimental stud y, the exposition of cells in the oxidized form of LDL, has led to the fast apoptosis and necrosis of the aforementioned cells. It was also investigated the molecular mechanisms through which total polar extract of the resin inhibits oxLDL cytotoxic effect on PBMC. The exposure of cells in the oxidized form of LDL, has led to the fast apoptosis and necrosis of the aforementioned cells. When culturing cells with oxLDL and the polar extract concurrently, inhibition of both the phenomena was observed. Antioxi dant activity Mastic has been used as a preservative for fats and oils by various people. Such a use by Egyptian villagers, trigger the first study on mastic's antioxidant activity in 70's where Abdel Rahman & Youssef Soad 1975; Abdel -Rahman et al.1975 showed that mastic possessed antioxidant activity similar to that of butylated hydroxyanisol. Moreover, the molecular mechanisms of the anti -inflammatory activity and the potential role of antioxidant activity of CMG has been evaluated (Triantafyllou et al., 2011) where it was found that GMG inhibited the activity of purified PKC (Inhibition of protein kinase C), decreased PKC activity in cell homogenate, and attenuated production Induction et (2014) investigated whether mastic gum modulates expression of Cyp1a1 and Cyp1a2 mRNA (measured by reve rse transcription real reaction) and Cyp1a -linked ethoxyresorufin O -deethylase (EROD) activity in rat liver following oral administration of CMG extract 1428 and 2000 mg/kg bw. For the evaluation of potential modulation of CYP1A1/ 2 o n rat liver for human risk assessment, a well -known bioactive natural compound, caffeine, was studied for detection of potential comparative effects on liver enzymes. Administration of CMG extract at the doses used does not cause significant transcriptiona l modulation of Cyp1a1/2 and subsequent CYP1A enzyme activity whereas administration of caffeine as a high dose of 100 mg/kg bw induced both the mRNA expression and the enzyme activity. The authors anticipate that administration of CMG extract at doses exceeding the recommended pharmaceutical doses does not modulate the CYP1A -catalyzed metabolic activation of several pro -carcinogens, thus considered to be of no biological or toxicological significance as compared to the respective effects observed after the treatment by caffeine. Assessment report on Pistacia lentiscus L., resin (mastix) EMA/HMPC/46756/2015 Page 24/43 3.1.5. Conclusions 3.2. Overview of available pharmacokinetic data regarding the herbal substance(s), herbal preparation(s) and relevant constituents thereof As the gum of Pistacia lentiscus L. (from the island of Chios) is used extensively as a constituent of herbal drugs or in food's area, the oral absorption of its major constituents still remained unclear. In the context of identifying the features of CMG that could be attributed for either therapeutic effects or effects of nutritional value , a methodology based on high -performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) was developed and applied for the quantification of mastic gum triterpenic acids, 24Z -isomasticadienonic acid (IMNA), lic acid (IMLA) in mouse plasma (Lemonakis et al. 2011). The specific compounds were selected based on their biological activity and potential against H. pylori . Concentrations were determined simultaneously in mouse plasma after oral administration of mas tic gum or total mastic extract without polymer (TMEWP) in order to evaluate the role of t he natural polymer, poly --myrcene, in the absorption process. Following TMEWP administration in mice, circulating IMNA and IMLA plasma levels were significantly higher (approximately 10 -fold) in comparison to IMNA and IMLA plasma levels following total CMG administration, suggesting that the polymer plays a critical role in the absorption process. More specifically following TMEWP administration, Cmax plasma values were 3300 \u00b1 859 ng/m l for IMNA and 163 \u00b1 58 ng/m l for IMLA. In comparison, following CMG adm inistration, Cmax plasma values were 329 \u00b1 57 ng/m l for IMNA and 28 \u00b1 8 ng/m l for IMLA. 3.3. Overview of available toxicological data regarding the herbal substance(s)/herbal preparation(s) and constituents thereof 3.3.1. Single dose toxicity No data available . 3.3.2. Repea t dose toxicity Dietary toxicity of mastic gum was studied in male and female F344 rats (Kang et al. 2007) fed 0%, 0.22%, 0.67% and 2% levels mixed into powdered basal diet for 13 weeks. No mortality or obvious clinical signs were observed in any of the an imals throughout the experimental period. Body weights were reduced in the high dose -treated group from week 2 to the end in males, and at weeks 8 and 13 in females. There were increased absolute and relative liver weights in a dose -related manner or limited to the high dose group males or females, along with changes in haematological parameters, including increased WBC and platelet in high dose males. Altered serum biochemistry parameters included increases of total proteins, albumin, and total cholesterol in both sexes, and -GTP in females only. However, macroscopic examination at necropsy revealed no gross lesions, and microscopic examination also revealed no treatment -related findings in any organs examined. As dietary treatment of mastic gum for 13 wee ks in this study caused decreased body weights at the high dose, especially in males, and increased liver weights in a dose -related manner in both genders without any morphological findings, it is concluded that the administration of it has a no observed a dverse effect level (NOAEL) of 0.67% in the diet. Assessment report on L., resin (mastix) EMA/HMPC/46756/2015 Page 25/43 data available for resin. An aqueous extract, called Chios mastic water (CMW) widely used in oral hygiene marketed products, was studied for its potential genotoxic activity, as wel l as its antigenotoxic properties against the mutagenic agent mitomycin -C (MMC). Genotoxicity was evaluated in vitro Cytokinesis Block MicroNucleus (CBMN) assay and the in vivo Somatic Mutation And Recombination Test (SMART). In the former assay, lymphocytes were treated with 1, 2 and 5% (v/v) of CMW with or without MMC at concentrations 0.05 and 0.50 g/ml. No significant micronucleus induction was observed by CMW, while co -treatment with MMC led to a decrease of the MMC -induced micronucl ei, which ranged between 22.8 % and 44.7%. (Vlastos et al. 2013) 3.3.4. Carcinogenicity No data available. 3.3.5. Reproductive and developmental toxicity No data available. 3.3.6. Local tolerance No data available. 3.3.7. Other special studies No data available . 3.3.8. Conclusions In the 3 -month repeat dose study in rats the only significant finding was the decreased body weight in the high -dose group. Consequently the NOAEL value was 0.67% of mastic gum in diet. Otherwise data on toxicity are not available. As only in vitro micronucleus and SMART tests with MGW were performed for evaluating genotoxicity, a List Entry is not proposed . 3.4. Overall conclusions on non -clinical data The in vitro studies show the antimicrobial activity of mastic against a panel of Gram -positive and Gram -negative bacte ria as well as its particular strong activity against H, pylori , with a minimum bacterial concentration (MBC) , i.e. the minimum concentration of mastic required in order to exterminate 99.9% of the H. pylori within 24 hours , at 60 g/ml. These findings together with the results of the in vitro antioxidative and anti inflammatory activities give a positive signal to the proposed therapeutic indication of mastic against mild dyspeptic disorders . Moreove r, the results of the in vivo experimental models give adequate plausibility to the longstanding traditional medicinal use of mastic in the proposed therapeutic indication . One single study investigated on the pharmacokinetic of two of the most abundant constituents of the mastic g um, the triterpenic acids, 24Z -isomasticadienonic acid 24Z resin (mastix) EMA/HMPC/46756/2015 Page 26/43 acid (IMLA), while other data on pharmacokinetics and interactions are not available. Mastic gum is not an inducer of CYP1A1/2 in rat liver. Non-clinical information on the safety of mastic gum is not available. The 13 -week repeat dose toxicity study in rats showed no observed adverse effect lev el (NOAEL) of 0.67% in the diet . No signals of clinical safety concern during the long-standing use of mastic are raised against medicinal use of mastic oil in the proposed condition of use. As there is no information on reproductive and developmental toxicity, the use during pregnancy and lactation cannot be recommended. Adequate studies to evaluate genotoxicity are not availabl e. Tests on reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity have not been performed. 4. Clinical Data 4.1. Clinical pharmacology 4.1.1.

Clinical studies (case studies and cl inical trials) Prevention of ulcers due to action against Helicobacter pylori Thirty -eight volunteers with symptoms and endoscopic confirmation of duodenal ulcer participated i n the first clinical study (Al- Habbal et al. 1984] ) in the University clinic of Mosul University in Iraq .. For the comparison of the effectiveness of Chios mastic , the volunteers were divided in two groups: group 1 consumed Chios mastic for two weeks (1 g per day) and group 2 consumed the same dosage of placebo powder (lactose) for t he same time period. After the lapse of two weeks all the volunteers were endoscopically examined, in order to see the progress of the ulcer. The results showed that in the group that consumed mastic there was an alleviation of the symptoms in 80% of the c ases, while the endoscopic examination has confirmed that duodenal ulcer was cured in 70% of the cases. The conclusions of the clinical study recommend mastic as drastic element for the alleviation and the Assessment report on Pistacia lentiscus L., resin (mastix) EMA/HMPC/46756/2015 Page 27/43 treatment of ulcer symptoms. Another important con clusion of the research was that the use of Chios mastic produced no unwanted side -effect. The same research team has published (Huwez et al. 1986 ) the findings of a new clinical study in patients who suffered of gastric ulcers, of benign nature. For this purpose, Chios Mastic was administered in the dosage of 2 g per day for four weeks (1 g before breakfast and 1 g before sleeping at night) to 6 patients with gastric ulcer diagnosed by means of gastroscopy . No patient was administered another type of phar maceutical treatment, for a time period of at least two months before the initiation of the clinical study. For the evaluation of the action of mastic gastroscopies were conducted as well as routine laboratory controls in the blood, urine and other biochem ical parameters, before the initiation of the treatment, two weeks after, four weeks after and two months after the initiation of mastic administration. The results of the study have shown that the administration of mastic has relieved all six patients tha t participated in the search from the symptoms, while the treatment was even endoscopically confirmed in five of them. During the study, but also two months after its completion no type of unwanted effect was found or any unusual result in the laboratory analysis . In 2002 Roe et al. published a clinical study concerning the action of mastic against gastritis caused by H. pylori in the South Korea Society of Gastroenterology magazine. Forty-eight volunteers found to be infected by H. pylori using UBT test (UREA BREATH TES technique for detecting H. pylori) , participated to the study that was conducted by the Medical School of Dan -kook University in South Korea . The participants were divided in two groups : the first group used Chian chewing gum for 90 days, while the second one used placebo gum. The UBT test was applied on patients before the initiation of the study as well as in intervals of 30 and 90 days following the completion. The results of the tests show ed that the use of mastic is especially effe ctive in limiting the concentration of H. pylori as well as the gastritis due also to H. pylori , reaching the conclusion that it can be used as an additional means for containing the bacterium and its effects. In 2009 Kottakis et al. investigated the effe cts of mastic gum (from the island of Chios) on innate cellular immune effectors. The in-vivo effect of AGPs/CMG under the presence of HP-NAP in neutrophil activation was investigated in five (5) H. pylori -infected patients and (3) three healthy volunteers who received 1 g daily consumption of CMG for 2 months. All participants did not receive any immunosuppressive medication before or during the trial; patients with infectious diseases that could modify their immunologic status were excluded. In-vitro studies with pull -down experiments to assess the effect of AGPs/CMG under the presence of HP-NAP on the neutrophil activation were also carried out. Neutrophil activation was estimated by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate -oxidase assays and optical m icroscopy methods by measurement of cytochrome C reduction. The studies suggested that the AGPs/CMG inhibit neutrophil activation in the presence of HP-NAP, playing a crucial role in H. pylori -associated pathologies in gastric mucosa. Recent studies (Dabos et al. 2010i;) have shown that CMG provided relief from heartburn to people who suffer from gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD ), providing symptomatic relief of pain in the stomach area but also in patients with epigastric pain. In the same study 54 pa tients obtain 1 g of CMG over three weeks. The results showed that: 75% of patients showed recession of symptoms. Symptoms such as stomach pain, heartburn and belching improved significantly. Interesting are the results of Dabos et al. (2010ii), which was designed to evaluate the effect of mastic gum on H. pylori in vivo . (52) Fifty -two patients participated in the clinical trial. They were randomized to receive either 350 mg three times a day (tid) of pure mastic gum for 14 days (Group A), or 1.05 g of pure mastic gum (Group B) for 14 days, or pantoprazole 20 mg twice a day (bd) plus pure mastic gum 350 mg tid for 14 days (Group C) or pantoprazole 20 mg bid plus amoxicillin 1 g bid plus Assessment report on Pistacia lentiscus L., re sin (mastix) EMA/HMPC/46756/2015 Page 28/43 clarithromycin 500 mg bid for 10 days (Group D). They were also asked to keep a log of adverse events. H. pylori eradication was tested 5 weeks after completion of the eradication regime. The results showed that mastic gum has some effect on H. pylori in vivo . Nine patients in the monotherapy groups achieved eradication whil e in ten more patients the urea breath test (UBT) value decreased compared to the pre -treatment reading. Eradication of H. pylori w as confirmed in 4/13 patients in Group A and in 5/13 in Group B. No patient in Group C achieved eradication whereas 10/13 pat ients in Group D had a negative result. There were no statistically significant differences between Groups A, B, C although there was a trend in Group A (p= 0.08) and in Group B (p =0.064). The difference was significant in Group D (p= 0.01). The combinati on of mastic gum and pantoprazole was ineffective in eradicating H. pylori or did it have effect on bacterial load either. The surprising failure of combination gum and pantoprazole probably is explained by the fact that the pump inhibitors protons increas e the pH of the stomach, thereby decreasing the possible activity of acidic components of mastic, which is probably due to the anti -H. pylori action. It was concluded that although even the high dose monotherapy did not achieve acceptable eradication rates it could be used as an alternative regime in patients unwilling to undergo eradication with the triple therapy regime. All patients tolerated mastic gum well and no serious adverse events were reported. Recently Kaliora et al. 2007 and 2007ii c linical tri als made by the Harokopio University of Athens in collaboration with the Gastroenterology Department of the General State Hospital Nicea proved that a dose of 2.2 g/day of mastic gum from Chios island (CMG) , equal to 40mg/Kg body weight, improves the cli nical status of patients with Crohn's disease of mild to moderate severity as well as better laboratory indexes. Results from a recent study by the same research group, prove the anti - inflammatory and antioxidant properties of mastic in Idiopathic Inflamma tory Bowel Disease (Gioxari et al. 2011; Papalois et al. 2012 ). In the same study CMG showed to be active as a whole molecule rather than its individual fractions in order to reduce inflammation via NF - regulation. Relief of Gastro oesophageal reflux disease and functional dyspepsia In a clinical study of Dabos et al, 2010 i the symptoms o f gastro -esophageal reflux disease were evaluated after treatment with mastic gum. Patients received 350 mg mastic gum three times daily or placebo . After 3 weeks of treatment the severity of the symptoms was assessed using the Hong Kong index of dyspepsia . Patient's global assessment of efficacy was also evaluated. At the placebo group 32 patients had either acid reflux or heartburn or both and 32 patients in the treatment arm had either acid reflux or heartburn or both. Only 6 patients in the placebo grou p showed some improvement of their symptoms at the end of the study period, whereas 25 patients in the treatment group reported benefit from the treatment (p<0.01). In 2010ii Dabos et al., performed the first double -blind placebo controlled trial to assess the effects of CMG in functional dyspepsia. The study was conducted in Chios District General Hospital Skylitsion, Chios, Greece. One hundred and forty eight patients (148) fulfilling Rome II criteria for functional dyspepsia were randomly assigned to rec eive either CMG 350 mg three times daily or placebo. After 3 weeks of treatment the change from baseline in the severity of symptoms of functional dyspepsia was assessed using the Hong Kong index of dyspepsia (HKID). The following twelve dyspepsia symptoms on a five point scale each (0 for absent, 1 for mild, 2 for moderate, 3 for severe and 4 for very severe): stomach pain in general, bloating of the upper abdomen, dull ache of the upper abdomen, stomach pain before meals, stomach pain when anxious, vomiti ng, nausea, belching, acid regurgitation, heartburn, acidity in the stomach, loss of appetite. Patients' global assessment of efficacy was also evaluated at the end of the 3 weeks' trial period. The symptom score after treatment was significantly lower in the CMG than in the placebo group ((14.78+/ -1.78) vs (19.96+/ -1.83)) (p<0.05). There was significant improvement in the actively treated group ((23.68\u00b11.64) vs Assessment report on Pistacia lentiscus L., resin (mastix) EMA/HMPC/46756/2015 Page 29/43 (14.78\u00b11.78)) (p < 0.03). There was no significant improvement in the placebo group ((23.27\u00b11.73 ) vs 19.96\u00b11.69)) (p = 0.23). With regards to patients' own global assessment of efficacy, 40% (30/74) of patients showed improvement on the placebo arm, while 77% (57/74) of patients in the active treatment group showed improvement of symptoms (p < 0.02). Individual symptoms that showed significant improvement with CMG were: stomach pain in general, stomach pain when anxious, dull ache in the upper abdomen and heartburn (<0.05 for all four symptoms). It was proved that CMG significantly improved the percep tion of symptoms in patients with functional dyspepsia over 3 weeks of treatment compared to placebo. The table that follows shows the results for the twelve individual symptom scores that form part of the HKID. There were no significant differences in sym ptoms' improvement in eight of the twelve symptoms. Differences in stomach pain in general (1.05\u00b10.05 vs 0.43\u00b10.03), stomach pain when anxious (0.91\u00b10.06 vs 0.33\u00b10.04), heartburn (0.77\u00b10.03 vs 0.21\u00b10.01) and dull ache in the upper abdomen (0.87\u00b10.05 vs 0.2 3\u00b10.03) were significantly in favour of the treatment group (p < 0.05 for all four symptoms). CMG was well tolerated by the patients. Crohn's Disease A study (Kaliora et al., 2007 i and 2007ii ) was performed in order to assess the effects of mastic on patients with Crohn's disease. The study was conducted in patients with established mildly to moderately active Crohn's disease and in healthy controls. Ten patients and 8 controls, recruited to a 4 week treatment with mastic caps (6 caps/d, 0.37 g/cap). Interleukin peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) befo re and after treatment. Treating CD patients with mastic resulted in the reduction of TNF-alpha secretion (2.1 +/ - 0.9 ng/m l vs 0.5 +/ - 0.4 ng/m l, P = 0.028). MIF release was significantly increased (1.2 +/ - 0.4 ng/m l vs 2.5 +/ - 0.7 ng/m l, P = 0.026) meani ng that random migration and chemotaxis of monocytes/macrophages was inhibited. No significant changes were observed in IL -6, MCP-1 and GSH concentrations. The study showed that mastic acts as an immunomodulator on PBMC, acting as a TNF -alpha inhibitor and a MIF stimulator. This finding provides strong evidence that mastic might be an important regulator of immunity in Crohn's disease. They also assessed the effects of mastic administration on cytokine production of circulating mononuclear cells of patients with active Crohn's disease (Kaliora et al., 2007B). in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) before and after treatment. Treating CD patients with mastic resulted in the reduction of TNF -alpha secretion (2.1 +/ - 0.9 ng/m l vs +/ - 0.4 ng/m l, P = 0.028). MIF release was significantly increased (1.2 +/ - 0.4 ng/m l vs 2.5 +/ - 0.7 ng/m l, P = 0.026) meaning that random migration and chemotaxis of monocytes/macrophages was inhibited. No significant changes were observed in IL -6, MCP -1 and GSH concentrations. It was proven that mastic acts as an immun omodulator on PBMC, acting as a TNF -alpha inhibitor a MIF stimulator. Although further double -blind, placebo -controlled studies in a large number of patients is required to clarify the role of this natural product, this finding provides strong evidence that mastic might be an important regulator of immunity in Crohn's disease. Wound healing activity The adhesive properties of mastic, as well as its beneficial presence in healing wounds and post - operative incisions have been identified and studied by re searchers for at least twenty years now. The natural resin of mastic is used very often as ingredient in bandages, plasters, compresses and other Assessment report on Pistacia lentiscus L., resin (mastix) EMA/HMPC/46756/2015 Page 30/43 healing means, applied in the protection and healing of wounds or postoperative incisions. The results of rele vant publications show, that CMG (mastic gum of Chios presents exceptional adhesive properties, when used in covering means and wound and incisions healing means, while at the same time, it contributes to the effective regeneration of the skin and to the w ound healing, while it does not have undesirable side -effects on the skin ( irritation, itching, dermatitis, skin depigmentation, etc), as the conventional ingredients used in healing means . Since 1986 and 1989 in relevant studies ( Mikhail et al. 1986; 19 89) published a comparison made of the adhesive properties of three categories of bandages. In the first category the adhesive bandages did not contain any additional ingredient, in the second category the bandages contained additionally the widely used in gredient for such applications: be nzoin, USP and in the third category Chios mastic solution (no further specification?) was used as reinforcing means. The specific study has shown that despite the use of be nzoin, USP in the bandages has resulted in improv ing their adhesive properties ; the use of mastic has brought an even more impressive improvement, confirming that Chios Mastic can be used with great success in the specific application. In a relevant study ( Lesesne 1992) a comparison was made between th e adhesive properties, as well as of the undesirable effects of mastic as an ingredient of the adhesive bandages, and be nzoin, USP. The study has been applied to 300 volunteers (100 men and 200 women), who were submitted to plastic surgeries. The volunteer s were divided in two groups: in the first group adhesive bandages with benzoin, USP were applied, while in the second group bandages with Chios Mastic ingredient were used. The volunteers were examined postoperatively after a period of 6 days, 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. The evaluation was based on elements such as: the attentive study of the condition of the wound, the appearance of infections, the effluence of the wound, the depigmentation and irritation of the skin, as well as the premature loss of the adhes ive properties of the bandage. The findings of the specific study have reached the conclusion that CMG ( mastic gum of Chios offers not only exceptional adhesive properties to the healing means, as compared to be nzoin, USP, but also it has an advantage over this latter one, in that it has exceptionally lower possibility of problems to arise due to dermatitis, and irritation or depigmentation of the skin . The results of the specific study were confirmed in a relevant announcement (Yavuzer et al. 2005 ) by anot her research team, which reaches the conclusion that mastic substantially increases the adhesive action of the self -adhesive bandages, when these are used as the only means for covering wounds and incisions. Oral hygiene In another study chewing mastic gum (MG) was proven to significantly reduce plaque index and gingival index. These results suggested that CMG is a useful antiplaque agent and that chewing CMG reduces both bacterial growth in saliva and plaque formation on teeth (Takahashi et al., 2006) . In other studies mastic gum exhibited antibacterial activity against Streptococcus mutans (Aksoy et al., 2006 and streptococci both in vitro and in vivo , lactobacilli, and total cultivated bacteria (Aksoy et al., 200 6). The results showed that che wing mastic gum decreased the total number of viable bacteria, S. mutans and lactobacilli in saliva. Therefore, chewing CMG might be useful in preventing caries. A relevant clinical study ( Topitsoglou -Themeli et al. 1984; 1985) , which was conducted in th e Dental faculty of the Univ of Thessaloniki, Greece in 1985, demonstrated that if mastic from Chios is used systematically, it may result in important decrease in the amount of formatting or already formatted dental plaque. In this study ten (10) voluntee r students participated, with low caries rate and were divided in two groups : the first of which chewed CMG for ten days, while the second chewed a placebo chewing gum. The results of the study have confirmed that in the group that used CMG the amount of Assessment report on Pistacia lentiscus L., resin (mastix) EMA/HMPC/46756/2015 Page 31/43 microbial plaque was largely diminished and hence it can be used effectively in the prevention of caries, peridental disorders and buccal cavity diseases in general. A similar clinical study (Fukazawa et al. 2001; Takahashi, et al. 2003 ), that was published in 2003 in Journal of Periodontology magazine, conducted by Dental Faculty of the University of Meikai in Japan, examined the action of chewing gum with natural CMG against the bacteria of saliva and the buccal cavity in general. For this purpose 20 orall y healthy volunteers participated, who were divided in two groups. The first group used CMG, while the second one used a placebo gum. In the saliva that was concentrated, before and after the chewing, the total number of bacterial colonies were identified and compared. At the same time, before and after the systematic chewing for 7 days, in the two groups the level of gingivitis - dental plaque as well as gum irritation degree - were studied. The results led to the conclusion that CMG leads to suspension of bacterial development in the buccal cavity, responsible for causing peridental diseases as well as the formation of dental plaque . At the same time, CMG led to a significantly lower degree of gum irritation, in comparison with placebo gum, confirming that it constitutes a drastic and safe means for improving oral hygiene. Recently , Aksoy et al. 2006 from three universities of Turkey published in Archive of Oral Biology magazine a study that investigates the in vitro , as well as in vivo action of mastic against pathogenic bacteria of streptococcus mutans family, which constitute one of the most basic reasons for the appearance of the caries and diseases of the buccal cavity in general. For the laboratory study of the antimicrobial action of mastic (in vitro ) model streptococcus mutans samples wereused. Respectively, the clinical study was applied in 25 peridentally healthy volunteers, who were divided in two groups: the first group consisted of those who used mastic and the second of those who used placebo g um for comparative reasons. The appraisal of the effectiveness of mastic in limiting streptococcus mutans development, has been conducted by comparing samples of saliva that were taken from the two groups of volunteers before and after 15, 45, 75, 105 and 135 minutes from the moment they started chewing mastic and the placebo gum. In each of the aforementioned five intervals it was discovered that in the saliva samples of the volunteers of mastic group there was an important, gradual decrease (15 minutes: 3 7%, 45 minutes:48.5%, 75 minutes:56.7%, 105 minutes:62.7%) of the total population of bacteria that reached 62.1% after 135 minutes of chewing. On the contrary, in the case of placebo gum group, there was no type of containment of the bacteria population. In the conclusions of the study it is established that mastic presents an exceptionally interesting antibacterial action, which can be compared to the action of antibiotics (vancomycin) in the case of Streptococcus mutans . This action of mastic appears as especially important, as it concerns the limitation of the frequent and dangerous bacteria of the mouth, streptococcus mutans , which are responsible for the decalcification of the enamel of the teeth, also responsible for a number of surface diseases of th e denture. The results of the study reach the conclusion that the frequent use of mastic constitutes an important factor (natural chewing gum) in improving oral hygiene, always in combination with the frequent teeth brushing. In another recent study (Watanabe et al. 2010 ) it was also prove d the useful effect of the mastic essential oil for chronic periodontitis. Plasma Lipid and blood sugar reduction Triantafyllou et al. (2011) investigated the effect of mastic powder in reducing plasma lipids and glucose levels. Subjects (n=133, aged over 50) were randomly assigned to two groups, the first (high - dose group) ingesting daily 5 g of mastic powder and the second receiving daily a Chios mastic solution (low-dose group). Serum biochemical parameters were determi ned on a monthly basis for an 18 - month (high -dose group) and a 12 -month (low -dose group) follow -up period. Generalized least squares random -effects linear regression was performed. The group ingesting Chios mastic powder Assessment report on Pistacia lentiscus L., (mastix) EMA/HMPC/46756/2015 Page 32/43 (high-dose group) exhibited a decre ase in serum total cholesterol, LDL, total cholesterol/HDL (a), apolipoprotein A -1, not change), SGOT, SGPT and gamma -GT levels. A decrease in glucose levels in males in the second (low -dose) group was observed.

The results showed that in group consumed mastic there was an alleviation of the symptoms in 80% of the cases, while the endoscopic examination confirmed that duodenal ulcer was cured in 70% of the cases.

Clinical studies in special populations (e.g. elderly and children) No data available. 4.4. Overall conclusions on clinical pharmacology and efficacy The results have shown that the use of mastic was effective in limiting the conc entration of H. pylori as well as the gastritis due also to Helicobacter as well as for the relief of symptoms such as stomach pain, heartburn and belching. In the only double blind placebo control clinical study (Dabos et al. (2010ii), to one hundred and forty eight patients (148) where 350 mg three times a day (tid) of pure mastic gum for 14 days (Group A), there was significant improvement in the actively treated group ((23.68\u00b11.64) vs (14.78\u00b11.78)) (p < 0.03). There was no significant improvement in the placebo group ((23.27\u00b11.73) vs 19.96\u00b11.69)) (p = 0.23). With regards to patients' own global assessment of efficacy, 40% (30/74) of patients showed improvement on the placebo arm, while 77% (57/74) of patients in the active treatment group showed improvem ent of symptoms (p < 0.02). Individual symptoms that showed significant improvement with mastic from the island of Chios were: stomach pain in general, stomach pain when anxious, dull ache in the upper abdomen and heartburn (<0.05 for all four symptoms). I t was proved that mastic improved the perception of symptoms in patients with functional dyspepsia over 3 weeks of treatment compared to placebo. Mastic was also clinically tried cutaneously (in 300 patients) for a period of time up to one year with gener ally positive results for its healing skin activities and no adverse reaction reported. Analytically 100 men and 200 women, volunteers who were submitted to plastic surgeries, being divided in two groups: in the first group adhesive bandages with benzoin, USP were applied, while in the second group bandages with Chios mastic ingredient were used, volunteers were examined postoperatively after a period of 6 days, 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. The evaluation was based on elements such as the condition of the wound, the appearance of infections, the effluence of the wound, the depigmentation and irritation of the skin, as well as the premature loss of the adhesive properties of the bandage. Mastic appeared to contribute to the effective regeneration of the skin and t o the wound healing, with no undesirable side -effects on the skin ( irritation, itching, dermatitis, skin depigmentation, etc), as the conventional ingredients mainly used in healing means . In conclusion the existing results of the clinical trials support adequately both the proposed therapeutic indications in mild dyspeptic disorders as well as for the symptomatic treatment of minor inflammations of the skin and as an aid in healing of minor wounds 5. Clinical Safety/Pharmacovigilance 5.1. Overview of toxicologic al/safety data from clinical trials in humans No data available. 5.2.

Overall co nclusions (benefit -risk assessment) There are insufficient data to support the \"well -established medicinal use\" of Pistacia lentiscus L. resin that has never been authorized in Europe as a medicinal product\" and therefore the requirement of 10 years of mar keting authorization is not fulfilled. However t he powder of Pistacia lentiscus L. resin, mainly Chios mastic has been used in folk -medicine in several countries all over the world (Iraq, Turkey, Japan, S, Korea, USA, etc) as well as in the European Union (Greece) for more than 30 years , Based on the available data from various literature sources the legal requirements for traditional use are met for the traditional medicinal use of mastic resin powdered . Results of non -clinical in vitro and in vivo studies , which show the a ntimicrobial activity of mastic against a panel of Gram -positive and Gram -negative bacteria , its particular strong activity against H, pylori (MBC 60 g/ml ) and the in vitro antioxidative and anti inflammatory activities , complemented by the results of clinical studies, provide adequate plausibility to the longstanding traditional medicinal use of mastic resin powdered in the following indications , even though the well established use cannot be considered : Indication 1) Traditional herbal m edicinal product used in mild dyspeptic disorders . In the absence of data in children and adolescents under the age of 18 years, mastic should not be used in this target population and should be limited to adults and elderly Indication 2) Traditional herba l medicinal product used for the symptomatic treatment of minor inflammations of the skin and as an aid in healing of minor wounds . The use in children under 1 2 years of age has not been established due to lack of adequate data . No fertility data are available. Safety during pregnancy and lactation has not been established. In the absence of sufficient data, the use during pregnancy and lactation is not recommended According to the results of different clinical studies, no adverse reactions have been repo rted and the herbal preparation was well tolerated. So far adverse events , serious adverse events and deaths as well as drug interactions from clinical trials or case studies have not been reported. Assessment report on Pistacia lentiscus L., resin (mastix) EMA/HMPC/46756/2015 Page 43/43 Toxicity studies are scarce, but no concerns in the prop osed condition of use arise from repeat dose study in rats (NOAEL value was 0.67% of mastic in diet ) and from the widespread long -standing medicinal use in folk medicine for more than 30 years . No constituent with known therapeutic activity or active mark er can be recognised by the HMPC . A European Union list entry is not supported due to lack of adequate data on genotoxicity.
